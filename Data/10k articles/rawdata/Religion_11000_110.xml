      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12260">The '''Adlet''' (or '''Erqigdlet''') are a race of creatures in the [[Inuit mythology]] of [[Greenland]], as well as the [[Labrador]] and [[Hudson Bay]] coasts. While the word refers to [[First Nations|inland native American tribes]], it also denotes a humanoid dog-legged tribe.&lt;ref name="BoasThe"&gt;Boas, "The Central Eskimo" 640.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower part of the body of the canine Adlet is like that of a dog and their upper part is like a man's. All Adlet run quickly, and their encounters with men usually end with man as the victor.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, "The Folklore of the Eskimo" 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Inuit lore, they are often portrayed as in conflict with humans, and are supposed to be taller than Inuit and white people.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, "The Eskimo of Baffin Land and Hudson Bay" 524.&lt;/ref&gt; In some stories they are cannibals.&lt;ref&gt;Green 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Inuit from [[Labrador]] use the term Adlet, tribes west of the [[Hudson Bay]] use the word Erqigdlit.&lt;ref name="BoasThe" /&gt; The monstrous race begotten by the Adlet was identified with inland native Americans by the Labrador and Hudson Bay tribes; Inuit from [[Greenland]] and [[Baffin Land]], which had no native American neighbors, use the term to refer to the half human, half canine creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

An etymology of the word is proposed by H. Newell Wardle: ''adlet'' might come from ''ad'', "below," and thus denote "those below." Alternatively, he argues, it might come from the stem ''agdlak'', "striped, streaked," thus "the striped ones," in reference to American Indians who lived to the west and painted their faces. "Erqigdlet" might be a derogatory term denoting the same people.&lt;ref&gt;Newell Wardle 577-78.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlat'' means "others," denoting American Indians from the Inuit perspective,&lt;ref name="RinkThe"&gt;Rink, "The Girl and the Dogs" 181.&lt;/ref&gt; though Newell Wardle considers this possibility secondary and deriving from phonetic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Newell Wardle 578 note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Franz Boas, an ethnologist who recorded many Inuit stories, gives an account of the origin of the Adlet; he had heard the story in [[Baffin Land]], specifically in [[Cumberland Sound]] from an Inuit named Pakaq. His transcription, a translation by H. Rink, and an explanation (by Boas) were published in ''[[The Journal of American Folklore]]'' in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Boas and Rink, "Eskimo Tales and Songs."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inuit of [[Greenland]], according to Rink, tell the same story as those in Baffin Land.&lt;ref&gt;Rink, "Tales and traditions of the Eskimo" 471; Boas and Rink, "Eskimo Tales and Songs" 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The story is often referred to as "The Girl and the Dogs" on the west coast of Greenland; on the east coast of Greenland it is known as "The Origin of the Qavdlunait and Irqigdlit" (that is, Europeans and Indians).&lt;ref name="RinkThe" /&gt;

A woman, Niviarsiang ("the girl"), lives with her father, Savirqong, but will not marry, and hence is also called Uinigumissuitung ("she who wouldn't take a husband"). After rejecting all her suitors, she marries a dog, Ijirqang, with white and red spots. Of their ten children, five are dogs and the others are Adlet, with dog's bodies for their lower half and man's bodies for their upper half. Since Ijirqang does not go hunting and the children are very hungry, it falls to Savirqong to provide for the noisy household. At last he puts them into a boat and carries them off to a small island, telling Ijirqang to come and get meat daily. Niviarsiang hangs a pair of boots around his neck and he swims ashore, but Savirqong, instead of giving him meat, puts stones in the boots and Ijirqang drowns. In revenge, Niviarsiang sends the young dogs over to gnaw off her father's feet and hands. He, in return kicks her overboard when she happens to be in his boat, and when she hangs on the gunwale he cuts off her fingers, which, when they fall in the ocean, turn into [[whale]]s and [[Pinniped|seals]].&lt;ref&gt;Boas, "The Central Eskimo" 637. This aspect of the Adlet myth is similar to an element in the mythology of [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]], the Inuit goddess of marine animals. See Newell Wardle, "The Sedna Cycle: A Study in Myth Evolution."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Niviarsiang is scared her father might kill the Adlet, she sends them inland, and from them a numerous people springs. The young dogs she sends across the ocean in a makeshift boat, and arriving beyond the sea they became the Europeans' ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, "The Central Eskimo" 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropological interpretation==
One interpretation of the phenomenon of the Adlet (and the theme of the "Dog Husband") sees the difference between the dog-like children and the other, the Adlet, as crucial. The dogs are sent overseas and will return as white Europeans to bring things favorable to the Inuit, whereas the Adlet, "swift runners of an aggressive disposition," become a kind of inland spirit, to be kept at bay. Thus, the "Dog Husband" myth carries the value of a [[cargo cult]]: "by offering their [sexual] favors to the dog-like Whites the Inuit daughters serve as mediators in obtaining their desirable goods."&lt;ref&gt;Sonne 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A reading of the account as a "Whaler myth," in a culture in which the Inuit were economically dependent on the mechanically superior products supplied by the European whalers, the story transforms material dependence on the white whaler into a reciprocal relationship, whereby the European comes back to repay his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Sonne 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas and Hinrich Rink offer two options for the occurrence of a legend explaining the origin of whites. Either the tradition dates back to when the Inuit first made contact with Europeans (which they consider highly unlikely), or, more likely, it is the adaptation of an already existing tradition, modified to account for the coming of the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Boas and Rink 126-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Signe Rink]] proposes a similar explanation in a hypothetical historical narrative that also takes linguistic evidence into account.&lt;ref&gt;Rink, "The Girl and the Dogs" 184-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Dog Husband" theme is paralleled in other tribal mythologies. The [[Dakelh]] (formerly known as the "Carrier tribe"), the indigenous people of the inland of [[British Columbia]], tell a number of similar stories. In one of those stories, a woman suspects she is being violated nightly, and throws a little bag of vermilion paint on the violator; the next day, she identifies him as a big dog, and later gives birth to four dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Morice 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Father Morice, writing about this and other stories he had been told by the Carrier people, posits that there might be "a sort of national tradition among the hyperborean races of America, since even the Eskimo have a story which is evidently the equivalent of it," proceeding to summarize the account as given by Franz Boas in "The Central Eskimo" (1888).&lt;ref&gt;Morice 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories (both about the Adlet and the woman who marries a dog) are told on the Siberian side of the [[Bering Strait]], among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogoras 671.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adlet stories==
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}
A number of stories containing Adlet were written down by ethnographers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

==="The Tornit and the Adlit"===
Many tales were told by the "Smith Sound Eskimo," an Inuit from [[Smith Sound]] who was in [[New York City]] in the winter of 1897-1898, and published by A.L. Kroeber for the ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]''. Two Tornits (another fabulous race from Inuit lore) find themselves among savage and cannibalistic Adlet. They sneak out at night and as they are leaving they cut the thongs on the Adlet's sledges that fasten the crossbars to the runners. The dogs start barking, but as the Adlet mount their sledges the runners fall off and the Tornit get away.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt; The same Smith Sound Eskimo also told a variant of the Adlet story related by Boas in "The Central Eskimo." In this version, the Tornit are the woman's offspring as well,&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber 168-69.&lt;/ref&gt; but Kroeber remarks that they are "ordinarily not connected with this tale."&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber 169 note 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Other stories told by the Smith Sound Eskimo, such as "The Origin of the Narwhal," also contain murderous Adlet.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber 170-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aselu===
The Inuit of [[Point Barrow]], [[Alaska]], tell of a dog named Aselu who was tied to a stick. He set himself free by biting through the stick, then went inside, where he had intercourse with a woman. She consequently gave birth to men and dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch 594-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Alevism|Alevi history}}
The '''History of the [[Shī‘ah]] [[Imāmī]] [[Alevis|Alevī]] [[Ṭarīqah]]''' or The '''History of the [[Alevism]]''' is that of a community of [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s of [[Anatolia]] and neighbouring regions.

==Origins and medieval period==
{{main|Islamization of Turkic tribes|Great Seljuk State|Sultanate of Rum|Baba Ishak|Babai Revolt|Bektashism and folk religion}}
During the great Turkish expansion from Central Asia into Iran and Anatolia in the Seljuk period (11-12th centuries), Turkmen nomad tribes accepted a Sufi and pro-Ali form of Islam that co-existed with some of their pre-Islamic customs. These tribes dominated central and eastern Anatolia for centuries with their religious warriors ''(ghazi)'' spearheading the drive against Byzantines and Slavs. Many Armenians converted to Turkmen type Islam while retaining some Christian practices, and some observers believe that heterodox Armenian Christianity exerted a significant influence on the beliefs of the extremist Shi`ite sects.&lt;ref name=angelfire&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alevi of Anatolia |author=David Zeidan |date=December 1995 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html |website=angelfire.com |accessdate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423153420/http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/ALEVI.html |archivedate=23 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ṭarīqah roots of Alevis ===
{{main|Ṭarīqah|Alevism}}
[[File:Orde van Ali Perzie 1880 Gritzner 001.jpg|thumb|sağ|250px|An [[Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;Dabashi, ''Theology of Discontent'', p.463&lt;/ref&gt; representation with the qualification of [[Ismah]] in [[Bektashiyyah]] [[sufi]] order.]]
Sufism stressed esoteric, allegoric and multiple interpretations of scripture combined to intuitive faith and a search for ecstatic experiences, and was spread by wandering dervishes believed to possess ''"bereket" (baraqat - spiritual power)'' and ''"keramet" (qaramat - miraculous powers)'' due to their special nearness to [[God in Islam|God]]. [[Dervish]] founders of ''"[[tariqat]]" (Sufi orders)'' were revered as Saints ''([[Wali]])'' and called [[dede (religious figure)|dede]], baba, [[pir (Alevism)|pir]], or [[shaykh]], and their tombs were serving as pilgrimage centres.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

Following the Seljuks, the Ottomans established their power in western Anatolia and gradually incorporated Eastern Anatolia into their empire. After Timur's victory over the Ottomans in the 15th century, the Ottoman hold on Eastern Anatolia weakened for a while, with autonomous [[Shi'ite]] Turkmen states ''([[Ak Koyunlu]], and [[Kara Koyunlu]])'' fighting each other for hegemony.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== Baktashiyyah sufi order ====
{{main|Hajji Bektash Wali|Bektashiyyah|Janissaries}}
The [[Bektashiyyah]] is a [[Shia]] [[Sufi]] order founded in the 13th century by [[Haji Bektash Veli]], a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219–23). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Hajji Bektash Wali, were called ''"Bel evlâdları" (children of the loins),'' and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the Babagan, those faithful to the path ''"Yol evlâdları" (children of the path)'' who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

Later, the [[Bektashiyyah]] became the order of the Janissary special troops, tolerated by the Ottomans as its monasteries and pilgrimage centres could be manipulated to control its Alevi followers.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== Kizilbashs ====
{{main|Sheikh Junāyd|Safaviyya|Haydar Safavi Sultan|Qizilbash|Shah Ismail I|Safavids}}
[[File:شاه اسماعیل یکم.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shah Ismail I]], the [[Sheikh]] of the [[Safaviyya|Safavi]] [[tariqa]], founder of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] of [[Iran]], and the [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Kızılbaş]] [[armies]].]]
In the early 16th century, a militant ''[[ghulat]]'' Shia order emerged, called ''[[Qizilbash|Kızılbaş]]'' or ''"[[Qizilbash|Redheads]]"'' after their distinctive headgear. [[Shah]] [[Ismail I|Isma'il]] was a hereditary leader of the [[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviyya]] Sufi order centered in [[Ardabil]] who led his (predominantly [[Azerbaijani people|Azeri]]) followers in conquering Persia. The result was the founding of the [[Safavid Dynasty]], and the [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|conversion of Iran to Shiism]]. Shah Ismail's personal religious views are reflected in his Turkish-language Sufi poetry of a ''[[ghulat]]'' nature (he claimed divinity), of which selections came to be included in Alevi scriptural compilations, the ''[[Buyruks]]''. The religion of the Iranian populace, however, fell under the domination of Shia [[Arab]] clerics who downplayed the ''ghulat'' beliefs of the Turkish warrior class.

===== The influences of Safavids on Anatolian Kizilbashs =====
After the foundation of the Safavid Persian state, the new Turkmen Shahs gradually rid themselves of their tribal and sectarian origins in their bid to build a unified Iranian state. Twelver Shiism was proclaimed state religion, with a special role for the Safavi Shahs as descendants of alleged Ali and the Imams. Their supposed ancestry is not accepted by most shia Muslims today. This state religion developed into a very different system to the Alevi faith of their Kizilbash troops. Arab Twelver theologians were recruited from Jabal Amil in Lebanon and from Bahrain, and most Iranians were forcibly converted to Twelver Shiism. The Kizilbash tribal troops were gradually disbanded in favour of a regular Iranian slave army.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

The [[Qizilbash]] (red-heads) were [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribes who adhered to the Safavid Sufi Order, whose Sheikhs claimed descent from Ali. Under Ismā`il (d. 1524) they became dominant in Eastern Anatolia and conquered Azerbaijan with its capital Tabriz, where Ismā`il named himself Shah in 1501 and went on to conquer all of Iran. His missionaries spread a message of revolt against the Sunni Ottomans in Anatolia, claiming that Ismā`il was the awaited ''"[[mahdi]]" ([[massiah]]),'' and Anatolia became the scene of protracted warfare between Ottomans and Safavids.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==Ottoman Empire period==
{{main|Ottoman Empire|Ottoman persecution of Alevis|Kızılbaş}}
The Ottomans had accepted Sunni Islam in the 13th century as a means to unifying their empire, and later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the Safavid Shia state and related heretical sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the Alevi Anatolian population. Anatolia became a battlefield between [[Safavids]] and [[Ottomans]], each determined to include it in their Empire.

=== Bayezid II period ===
{{main|Bayezid II}}
Ismail instigated a series of revolts culminating in a general Anatolian uprising against the Ottomans, whose Sultan [[Bayezid II]] mounted a major expedition 1502-1503 which pushed the Safavids and many of their Turkmen followers into Iran.
[[File:Battle of Chaldiran (1514).jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Battle of Chaldiran]].]]
=== Selim I period and the battle of Chaldiran ===
{{main|Selim I|The Battle of Chaldiran}}
The successor of Bayezid II, Sultan [[Selim I]] "The Grim", launched a vigorous campaign into eastern Anatolia, utilising a religious edict condemning Alevis as apostates to massacre many. In the summer of 1514 [[Selim I]] launched another offensive and won the major battle of Chaldiran on the eastern side of the Euphrates, convincing the Safavids to avoid open conflict with the Ottomans for the next century, and enabling him to overcome the last independent Turkmen dynasties in eastern Anatolia in 1515-1517.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

=== Suleyman I period ===
{{main|Suleyman I|Shahkulu Uprising}}
[[Suleyman the magnificent]] also ruthlessly suppressed Safavid supporters in eastern Anatolia leading three campaigns into northwest Iran. Finally in 1555 the peace of Amasya recognised Ottoman rule over Iraq and Eastern Anatolia and Iranian rule over Azerbaijan and Caucasia.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== The consequences of Qizilbash-Sunni division in Anatolia ====
The Kizilbash in Anatolia were now militarily, politically and religiously separated from their source in Iran, retreated to isolated rural areas and turned inward, developing their unique structures and doctrines. Following the severe persecution and massacres by the Ottomans which went on into the 18th century, Alevis went underground using taqiya, religious dissimulation permitted by all Shi`a groups, to conceal their faith (pretending to be Sunnis) and survive in a hostile environment.
[[File:Arolsen Klebeband 01 457 4.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Selim I]].]]
Kizilbash and Bektashis shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Alevis developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, Alevis developed a tradition of opposition to all forms of external religion.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;
[[File:Atatürk.jpg|left|260px|thumb|Current symbol picture of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] for the democratic [[Alevi]]-rights.]]
Meanwhile, the rulers of the Ottoman Empire gradually distanced themselves from their nomadic Turkic heritage, ultimately (during the thirteenth century) adopting the [[Sunni Islam]] of their Mediterranean subjects. During the long rivalry with Safavid [[Qizilbash]] tribes fought for local control of the Anatolian highlands, and were responsible for several 15th and 16th century uprisings against the Ottomans. The 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] found them on the "wrong" side of the Ottoman / Iranian border, as subjects of an Ottoman court which viewed them with suspicion. Massacres of [[Qizilbash]] occurred.

The career of [[Pir Sultan Abdal]] takes place in this context. Apparently a 16th-century folk musician from [[Sivas]], Pir Sultan Abdal was known for playing a stringed instrument called the ''[[bağlama]]'' and singing songs critical of his Ottoman governors, in defense of the rights of the Anatolian peasantry. Hanged for fomenting rebellion, he became another beloved figure in Alevi folklore and is now often invoked as a symbol of Alevism's leftist aspect. He is also preferred by Alevi Kurds, who appreciate his protest against the Turkish establishment, over [[Haji Bektash Veli]] (whom they identify with the Turks).

==== The emergence of Ishikism and Yazdanism in Anatolia ====
{{main|Ishikism|Yazdanism}}
After the Kızılbaş lost their power in Anatolia, they are assumed to have merged into the Anatolian Alevis. Kurdish Alevis are sometimes still called Kızılbaş. Even as far east as [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]], many [[Shias]] have "[[Qizilbash]]" as their family names.&lt;ref&gt;Dogan, [http://www.uni-due.de/juso/EMRE/alevismu/diplom/diplom.htm Religion und kollektive Identität im gegenwärtigen Diskurs der anatolischen Aleviten]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ottoman rule the Alevis emerged as an [[endogamy|endogamous]] ethnic group, primarily Turkish-speaking but also including Kurdish communities, concentrated in rural Anatolia. (One writer speculates that [[Tunceli province|Dersim]]'s Kurds converted to Alevism from another ''ghulat'' sect.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by hereditary ''dedes,'' and sometimes by ''Bektashi [[dervish]]es,'' they practiced ''"[[taqiyya]]" (dissimulation, secrecy)'' about their religion.

=== The emergence of a new Bektashi identity ===
[[Bektashi]] identity may have been adopted to this end, since the Bektashis were technically Sunni and tolerated by the court. After the 1826 disbanding of the [[Janissary]] Corps, the now-proscribed Bektashi order began to meet underground, like the Alevis. Adherents of the two groups blurred together to some extent. In the years before and during World War I the Çelebi family, one of two leadership groups associated with the shrine of Haji Bektash, attempted to extend its authority to the ''village Bektashi'' (Alevi) ''dede''s, whose own hierarchy was in disarray. Some Alevi groups accepted this Bektashi authority, while others did not.&lt;ref&gt;See Ali Yaman's article "[http://www.alevibektasi.org/dedes.htm Kizilbash Alevi Dedes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022200049/http://www.alevibektasi.org/dedes.htm |date=2013-10-22 }}."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkish Republic period - Modern history ==
{{main|Republic of Turkey|History of the Republic of Turkey}}
Rural Alevis were marginalised and discriminated against in the Ottoman Empire, although the official Bektashiya order enjoyed a privileged role through its close association with the Janissary professional military corps. In 1826 Sultan Mahmud II massacred the Janissaries and suppressed the Bektashi order. Yet Bektashi secret circles remained extremely active, Bektashis becoming progressive, anticlerical, and liberal, viewed suspiciously by the authorities and cooperating with others hostile to the establishment such as Freemasons and Young Turks. Until 1925 it was estimated that 10 to 20 percent of Turkey's adult male population were still members of the Bektashiya.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

=== Alevism and Kemalism ===
{{main|Alevism|Kemalism}}
Kemalism turned Alevis into legally equal citizens, and its reforms had a radical impact on them as roads were built through their formerly isolated areas, compulsory schooling was introduced, and communications improved, drawing them out of their marginalisation into active engagement in social and political life and into deeper contact with the outside world and the state centre. The new Turkish Republic fulfilled many Alevi expectations, enabling them to identify with and support its nation-building measures - the Alevis still see themselves as the protectors of Kemalism and democracy in Turkey.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== Alevi perception of Atatürk ====
{{main|Mahdi|Messiah|Atatürk}}
In his drive for secularization Atatürk later (1925) destroyed most religious frameworks, Sunni as well as Alevi, closing down the orders and confiscating their monasteries. Although driven underground, the orders continued to enjoy popularity in secret.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

Alevis are proud of their cooperation with Ataturk, and the fact that the Çelebi and Dedebaba of the Hacıbektaş monastery had supported him. Alevis were his faithful allies in the war of independence, in the setting up of the modern Turkish secular nationalist state, and in the destruction of Ottomanism. The early Kemalist republic is regarded as the ideal state in which the Alevis were fairly represented proportionately to their percentage of the total population in the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

[[Alevis]] saw [[Ataturk]] as [[Mahdi]]&lt;ref name="MAHDI in Iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= | authorlink= | title=THE CONCEPT OF MAHDI IN TWELVER SHIʿISM | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica | accessdate=2014-07-07 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/islam-in-iran-vii-the-concept-of-mahdi-in-twelver-shiism}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''([[Messiah]]),'' a Saviour, a [[divine]] [[emanation]]{{fact|date=September 2015}} following [[Ali]] and [[Hajji Bektash Wali]], sent to save them from the Sunni Ottoman yoke, who turned Alevi ideals into state practice, and his portrait is hung up beside Ali's in many Alevi homes. Ataturk on his part saw the Alevis as allies in his struggle against the traditional Ottoman elite and for secularism and Turkish nationalism. He selectively included Alevi cultural markers in his construct of the new Turkish national collective identity. However, to ensure national unity, the unique Alevi identity was subordinated to the general Anatolian-Turkish national identity.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

However, the stigma of Alevism remained even as the younger generation tried to adapt itself to the secular Turkish identity. Alevis found that they still faced discrimination in employment and education, and again turned to taqiya for stigma management, adapting to Sunni ways in order to get a share of the scarce resources. Many concealed that they were Alevi, visited the mosques, and kept Ramadan. Education and migration were seen as the gateway to social upward mobility, and from 1960s on a new Alevi middle class appeared.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== The influences of secularization process on Alevism ====
[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Mevlevi Order March 1923.png|thumb|260px|[[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]] in 1923, with members of the [[Mevlevi Order]], before its institutional expression became illegal and their [[dervish]] lodge was changed into the [[Mevlana Museum]].]]
Secularization diminished traditional threats to Alevi existence transforming Turkish society into a less Alevi-hostile community. The downplay of religion in public life and the Westernization of the ruling elite tended to turn Alevism into just one of several cultural and folklorist themes in Turkish nationalism. While still trying to maintain their ethnic identity, Alevis became increasingly secularized and neglected their traditional institutions. However, the wall of Sunni prejudice to the historically marginalized Alevi was not easily overcome, and Alevis remained to some extent the object of suspicion, in their turn remaining somewhat sceptical of the central state and its institutions.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

As the existential danger receded and the community opened up to the outside world, solidarity ties loosened. ritual and ceremony lost some of their meaning and the spiritual leadership gradually lost its authority. This change in Alevi internal structures was accelerated by the massive migration into the cities, where Alevis underwent a process of secularization and modernization which broke traditional hereditary ties to the religious hierarchy. Religion lost its relevancy and even intermarriage was practiced by some. A new generation grew up in the 1960s that had not passed through initiation and was not familiar with the Alevi "Way" (yol).&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

==== The influence of sufi orders on Alevis ====
{{sufism}}
Turkish state politics after the military takeover encouraged Sunni-orthodox and nationalist unity ideology. [[Sunni]] [[Sufi]] orders such as the [[Naqshbandi]], [[Süleymancı|Suleimanci]], and [[Hizmet movement|Nurcu ''(Hizmet/Servis movement)'']] became more visible, and Sunni propaganda disseminated by the government stated that Alevis were actually Sunnis with some divergent customs, negating the uniqueness of Alevism and trying to integrate it in state Sunnism. Whilst accepting that Alevism has important Turkish elements, the authorities tried to Sunnify Alevism, initiating a state policy of assimilation and Sunnification. Infrastructure improvements in Alevi villages were made conditional on compliance with mosque construction and the participation of all Alevi children in Sunni religious instruction.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

When Sunni fundamentalism appeared in the 1970s, many Alevis reacted by reinterpreting Alevism in socialist and Marxist idiom that seemed to have an affinity to Alevi ideals. There was a generation gap in Alevism: the older generation remained Kemalist and hoped for the official reopening of the Bektashi order whilst the young generation became very politicized as they came in contact with revolutionary thought in universities, high schools, and trade unions. They claimed that the old forms were outdated and that Alevis must work for a radical restructuring of society. They saw all "reactionary" elements which tried to assimilate them into mainstream Sunni life as enemies, and joined extreme leftist parties, reinterpreting historical opposition to Sunnism in terms of class struggle and continuing the traditional Alevi role of opposition to the state. Some leftist Alevi activists also turned against their own religious hierarchy, branding them feudal exploiters of the masses and driving [[dede (religious figure)|dedes]] out of their villages.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

===Alevi unrest and its consequences in Turkey===
The violence of the 70s resulted in the military takeover of 1980 whose purges hurt Alevis harder than others because of their leftist commitment, and the ''[[Hacıbektaş]] celebrations'' were forbidden for several years. As a reaction, community identification intensified and religious and cultural boundary markers against the Sunni majority regained importance.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

The return of many Turks to their religious roots and the politicization of their communal identities were a crisis response to modernity and the accelerated rate of change it forced on Turkish society. Secularist ideologies such as [[Kemalism]] and [[socialism]] seemed to have failed and not delivered the hoped for goods. Alevis were not willing any more to sacrifice their communal identity on the altar of class-struggle and began consciously to identify themselves as a political group on the basis of a shared religious identity.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

Much of the violence during the late 70s although presented by state and media as left versus right was in fact Sunni versus Alevi. Ultra-nationalists allied themselves to Sunni fundamentalists in attacking Alevis. Even some communists of Sunni background sided with conservative Sunnis against their political allies of Alevi background. In 1978 in the city of [[Kahramanmaraş]] in southern Turkey local Sunnis went on a rampage, slaughtering scores of leftist Alevis from the nearby villages in the worst massacre in living memory.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

====Incidents before 1980 Turkish coup d'état====
The first massacre that targeted Alevi Kurds was the Dersim Massacre in 1938. Later, during the 1960s-70s, the politicization of Alevi communities within the Turkish leftist movement angered right-wingers, ultra-nationalists and Islamists, who cooperated in carrying out pogroms of Alevis in the late 1970s. Malatya in 1978, Maraş in 1979, and Çorum in 1980 witnessed the murder of hundreds of Alevis, the torching of hundreds of homes, and lootings committed by ultranationalists and reactionaries. These are now believed to have been organized by the state. Such massacres continued in the following decades and included the Sivas Massacre (1993) and the Gazi incidents in Istanbul (1995).&lt;ref name=memorializeturkey&gt;{{cite web|title=Pir Sultan Abdal Monument and Festival|url=http://www.memorializeturkey.com/en/memorial/pir-sultan-abdal-monument-and-festival/|website=memorializeturkey.com|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turkishpolicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rana Birden Çorbacıoğlu|first1=Zeynep Alemdar|title=ALEVIS AND THE TURKISH STATE|url=http://www.turkishpolicy.com/dosyalar/files/zeynep_alemdar-rana_birden_corbacioglu-10_4.pdf|website=turkishpolicy.com|accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key component of the [[turkification]] process was the policy of massive population resettlement, a result of the 1934 law on resettlement, a policy targeting the region of Dersim as one of its first test cases with disastrous consequences for the local population.&lt;ref&gt;George J Andreopoulos, ''Genocide'', page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incidents after 1980 Turkish coup d'état====
The democratic opening in Turkey in 1988/1989 broke taboos and opened up public discussions in the press. Publications were allowed that would never have been permitted before and liberals pushed for ethnographic studies of the Turkish society mosaic. Since 1989 the liberal press has accepted Alevism as a separate religious community. Along with other marginalized groups Alevis increased their political activism and fought for equality and official recognition of Alevism as an Islamic community with its special characteristics, for legalization of its religious ritual and practice, for integration of Alevi doctrine in the state education system, and for allotment of a fair share in the media.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

[[1980 Turkish coup d'état|The 1980 military takeover]] brought all Turkish secularist movements under pressure due to the growing Islamization of public and private life. Alevis allied themselves to secular-liberal Sunni groups that feared for the secular Kemalist state - but Alevis this time were not absorbed by these groups but cooperated with them as a separately identifiable group.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

As Sunni Islamism gained strength in the late 1980s and religious intolerance spread, an Alevi backlash occurred in the form of a cultural revival spearheaded by the new educated Alevi elite who organised foundations and trusts, rebuild Saint tombs, and restored rituals. There was an effort to reclaim traditions and re-mark boundaries, a call to reconstruct Alevi culture, community, and identity. A process was initiated of a reinterpretation of Alevi history and religion, culminating in an "invention of traditions" accompanied by a "coming out" of Alevis from century long dissimulation practices. For the first time in modern history Alevis dared to publicly accept their stigmatized identity, articulate their collective interests towards the state, and demand equality with the Sunni majority.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

The government was unhappy about the outcome of liberalisation. It had hoped to woo Alevis into a pure Turkish nationalist camp and separate them from other oppressed minorities, especially the exploding Kurdish nationalism. There was a growing state interest in dividing Alevis from Kurds and manipulating them to further the regime's aims. The Alevis for their part, encouraged by the weakening of the Soviet block and revived claims for minority recognition around the world, pressed for increased recognition in Turkish society. Alevi publications multiplied, and Alevis supported the claims of other minorities such as the Laz and the Kurds.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

The pervasive influence of religion in public life in the 1990s has grave potential for a worsening of Sunni-Alevi tensions. In 1990 the Ministry of Cults took over the organisation of the Hacibektas festivities under the excuse of making it an international attraction. Alevis were unhappy about its interference in the programme especially in 1993 and 1994 as government officials stressed the Turkish elements in Alevism but ignored the community's specificity and did not give it any operating space as a minority community.&lt;ref name=angelfire/&gt;

With the political thaw of the 1990s, Alevis in Turkey, influenced by the activities of their brethren in Europe, especially Germany, began to actively publish Alevi books, and open Alevi cultural centers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Bruinessen, "[http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/clashes_between_or_within.htm Clashes between or within civilizations?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13993">'''Apostolic poverty''' is a Christian [[doctrine]] professed in the thirteenth century by the newly formed religious [[religious order|orders]], known as the [[mendicant order]]s, in direct response to calls for reform in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In this, these orders attempted to live their lives without ownership of lands or accumulation of money, following the precepts given to the [[seventy disciples]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (10:1-24), and succeeding to varying degrees. The ascetic [[Pope Paschal II]]'s solution of the [[Investiture Controversy]] in his radical Concordat of 1111 with the Emperor, repudiated by the cardinals, was that the ecclesiastics of Germany should surrender to the imperial crown their [[fief]]s and secular offices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], 1992. ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', p 262f.&lt;/ref&gt; Paschal proved to be the last of the Gregorianist popes.

The provocative&lt;ref&gt;"Provocative": Cantor 1992:263.&lt;/ref&gt; doctrine was a challenge to the wealth of the church and the concerns about ensuing corruption it brought: rejected by the hierarchy of the Church, it found sympathetic audiences among the disaffected poor of the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Cantor 1992:263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The doctrine of apostolic poverty was condemned as [[heresy]] in 1323, but it continued to be a source of debate.&lt;ref&gt;The cultural context of [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' set in 1327 is the [[Franciscan#Renewed controversy on the question of poverty|renewed controversy on the question]] and the persecution of radical Franciscans.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Humiliati===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
One group which was a major proponent of apostolic poverty was the [[Humiliati]], the "Humble Ones".  Founded by a wool merchant, they established communities scattered around Italy and France, organized on the principle of a simple way of life for the laity, who shared their goods while remaining in family units. They remained primarily a [[Laity|lay]] movement, and came to reject the authority of the [[hierarchy]] and the [[clergy]]. For this and other reasons, they were later to be declared [[Heresy|heretical]] by the Catholic Church.

It is often assumed{{By whom|date=September 2011}} that Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] was inspired to form the [[Franciscan]]s by their movement, in an effort to emulate the poverty of [[Jesus Christ]] and to bring his message through a simple life and example, while strictly adhering to the beliefs of the Catholic Church. [[Saint Dominic]] founded a similar order, the [[Order of Preachers]], better known as the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s.

===Waldenses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
[[Peter Waldo]], founder of the Christian sect which came to known as the [[Waldenses]], also applied this belief. Among other points of dissent with the practices of the Roman Catholic Church at the time, the Waldenses believed in reading the [[Bible]] in one's native language—as opposed to having it only in Latin—and were also greatly persecuted by the Church.

===Franciscans===
{{also|Absolute Poverty of Christ}}
The Franciscans were authorized by [[Pope Gregory IX]] to have non-members who would look after their material needs, while the friars themselves would own nothing and would only make use according to the vow of poverty of what was given to them. From the beginning, two tendencies developed. Some friars, referred to as the Zelanti, living more isolated and simpler lives, strictly observed the poverty enjoined by the testament of Saint Francis. Others lived in convents in the towns, tending the attached churches with the necessary liturgical furnishings and devoting themselves also to study and preaching, which required the use of books. They observed the Franciscan Rule in accordance with interpretations officially made by the Popes. Already Gregory IX had indicated that the testament of St Francis did not oblige the friars in conscience. [[Pope Innocent IV]] gave the Franciscans permission to appoint "procurators" to buy, sell and administer goods given to them. [[Bonaventure]], who become minister general in 1257, tried to reconcile the two tendencies and is sometimes called the second founder of the Order, to which he gave its first General Constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht01.html History of the Franciscan Movement (1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with the secular clergy and with lay teachers in the universities led to accusations of hypocrisy with regard to the profession of poverty from outsiders, as well as from those members of the order formerly known as the Zelanti, but who then began to be referred to as the Spirituals, because of their association with the Age of the Spirit that the apocalyptic writer [[Joachim of Fiore]] had foretold would begin in 1260.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht03.html History of the Franciscan Movement (3)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the 14th century, the conflict between the Spirituals and the [[Conventual Franciscans]] came to a head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Brian+Tierney+%22long-simmering%22&amp;btnG=#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Brian+Tierney+%22boiled+up%22&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Brian+Tierney+%22boiled+up%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=14602l15059l2l16116l3l3l0l0l0l1l253l600l0.2.1l3l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&amp;fp=7ba1951dff990cce&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=615Tierney, p. 172]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, ''The Image of St Francis'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The Spirituals, who in the 13th century were led by the Joachimist [[Peter Olivi]], adopted more extreme positions that discredited the notion of apostolic poverty in some eyes and led to condemnation by [[Pope John XXII]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip D. Krey]] et al., ''[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=krey+%22joachimist+peter%22&amp;btnG= Nicholas of Lyra: The Senses of Scripture]'' (Brill 2000 {{ISBN|978-90-04-11295-7}}), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 14 August 1279 bull ''Exiit qui seminat'', [[Pope Nicholas III]] had confirmed the arrangement already established by Pope Gregory IX, by which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the [[Holy See]], which granted the friars the mere use of it. The bull declared that renunciation of ownership of all things "both individually but also in common, for God's sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the Church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/wexiit.html English translation 1;] cf.[http://www.franciscan-archive.org/bullarium/exiit-e.html English translation 2]  and another translation in [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Rosalind+B+Brooke+%22renunciation+of+ownership%22&amp;btnG= Rosalind B.

On 26 March 1322, John removed the ban on discussion of Nicholas III's bull&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/mhpir/politics_and_international_relations/staff/john_kilcullen/quia_nonnunquam/ Bull ''Quia nonnunquam''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606232917/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/mhpir/politics_and_international_relations/staff/john_kilcullen/quia_nonnunquam/ |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would condemn the Church's right to have possessions.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The Franciscan chapter held in [[Perugia]] in May 1322 declared on the contrary: "To say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles, in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right of ownership and ''dominium'' or by personal right, we corporately and unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic."&lt;ref name=History/&gt; By the bull ''Ad conditorem canonum'' of 8 December of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/wadc.html English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; John XXII, declaring that "it was ridiculous to pretend that every egg and piece of bread given to and eaten by the Friars Minor belonged to the pope",&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; forced them to accept ownership by ending the arrangement according to which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the [[Holy See]], which granted the friars the mere use of it. He thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; a structure that "absolved the Franciscans from the moral burden of legal ownership, and enabled them to practise apostolic poverty without the inconvenience of actual poverty".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2022/6142/06.10.24.html;jsessionid=EA6A9CD516391324ABDB130F17396421?sequence=1 Frans van Liere in ''The Medieval Review'' 06.10.24]&lt;/ref&gt; And on 12 November 1323 he issued the short bull ''Cum inter nonnullos'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/wcumint.html English translation 1;][http://www.franciscan-archive.org/bullarium/qinn-e.html English translation 2]&lt;/ref&gt; which declared "erroneous and heretical" the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever.&lt;ref name=Schatz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kleinhenz&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Kleinhenz+%22conflicting+acts%22&amp;btnG= Christopher Kleinhenz, ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia''] (Routledge 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-415-93930-0}}), vol. 1, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Brian+Tierney+%22judged+heretical%22&amp;btnG= Tierney, p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;

Influential members of the order protested, including the minister general [[Michael of Cesena]], the English provincial [[William of Ockham]], and [[Bonagratia of Bergamo]]. In 1324, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] sided with the Spirituals and accused the Pope of heresy. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III's bull ''Exiit qui seminat'' was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull ''Quia quorundam'' of 10 November 1324,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/wqq.html English translation 1] and  [http://www.franciscan-archive.org/bullarium/qquor-e.html English translation 2]&lt;/ref&gt; in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: "Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common."

In 1328 Michael of Cesena was summoned to Avignon to explain the Order's intransigence in refusing the Pope's orders and its complicity with Louis of Bavaria. Michael was imprisoned in Avignon, together with Francesco d'Ascoli, Bonagratia and William of Ockham. In January of that year Louis of Bavaria entered Rome and had himself crowned emperor. Three months later, he declared John XXII deposed and installed the Spiritual Franciscan [[Antipope Nicholas V|Pietro Rainalducci]] as Pope. The Franciscan chapter that opened in [[Bologna]] on 28 May reelected Michael of Cesena, who two days before had escaped with his companions from Avignon. But in August Louis the Bavarian and his pope had to flee Rome before an attack by [[Robert, King of Naples]]. Only a small part of the Franciscan Order joined the opponents of John XXII, and at a general chapter held in [[Paris]] in 1329 the majority of all the houses declared their submission to the Pope. With the bull "Quia vir reprobus" of 16 November 1329,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.mq.edu.au/Ockham/wqvr.html English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; John XXII replied to Michael of Cesena's attacks on ''Ad conditorem canonum'', ''Cum inter'' and ''Quia quorundam''. In 1330 Antipope Nicholas V submitted, followed later by the ex-general Michael, and finally, just before his death, by Ockham.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The '''Bhojshala''' ([[IAST]]: Bhojaśālā, sometimes Bhoj Shala, meaning 'Hall of Bhoja') is located in [[Dhar]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It is the site of the early 11th century centre for [[Sanskrit]] studies and temple of [[Sarasvatī]] – the Hindu goddess of learning, music and arts – located in the hall's precincts. Bhojshala is attributed to celebrated King [[Bhoja]] of the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramāra dynasty]] of [[central India]], a great patron of education and arts, and to whom major Hindu Sanskrit works on poetics, [[yoga]] and architecture are attributed.&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt; The term ''Bhojashala'' became linked to a later era mosque and tombs that exist immediately next to it, an association that started in early 20th century, though the Islamic structures were built between the 14th and 15th century.&lt;ref name=willis129&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=129–153 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhojshala is also an archaeological site, one which is disputed between Hindus and Muslims. The site excavation since the 19th century has yielded information on medieval era Indian religions particularly of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], as well as a goddess statue that was housed in the [[British Museum]] but whose current location is a mystery.&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt; The site also houses the Kamal-Maula mosque with four Sufi tombs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmad Nabi Khan|title=Islamic Architecture in South Asia: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2tQAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-579065-8|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the [[hypostyle]] mosque was built primarily from demolished temple pillars and parts around 1400 CE, while the tomb of Kamal al-Din Malawi (c. 1238-1330) is older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=134–135 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}, Quote: "Next to the tomb is a spacious hypostyle mosque built primarily of reused temple parts (Fig. 3)."&lt;/ref&gt; The Muslims use the mosque for Friday prayers and [[Islam]]ic festivals, while the Hindus pray on Tuesday.

==History: King Bhoja==
[[File:Raja Bhoj Statue on Upper Lake, Bhopal..JPG|thumb|Raja Bhoj Statue on Upper Lake, Bhopal.]]
King [[Bhoja]], who ruled between ''circa'' 1000 and 1055 in central India, is considered in the Hindu tradition as one of the exceptional kings.&lt;ref name=willis130&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=129–131 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a celebrated patron of arts, and out of reverence for him, Hindu scholars that followed traditionally attributed a large number of Sanskrit works on philosophy, astronomy, grammar medicine, yoga, architecture and other subjects to him. Of these, a well studied and influential text is in the field of poetics called ''Śṛṅgaraprakāśa''.&lt;ref name=willis130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Venkatarama Raghavan, ''Bhoja’s Śṛṅgaraprakāśa'', 3rd rev. ed. (Madras, 1940).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with his literary and art support, Bhoja began constructing a [[Shiva]] temple at [[Bhojpur, Madhya Pradesh|Bhojpur]]. If it had been completed to the extent he planned, the temple would have been double the size of the Hindu temples at the [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments]]. The temple was partially completed, and the epigraphical evidence confirms that Bhoja founded and built Hindu temples.&lt;ref name=willis130/&gt;

Bhoja's successor was king [[Arjunavarman]] (''circa'' 1210-15). He and many others, in Hindu and Jain traditions, held Bhoja in such high regard that they stated or were revered as an reincarnation (rebirth) of Bhoja or Bhoja-like ruler.&lt;ref name=willis130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Hultzsch, ‘Dhar Prasasti of Arjunavarman: Parijatamanjari-Natika by Mandana’, ''Epigraphica Indica'' 8 (1905-06): 96-122.&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries later, Bhoja remained a revered figure as evidenced by Merutuṅga's ''Prabandhacintāmaṇi'' completed in the fourteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Tawney, ''The Prabandhacintāmaṇi or Wishing-stone of Narratives'' (Calcutta, 1901)&lt;/ref&gt; and Ballāla’s ''Bhojaprabandha'' composed at [[Varanasi]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Herbert Gray|Louis H. Gray]], ''The Narrative of Bhoja (Bhojaprabandha)'', American Oriental Series, vol. 34 (New Haven, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition continued, and in the 20th century, Hindu scholars described Bhoja as an example of the glorious past of their historic culture and a part of Hindu identity.&lt;ref name=willis130/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. K. Munshi, ed. ''Śṛṅgāramañjarīkathā'', Siṅghī Jaina granthamālā, no. 30 (Bombay, 1959): 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capital of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, [[Bhopal]], is named after him, i.e. ''Bhoj-pal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Swati Mitra|title=Pachmarhi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1B4rvdpvS7YC&amp;pg=PA71|year=2009|publisher=Goodearth Publications|isbn=978-81-87780-95-3|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dhār and Inscriptions in the Bhojaśālā==
[[File:Dhar inscription at KM.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|One of the serpentine inscriptions found by K. K. Lele at Kamāl Maula]]
The archaeological sites at Dhār attracted the early attention of colonial Indologists and historians. John Malcolm mentioned it in 1822, along with building projects such as the dams planned and completed by King Bhoja.&lt;ref name=willis136/&gt; Malcolm also mentioned that he removed an inscribed panel from the site; this appears to be the [[Rāüla vela of Roḍa]], a unique poetic work in the earliest forms of Hindi. This inscription was kept first in [[The Asiatic Society of Mumbai]] and was later transferred to the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;Harivallabh Chunilal Bhayani, Rāula-vela of Roḍa: a rare poem of c. twelfth century in early Indo-Aryan (Ahmedabad: Parshva Prakashan, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, in 1888, William Kincaid published his ''Indian Antiquary'' which makes no mention of the term Bhojshala, but does mention a ''Akl ka kua'' or "Well of Wisdom" in front of the tomb of Kamal al-Din. According to Michael Willis, Kincaid was not a sympathetic ethnographer, but the absence of the term Bhojshala in his text may be because there was "no living tradition about Bhojshala in the middle decades of the nineteenth century" among those who he interacted with in Dhar.&lt;ref name=willis136&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=136–138 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholarly studies on the inscriptions of Bhojshala began in the 19th century, such as with the efforts of Bhau Daji in 1871.&lt;ref name=willis136/&gt; In 1903, K. K. Lele, Superintendent of Education in the Princely State of Dhār, reported a number of Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions in the walls and floor of the pillared hall at Kamāl Maula mosque.&lt;ref name=willis141&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=141–143 with footnotes | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these records is a series of verses in [[Prakrit]] praising the [[Kurma|Kūrma]] or Tortoise incarnation of the god [[Vishnu|Viṣṇu]]. The ''Kūrmaśataka'' is attributed to king [[Bhoja]] but the palaeography of the record suggests that this copy was engraved in the twelfth or thirteenth century. The text was published by Richard Pischel in 1905-06, with a new version and translation appearing in 2003 by V. M. Kularni.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pischel, ''Epigraphia Indica'' 8 (1905-06); V. M. Kulkarni, ''Kūrmaśatakadvayam: two Prakrit poems on tortoise who supports the earth'' (Ahmedabad: L.D. Institute of Indology, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

A second inscription is part of a drama called ''Vijayaśrīnāṭikā'' composed by Madana. The preceptor of king [[Arjunavarman]], Madana bore the title 'Bālasarasvatī'.&lt;ref&gt;S. K. Dikshit, ed., ''Pārijātamañjarī alias Vijayaśrī by Rāja-Guru Madana alias Bāla-Sarasvatī'' (Bhopal, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription reports that the play was performed before Arjunavarman in the temple of [[Sarasvatī]]. This suggests that the inscription could have come from the site of a Sarasvatī temple.&lt;ref&gt;Zafar Hasan, ''EIM'' (1909-10): 13-14, pl. II, no. 2; ''Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy'' (1971-72): 81, no. D. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The variety and size of pillars, and the inscribed tablets recovered by Lele from the site, among them two serpentine inscriptions giving grammatical rules of the [[Sanskrit]] language, show that materials were brought from a wide area and a number of different structures.

The finds—and the serpentine grammatical inscriptions in the building—prompted Lele to describe the building as the Bhojśālā or Hall of Bhoja because king Bhoja was the author of a number of works on poetics and grammar, among them the ''Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa'' or 'Necklace of Sarasvatī'.&lt;ref&gt;R. Birwé, ‘Nārāyaṇa Daṇḍanātha's Commentary on Rules III.2, 106-121 of Bhoja's Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa’, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 84 (1964): 150-62; the poetic text with this title, rather than the grammatical one, has been published as ''Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇam of King Bhoja'', 3 vols., ed. and trans., Sundari Siddhartha (Delhi, 2009) {{ISBN|978-81-208-3284-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Bhojaśālā was taken up by C. E. Luard and published in his ''Gazetteer'' of 1908 although Luard noted that it was a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Luard, ''Western States (Mālwā). Gazetteer'', 2 parts. The Central India State Gazetteer Series, vol. 5 (Bombay, 1908): part A, pp. 494-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sarasvatī==
[[File:Goddess Ambika from Dhar.JPG|thumb|Goddess Ambika from Dhar, whose inscription mentions Vagdevi (Sarasvati).&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;]]
After Lele and Luard had identified the Bhojaśālā with the Kamāl Maula masjid, O. C. Gangoly and K. N. Dikshit published [[Ambika Statue from Dhar|an inscribed sculpture]] in the British Museum, announcing that it was Raja Bhoja's Sarasvatī from Dhār.&lt;ref&gt;O. C. Gangoly and K. N. Dikshit, ‘An Image of Saraswati in the British Museum’, ''Rūpam'' 17 (January, 1924): 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was broadly accepted and had a significant impact. The statue in the British Museum was identified as Bhoja's Sarasvatī in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sivaramamurti, ''Indian Sculpture'' (New Delhi, 1961): 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;

The inscription on the sculpture mentions king Bhoja and Vāgdevī, another name for Sarasvatī.&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt; However, later study of the inscription by Indian scholars of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages such as [[Harivallabh Bhayani]],&lt;ref&gt;Kirit Mankodi, ‘A Paramāra Sculpture in the British Museum: Vāgdevī or Yakshī Ambikā?’, ''Sambodhi'' 9 (1980-81): 96-103.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that inscription records the making of a sculpture of [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambikā]] of Jainism after the making of three Jinas and Vāgdevī. In other words, according to Michael Willis, "although Vāgdevī is indeed mentioned, the inscription's main purpose is to record the making of an image of Ambikā, i.e. the sculpture on which the record is incised".&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. N. P. Tiwari, ''Ambikā in Jaina Art and Literature'' (New Delhi, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Michael Willis provides the translation of the inscription as follows:&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The text and further comments published in Michael Willis, ‘New Discoveries from Old Finds: A Jain Sculpture in the British Museum’, ''[http://www.soas.ac.uk/jainastudies/newsletter/ CoJS Newsletter]'' (SOAS) 6 (2011): 34-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription on the statue previously with the British Museum indicates that the Vāgdevī at Dhār was dedicated to the Jain form of Saraswati deity. While Ambika statue was discovered at the Bhojshala site, the Vagdevi statue mentioned in the inscriptions no longer exists or is yet to be located. Other evidence suggests that the Hindu King Bhoja's eulogistic tablets in the Sarasvatī temple engraved with a poem are dedicated to a Jain Tirthankara.&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawney, ''Prabandhacintāmaṇi'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The building is a [[Protected Monument]] of national importance under the laws of India and is under the juristiction of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]]. Both Hindus and Muslims claim the site, and use it for their prayers. According to Archaeological Survey of India guidelines, Muslims can pray on Friday and Islamic festivals, Hindus can pray on Tuesday and on the festival for goddess Sarasvatī, namely [[Vasant Panchami]]. The site is open to visitors on other days. &lt;ref name=willis129/&gt;&lt;ref name=indiatoday2016/&gt;

The disputes about the site were prompted by the inscriptions and the information they provide about historic Indian religions, particularly Hinduism and Jainism. Data about Jainism comes from texts and a statue of the goddess Ambikā that is now housed in [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=willis129/&gt; The area beside the Bhojshala has four Sufi Islam tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahmad Nabi Khan|title=Islamic Architecture in South Asia: Pakistan, India, Bangladesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2tQAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-579065-8|pages=175–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important is the tomb of Kamāl al-Dīn (''circa'' 1238-1330), famous [[Chishti]] saint, who tomb was rebuilt under the [[Malwa Sultanate]]. Architecturally, the Bhojshala is earlier in date, and appears to be a hypostyle hall built of temple parts in the 1300s in a manner similar to the Quwwat-ul-Islam in the [[Qutb Minar complex]], Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Willis | first=Michael | title=Dhār, Bhoja and Sarasvatī: from Indology to Political Mythology and Back | journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=22 | issue=01 | year=2012 | pages=134–135 | doi=10.1017/s1356186312000041 }}, Quote: "Next to the tomb is a spacious hypostyle mosque built primarily of reused temple parts (Fig. 3)."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conflicts arise when the Vasant Panchami falls on Friday. The Archaeological Survey of India attempts to assign hours to both Hindus and Muslims on such days. However, this been a source of communal conflict and occasional distrubance when the religious group scheduled for the earlier time slot refuse to vacate the premises in time for the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rajendra Vora|author2=Anne Feldhaus|title=Region, Culture, and Politics in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kg2KAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Manohar|isbn=978-81-7304-664-3|pages=327–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/indore-celebrates-basant-panchmi/articleshow/56924412.cms Indore celebrates Basant Panchmi], The Times of India, February 2 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indiatoday2016&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/dhar-bhojshala-kamal-maula-mosque-row-madhya-pradesh-vishwa-hindu-parishad/1/594073.html Bhojshala-Kamal Maula mosque row: What is the dispute over the temple-cum-mosque all about?], India Today, Shreya Biswas (February 12, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boaz Cohen''' (1899–1968) was a leading American scholar of [[Talmud]], a legal decisor ([[posek]]), and a professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].

==Biography==
Cohen was born and educated in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].  He was ordained as a [[rabbi]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTS) in 1924.  Following his ordination, he was appointed Assistant Librarian of JTS.  In 1925, he was appointed an instructor of [[Talmud]], and went on to serve on the JTS faculty for four decades.  In 1927, he received his Ph.D. from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxix&lt;/ref&gt;  During his career he published extensively on the Talmud and [[Jewish law]], while also authoring many comparative studies between Jewish law and other legal systems.  Many of those studies were published in a collection titled ''Jewish and Roman Law'' (New York, 1966).

Cohen also served as Chair of the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards|Committee on Jewish Law]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], and he issued thousands of legal rulings.&lt;ref&gt;"Boaz Cohen (1899-1968)," by Elias J. Bickerman and Edward M. Gershfield, ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research,'' Vol. 37, (1969), pp. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been much speculation as to the original [[Rigvedic]] '''[[Soma (drink)|Soma]]''' plant (and of the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]] ''*Sauma'', which besides ''Soma'' is reflected in the Iranian '''[[Haoma]]''').

Since the late 18th century, when [[Anquetil-Duperron]] and others made portions of the Avesta available to western scholarship, several scholars have sought a representative botanical equivalent of the ''haoma'' as described in the texts and as used in living [[Zoroastrian]] practice. Most of the proposals concentrated on either linguistic evidence or comparative pharmacology or reflected ritual use. Rarely were all three considered together, which usually resulted in such proposals being quickly rejected.

==Candidates for the identity of soma==
The Rigveda calls the plant Soma the "Creator of the Gods"&lt;ref name="RV 9.42"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PL9.HTM|title=Rig Veda (Griffith tr.): text - IntraText CT|website=www.intratext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gives Soma precedence above Indra and the other Gods calling Soma "a God for Gods".&lt;ref name="RV 9.42"/&gt;

Soma was{{when|date=April 2015}} generally assumed{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} to be [[entheogen]]ic, based on 
[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PIK.HTM RV 8.48] Note, there are numerous similar references in the Vedas, e.g. [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PK7.HTM RV9.4], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PK8.HTM RV9.5], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PKB.HTM RV9.8], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PKD.HTM RV9.10], [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0039/_PL9.HTM RV9.42]. Some descriptions of Soma are associated with ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]'' (heat, excitement, "energy"). Soma is associated with the warrior-god [[Indra]], and appears to have been drunk before battle. For these reasons, there are stimulant (amphetamine-like) plants as well as entheogenic plants among the candidates that have been suggested. Soma is also often associated with Light and Indra is the "Lord of Light" as shown in [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08082.htm RV 8.82.25].{{Primary source inline|date=April 2015}}

{{quote|''For thee, O Lord of Light, are shed these Soma-drops, and grass is strewn. Bring Indra to his worshippers. May Indra give thee skill, and lights of heaven, wealth to his votary. And priests who praise him: laud ye him.''}}

Several texts like the [[Atharva Veda]] extol the medicinal properties of Soma and he is regarded as the king of medicinal herbs (and also of the [[Brahmana]] class).

===Somalata===
When the ritual of [[Somayajna]] is held today in South India, the herb which is used is the ''somalata'' (''[[Sarcostemma acidum]]''){{cn|date=February 2018}}, a leafless plant that grows in rocky places all over India.

===Fly-agaric===
[[File:Amanita muscaria 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fly-agaric (''[[Amanita muscaria]]'').]]
From the late 1960s onwards, several studies attempted to establish ''soma'' as a [[psychotropic]] substance. A number of proposals were made, included an important one in 1968 by [[Robert Gordon Wasson]], an amateur mycologist, who (on Vedic evidence) asserted that ''soma'' was an inebriant, and suggested fly-agaric mushroom, ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', as the likely candidate. Wasson and his co-author, [[Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty]], drew parallels between Vedic descriptions and reports of Siberian uses of the fly-agaric in [[shamanic]] ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wasson|first=Robert Gordon|title=Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality|journal=Ethno-Mycological Studies|volume=1|year=1968|isbn=978-0-15-683800-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the mountainous origin of soma matches the habitat of fly-agaric, and when discussing soma, the Vedas do not mention any part of a flowering tree.{{r|eiec}}

In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and drew attention to [[ephedrine]] (in particular to that extracted from ''[[Ephedra sinica]]''), and noted that it "is a powerful stimulant, and would thus be a more plausible preparation for warriors about to go into
battle than the fly-agaric, which is a depressant." (for use of ''parahaoma'' by soldiers, see reference to the [[Ab-Zohr]] in ''[[Denkard]]'' 8.25.24).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brough|first=John|title=Soma and ''Amanita muscaria''|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS)|volume=34|issue=2|pages=331–362|year=1971 |jstor=612695}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in turn contradicted in 1974 by Iranologist Ilya Greshevitch, who determined that, in small doses, fly-agaric was indeed a [[stimulant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Greshevitch|first=Ilya|editor1-first=Philippe |editor1-last=Gignoux |editor2-first=Ahmad |editor2-last=Tafazzoli |title=Mémorial Jean de Menasce|location=Louvain|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, since the "weapon" that Indra uses is the "Vajra" which emits "lightning bolts", the "battles" could not have been physical ones.

[[J. P. Mallory]] rejects Wasson's argument that the absence of Vedic descriptions of plant parts point to a fungus, since the Vedas do not describe the plant from which is extracted at all; he explains the references in mountains as a metaphor "recalling soma's lofty origins".&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=J.

P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Sacred drink |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Psilocybe cubensis''===
[[File:Psilocybe Cubensis.JPG|thumb|''Psilocybe cubensis'' mushroom]]
[[Terence McKenna]] in his book "''The Food Of Gods''" takes issue with the ''Amanita muscaria'' theory and suggests the [[psilocybin]]-containing ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'' mushroom as a Soma candidate. McKenna argues that effects of the ''Amanita muscaria'' mushrooms contradict the description of the properties described in the Rigveda. ''Amanita muscaria'' mushrooms have properties that are arguably more [[deliriant]] than [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]. Psilocybin, the active [[psychoactive]] component in ''Psilocybe cubensis'', has a strong mind-altering effect. McKenna cites other cultures who use and venerate psychedelic plant-drugs in religious ceremonies such as at [[Chavin de Huantar]], Peru.

Gordon Wasson, who initially suggested that the soma plant was ''Amanita muscaria,'' described ''Psilocybe cubensis'' as "easily identified and gathered" in India, and eventually hypothesized, along with McKenna, that ''Psilocybe cubensis'' was perhaps the true identity of soma. McKenna and Wasson both unsuccessfully attempted to use ''Amanita muscaria'' to achieve a state of consciousness conducive to the development of a religion.

The 9th mandala of the Rigveda suggests that the cow is the embodiment of soma, which provides support for McKenna's theory because ''Psilocybe cubensis'' is known to grow in cow dung.

A study by Griffiths et al. concluded that psilocybin is capable of producing mystical experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_releases/2006/GriffithsPsilocybin.pdf|title = Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance|date = May 2006|accessdate = 2015-12-18|website = HopkinsMedicine|publisher = Johns Hopkins Medicine|first1 = R.

A. |last2 = Richards |first3 = U. |last3 = McCann |first4 = R. |last4 = Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences may be conducive to the development of a religious ritual. It is worth noting that the experience of death and rebirth can be brought on by psychedelic drugs, but it is also a central concept of Hinduism (i.e. saṃsāra).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://selfdefinition.org/afterlife/Stanislav-Grof-Human-Encounter-With-Death.pdf|title = The Human Encounter With Death|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Grof|first = Stanislav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Peganum harmala''===
[[File:Peganum harmala0.jpg|thumb|left|Harmal seed capsules]]
In 1989, David Flattery, with linguistic support from Martin Schwarz, concentrated again on Iranian ''haoma''. The two again paid particular attention to the [[hallucinogen]]ic properties that may be interpreted from the texts, and discounted Ephedra because they could not observe Zoroastrian priests becoming intoxicated.
They concluded that it was "therefore neither likely that Ephedra was a substitute for *sauma nor that it was *sauma itself" and that the [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] alkaloids extracted from Ephedra had to be mixed with the extract from some other plant to achieve the described effects. Flattery proposed the second plant was ''[[Peganum harmala]]'' (harmal, harmel, Syrian rue, see also [[harmaline]]), known in Iranian languages as ''esfand'', ''sepand'' or other similar terms related to Avestan word ''spenta'' ('sacred', 'holy'). Flattery considered harmel to be the real ''haoma'', with ephedra only being the secondary ingredient in the ''parahaoma'' mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Flattery |first1=David Stophlet |last2=Schwarz |first2=Martin |title=Haoma and Harmaline: The Botanical Identity of the Indo-Iranian Sacred Hallucinogen "Soma" and its Legacy in Religion, Language, and Middle Eastern Folklore |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-520-09627-1 |series=University of California Publications Near Eastern Studies |volume=21 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INtzYGQOlFoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for preferring ''Peganum harmala'' as the identity of soma-haoma include its use as an entheogen in some South American cultures, mirroring its role in Indo-Iranian religion, and its being the only [[incense]] plant with hallucinogenic properties in Iran.{{r|eiec}}

''Peganum harmala'' contains [[harmaline]], which is a strong [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO-inhibitor]], and it is therefore often used as a first component in [[ayahuasca]] ceremonies in order to inhibit the metabolisation of an orally administered [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] molecule (2nd component). Since co-occurrence of DMT-carrying [[Phalaris aquatica|Phalaris]] grass and Harmala were observed at [[Yazd]], [[Persepolis]], [[Merv]] and [[Termez]],&lt;ref&gt;Hromada, Daniel Devatman (2015),[http://wizzion.com/soma/somahuasca.pdf The Somahuasca Hypothesis]&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis stating that Soma/Haoma was a biochemical Euro-Asian correlate of ayahuasca cannot be a priori excluded.
&lt;!-- CHECK: What is the "wild rue" in the title of the paper? ...    Moreover, as Gerardo Gnoli established in 1993, Iranian Zoroastrians, "while making much use of rue, do not crush it or associate it in any way with ''haoma'' rituals." ({{cite journal|last=Gnoli|first=Gerardo|title=On the Iranian Soma and Persian ''sepand'' 'Wild Rue'|journal=East and West|volume=43 |year=1993}}) --&gt;

===''Ephedra''===
[[File:Ephedra distachya.jpg|thumb|200px|''Ephedra distachya'']]
Another candidate of the non-hallucinogenic, [[stimulant]] hypothesis is a species of the genus ''[[Ephedra]]''. [[Ephedrine]], the agent substance in this plant, has a chemical structure similar to [[amphetamine]]s, and it results in high blood-pressure; according to anecdotal reports, it has a stimulating effect more potent than that of [[caffeine]].

In the late 19th century, the highly conservative Zoroastrians of [[Yazd]] province in [[Iran]] were found to use [[Ephedra]] (genus [[Ephedra (genus)|''Ephedra'']]), which was locally known as ''hum'' or ''homa'' and which they exported to the Indian [[Zoroastrian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Edward Tierney Aitchison | J.E.T. Aitchison]], "The botany of the Afghan delimitation commission" ''Trans. LinnEan Soc. of London.'', 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant, as Falk also established, requires a cool (but not cold) and dry climate, i.e. it does not grow in India (which is too hot and/or too humid) but thrives in [[central Asia]]. ''[[Ephedra distachya]]'' is native to southern Europe and northern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;David S. MacKenzie, ''Perennial ground covers''. Timber Press, 2002, page 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was discovered that a number of [[Iranian languages]] and Persian dialects have ''hom'' or similar terms as the local name for some variant of Ephedra.

Ephedra plants are shrubs, measuring between 0.2 and 4 meters, with numerous green or yellowish stems. There are about 30 species, mainly Eurasian. The species growing in mountainous regions have the highest ephedrine content (up to 3% in the case of ''[[Ephedra equisetina]]''). The marrow in the stems is brown-coloured in some species, reminiscent of Sanskrit ''babhru'' ("greyish-brown"), used exclusively in the Vedas to describe the extract.

The different species of Ephedra are not well known, and their taxonomy is in a state of confusion. Assuming a Pontic-Caspian home of Indo-Iranian religions (see [[Kurgan]]), the only likely candidate is ''[[Ephedra distachya]]'', still used in Iranian folk medicine.

The native name for Ephedra in most Indo-Iranian languages of Central Asia is derived from ''*sauma-'' (e.g. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] ''somalata'', [[Pashto language|Pashto]] ''Oman''/''unan'', [[Balochi language|Baluchi]] ''hum''/''huma''/''uma'').

In 1989, in a highly influential text, Harry Falk pointed out that both the Flattery and Wasson arguments assumed that ''haoma'' was hallucinogenic, although the effect desired by Zoroastrian and Vedic ritual use was not. Falk noted that, in the texts, both ''haoma'' and ''soma'' were said to enhance alertness and awareness, did not coincide with the consciousness altering effects of an [[entheogen]], and that "there is nothing shamanistic or visionary either in early Vedic or in Old Iranian texts,"&lt;ref name="falk"/&gt;{{rp|79}} nor could the small doses administered in living Zoroastrian custom justify its consideration as an inebriant. Living custom also does not give the extract enough time to ferment.

Falk established that the effect of the [[Alkaloids|alkaloid]] ephedrine was, in many respects, similar to adrenaline, but "its actions are less intense but more prolonged than those of adrenaline, and, most important, it prevents sleeping." Chemically, ephedrine is similar to [[amphetamine]] (amphetamine itself originating as an innovative "upgrade" of an ephedrine prototypical base). Falk also asserted that the three varieties of ephedra that yield ephedrine (''[[Ephedra gerardiana|E. gerardiana]]'', ''[[Ephedra major|E. major procera]]'' and ''[[Ephedra intermedia|E. intermedia]]'') also have the properties attributed to ''haoma'' by the texts of the Avesta.&lt;ref name="falk"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Falk |first=Harry |title=Soma I and II |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS) |volume=52/1 |year=1989 |jstor=617914 |pages=77–90 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

In 1994, [[Viktor Sarianidi]] claimed that ancient ritual objects found at [[BMAC]] archeological sites in [[Central Asia]] bore traces of Ephedra stalks and Papaver (poppy) seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarianidi|first=Victor|year=1994|title=New Discoveries at ancient Gonur|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=2.3|issue=3|pages=289–310|doi=10.1163/157005795x00173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Harri Nyberg investigated the specimens provided by Sarianidi but could not confirm the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nyberg|first=Harri|title=The problem of the Aryans and the Soma: the botanical evidence|journal=The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South-Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity|editor=George Erdosy|year=1995|pages=382–406}} Cited by Houben 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Following a 1999 workshop on Soma-Haoma in [[Leiden]], Sarianidi made specimens of the material (sediment in a pitcher, which he claimed had traces of Ephedra, papaver and hemp) available for further study, but the publication of an analysis (together with the proceedings of the Leiden workshop) only occurred in 2003. In that analysis, performed by Connie Bakels and corroborated by two other teams, no evidence of either hemp or Ephedra were found. (Bakels, 2003)
--&gt;
Another site provided material which Sarianidi had declared contained traces of Ephedra, papaver and hemp ([[Cannabis]]) in 1998–1999. It was analysed in 2002–2003 by three independent teams, but they found no traces of the claimed contents.&lt;ref&gt;Bakels, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in the conclusion of his observations on the 1999 Haoma-Soma workshop in Leiden, Jan E. M. Houben writes that "[d]espite strong attempts to do away with Ephedra by those who are eager to see ''*sauma'' as a hallucinogen, its status as a serious candidate for the Rigvedic Soma and Avestan Haoma still stands."&lt;ref&gt;Houben, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This supports Falk, who in his summary noted that ''"there is no need to look for a plant other than Ephedra, the one plant used to this day by the [[Parsi people|Parsis]].''&lt;ref name="falk"/&gt;

===''Cannabis sativa''===
[[Cannabis]] was also suggested, also based on Tibetan clues. The Tibetan word for Dekkan hemp ''[[Hibiscus cannabinus]]'', is ''So. Ma.Ra. Dza.'', apparently a borrowing from the Sanskrit ''soma-raja'' "king Soma" or possibly "soma rasa" / "soma juice" which could be the same as "[[bhang]]". Additionally, the Chinese word for cannabis hemp is ''Huo Ma'' or literally "fire hemp".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/olsen/hemp/iha/iha03207.html|title=Taxonomic studies of Cannabis in China|website=www.druglibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Nelumbo nucifera''===
Based on a detailed botanical analysis of iconography and ancient texts, ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', also known as the Sacred Lotus, is another candidate for Soma. The description of Soma in the Vedic texts somewhat resembles the Sacred Lotus. Sacred Lotus is a waterlily that produces golden-red flowers on stalks. These flowers resemble portions of the ancient texts comparing Soma to an arrow and the sun. Other Vedic hymns describe Soma as having a "ruddy radiance", reflecting the color of the flowers of the Sacred Lotus. Soma is also described in the Vedic hymns as growing "joint by joint, knot by knot", which is a good description of a plant that grows by producing procumbent shoots with nodes and internodes. In addition, [[benzoisoquinoline]] [[alkaloid]]s found in the Sacred Lotus, including [[aporphine]], [[proaporphine]], and [[nuciferine]], are psychoactive, producing feelings of [[euphoria]] when ingested.&lt;ref&gt;Spess, David L. Soma The Divine Hallucinogen, InnerTraditions, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spess, David L. Errors in Alkaloids of Nelumbo and Nymphaea species, 2011, academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, A. "A botanical perspective on the identity of soma (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) based on scriptural and iconographic records" in Economic Botany 2004;58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ergot===
[[File:Claviceps purpurea.JPG|thumb|Claviceps purpurea]]
In ''The Road to Eleusis'', the authors, [[R. Gordon Wasson]], [[Albert Hofmann]], and [[Carl A.P. Ruck]], note the similarity in preparation of the Vedic Soma and Eleusinain Mysteries [[Kykeon]].  The book hypothesizes that the source of both was ergot ([[Claviceps purpurea]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofmann|first1=R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, Carl A. P.

===Sugarcane===
Several authors have identified Saccharum Sara, a variety of sugarcane that grows near lakes&lt;ref&gt; https://www.vedanet.com/the-secret-of-the-soma-plant/ &lt;/ref&gt; as source of vedic Soma or with an ancient variety of sugarcane that may presently be extinct &lt;ref&gt;Frawley, D.

===Account by Swami Rama===
In his autobiography, [[Swami Rama]] recalls contacting an Indian herbologist and Vedic scholar named Vaidya Bhairavdutt, who is described as "the only living authority on soma". Bhairavdutt comes to visit the swami, bringing about a pound of the herb with him. He informs the swami that though the plant's effects can be likened to that of psychedelic mushrooms, it is definitely not a mushroom, but rather a succulent plant.&lt;ref name="rama"/&gt;{{rp|274}}
Bhairavdutt convinces the swami to join him in partaking the soma. The taste, says Swami Rama, is "a little bit bitter and sour." Bhairavdutt becomes inebriated and dances wildly, claiming he is Shiva. Several students attempt to restrain the apparently slightly built Bhairavdutt, but are unable to do so. Meanwhile, Swami Rama develops a crippling headache, a symptom which is compatible with the effects of ephedrine overdose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} No hallucinogenic effects are described by Swami Rama.&lt;ref name="rama"&gt;{{cite book |author=Swami Rama |year=1978 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3nXAAAAMAAJ |title=Living with the Himalayan Masters |publisher=The Himalayan Institute Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275–276}}

'''Buddhism''' is a legally recognized religion in [[Slovenia]] and it is followed by more than 1,000 Slovenes, though no official numbers are established as the previous census did not include Buddhism specifically. Although still small in absolute numbers (though Slovenia has only 2 million inhabitants), Buddhism in Slovenia enjoys widespread acceptance if not popularity.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

As in most European countries, different branches and schools of Buddhism are represented by groups of varying sizes. The largest traditions represented are [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]]. There is a Buddhist temple in [[Ljubljana]], the capital of Slovenia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dharmaling.org/en/ljubljana-center Temple in Ljubljana&lt;/ref&gt; and Theravada hermitage in the forested countryside in Goljek, near Trebnje, which belongs to [[Ajahn Chah]] lineage.

In Slovenia, the competent administration dealing with religions is the Governmental Office for Religious Community of Republic of Slovenia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvs.gov.si/en {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807221550/http://www.uvs.gov.si/en/ |date=2007-08-07 }} Office for Religious communities of Slovenia&lt;/ref&gt; and a newly approved regulation has been enacted in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvs.gov.si/en/legislation{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} new law regulating the religious communities&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist organisations==
Buddhist religious communities registered to the Office for Religious Communities of the Government of Slovenia include:
* [[Buddhist Congregation Dharmaling]], registered in 2003. This organization is active also in [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[France]], [[India]]. This community has a resident [[Lama]], recognised [[Tulku]], [[Shenphen Rinpoche]].
* Samanadipa Forest Hermitage, founded in 2016. It is associated with the [[Forest Tradition of Ajahn Chah]]. This community has a resident monk, Ajahn Hiriko.
On 4 July 2008, an agreement was signed between [[Dharmaling]] and the State of Slovenia. This is first agreement signed with a Buddhist Community in Slovenia.
* Buddha-Dharma, registered in 1995.

The following smaller associations also exist in Slovenia:
* [[Shambhala Buddhism]] group Ljubljana
* Yeshe Khorlo group ([[Nyingma]] branch of [[Tibetan Buddhism]])
* Phowa group (focused on the practice of [[phowa]], under the guidance of Ayang Rinpoche, a renowned Phowa Master)
* Association of Theravada Buddhism Bhavana ("Društvo theravadskih budistov, Bhavana")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slo-theravada.org SloTheravada - modrost zgodnjega budizma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slovene Buddhist Association Madyamika ("Slovensko budistično društvo Madyamika, Srednja pot")&lt;ref&gt;[http://buda.si Domov - Budizem - Slovensko budistično društvo Srednja pot - Madyamika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829064759/http://buda.si/ |date=August 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bwiti''' is a [[spiritual discipline]] of the forest-dwelling [[Babongo]] and [[Mitsogo]] peoples of [[Gabon]] (where it is recognized as one of three [[official religion]]s) and by the [[Beti-Pahuin peoples#Fang|Fang people]] of Gabon and [[Cameroon]]. Modern Bwiti incorporates [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]], and [[Christianity]] into a [[syncretistic]] belief system.

Bwiti practitioners use the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[dissociative]] root bark of the ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'' plant, specially cultivated for the religion, to promote radical spiritual growth, to stabilize community and family structure, to meet religious requirements, and to resolve pathological problems. The root bark has been consumed for hundreds of years in a Bwiti [[rite of passage]] ceremony, as well as in [[initiation rite]]s and acts of healing. The experience yields complex visions and insights anticipated to be valuable to the initiate and the chapel.

==Liturgy==
===Intoxicants in liturgy===
Taking Iboga brings both open and closed-eye visions which can be made stronger by darkness, ambiance, and suggestion. Following the visions, users experience an introspective mindset in which they often recount past experiences in life. Difficulty sleeping, nausea, and vomiting sometimes last until the day after consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ibogaine/ibogaine_basics.shtml Ibogaine Basics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rites===
Bwiti ceremonies are led by a spiritual leader called ''[[Nganga|N'ganga]]'' who is a very important member of the community and has extensive knowledge of traditional healing practices, hexes, and spells. The crucial rite of Bwiti is the initiation ceremony, when young Gabonese men take iboga for the first time in the men's hut to become members of the spiritual practice. There are many ceremonies at different times of the year to give homage to the ancestors. Special ceremonies may be held to heal sick persons or drive out malevolent spirits.

During many ceremonies, a traditional torch made of bark and tree sap is burned. Musicians playing drums and a traditional Ngombi harp are central to the rites. The N'ganga and other participants usually dress in red, black, and white cloth. They may wear skirts of raffia material and small shells or beads. Animal skins, such as [[Genet (animal)|Genet]] fur, are often worn. The iboga root may be made into a tea or more often taken in the form of scrapings. Ceremonies usually begin at night and may last for days as the doses of the drug used in these ceremonies is particularly long lasting.

==Recognition==
Bwiti is one of Gabon's official religions and is influenced by Christianity including using the Christian Calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/tribe/tribes/babongo/index.shtml The Babongo], BBC page for Bruce Parry's "Tribe" series.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Christianity Is Stupid'''" is a song from [[Negativland]]'s 1987 concept album, ''[[Escape from Noise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&amp;pg=PT720 |page=713 |title=The Rough Guide To Rock |last=Buckley |first=Peter |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |isbn=1-84353-105-4 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the song, Negativland rearranges words and phrases to form a different meaning. They sampled phrases from a sermon by Rev. [[Estus Pirkle]] (from his 1968 LP, ''[[If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/Estus-W-Pirkle-If-Footmen-Tire-You-What-Will-Horses-Do/release/6441970&lt;/ref&gt; itself later adapted into a film of the same name).&lt;ref name=Weird&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T9okjBKav1oC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=Weird Minnesota |author1=Eric Dregni |author2=Mark Moran |author3=Mark Sceurman |publisher=Sterling |page=24 |year=2006 |isbn=1-4027-3908-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirkle's narrative included an imagined visit to the U.S. under [[Communism]] where public loudspeakers constantly proclaim "Christianity is stupid! Communism is good! Give up!" These phrases were altered and mixed with appropriately march-like [[heavy metal music]] and various other sound effects.

In 2004, the song was made into a video entitled "The Mashin' of the Christ" that sampled many [[Jesus Christ]]-topic films and footage from [[Marxist-Leninist]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |page=51 |title=Negativland—Our Favorite Things |work=CMJ New Music Monthly |date=December 2007 |issn=1074-6978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake press release==
When their 1987 album, ''[[Escape From Noise]]'', proved to be more successful than they expected, Negativland were expected to do a national tour. However, their record company, SST, could not provide sufficient funds.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} To explain the cancelled tour, Negativland issued a fake [[press release]] saying that the song "Christianity Is Stupid" had played a role in the [[David Brom]] murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=All music guide to electronica: the definitive guide to electronic music |first=Vladimir |last=Bogdanov |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=0-87930-628-9 |year=2001 |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release implied that Brom had listened to Negativland's song "Christianity Is Stupid" before the fatal quarrel with his religious parents.&lt;ref name="Brom"&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=4842 PRANKS! – Pullout – Music Quarterly – The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt; The group claimed they were "advised by Federal Official Dick Jordan not to leave town pending an investigation into the Brom murders".&lt;ref name=Weird/&gt; Brom, 16 at the time, had killed his family with an axe. Negativland's press release was picked up by San Francisco Bay Area media, including CBS News. Negativland recorded much of the news about their supposed influence on Brom, and in 1989 worked this material into another album called ''[[Helter Stupid]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FIpO0Kiw_4C&amp;pg=PA117 |pages=117–118 |title=Freedom of expression®: resistance and repression in the age of intellectual property |first=Kembrew |last=McLeod |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-8166-5031-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Negativland exposed their own hoax during an [[NPR]] interview on the subject.

In reality, there was no official named "Dick Jordan", and Brom did not possess any Negativland music. Nevertheless, pundits and journalists took the press release at face value, and the hoax received widespread media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.negativland.com/reviews/reviews_escape.html Reviews – Escape From Noise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107084532/http://www.negativland.com/reviews/reviews_escape.html |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Negativland encouraged the spread of the story by steadfastly refusing further comment, supposedly on the advice of their attorney "Hal Stakke", another fictional person invented by the band. Much of this media coverage was negative, and band member [[Richard Lyons (musician)|Richard Lyons]]' home in [[Oakland, California]] was pelted with rocks by an unknown vandal.&lt;ref name="Brom"/&gt; The resulting media craze, stemming from journalists neglecting to fact-check, is lampooned in the title track of their 1989 album, ''[[Helter Stupid]]'', whose insert also includes background information behind the band's prank.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bey William Bailey, ''MicroBionic: Radical Electronic Music and Sound Art in the 21st Century'', p. 153-180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.metrotimes.com/culture/story.asp?id=255 Guerrilla culture-jam (Metro Times Detroit)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confucius’ Birthday''' ({{zh|c=孔子誕辰 / 孔子诞辰}}, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] {{zh|p=Kǒngzǐ Dànchén}}）, falls on the 27th day of the eighth lunar month of the Chinese calendar. It is officially celebrated on [[Taiwan]] as "[[Teachers' Day]]" on September 28th, and in [[Hong Kong]] on the third Sunday of September as "Confucius Day", though the traditional date is also often observed. [[Mainland China]] observes a "Teachers' Day" on September 10th to celebrate the efforts of today's teachers, and there is a legislative effort underway to move that to September 28th. 

Many countries with [[Confucian]] cultures hold commemorations each year, especially mainland China, [[Macau]], Taiwan, Hong Kong, [[South Korea]], and [[Japan]]. The birth of Confucius is not a public holiday, but it is an official public holiday for workers (not including teachers) in Taiwan, known as Teachers’ Day. In October 2006, Hong Kong officially commenced celebrating the birth date of Confucius. The roots of this traditional ceremony can be found as far back in the time of the Zhou Dynasty, and appeals to both foreign tourists and local people to this day.

==Celebrations at the birthplace of Confucius==

Festivals are held to celebrate the birth of Confucius all across China, including at his birthplace in [[Shandong]] Province. Among the many attendees of the ceremonies at the Temple of Confucius in [[Qufu]] are scholars, notable people, and descendants of Confucius.
 
During the festival at the Qufu temple there are many activities and entertainments, including musical performances and dancing from ancient times. In the famous Yi Dance, the dancers wear clothes from the Song and Ming Dynasty, with yellow silk robes, blue waistbands, and black hats. The ceremonial music, played with traditional Chinese instruments, is known as “The Sound of Peace”. The musicians wear the clothes of the Ming Dynasty, with red robes and black hats. In addition to these performances, are calligraphy demonstrations and exhibitions, with many people in traditional costumes. Tourists are welcome to attend and enter the tombs of Confucius and his descendants, as well as explore his hometown and the Confucius Temple.

[[Image:Masolino 007.jpg|thumb|180px|''The Miracle of the Snow'' by [[Masolino da Panicale]]. [[Christ]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] observe [[Pope Liberius]], who marks in the legendary snowfall the outline of the basilica.]]
The '''Dedication of the [[Basilica of St Mary Major]]'''&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Missal'', official English translation&lt;/ref&gt; (''In Dedicatione basilicae S. Mariae'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/20881056/Missale-Romanum-2002 ''Missale Romanum'', 2002, p. 112, 799]&lt;/ref&gt; is a feast day in the [[General Roman Calendar]], optionally celebrated annually on 5 August with the [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank]] of [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]].

In earlier editions of the General Roman Calendar, down to that of [[General Roman Calendar of 1960|1960]], it is called the '''Dedication of the Basilica of St Mary of the Snows''' (''In Dedicatione basilicae S. Mariae ad Nives''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'', 1962, pp. L, 613]&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the legendary story about the foundation of the [[basilica]]. For the same reason the feast is also known popularly as '''Our Lady of the Snows'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snows.org/about-us/shrine-history/ "Shrine History", National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows]&lt;/ref&gt; The reference to the legend was removed in the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] of the General Roman Calendar.&lt;ref name=Calendarium133&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Pope Pius V]] inserted this feast into the General Roman Calendar in 1568,&lt;ref name=Calendarium&gt;Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; when, in response to the request of the [[Council of Trent]], he reformed the [[Roman Breviary]]. Before that, it had been celebrated at first only in the church itself and, beginning in the 14th century, in all the churches of the city of Rome.&lt;ref name="CathEncy"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11361c.htm Ott, Michael. "Our Lady of the Snow." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 27 Jun. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, it appears in the [[Tridentine Calendar]] for celebration as a Double. In [[Pope Clement VIII]]'s Missal of 1604, it was given the newly invented rank of Greater Double. In [[Pope John XXIII]]'s 1960 calendar, it became a Third-Class Feast.&lt;ref&gt;[[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]&lt;/ref&gt; This 1960 calendar, included in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], is the calendar whose continued use privately and, under certain conditions, publicly is authorized by the motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Nine years later, the celebration became an optional memorial.&lt;ref name=Calendarium133/&gt;

The feast commemorates the dedication by [[Pope Sixtus III]] of the rebuilt [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]] just after the [[First Council of Ephesus]]. This major basilica, located on the summit of the [[Esquiline Hill]] in [[Rome]], is called the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore]] ({{lang-la|Basilica Sanctae Mariae Maioris}}) because it is the largest church in Rome dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]].

The original church, which was replaced by that of Pope Sixtus III, was built during the pontificate of [[Pope Liberius]] (352–366), and is thus sometimes known as the ''Basilica Liberii'' or ''Basilica Liberiana''.

== Legend ==

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 003.jpg|thumb|"Our Lady of the Snows", Mathis Gothart Grünewald]]
{{RC-Mariology}}

Until 1969 the feast was known as ''Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives'' (Dedication of the Church of Our Lady of the Snows), a name that had become popular for the Basilica in the 14th century&lt;ref name=Calendarium/&gt; in connection with a legend about its origin that the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] summarizes: (in the middle of the 4th century) "During the pontificate of [[Pope Liberius|Liberius]], the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary that they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot that was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by [[Pope Sixtus III|Sixtus III]] in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it would seem that the legend has no historical basis."&lt;ref name="CathEncy"/&gt;

In fact there is no reference to the legend before the year 1000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1098 American Catholic, "Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the legend in the 15th century is shown in the painting of the Miracle of the Snow by [[Masolino da Panicale]] of around 1423, now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples, in which the miracle is depicted as witnessed by a crowd of men and women, with Jesus and the Virgin Mary observing from above, and by the building in that century and the immediately following centuries of many churches dedicated to Our Lady of the Snows, of which 152 still exist in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Madonna della Neve]]&lt;/ref&gt; A more critical attitude began to prevail in the 18th century, as evidenced by the proposal that a congregation set up by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] presented to him in 1741 that the reading of the legend be removed from the Roman Breviary and that the original name, "Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae", be restored. This recommendation was implemented only in 1969, 228 years later.

==Legacy of the legend==
On 5 August each year, during the celebration of the liturgical feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major, a custom that commemorates the story of the miraculous snowfall is still maintained: at the conclusion of the Solemn Mass in the basilica, a shower of white rose petals is dropped from the dome of the Chapel of Our Lady.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/Summ99.html Mauriello, Matthew R. "Our Lady of the Snows", ''Fairfield County Catholic'', January 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003143617/http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/Summ99.html |date=October 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At sunset on the same day, an artificial "snowfall" is staged as a tourist attraction in the square outside the basilica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goitaly.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;zTi=1&amp;sdn=goitaly&amp;cdn=travel&amp;tm=30&amp;f=00&amp;su=p284.13.342.ip_&amp;tt=65&amp;bt=7&amp;bts=7&amp;zu=http%3A//www.italiannotebook.com/lists/archive.php%3Fx%3D386%26listID%3D2%26layoutID%3D6%26pagerows%3D10%26pagenum%3D1 Normanno Ross, "The Miracle of the Snow"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the above-mentioned many shrines of the ''Madonna della Neve'' in Italy, the United States has a "National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows" in Belleville, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snows.org/DefaultEnglish.aspx The National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows]&lt;/ref&gt; and parishes dedicated to "Our Lady of the Snows" are located in Reno, Nevada;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olsparish.com/ Our Lady of the Snows Church, Reno, Nevada]&lt;/ref&gt; Floral Park, New York&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olsnows.org/history.php Our Lady of the Snows Church, Floral Park, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;, Milford, Michigan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmarymilfordmi.org/ St. Mary, Our Lady of the Snows]&lt;/ref&gt; and Woodstock, Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourladyofthesnows.org/ Our Lady of the Snows Roman Catholic Church, Woodstock, Vermont], St. Mary's Our Lady of The Snows, Milford, Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; In Croatia, [[Bol, Croatia|Bol]] on the island of [[Brač]] as well as the parish church in [[Mamre]] on the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]] are dedicated to the Lady of the Snows. There's also a dedicated temple on Calvary hill in Bratislava, Slovakia - Kostol Panny Márie Snežnej&lt;ref&gt;[[:sk:Kostol Panny Márie Snežnej (Bratislava)|Kostol Panny Márie Snežnej]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}

The '''''Galdrabók''''' ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Book of Magic'') is an Icelandic [[grimoire]] dated to ca. 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Matthías Viðar Sæmundsson 1992:10; Flowers 1989:29; Lindqvist 1921:11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small manuscript containing a collection of 47 [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] and sigils/staves.&lt;ref&gt;Lindqivst 1921:9; Matthías Viðar Sæmundsson 1992:11.&lt;/ref&gt; The grimoire was compiled by four different people, possibly starting in the late 16th century and going on until the mid-17th century. The first three scribes were Icelanders, and the fourth was a [[Danes|Dane]] working from Icelandic material.&lt;ref&gt;Matthías Viðar Sæmundsson 1992:10; Flowers 1989:30.&lt;/ref&gt; The various spells consist of [[Latin]] and [[Runes|runic]] material as well as [[Icelandic magical staves]], [[invocation]]s to Christian entities, demons and the [[Norse gods]], as well as instructions for the use of [[herbs]] and magical items. Some of the spells are protective, intended against such problems as trouble with [[childbearing]], headache and insomnia, previous incantations, [[Infection|pestilence]], suffering and distress at sea. Others are intended to cause fear, kill animals, find thieves, put someone to sleep, cause [[flatulence]], or bewitch women.

The book was first published in 1921 by Natan Lindqvist in a diplomatic edition and with a Swedish translation. An English translation was published in 1989 by [[Stephen Flowers]], and a facsimile edition with detailed commentary by Matthías Viðar Sæmundsson in 1992. In 1995 Flowers produced a second retitled edition of his book and with the assistance of Sæmundsson corrected many translations and added many more notes and commentaries.

'''Harisena''' was a tenth century ''[[Digambara monk]]''. His origin is traced to those monks who had stayed in the north during the supposed famine and had been prevailed upon by their lay followers to cover their private parts with a strip of cloth (''ardhaphalaka'') while begging for alms.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=48}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1623">'''Himalayan Buddhism''' is a term used to collectively refer to the [[Buddhist]] schools of [[Tibet]],  [[Bhutan]], and regions of [[Nepal]], and those practiced in the Indian Himalayan regions of [[Ladakh]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Darjeeling]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

There are four main, and several smaller, sects  of Buddhism which were centred in Tibet but spread to the surrounding Himalayan regions:
* [[Nyingma]]
* [[Sakya]]
* [[Kagyu]]
* [[Geluk]]

The [[Newar Buddhism]] of Nepal, which was centred in the Kathmandu valley, is older than [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and Tibetan Buddhism drew many teachings, particularly Vajarayana teachings, from Newar Buddhism as well as teachings from [[Indian Buddhism]]

All these Buddhist traditions are closely related historically and all include practices of both the Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]] traditions of Buddhism. The Buddhism of Mongolia is sometimes considered part of the same cultural milieu, although Mongolia is not in the Himalayan region.

The '''Igong Maji''' ([[Hangul]]: 이공맞이, literally ''Greeting the Igong'' is a [[Korean shamanism|Korean shamanistic]] ritual done in [[Jeju Island]]. Because Igong, the god of flowers, does not have an important role in common life, the ''Igong Maji'' was done only as a part of a large [[gut (ritual)|gut ritual]].&lt;ref name="seogwipo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seogwipo.grandculture.net/Contents?local=seogwipo&amp;dataType=01&amp;contents_id=GC04601694|title=이공맞이|publisher=한국학중앙연구원|language=Korean|accessdate=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Igong was the patron of the Fields of Seocheon, a [[Korean mythology|mythological]] realm of magical flowers.&lt;ref name="seogwipo" /&gt; The myth concerning the Igong (Hallakgungi being his true name, and Igong being only a title) is called the ''[[Igong Bonpuli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/minsok/dicParser.jsp?DIC_ID=2609&amp;xslUrl=dicPrint_Pop.jsp&amp;printYN=Y|title=불도맞이 |publisher=[[National Folk Museum of Korea]]|accessdate=2016-06-29|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Igong Bonpuli'', the Fields of Seocheon include many magical flowers, but only two have importance; the Hwansaengkkot (literally ''Flowers of reincarnation'') and the Suremyeolmangaksimkkot (literally ''Flower that brings destruction through the evil mind''). The Hwansaengkkot include the Bbyeoalikkot (flower that revives the bones), Salsalikkot (flower that revives the flesh), Ojangyukbusalikkot (flower that revives the intestines), Pisalikkot (flower that revives the blood), Sumsalikkot (flower that revives the breath), and Honsalikkot (flower that revives the soul).

Thus, the Igong Maji ritual was intended to ward off destruction and evil caused by the Suremyeolmangakshimkkot and gather the prosperity caused by the Hwansaengkkot.

Additionally, the Igong Maji had another function. Because it was believed that the children who died under the age of fifteen would assist in raising the magical flowers, parents who lost their children prayed to Igong to not harass their children.

==Supplies==
The Igong Maji was done in the hall of the house. In the hall was a large table, filled with sacrifices for the Igong. The sacrifices included [[rice]], [[sirutteok]],fish, fruits, vegetables, eggs, wine, and a Jeju Island cuisine called dollaetteok. The essential ingredients of the Igong Maji were the Suremyeolmangaksimkkot and the Hwansaengkkot. A bundle of entertwined ropes symbolized the Suremyeolmangaksimkkot, and cammelia flowers placed in a bowl of rice symbolized the Hwansaengkkot.

==Parts==
The Igong Maji was divided into seven parts.
# Chogamje, an introduction. It starts from the creation of the world. Next, the shaman gives a geographical and historical explanation of the location (this is called the Bepodoeobchim), then the shaman describes the date and location of the ritual (this is called the Gukseomgim). Next, the shaman gives the reason for the ritual (this is called the Jiban Yeonyu Dakkeum). The Gunmun Yeollim follows. The Gunmun Yeollim opens the way for Igong. Next, the Saedorim cleans the way for Igong, the Shincheonggwe checks if the way is open or not, and the Bunbusaroem checks if the god came or not. 
# Chumul Gongyeon, a [[religious music|song]] urging the Igong to eat the sacrifice. 
# Igong Jilchim, an integral part of the Igong Maji. The shaman says that the way that Igong walks through is a steep, dirty road, and cleans the road. The shaman cuts plants with a sacred sword, sweeps the dead plants with a stick, digs up the roots of the plants, stomps on the humps of the trail, sweeps away the stones, smoothens the trail, waters the trail to dispose of the dust, covers mud with a belt, and releases [[butterflies]] into the air. Finally, the shaman covers the trails with a long piece of linen, slices up the linen, and sprinkles rice and powder on the linen.
# Soji Sareum, a ritual where people pray to the Igong.
# Igongi Jeonsanggut, a curious ritual. The shaman makes [[tteok]] and wine, then suddenly pretends to be ill. He signifies that his head is ill by putting a tteok on his head, and also puts a tteok on his ears, nose, chin, shoulder, hip, belly, legs, and feet. Then, the shaman uses the power of Igong to expel the sickness from the body.
# Seoksalim, a ritual to rest the Igong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=541296&amp;categoryId=1627&amp;mobile |title=네이버 지식백과 |publisher=Terms.naver.com |date=1996-01-05 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The three dimensions of Islam.png|350px|thumbnail|The three dimensions of Islam (''[[Islam]]'' including ''[[Iman (concept)|Iman]]'' including ''Ihsan''.)]]
'''Ihsan''' ({{lang-ar|إحسان}} ''ʾiḥsān'', also Romanized ''ehsan''), is an Arabic term meaning "perfection" or "excellence" (Ara. ''husn''). It is a matter of taking one's inner [[faith]] (''[[iman (concept)|iman]]'') and showing it in both deed and action, a sense of social responsibility borne from religious convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maqsood | first = Ruqaiyyah Waris | title = Teach Yourself Islam | authorlink = Ruqaiyyah Waris Maqsood | series = Teach Yourself World Faiths | date = September 15, 1994 | publisher = [[Teach Yourself]] | isbn = 978-0-340-60901-9 | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], ihsan is the Muslim responsibility to obtain perfection, or [[excellence]], in worship, such that [[Muslims]] try to worship [[God in Islam|God]] as if they see him, and although they cannot see him, they undoubtedly believe that he is constantly watching over them. That definition comes from the [[Hadith of Gabriel]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, "[Ihsan is] to worship God as though you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then indeed He sees you". ([[Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari|Al-Bukhari]] and [[Al-Muslim]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]], ''Islam: Faith and History'', pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Ihsan, meaning "to do beautiful things", is one of the three dimensions of the Islamic religion (Ara. ''ad-din''): [[islam]], [[iman (concept)|iman]] and ihsan. In contrast to the emphases of ''islam'' (what one should do) and ''iman'' (why one should do), the concept of ihsan is primarily associated with intention. One who "does what is beautiful" is called a ''muhsin''. It is generally held that a person can only achieve true ihsan with the help and guidance of [[God]], who governs all things. While traditionally Islamic jurists have concentrated on Islam and theologians on Iman, the [[Sufis]] have focused their attention on Ihsan.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism''. William C. Chittick. {{ISBN|978-1-85168-547-9}}. Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Islamic scholar]]s explain ihsan as being the ''inner'' dimension of Islam whereas [[shariah]] is often described as the ''outer'' dimension:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the preceding discussion it should be clear that not every Muslim is a man or woman of faith (''mu'min''), but every person of faith is a ''muslim''. Furthermore, a Muslim who believes in all the principles of Islam may not necessarily be a righteous person, a doer of good (''muhsin''), but a truly good and righteous person is both a ''muslim'' and a true person of faith.&lt;ref name="Mahmoud M. Ayoub p. 54"&gt;Mahmoud M. Ayoub, ''Islam: Faith and History'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ihsan "constitutes the highest form of worship" (''ibadah'').&lt;ref name="Mahmoud M. Ayoub p. 54"/&gt; It is excellence in work and in social interactions. For example, ihsan includes sincerity during Muslim prayers and being grateful to parents, family, and God.

'''''Initiation into Hermetics''''' is the title of the English translation of [[Franz Bardon]]'s first of three volumes concerning self-realization in line with the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] tradition.

==Publication==
The book was first published in German in 1956 under the title ''Der Weg zum Wahren Adepten'' by publisher Verlag Hermann Bauer. The first English edition appeared in 1962, published by Osiris Verlag and translated by Alfred Radspieler. A second English translation was published in 1971 by Dieter Rüggeberg. The most recent translation is published by Merkur, the translators of which were: Gerhard Hanswille and Franca Gallo and edited by Ken Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merkurpublishing.com/franz_bardon_hermetics_evocation_kabbalah.htm|title=Franz Bardon Books|accessdate=4 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Merkur Publishing|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The book itself is divided into two sections: the theory section and the practical section.

The theory section outlines esoteric theory and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic philosophy]] to help the student when following this course. Topics covered include the [[Classical element|elements]] (fire, air, water and earth plus the fifth, ether), [[Karma]] (the law of cause and effect), [[Chakra|occult anatomy]], the physical, [[Astral plane|astral]] and mental planes and the matters of religion and god.

The practical section is divided into 10 steps. Each step contains physical, astral and mental exercises which the student must master to the degree laid out by Bardon before moving on to the next step. The three kinds of exercises within a step are to be practiced concurrently, the idea being that this will lead to a more balanced development.

Most Libyans adhere to the [[Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]], which provides both a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] [[guide]] for individuals and a keystone for [[government]] policy. Its tenets stress a unity of religion and state rather than a separation or distinction between the two, and even those Muslims who have ceased to believe fully in Islam retain Islamic habits and attitudes. The post-revolution [[National Transitional Council]] has explicitly endeavored to reaffirm Islamic values, enhance appreciation of [[Islamic culture]], elevate the status of [[Qur'an]]ic law and, to a considerable degree, emphasize Qur'anic practice in everyday [[Libya]]n life with legal implementation in accordance to Islamic jurisprudence known as [[sharia]]. Libya has a small presence of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]]s and [[Shias]] consisting of [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] immigrants, though unrecongnized by the state .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/01/16/pakistani-ahmedis-held/#axzz33Hqj4Sty | title=Pakistani Ahmedis Held | date=January 16, 2013 |accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Islam in Libya==
During the seventh century, [[Muslims]], who were spreading their faith,  reached Libya to spread the message. The [[urban area|urban]] centers soon became substantially Islamic, but widespread conversion of the [[nomads]] of the [[desert]] did not come until after large-scale invasions in the eleventh century by [[Bedouin]] tribes from [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]].

A residue of pre-Islamic beliefs blended with the Islam of the Arabs. Hence, popular Islam became an overlay of Quranic ritual and principles upon the vestiges of earlier beliefs&amp;mdash;prevalent throughout North Africa&amp;mdash;in [[jinns]] (spirits), the [[evil eye]], [[rites]] to ensure [[good fortune]], and [[cult]] veneration of local [[saint]]s. The educated of the cities and towns served as the primary bearers and [[wiktionary:Guardians|guardians]] of the more austere brand of orthodox Islam.

==Saints and brotherhoods==
[[File:Quran studying board.jpg|320px|thumb|left|Quran studying board shot in Almayyit Mosque Tripoli. Writing on wooden boards is the traditional method for memorizing Quran]]
Islam as practiced in [[North Africa]] is interlaced with indigenous Berber beliefs. Although the Sufi orthdoxy preached the unique and inimitable [[majesty]] and [[sanctity]] of [[God]] and the [[social equality|equality]] of God's [[religious belief|believers]], an important element of Islam for centuries has been a belief in the coalescence of special spiritual power given by god to particular living human beings. The power is known as [[Barakah]], a transferable quality of personal blessedness and spiritual force said to lodge in certain individuals. Those whose claim to possess barakah can be substantiated&amp;mdash;through performance of apparent [[miracle]]s, exemplary human insight, or [[genealogy|genealogical]] connection with a recognized possessor&amp;mdash;are viewed as saints. These persons are known in the West as marabouts, a [[French language|French]] transliteration of al murabitun (those who have made a religious retreat), and the benefits of their baraka are believed to accrue to those ordinary people who come in contact with them.

The true Islamic way of saints became widespread in rural areas; in urban localities, Islam in its Sunni form  prevail. Saints were present in [[Tripolitania]], but they were particularly numerous in [[Cyrenaica]]. Their baraka continued to reside in their tombs after their deaths. The number of venerated tombs varied from tribe to tribe, although there tended to be fewer among the camel herders of the desert than among the sedentary and nomadic tribes of the [[plateau]] area. In one village, a visitor in the late 1960s counted sixteen still-venerated tombs.

Coteries of [[wikt:disciple|disciples]] frequently clustered around particular saints, especially those who preached an original tariqa (devotional "way"). Brotherhoods of the followers of such mystical teachers appeared in North Africa at least as early as the eleventh century and in some cases became mass movements. The founder ruled an order of followers, who were organized under the frequently absolute authority of a leader, or shaykh. The brotherhood was centered on a zawiya (pl., zawaya).

Because of Islam's austere [[Rationality|rational]] and [[intellectual]] qualities, many people have felt drawn toward the more emotional and personal ways of knowing God practiced by mystical Islam, or [[Sufism]]. Found in many parts of the Muslim world, Sufism endeavored to produce a personal experience of the divine through mystic and ascetic discipline.

Sufi adherents gathered into brotherhoods, and Sufi orders became extremely popular, particularly in rural areas. Sufi brotherhoods exercised great influence and ultimately played an important part in the religious revival that swept through North Africa during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Libya, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] proved unable to mount effective resistance to the encroachment of [[Christian missionary|Christian missionaries]], the work was taken over by Sufi-inspired [[revivalist movement]]s. Among these, the most forceful and effective was that of the [[Senussi]], which extended into numerous parts of North Africa.

===Senussi===
The [[Senussi]] movement was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its ''[[Zawiya (institution)|zawaayaa]]'' could be found in [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]], but Senussi influence was strongest in [[Cyrenaica]]. The [[Senussi]]'s first theocracy was in the city of [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], located in Cyrenaica, and that was the center for them in 1841.  After the Italian occupation, the focus turned from government to seminary education and then to the creation of an Islamic University which became in 1960 the University of Mohammed bin Ali al-Sanusi. The arrival of Muammar Gaddafi's rule changed the course of the university. It is now known as the [[Omar Al-Mukhtar University]]. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of [[wikt:unity|unity]] and purpose.

The Senussis formed a nucleus of resistance to the [[Italy|Italian]] colonial regime (see Italian Colonialism, ch. 1). As the [[nationalism]] fostered by unified resistance to the Italians gained adherents, however, the religious fervor of devotion to the movement began to wane, particularly after the Italians destroyed Senussi religious and educational centers during the 1930s. Nonetheless, [[Idris I of Libya|King Idris]], the [[monarch]] of independent Libya, was the grandson of the founder of the Senussi movement, and his status as a Senussi gave him the unique ability to command respect from the disparate parts of his kingdom.

Despite its momentary political prominence, the Senussi movement never regained its strength as a religious force after its zawaayaa were destroyed by the Italians. A promised restoration never fully took place, and the Idris regime used the Senussi heritage as a means of legitimizing political authority, rather than of providing religious leadership.

After unseating Idris in 1969, the revolutionary government placed restrictions on the operation of the remaining zawaayaa, appointed a [[supervisor]] for Senussi properties, and merged the Senussi-sponsored Islamic University with the [[University of Libya]]. The movement was virtually banned, but in the 1980s occasional evidence of Senussi activity was nonetheless reported. Senussi inspired activists were instrumental in freeing Cyrenaica from Gaddafi's control during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]].

==Islam in Gaddafi's Libya==
[[File:Koran class in Al Bayda.jpg|320px|thumb|left|Koran class in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]]]]

Under the revolutionary [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] government, the role of [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] Islam in Libyan life became progressively more important. [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] was a highly devout Muslim, with an expressed desire to exalt Islam and to restore it to its proper&amp;mdash;i.e., central&amp;mdash;place in the life of the people. He believed that the purity of Islam had been sullied through time, particularly by the influence of [[Europe]]ans, both during and after the colonial period, and that Islam's purity must be restored by such actions as: the restoration of [[sharia]] to its proper place as the basis of the Libyan legal system, the banning of "immodest" practices and dress, and the symbolic purification of mosques.

Gaddafi also believed in the value of the [[Quran]] as a moral and political guide for the contemporary world, as is evident from his tract, [[The Green Book (Libya)|''The Green Book'']], published in the mid-1970s (see The Green Book, ch. 4). Gaddafi considered the first part of The Green Book to be a commentary on the implications of the Quranic injunction that human affairs be managed by consultation. For him, this meant direct democracy, which is given "practical meaning" through the creation of people's committees and popular congresses. Gaddafi felt that, inasmuch as ''The Green Book'' was based solely on the Quran, its provisions should be universally applicable&amp;mdash;at least among Muslims.

Soon after taking office, the Gaddafi government showed itself to be devoutly [[conservative]] by closing [[Bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[nightclub]]s, banning entertainment deemed provocative or immodest, and making use of the Muslim calendar mandatory. The intention of reestablishing sharia was announced, and Gaddafi personally assumed chairmanship of a commission to study the problems involved. In November 1973, a new legal code was issued that revised the entire Libyan judicial system to conform to the sharia, and in 1977 the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] (GPC&amp;mdash;see Glossary) issued a statement that all future legal codes would be based on the Quran.

Among the laws enacted by the Gaddafi government were a series of legal penalties prescribed during 1973 which included the punishment of armed [[robbery]] by [[amputation]] of a hand and a foot. The legislation contained qualifying clauses making its execution unlikely, but its enactment had the effect of applying Quranic principles in the modern era. Another act prescribed flogging for individuals breaking the fast of Ramadan, and yet another called for eighty lashes to be administered to both men and women guilty of [[fornication]].

In the early 1970s, Islam played a major role in legitimizing Gaddafi's political and social reforms. By the end of the decade, however, he had begun to attack the religious establishment and several fundamental aspects of [[Sunni]] Islam. Gaddafi asserted the transcendence of the Quran as the sole guide to Islamic governance and the unimpeded ability of every Muslim to read and interpret it. He denigrated the roles of the [[Ulema|ulama]], imams, and Islamic jurists and questioned the authenticity of the hadith, and thereby the sunna, as a basis for Islamic law. The sharia itself, Gaddafi maintained, governed only such matters as properly fell within the sphere of religion; all other matters lay outside the purview of religious law. Finally, he called for a revision of the [[Muslim calendar]], saying it should date from [[Muhammad#Farewell pilgrimage and death|Muhammad's death]] in 632, an event he felt was more momentous than the hijra ten years earlier.

These unorthodox views on the [[hadith]], sharia, and the Islamic era aroused a good deal of unease. They seemed to originate from Gaddafi's conviction that he possessed the transcendent ability to interpret the Quran and to adapt its message to modern life. Equally, they reinforced the view that he was a reformer but not a literalist in matters of the Quran and Islamic tradition. On a practical level, however, several observers agreed that Gaddafi was less motivated by religious convictions than by political calculations. By espousing these views and by criticizing the ulama, he was using [[religion]] to undermine a segment of the middle class that was notably vocal in opposing his [[economy|economic]] policies in the late 1970s. But Gaddafi clearly considered himself an authority on the Quran and Islam and was not afraid to challenge traditional religious authority. He also was not prepared to tolerate dissent.

The revolutionary government gave repeated evidence of its desire to establish Libya as a [[leader]] of the [[Islamic world]]. Moreover, Gaddafi's efforts to create an [[Arab]] nation through political union with other Arab states were also based on a desire to create a great Islamic nation. Indeed, Gaddafi drew little distinction between the two.

The government took a leading role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide proselytizing on behalf of Islam. The [[Jihad]] [[Collective investment scheme|Fund]], supported by a payroll tax, was established in 1970 to aid the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] in their struggle with [[Israel]]. The Faculty of Islamic Studies and Arabic at the [[University of Benghazi]] was charged with training Muslim intellectual leaders for the entire Islamic world, and the Islamic Mission Society used public funds for the construction and repair of [[mosque]]s and Islamic educational centers in cities as widely separated as [[Vienna]] and [[Bangkok]]. The Islamic Call Society (Ad Dawah) was organized with government support to propagate Islam abroad, particularly throughout Africa, and to provide funds to Muslims everywhere. The symbolic purification major urban mosques took place in 1978.

Gaddafi was forthright in his belief in the [[perfection]] of Islam and his desire to propagate it. His commitment to the open propagation of Islam, among other reasons, caused him to oppose the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], an [[Egypt]]ian-based fundamentalist movement that used clandestine and sometimes subversive means to spread Islam and to eliminate Western influences. Although the Brotherhood's activities in Libya were banned in the mid-1980s, it remained present in the country maintaining a low profile. In 1983 a member of the brotherhood was [[executed]] in [[Tripoli]], and in 1986 a group of Brotherhood adherents was arrested after the murder of a high-ranking political official in [[Benghazi]]. The Muslim Brotherhood had  spread throughout Libya, but were particularly strong in the cities of Benghazi, [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and [[Ajdabiya]]. Gaddafi challenged the Brotherhood to establish itself openly in non-Muslim countries and promised its leaders that, if it did, he would financially support its activities. No support was ever forthcoming.

Gaddafi stressed the universal applicability of Islam, but he also reaffirmed the special status assigned by  [[Muhammad]] to [[Christian]]s. He likened Christians to misguided Muslims who strayed from the correct path. Furthermore, Gaddafi assumed leadership of a drive to rid Africa of [[Christianity]] as well as of the [[colonialism]] with which he associated it, despite the fact that Christianity's presence in Libya long predates Islam or its presence in much of Europe.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4049">'''Joseph ben Solomon Ṭaiṭazaḳ''' ({{Lang-he-n|יוסף בן שלמה טאיטאצק}}), also referred to by the acronym ''MahaRITaTS'', was a [[talmudic]] authority and [[kabalist]] who lived at [[Salonica]] in the 15th and 16th centuries. He was a member of the [[Taitazak family]].

With his father and brother [[Judah ben Solomon Taitazak]], he moved in [[Jewish expulsion from Spain|1492 from Spain]], his native land, to [[Salonica]], where he became a [[rabbi]].

==Life==
He was regarded as one of the most mysterious Kabbalists of the 17th century and one of the leading rabbinical figures in Jerusalem and Damascus. He discussed magic squares, which allude to the highest and most concealed concepts and their use within amulets. Many references can be found in writings of contemporary and leading Kabbalists, such as Rabbi [[Joseph Tirshom]]'s manuscript (ca. 1550 CE) "Shoshan Yesod Olam" (The Rose, Foundation of the Universe), Rabbi [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Eljah Baal Shem]]'s ''Toledot Adam'' (Generation of Adam) and Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]]'s (1560-1630 CE) ''Sh'nei Luchot HaB'rit'' (Two Tablets of the Covenant) discuss the magic square in relation to the mysteries of creation.

He was a fervent adherent of the [[Kabbalah]], in which he was well versed, and led an ascetic life. [[Eliyahu de Vidas|Elijah de Vidas]], in his ''Reshit Ḥokmah'' (''Sha'ar ha-Ḳedushshah,'' ch. vii), relates that with the exception of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] nights, Joseph for forty years never slept in a bed, but on a box, with his feet on the ground. With such a disposition to asceticism and mysticism it was but natural that Joseph should become enthralled by the [[Jewish messiah|Messianic]] vagaries of [[Solomon Molcho]], whom he supported while preaching at Salonica in 1529. Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] writes, "Rabbi Joseph Taitazak was apparently influenced by [[Abulafia]]'s school of Kabbalah, and many ideas that he discusses seem to be taken verbatim from Abulafia's writings."{{cn|date=December 2013}}

He was also considered one of the greatest Talmudists of his time, with even [[Joseph Caro]] invoking his authority (''Abḳat Rokel,'' §56). Among Joseph's disciples were [[Isaac Adarbi]], [[Samuel di Medina]], and [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]].

==Works==
He was the author of the following works:
*''Ben Porat,'' a commentary on [[Ecclesiastes]] (Venice, 1599)
*''Leḥem Setarim,'' on the [[Book of Daniel]] and the [[Five Scrolls]] (ib. 1608), and on [[Psalms]], [[Book of Job|Job]], and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (Neubauer, ''Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.'' Nos. 206, 2; 329; 969; 2270, 8; 3521)
*A commentary on the [[Sayings of the Fathers]]
*''[[Responsa]],'' some of which have been included in the writings of his contemporaries and pupils
*Notes on [[casuistical]] matters
*Commentaries on [[haggadic]] passages
*A treatise on the [[astrolabe]] (Neubauer, l.c. Nos. 834, 7, 10; 2080, 3; 2254, 8).
*According to [[Isaac Adarbi]] (''Dibre Ribot,'' p.&amp;nbsp;64), Joseph was the author also of novellæ on [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi]].

In the mid-6th century, the introduction of [[Buddhism]] from Korea ([[Baekje]]) to Japan resulted in a revival of [[Japanese sculpture]]. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in [[Yamato Province]] (present day [[Nara Prefecture]]) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Hakuhō period|Hakuhō]] periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by almond-shaped eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor [[Tori Busshi]], who was strongly influenced by the [[Northern Wei]] style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The [[Shaka Nyorai|Shakyamuni]] triad and the Guze [[Guanyin|Kannon]] at [[Hōryū-ji]] are prime examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early [[Tang dynasty]], greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long narrow slit eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the [[Avalokiteśvara|Shō Kannon]] at [[Yakushi-ji]] and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.&lt;ref name="stat-asuka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asukanet"&gt;{{cite web

During the [[Nara period]], from 710 to 794, the government established and supported workshops called zōbussho, the most prominent of which was located in the capital [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] at [[Tōdai-ji]], which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, [[lacquer]] and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at [[Kōfuku-ji]].&lt;ref name="stat-nara"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Heian period]] works before the mid-10th century appear heavy compared to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. [[Jōchō]] was the most important sculptor of this time, and he used the ''yosegi'' technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the {{Not a typo|Enpa}}, Inpa and Keiha school. The [[Amida Nyorai]] at [[Byōdō-in]] is the only extant work by Jōchō.&lt;ref name="stat-nara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stat-heian"&gt;{{cite web

Japanese sculpture experienced a renaissance during the [[Kamakura period]], led by the [[Kei school]]. Partially influenced by [[Song dynasty]] China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as a material for the statues. As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to the depiction of Buddhist deities.&lt;ref name="stat-kamakura"&gt;{{cite web

The definition and the criteria have changed since the inception of the term. These sculptures adhere to the current definition, and have been designated national treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into force on June 9, 1951. The items are selected by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] based on their "especially high historical or artistic value".&lt;ref name="bunkapamphlet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; This list presents 136 entries of sculptures, including those from Classical and early Feudal Japan of the 7th-century [[Asuka period]] to the 13th-century [[Kamakura period]], although the number of sculptures is higher, because groups of related sculptures have sometimes been joined to form single entries. The sculptures listed depict Buddhist and [[Shintō]] deities or priests venerated as founders of temples. Some of the most ancient sculptures were imported directly from China.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stbook"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ogawa|Seki|Yamazaki|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Various materials have been used for the sculptures. Although most are wooden, 12 entries in the list are bronze, 11 are [[lacquer]], 7 are made of clay and 1 entry, the [[Usuki Stone Buddhas]], is a stone sculpture. Typically [[hinoki]], [[Torreya nucifera|Japanese nutmeg]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphorwood]] were the woods used for the wooden sculptures. Wooden sculptures were often lacquered or covered with gold-leaf. The smallest statue measures around {{convert|10|cm}}, whereas the Great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura are about {{convert|13|m}} and {{convert|15|m}} high. The objects on the list are located in Buddhist temples, or in museums associated with temples. Some items are located in shrines, as well as in secular museums.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web

[[Nara Prefecture]] is home to the largest number of National Treasure sculptures, with 75 of the 136 entries. Together with the 39 entries located in [[Kyoto Prefecture]], they constitute the bulk of sculptural National Treasures. [[Hōryū-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]] are the locations with the most entries, with 17 and 18 designations respectively.

      <comment>Undid revision 585922887 by [[Special:Contributions/12.88.217.146|12.88.217.146]] ([[User talk:12.88.217.146|talk]])</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">For some years before and around the time of activity of [[Joan of Arc]], a number of vague prophecies concerning a young Maid who would save [[France]] were circulating. The prophecies were attributed to several sources, including St. [[Bede]] the Venerable, Euglide of Hungary, and [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]. Some of these spoke of a Maid who was supposed to come from the "borders of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]]". Since Joan's village was near the border between France and the Duchy of Lorraine in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], at the time many in France believed in her.

During her examination at [[Poitiers]], Joan was reportedly questioned about a recent prophecy attributed, perhaps incorrectly, to [[Marie d'Avignon]] ([[:fr:Marie Robine]])&lt;ref&gt;Warner, p. 24 f.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning an armed woman who was to save the Kingdom. One version of the prophecies had it that the Maid would come forth from an oak wood and would work miracles, although when questioned about this version of the prophecy at her [[Trial of Joan of Arc|trial]], Joan said she did not place any faith in that one. 

[[Retrial of Joan of Arc|Rehabilitation trial]] testimony also brought up the subject of such prophecies. Durand Laxart, Joan's uncle, who accompanied Joan on both of her journeys to Vaucouleurs, reported at the rehabilitation trial that Joan had told him: "Was it not said that France would be ruined through a woman and afterwards restored by a virgin?". Catherine Royer, with whom Joan stayed while at Vaucouleurs on her second visit in January and February 1429, also reported substantially the same thing.

In any case, it is known that such prophecies were widely known in France at around that time and that many in France among the supporters of the Dauphin identified Joan with the Maiden in the prophecies and this identification contributed to her popularity and following.

[[Image:Jiuhuashan yunhai.JPG|thumb|right|315px|A view from Jiuhuashan's Lesser Tiantai peak]]
'''Mount Jiuhua''' ({{zh|s=九华山|t=九華山|p=Jǐuhuá Shān|l=Nine Glorious Mountains}}) is one of the four sacred mountains of [[Chinese Buddhism]]. It is located in [[Qingyang County]] in [[Anhui]] province and is famous for its rich landscape and ancient temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hceis.com/ChinaBasic/Mountains/Jiuhuashan.htm|title=Jiuhuashan|website=www.hceis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the mountain's shrines and temples are dedicated to [[Ksitigarbha]] (known in Chinese as Dìzàng, {{zh|地藏}}, in Japanese as [[Ksitigarbha#In Japan|Jizō]]), who is a [[bodhisattva]] and protector of beings in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell realms]] according to [[Mahayana]] Buddhist tradition. Pious Buddhists often visit Anhui to climb to Greater [[Tiantai]] peak, which is regarded as Jiuhuashan's most important peak, although it is not the tallest.

==History==
[[File:Jiuhuashan-ss.jpg|thumb|200px|Temples at Mount Jiuhua]]
Mount Jiuhua was called Mount Lingyang in [[Han Dynasty]]. It was called Mount Jiuzi (九子山) in Liang and Chen Dynasties of South Dynasties. A legend says that the great poet [[Li Bai]] of [[Tang Dynasty]] travelled here and wrote down "Magic is divided to two branches, sacred mountain generates nine glories." (妙有分二气，灵山开九华). Thus it was named Mount Jiuhua.

JiuHuashan is delicately beautiful which is located in the southeastern part of Chizhou City, in Quingyang County of Anhui Province. The gross area reaches 120 square kilometers, while the protection area reaches 114 square kilometers. Shiwang Peak is the highest one with an elevation of 1342 meters above sea level. Together with Wutai Mountain in Shanxi, Emei Mountain in Sichuan and Putuo Mountain in Zhejiang. Jiuhua Mountain is called one of the four great Buddhist mountains in China. In 719 AD, [[Kim Qiaoque]], a [[Silla]] prince (today's Qingzhou city in South Korea) came to Jiuhua  Mountain and cultivated himself for 75 years. He died at 99 years of age, his corporeal body stayed intact. Because he was very similar in appearance to Dizang Buddhisattva, the monks there believed Dizang Boddhisattva was reincarnated in him, as a result, Jiuhua Mountain became the place to hold rites for Dizang Boddhisatva. During the golden periods of the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were as many as 360 temples and 4,000 to 5,000 monks and nuns. The mountain is not only famous for its Buddhist culture but also noted for its natural landscapes featuring old pines, green bamboo forests, strange rocks, waterfalls, streams and caves.

Mount Jiuhua was originally known as Jiuzi (Nine-Peak) Mountain. But ever since Li Bai, the celebrated poet in the Tang Dynasty wrote of the mountain,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sailing down the Jiujiang River the other day, I saw the Jiuhua Peaks in the distance. Looking like a heavenly river hanging in heaven, Its green water embroidering cotton rose hibiscuses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

the mountain was renamed Jiuhua Mountain. As a popular pilgrimage destination, it was very famous in the southeastern part of China and became one of the four holy mountains of Buddhism. Since its opening in 1979, Jiuhua Mountain, with its abundant Buddhist culture and uniquely attractive scenery, has enjoyed a high reputation in southeast Asia, South Korea and Japan. It is known as the mountain of [[Ksitigarbha|Dizang Buddhisattva]] and for having a large number of whole Buddhist relics. There are 99 peaks in the area, among them Shiwang Peak, Lotus Peak, and others.

{{Buddhism|terse=1}}
'''Madutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "malleability", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyamadutā'' - malleability of mental body (or pliancy of cetisakas)
* ''Cittamadutā'' - malleability of consciousness (or pliancy of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2367-2369}}
:The twofold malleability has the characteristic of the subsiding of rigidity (''thambha'') in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush rigidity. It is manifested as non-resistance, and its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as wrong views and conceit, which create rigidity.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 44, 45) this pair of cetasikas consist in suavity, smoothness and absence of rigidity.

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 130) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: They have the characteristic of suppressing the rigidity of mental factors and of consciousness; the function of crushing the same in both; the manifestation or effect of setting up no resistance; and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as opinionatedness (''diṭṭhi'') and conceit which cause mental rigidity.

The '''New Commandment''' is a term used in [[Christianity]] to describe [[Jesus|Jesus's]] commandment to "love one another" which, according to the [[Bible]], was given as part of the final instructions to [[Disciple (Christianity)|his disciples]] after the [[Last Supper]] had ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref|John|13:2|9}} "And supper being ended...",&lt;/ref&gt; and after [[Judas Iscariot]] had departed in {{Bibleref|John|13:30|9}}.&lt;ref name=Moloney425 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yarbrough215 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Warren487 /&gt;

{{quote|text=Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; A &lt;u&gt;new commandment&lt;/u&gt; I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt; By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. &amp;mdash;{{bibleref|John|13:33-35|9|John 13:33&amp;ndash;35}} ([[Authorized King James Version|KJV]])}}

This commandment appears thirteen times in twelve verses in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name=Warren487 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Bibleref2|John.13:34;15:12;15:17||9}}
*{{Bibleref|Romans|13:8|9}}

*{{Bibleref2|1John.4:7;4:11-12||9}}
*{{Bibleref|2John|1:5|9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, this commandment is interpreted as dual to the [[Love of Christ]] for his followers.&lt;ref name=Moloney425 /&gt; The commandment can also be seen as the last wish in the [[Farewell Discourse]] to the disciples.&lt;ref name=Rich301 &gt;''Imitating Jesus'' by Richard A. Burridge 2007 {{ISBN|0802844588}} page 301&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Scott Hahn]], while the [[Torah]] commanded [[human love]], Jesus commands [[divine love]] for one another that is modeled on his own acts of [[Charity (practice)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius Catholic Study Bible New Testament&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel of John==
The statement of the new commandment by Jesus in John 13:34-35 was after the [[Last Supper]], and after the departure of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]].&lt;ref name=AndreasK149 &gt;''Encountering John: The Gospel in Historical, Literary, and Theological Perspective'' by Andreas J. Kostenberger 2002 {{ISBN|0801026032}} pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt; The commandment was prefaced in John 13:34 by Jesus telling his remaining disciples, as little children, that he will be with them for only a short time, then will leave them.&lt;ref name=AndreasK149 /&gt;

In the commandment Jesus told the disciples: "Love one another; as I have loved you".&lt;ref name=Moloney425 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' (1998) by Francis J. Moloney and Daniel J. Harrington. {{ISBN|0-8146-5806-7}}. Page 425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruce294 &gt;''The Gospel of John'' (1994) by Frederick Bruce. {{ISBN|0-8028-0883-2}}. Page 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after the commandment, and before the [[Farewell Discourse]] the first reference to [[Peter's Denial]]s took place, where Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the cock crow.&lt;ref name=AndreasK149 /&gt;

Two similar statements also appear in chapter 15 of the Gospel of John:&lt;ref name=Yarbrough215 &gt;{{cite book |title=1, 2, and 3 John |last=Yarbrough |first=Robert W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Baker Academic |location= |isbn=0801026873 |page=100 |pages= |accessdate=July 5, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBYkfauh8E4C&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=%22love%20one%20another%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1 Peter===

* [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 Peter 1:22|1 Peter 1:22]]: ... for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.

==Interpretations==
{{Main|Great Commandment}}
The "New Commandment" concerns the love for neighbour and is the second part of the [[Great Commandment#New Testament accounts|Great Commandment]]. Its first part is the love for God, as it is stated also by the first of the [[Ten Commandments]]: "[[Thou shalt have no other gods before me]]".

The "New Commandment", the ''Wycliffe Bible Commentary'' states, "was new in that the love was to be exercised toward others not because they belonged to the same nation, but because they belonged to Christ ... and the love of Christ which the disciples had seen ... would be a testimony to the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles F. Pfeiffer and Everett F. Harrison, eds.|title=''The Wycliffe Bible Commentary''|publisher=Iversen-Norman Associates|location=New York|year=1971|page=341|id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 72-183345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ''novelties'' introduced by this commandment – perhaps justifying its designation as ''New'' – is that Jesus "introduces himself as a standard for love".&lt;ref name=Martins&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Roman Curia|The Vatican]]|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20070506_beatif-madre-carmen_en.html|title=Homily of Cardinal Martins, Antequera, Spain|date=2007-05-06|accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual criterion had been "as you love yourself". However, the New Commandmant goes beyond "as you love yourself" as found in the [[ethic of reciprocity]] and states "as I have loved you", using the [[Love of Christ]] for his disciples as the new model.&lt;ref name=Martins /&gt;

The First Epistle of John reflects the theme of love being an ''[[imitation of Christ]]'', with [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/1 John#4:19|1 John 4:19]] stating: "We love, because he first loved us."&lt;ref&gt;''The People's New Testament Commentary'' by M. Eugene Boring and Fred B. Craddock 2010 {{ISBN|0664235921}} page 335&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Vayeira#Readings#Fourth reading – Genesis 19:21–21:4|Lot in Genesis 21]] and the mission of the Archangel Raphael in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Tobit#Summary|Book of Tobit]] refer to the work of angels in the human earthly life, disguised as a man&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/book.php?book=Tobit&amp;t=1&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse=1 | title = Book of Tobit, chapter 5, verse 4, in the "1611 Kung James Bible"}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Aglicans Christians venerate the [[hierarchy of angels|angels of God]] as [[communion of saints#Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican views|saints]], which for them shall be both human or angelic creatures of God. Among them, the [[guardian angel]] is considered neighbor as the human beings.

'''Para-Scientology''' (or '''Parascientology''') is a branch of [[Scientology]] which deals with all things unknown.

[[L. Ron Hubbard]], founder of the [[Church of Scientology]], defined it this way in the book ''Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought'':
"Para-Scientology includes all of the uncertainties and unknown territories of life which have not been completely explored and explained."&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard, ''Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought'', 1997 paperback edition, pg. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard sometimes used the term to differentiate between things that he considered facts and absolute certainties, and things that were still partially undetermined and on the cutting edge of Scientology research.{{Original research inline|date=November 2008}}
One such example can be found in Hubbard's book ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'':
"In Para-Scientology, there is some evidence that the stomach once produced sufficient life energy to motivate the body without any further 'food', but the body of man and beasts in general is not equipped so today, and of that we are very certain".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Scientology: A New Slant on Life'', pg. 114, 1997 paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=November 2008}}

On other occasions, Hubbard used the term to simply designate basic Scientology concepts that were not fully grasped by beginning Scientologists ([[Clear (Scientology)|pre-clears]]), and must remain "Para-Scientological" to that person until he or she accepts them as fact:
"Some of the classified bodies of data which fall in Para-Scientology are: Dianetics, incidents on the "wholetrack", the immortality of Man, the existence of God, engrams containing pain and unconsciousness and yet all perception, prenatals, clears, character, and many other things which, even when closely and minutely observed, still are not certain things to those who observe them. Such things have relative truth".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://members.chello.nl/mgormez/books/malko/5.htm George Malko - Scientology: the Now Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Para-Scientology'' was also a Hubbard lecture recorded in the 1950s but only released in 2002 as part of the Classic Lecture Series by the [[Church of Scientology]]. It focuses specifically on so-called "[[paranormal]]" subjects from a Scientological perspective, such as witches, ghouls, demons and "the nasty problem of werewolves".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Critical views==
[[George Malko]], in his book ''[[Scientology: The Now Religion]]'', sees the differentiation between Scientology and Para-Scientology as tenuous and relative. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion of a Scientology and a Para-Scientology confounds only because with continued development of various avenues of thinking, it became increasingly difficult to separate what was a concrete Scientological "consideration," and what represented Para-Scientology's "highly specialized system in order to observe them at all." That there is no true division between the two categories is evident from the Axioms, which represent the fundamental substance of all which Scientology believes, and which Hubbard calls "commonly held considerations".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Malko also points out that Hubbard states in 1954's ''The Creation of Human Ability'' that the concept of "[[past lives]]" was only a theory. However, by 1960 and the publication of ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]'', Hubbard was insisting past lives are not a theory,but a fact proven by experiments with his [[e-meter]].

Professor [[Stephen A. Kent]], in his paper ''The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology'' noted that in 1953 (before Scientology became a religion),
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Hubbard began making tentative connections between Scientology and religion. He formulated the awkward category, "Para-Scientology," in which he placed what he called "all greater or lesser uncertainties" such as 'Dianetics, incidents on the 'whole track,' the immortality of Man, the existence of God," as well as "past lives, mysterious influences, astrology, mysticism, religion, psychology, psychiatry, nuclear physics and any other science based on theory' (Hubbard, 1953c: 377). Scientology, Hubbard asserted, was the science of certainty, and Dianetics (like the other beliefs and practices that he mentioned) 'is a specialized thing based on theory which, no matter how workable, requires specialized observation'.... Presumably this distinction makes sense to some of Hubbard's followers". (''Religious Studies and Theology'' journal, Vol.18, No.2 (December 1999) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/kent-fake-religion.htm Scientology - The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology by Stephen Kent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112193301/http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/kent-fake-religion.htm |date=2006-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Parivar Vichora'''(In Punjabi ਪਰੀਵਾਰ ਵਿਛੋੜਾ ਗੁਰੁਦੁਆਰਾ, In Hindi परिवार विछोड़ा गुरुद्वारा) is a [[Gurdwara]] situated on the bank of the river Sirsa. This is where the 10th Guru of Sikh, Guru Gobind SIngh Ji's, family got separated.

==History==
This Gurdwara Sahib signifies the tragic happenings that followed the evacuation of [[Anandpur Sahib]] by [[Guru Gobind Singh]] during the night of 5–6 December 1705 after agreement was reached between the Sikhs and the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] authorities. The Mughal army commander had promised to allow the Sikhs to leave the fort unmolested. On the morning of 6 December 1705, the Guru arrived at this place by the river Sirsa and decided to make a brief halt for the morning religious congregation. However, the Mughal army commander broke the oath taken on Quran and attacked the Guru on the bank of the river. The Sikhs found that the Sirsa river was flooded and swollen by the monsoon rains.

After invoking the blessings of the Almighty, Guru Gobind Singh divided his columns into two. While the part of the force was to engage against the enemy, the others were ordered to get across the river. The Guru followed by a small party of Sikhs, rode their horses into the swollen stream with swords in their hands. Guruji along with his four sons and 50 followers and ladies of the home reached the other bank. Many Sikhs died crossing the river. In the chaos two younger sons of the Guru along with their grandmother, got separated.

Though some Sikhs got safely across the river, Guru Gobind Singh's family got split and were no longer together. There was no time to look for the missing as the army was close by. The Guru with his two elder sons and 40 Sikhs marched towards Chamkaur. Mata Sahib Kaur Ji escorted by few Sikhs reached Delhi, while his aged mother and two younger sons were escorted by a servant Gangu to his village in Morinda.

==Location==
At this holy spot Gurudwara Parivar Vichhora, was built by grateful devotees of the great Guru. It marks the place where the Guru's family was separated from the main body of the Sikhs. The Gurdwara is on a hill top, and commands a panoramic view of the surrounding valley. One has to climb 100 odd steps to reach it.

It is situated near the bank of river Sirsa in the village Majri, Rupnagar, Punjab 140114.&lt;ref name="Google Maps satellite view"&gt;{{cite book|author=Google Maps|title=Google Maps location of Gurudwara|url=https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Majri,+Punjab,+India/@31.0599637,76.591535,332m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x3905563e4d5a556b:0x461cfb9f9522def3!8m2!3d31.0524441!4d76.5921665|year=2018|publisher=Google Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] church, a '''parson''' is the priest of an independent [[parish church]], that is, a parish church not under the control of a larger ecclesiastical or monastic organization. The term is similar to [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] and is in contrast to a [[vicar]], a cleric whose [[revenue]] is usually, at least partially, appropriated by a larger organization. Today the term is normally used for some parish clergy of non-Roman Catholic churches, in particular in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition in which a parson is the [[incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of a [[parish|parochial]] [[benefice]]: a parish [[priest]] or a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]]; in this sense a parson can be compared with a vicar. The title ''parson'' can be applied to clergy from certain other Protestant denominations. A parson is often housed in a church-owned home known as a [[parsonage]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Jennings, ''The Old Rectory: The History of the English Parsonage'', Continuum, 2009; {{ISBN|978-0-8264-2658-1}}&lt;!-- pages?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglicanism==
[[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' says that a ''parson'' is a parish priest with the fullest legal rights to the parish properties:

:A '''parson''', ''persona ecclesiae'', is one that has full possession of all the rights of a parochial church. He is called parson, ''persona'', because by his person the church, which is an invisible body, is represented; and he is in himself a body corporate, in order to protect and defend the rights of the church (which he personates) by a perpetual succession. He is sometimes called the rector, or governor, of the church: but the appellation of parson, (however it may be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use) is the most legal, most beneficial, and most honorable title that a parish priest can enjoy; because such a one, ([[Sir Edward Coke]] observes) and he only, is said ''vicem seu personam ecclesiae gerere'' ("to carry out the business of the church in person")
:: — Bl. Comm. I.11.V, p. *372

Legally, parish priests are separately given spiritual and temporal jurisdiction (they are instituted and inducted). The spiritual responsibility is termed the ''[[cure of souls]]'', and one holding such a cure is a [[curate]], which was also given to parish assistants, or assistant curates. The title ''parson'', however, refers to the temporal jurisdiction over the churches and [[glebe]]. Depending on how the [[tithe]]s were apportioned, a parson may be a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] or a [[Vicar (Anglicanism)|vicar]]. A parish priest who received no tithes was legally a ''perpetual curate'' (to distinguish him from assistant curates). {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

However, historically, many [[Perpetual curate|perpetual curates]], as they were technically parsons (having temporal jurisdiction), preferred to use this latter title. This led to the term ''parson'' having three senses. It could refer to any clergyman who was in charge of the parish church (rectors, vicars or perpetual curates) without distinction; it could, through actual use, refer simply to perpetual curates, or it could, through popular use, refer to any member of the clergy, even assistant curates. An Act of Parliament in 1868, changed the way that parochial clergy were paid, and permitted perpetual curates to be called vicars. This led to the rapid abandonment of the title ''parson'' in favour of ''vicar'', to the extent that now, as previously for parson, the term ''vicar'' is often used for any cleric of the Church of England. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Ireland==
In [[Ulster]], in the early 17th century, every [[parish]] had a [[vicar]] and a parson instead of a [[co-arb]] and an [[erenagh]]. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass (‘serveth the cure’) and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality. As he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal.

However, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in [[Tyrone]]. In the [[Diocese of Clogher (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Clogher]], the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the [[Diocese of Derry and Raphoe|Diocese of Derry]], church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands (‘temporalities’). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual tribute to the bishop. In places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the [[income in kind]] from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the Bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the [[Diocese of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Armagh]] the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof because they received the entire income from the termon lands.

{{History of Iran}}
The '''Qarinvand dynasty''' (also spelled '''Karinvand''', '''Karenvand''', and '''Qarenvand'''), or simply the '''Karinids''' or '''Qarinids''', was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] dynasty that ruled in parts of [[Tabaristan]] ([[Mazandaran province|Mazandaran]]) in what is now northern [[Iran]] from the 550s until the 11th-century. They considered themselves as the inheritors of the [[Dabuyid dynasty]], and were known by their titles of ''Gilgilan'' and ''[[Ispahbadh]]''. They were descended from [[Sukhra]], a [[Parthia]]n nobleman from the [[House of Karen]], who was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 484 to 493.

== History ==
The dynasty was founded by Karen, who in return for aiding the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow I]] (r. 531–579) against the [[Western Turkic Khaganate|Turks]], received land to the south of [[Amol]] in Tabaristan. During the 7th century, an unnamed ruler Qarinvand dynasty was granted parts of Tabaristan by the [[Dabuyids]] who ruled in the area. In 760, the Dabuyid ruler [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]] was defeated, his dynasty abolished and Tabaristan annexed by the [[Abbasids]], but the Qarinvand and other minor local dynasties continued in existence. At this time, a certain [[Vindadhhurmuzd]] is mentioned as the Qarinvand ruler, while his younger brother [[Vindaspagan]] ruled as a subordinate ruler over the western Qarinvand regions, which reached as far as [[Dailam]],{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=201}} a region controlled by the [[Dailamites]], who like the Qarinvands and other rulers of Tabaristan were [[Zoroastrian]]s.

Vindadhhurmuzd, along with the [[Bavand dynasty|Bavandid]] ruler [[Sharwin I]], led the native resistance to Muslim rule and the efforts at Islamization and settlement begun by the Abbasid governor, [[Khalid ibn Barmak]] (768–772). Following his departure, the native princes destroyed the towns he had built in the highlands, and although in 781 they affirmed loyalty to the Caliphate, in 782 they launched a general anti-Muslim revolt that was not suppressed until 785, when [[Sa'id al-Harashi]] led 40,000 troops into the region.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=202}} Relations with the caliphal governors in the lowlands improved thereafter, but the Qarinvand and Bavandid princes remained united in their opposition to Muslim penetration of the highlands, to the extent that they prohibited even the burial of Muslims there. Isolated acts of defiance like the murder of a tax collector occurred, but when the two princes were summoned before [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 805 they promised loyalty and the payment of a tax, and were forced to leave their sons behind as hostages for four years.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=202, 204}}

Vindadhhurmuzd later died in 815, and was succeeded by his son [[Qarin ibn Vindadhhurmuzd]], who along with Sharwin's successor [[Shahriyar I]] was requested by the Abbasid caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] to aid in the [[Arab–Byzantine wars]]. Shahriyar declined the request, while Qarin accepted, and became successful in his campaign against the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=145–156}} Qarin was then bestowed with many honors by Al-Ma'mun. Shahriyar, jealous of Qarin's fame, began annexing some of the latter's territory. In 817, during the reign of Qarin's son [[Mazyar]], Shahriyar, with the aid of Mazyar's uncle Vinda-Umid, expelled the latter from Tabaristan, and seized all his territories.{{sfn|Ibn Isfandiyar|1905|pp=145–156}}

Mazyar fled to the court of al-Ma'mun, became a Muslim and in 822/23 returned with the support of the Abbasid governor to exact revenge: Shahriyar's son and successor, [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]], was defeated and killed, and Mazyar united the highlands under his own rule. His growing power brought him into conflict with the Muslim settlers at [[Amul]], but he was able to take the city and receive acknowledgement of his rule over all of Tabaristan from the caliphal court. Eventually, however, he quarreled with [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]], and in 839, he was captured by the [[Tahirids]], who now took over control of Tabaristan.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}} The Bavandids exploited the opportunity to regain their ancestral lands: Shapur's brother, [[Qarin I]], assisted the Tahirids against Mazyar, and was rewarded with his brother's lands and royal title.

[[Quhyar]], a brother of Mazyar, who had betrayed the latter and chose to aid the Tahirids, who promised him the Qarinvand throne, shortly ascended the Qarivand throne, but was shortly killed by his own Dailamite soldiers because of his betrayal against his brother. Although many scholars considered the death of Quhyar as the fall of the Qarinvand dynasty, the dynasty continued to rule in parts of Tabaristan, and a certain Baduspan ibn Gurdzad is mentioned in 864 as the ruler of the Qarinvand dynasty, and is known to have supported the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Alid]] [[Hasan ibn Zayd]]. However, his son and successor [[Shahriyar ibn Baduspan]] was hostile to Hasan ibn Zayd, but was along with the Bavandid ruler [[Rustam I]] forced to acknowledge his authority.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=209}} Shahriyar's son [[Muhammad ibn Shahriyar]] is later mentioned as the later of the Qarivand dynasty in 917, and was like his father hostile to the Alids.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=210}} Two centuries later, a certain Qarinvand ruler named [[Amir Mahdi]] is mentioned in 1106 as one of the vassals of the Bavandid ruler [[Shahriyar IV]]. After him, no other Qarinvand ruler is known, but they continued to rule until the 11th-century.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}}

'''Sayyida Shirin''' ({{lang-fa|سیده ملک خاتون}}), also simply known as '''Sayyida''', was a [[Bavandid]] princess, who was the wife of [[Buyid]] ruler of [[Rey, Iran|Ray]], [[Fakhr al-Dawla]]. She was the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of Ray during the reign of her son, [[Majd al-Dawla]] (r. 997–1029).

== Origins ==
[[File:Caspian coast of Iran during the Iranian intermezzo.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of northern Iran]]
According to the medieval historian [[Hilal al-Sabi']] and the modern historian [[Wilferd Madelung|Madelung]], Sayyida Shirin was the sister of the [[Bavandid]] ruler [[al-Marzuban]].{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=217}} However, according to the [[Qabus nama|Qabus-nama]] made by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Keikavus]] (who was a neighbor of the Bavandids and of Bavandid descent himself), Sayyida Shirin was the niece of al-Marzuban.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=217}} [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] calls her the son of a certain Bavandid ruler (''[[ispahbadh]]'') of [[Tabaristan]] named Sharwin, who may be the Bavandid ruler [[Sharwin III]], who was the brother of al-Marzuban. Sayyida Shirin also had a brother named [[Rustam Dushmanziyar]],{{sfn|Huart|1993|p=667-668}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=244}} whose son [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] became the founder of the [[Kakuyid dynasty]]. 

Although Sayyida is called a [[Kurdish people|Kurd]] in some sources,{{sfn|Meisami|1999|p=200}} she is generally agreed to be from the Bavand dynasty,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=244}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=217}}{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747-753}} which was then of [[Daylamite]] origin.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=244}} [[Encyclopædia Iranica]] also states that; “it should be remembered that “Kurd” in the sources of the 10th-11th centuries refers to all the transhumants of the [[Zagros]] region including the [[Lors]].”{{sfn|Ch. Bürgel|R. Mottahedeh|1988|pp=265-269}}

== Biography ==
At an unknown date, Sayyida Shirin married Fakhr al-Dawla, and bore him two sons named [[Majd al-Dawla|Abu Taleb Rostam]] and [[Shams al-Dawla|Abu Taher]] in the 990s. Fakhr al-Dawla later died in 997 and was in [[Rey, Iran|Ray]] succeeded by Abu Taleb Rostam, who was given the ''[[laqab]]'' of "Majd al-Dawla". Meanwhile, Abu Taher was given the ''laqab'' of "Shams al-Dawla", and became the ruler of [[Hamadan]]. Since both brothers were in the age of minority, power was assumed by Sayyida. Both sons initially declared themselves independent and assumed the title of [[Shah|Shâhanshâh]], but by 1009 or 1010 at the latest had recognized the authority of their relative [[Baha' al-Dawla]], who controlled [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Iraq]], and abandoned the title.

In 1006 or 1007, with the assistance of his ''[[vizier]]'' Abu 'Ali ibn 'Ali, Majd al-Dawla attempted to throw off the regency of Sayyida. Sayyida, however, escaped to the Kurd Abu Najr Badr ibn Hasanuya, and together with Shams al-Dawla they put Ray under siege. After several battles, the city was taken and Majd al-Dawla was captured. He was imprisoned by Sayyida in the fort of Tabarak, while Shams al-Dawla took to power in Ray. After a year, Majd al-Dawla was released and reinstated in Ray; Shams al-Dawla returned to Hamadan. Power continued to be held by his mother. However, Shams al-Dawla later tried to seize Ray from Majd al-Dawla, but was stopped by Sayyida. Sayyida later died in 1028.{{sfn|Bosworth|1975|p=177}}

[[File:Carte de Strasbourg XIII 01.jpg|thumb|500px|13th-century [[Strasbourg]]]]
The '''''Sister Catherine Treatise''''' ({{lang-de|Daz ist Swester Katrei Meister Eckehartes Tohter von Straezburc}}) is a work of Medieval [[Christian mysticism]] seen as representative of the [[Heresy of the Free Spirit]] of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in Europe. Wrongly attributed to Christian mystic [[Meister Eckhart]] it nevertheless shows the influence of his ideas (as evinced by the full German title), or at least the ideas which he was accused or attributed as having had by the [[Inquisition]]. 

==Mystical dialogue==

The ''Sister Catherine Treatise'' takes the form of a series of dialogues in [[Middle High German]] between a woman (Sister Catherine) and her Confessor (not named but sometimes said to be Eckhart). 

Sister Catherine is determined to find "the shortest way" to God and comes to her Confessor for advice. In the first section her Confessor urges her to rebuke sin and seek purity so as to receive God. She leaves with the intention of doing so.

Years later Sister Catherine returns to speak again to her Confessor, but this time the roles are reversed. Sister Catherine has experienced God and, after falling seemingly dead for three days (in imitation of Christ), reawakens to claim that she has achieved a unity with God which is eternal and which will last throughout this life and beyond. Sister Catherine is presented as having gone further down the road of spiritual development to her Confessor and he finds himself praising her for her Holiness rather than the other way round. 

Sister Catherine speaks of her unity with God in the following terms:

{{quote|I am where I was before I was created: that place is purely God and God. There are neither angels nor saints, nor choir, nor this nor that. Many people speak of eight heavens and of nine choirs. They are not where I am. You should know that everything stated in such a way and presented to people in images is but an incitement to seek God. Realise that in God is nothing but God. You must also understand that no soul may come unto God before it has become God as it was before it was created. No one may come into the naked Godhead except the one who is naked as he was when he flowed out of God. The masters say that no one may enter here as long as he has any attachment to lower things, even if it is only as much as the tip of a needle can carry. (Sister Catherine Treatise: Trans Elvira Borgstaedt. Paulist Press 1986)}}

The rest of the treatise consists of a continued dialogue with the Confessor - often held at a fever-pitch of excitement and emotion - in which both Sister Catherine and the Confessor exchange ideas about God's immanence, the possibility of humanity's union with Him in this life, the role of [[Mary Magdalene]]'s relationship with Christ as his Lover and chief Apostle and the need to recognise the deceptions of the reality and unreality of Union with God i.e. what true Union is as opposed to false Union. Here the treatise is careful to delineate the danger of those who interpret the Free Spirit ideals as carte blanche to commit sinful and/or immoral acts. The treatise finishes with Sister Catherine abjuring the Confessor to strive after higher feats of spiritual understanding, the pupil having become the master (or mistress) and the Confessor needing the guidance of the Sister to achieve union with God.

==Assessment==

The ''Sister Catherine Treatise'' is often cited, along with [[Marguerite Porete]]'s ''[[The Mirror of Simple Souls]]'', as one of the representative literary expressions of the [[Heresy of the Free Spirit]], which held that a divine union with God was possible to people in this life and, more controversially, independently of the ministrations of the Church. Initially attributed to [[Meister Eckhart]] in [[Franz Pfeiffer]]'s ground-breaking edition of the Christian mystic's works in 1857 it is now regarded as not being by him but showing evidence of his thinking, or at least evidence of the Free Spirit movement which Eckhart was accused of adhering to.

Written in a heightened emotional prose which gives the Treatise a slightly hysterical, hallucinatory quality the work espouses a highly feminine approach to the Christian Mystery, with lengthy discussions of the significance of [[Mary Magdalene]] as the true lover of Christ (an element which links it to Porete, some of the alleged beliefs of the [[Cathars]] and the speculations of [[Dan Brown]]) and the figure of Sister Catherine herself emerging as more initiated into the inner spirituality of Christianity than her male counterpart. In it many of the articles of faith of the Free Spirit movement are expressed - a [[neo-Platonic]]/[[panentheistic]] belief in God's immanence in Creation, the possibility of salvation and the [[Unio Mystica]] in this life, the limitations of Church teaching in terms of real mystical insight - and as such it is a valuable document for those in search of understanding the more radical approach to interpreting the Gospels of the Medieval period known as the [[Heresy of the Free Spirit]].

The treatise is the only currently known medieval work which mentions the well-known question of [[How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?|how many angels can stand, or perhaps perch (''siczen''), on the point of a needle]]:  "doctors declare that in heaven a thousand angels can stand on the point of a needle (''tusent selen siczen in dem himelrich uff einer nadel spicz'')."   ''Dancing'' on the point of a needle appears to be a later concept.

==Events of Tasu'a==
The following are the main events of Tasu'a:

===Shemr's entrance to Karbala===
In the forenoon of Tasu'a, [[Shemr]], accompanied by a four thousand-man army, arrived at [[Karbala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Ahmad ibn A'tham]]|first1=|title=Al-Fotooh|volume=5|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ibn Shar Ashoob|first1=|title=Manaqib Ali ibn Abi Talib|volume=4|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ahl-ul-bayt.org/en.php/page,16833A37280.html?PHPSESSID=5c848ee7c51d66d80f644fc360dc0451 | title=A Short Report on Imam’s Movement from Medina until his Martyrdom | publisher=عاشورا | accessdate=29 September 2015 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought a letter from [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] to [[Umar ibn Sa'ad]], telling him to take [[Bay'ah]] from Husayn or fight.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan "&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.al-islam.org/karbala-and-ashura-ali-husayn-jalali/karbala%E2%80%99-0#shimr%E2%80%99s-trick | title=Karbala and Ashura | publisher=Ansariyan Publications | author=Ali Husayn Jalali}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shemr"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.al-islam.org/nafasul-mahmum-relating-heart-rending-tragedy-karbala-shaykh-abbas-qummi/shimr-bin-ziljawshan%E2%80%99s | title=Nafasul Mahmum, Relating to the heart rending tragedy of Karbala' | publisher=Islamic Study Circle | author=Abbas Qumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABWA "&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.al-islam.org/event-taff-earliest-historical-account-tragedy-karbala-abu-mikhnaf | title=The Event of Taff, The Earliest Historical Account of the Tragedy of Karbala | publisher=ABWA Publishing and Printing Center | author=[[Abu Mikhnaf]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe conduct for the children of Umm ul-Banin===
Shemr was one of the [[tribesman]] of [[Umm ul-Banin]]. He was given a guarantee of [[safe conduct]] from Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad for children of Umm ul-Banin in Tasu'a. He asked [[Abbas ibn Ali]] and his brothers to abandon Husayn ibn Ali and obey [[Yazid I|Yazid]]. Abbas didn't accept his safe conduct and answered him: "God curse you and your safe conduct! You give us safe conduct and you do not give safe conduct to the grandson of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] of God? And you are asking us to enter the obedience of the cursed people and those who are children of cursed people?"&lt;ref name="Ansariyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABWA" /&gt;

===Preparing for war===
After rejection of the safe conduct by Abbas and his brothers, Umar ibn Sa'ad ordered his army to attack Husayn's camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Al-Baladhuri]]|first1=|title=[[Genealogies of the Nobles]]|volume=|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]]|first1=|title=Al-Irshad|volume=2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Kharazmi|first1=Al-Muvafaq ibn Ahmad|title=[[Maqtal al-Husayn]]|volume=1|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Husayn ibn Ali understood their intent, he asked his brother to go to them and ask about his plan. Abbas ibn Ali, [[Zuhayr ibn Qayn]], [[Habib ibn Madhahir]] and a few others went and asked them. They answered that our governor ordered us to ask you to Bay'ah him and his rule or fight. Abbas returned to Husayn and said their message. "Go back to them and ask them to give us this evening as a respite till tomorrow so that we may pray to our Lord, supplicate to Him, and seek His forgiveness, for He knows how much I love prayers, the recitation of His Book, the abundance of invocations, and the seeking of His forgiveness", Husayn said to Abbas. Abbas went back to the army and said them the message. Umar Ibn Sa'ad agreed to delay the war until the next day.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABWA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Muqarram"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abd al Razzaq al-Muqarram|title=Maqtal al-Husayn|url=http://www.al-islam.org/maqtal-al-husayn-abd-al-razzaq-al-muqarram/day-nine|year=|publisher=Al-Kharsan Foundation for Publications|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siege of Karbala===
In a [[Hadith]] by [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] it is said: "Ninth of Muharram is the day, when Imam Husayn and his companions were besieged at Karbala by the army of [[Syria]] from all sides and offloaded their luggage. The son of Marjanah (Ubaydullah bin Ziyad) and Umar ibn Sa’ad were pleased at the large number of their army and they deemed Imam and his companions to be weak. They knew that Imam Husayn had no helpers or aides in [[Iraq]]. May my father be ransom upon the oppressed traveler."&lt;ref name="Shemr" /&gt;

==Rituals==
{{main article|Mourning of Muharram}}
[[File:Tasu'a, in Iran (Ardabil).jpg||thumb|360px|The day of Tasu'a, in [[Iran]] ([[Ardabil]])]]

In the days of Ashura and Tasua, Muslims go to mosques and Takiehs or go to mourning ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Fervent and Spiritual Mourning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Fervent and Spiritual Mourning|url=http://old.ido.ir//en/en-a.aspx?a=1390092910|website=old.ido}}&lt;/ref&gt;They recite [[Hadith|Ahadith]] and poems in honor of [[Abbas ibn Ali]].&lt;ref name="presstv"&gt;{{cite web|last1=staff|first1=Writer|title=Millions of Shia Muslims commemorate Tasu’a across world|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/10/11/488529/Shia-Muslims-Iran-Tasua-commemorate-Shia-Imam-Hussein-Karbala-Muharram|website=presstv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a whole, the mourning ceremonies consists of procession, chanting and self-flagellation.&lt;ref name="Banham2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qMTPAPFGXUC&amp;pg=PA737&amp;dq=Muharram+mourning+traditions+of+Tasua&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjayae2wp_WAhXDalAKHSqIABYQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Muharram%20mourning%20traditions%20of%20Tasua&amp;f=false|title=The Cambridge Guide to Theatre|last1=Banham|first1=Martin|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge university|isbn=0521434378|page=737}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest and most common tradition between Muslim is asking wishes from Allah then promise to feed people. In [[Iran]] this tradition is well-established and reaches its climax on Tasua and [[Ashura]] (the 9th and 10th of Muharram) to feed mourners.&lt;ref name="presstv2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/10/11/488529/Shia-Muslims-Iran-Tasua-commemorate-Shia-Imam-Hussein-Karbala-Muharram|title=Millions of Shia Muslims commemorate Tasu’a across world|last1=staff|first1=Writer|website=presstv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ta'zieh as a religious play is an old traditional practice for mourning in some cities and villages.&lt;ref name="The Dialectics of Continuity and Change2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4JFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=traditions+of+Tasua&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN0_Pqy5_WAhVBbFAKHZ5SAGkQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=traditions%20of%20Tasua&amp;f=false|title=Modern Iran: The Dialectics of Continuity and Change|last1=E. Bonine|first1=Michael|last2=R. Keddie|first2=Nikki|date=1981|publisher=State University of New York|isbn=978-0873954655|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants see the [[Ta'zieh]] as a part of ritual mourning and not as a common play where actors have to memorize their scripts. In other words, the actors read from the script.&lt;ref name="Banham2" /&gt;

==Relation with Abbas ibn Ali==
This day is devoted to Abbas ibn Ali in Shia communities, because of his bravery as the standard-bearer of Husayn's army in the [[Battle of Karbala]].&lt;ref name="Sadr"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |author2=Hamid Dabashi |author3=Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr |title= Shi'ism: Doctrines, Thought, and Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VD22-wi4HQAC&amp;pg=PA319|year=|publisher=Sunni press|isbn=|pages=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''temple boy''' ({{lang-th|เด็กวัด}} ''dek wat'') is a boy in [[Thailand]] who lives in a [[wat]] and assists [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]]. 

The temple boys carry the [[alms]] bowls of the monks during the morning alms collection, and subsequently prepare the monks’ food before eating the leftovers themselves. They follow the [[Five Precepts#Ten Precepts|ten precepts]]. Some are sent to become temple boys to acquire [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]]; others, because they are given free room and board; and others to receive [[religion|religious]] and [[morality|moral]] instruction. Some temple boys go on to be ordained as monks themselves.  Temple boys may undertake the formal step of [[śrāmaṇera|sāmaṇera]] ordination as part of their role, depending on their age and local custom.

The '''Temple of Derr''' or '''el-Derr''' is a ''[[speos]]'' or [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Egyptian temple]] in [[Lower Nubia]]. It was built during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]] by [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', Blackwell Books, 1992. p.259&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only rock-cut temple in [[Nubia]] which was constructed by this pharaoh on the right (or east) bank of the [[Nile]] and used to stand at el-Derr.&lt;ref&gt;John Baines and Jaromír Málek, ''Atlas of Ancient Egypt'', Facts on File Publications New York, 1982. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; The temple's unique position "was probably because the river on its approach to the Korosko bend flows in an 'unnatural' southeasterly direction."&lt;ref&gt;Baines and Málek, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; The Derr structure was known in ancient times as 'The ''Temple of Ri'amsese-meryamun'' [Ramesses II] ''in the Domain of Re'' '&lt;ref&gt;Baines and Málek, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; and was dedicated to the god [[Ra-Horakhty]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, ''Discovering Ancient Egypt'', Facts on File, 1993. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars disagree over its precise construction date: the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal states that it was built in the thirteenth year of Ramesses II, presumably to coincide with his first royal jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, John Baines and Jaromír Málek write that the temple of Derr "was built in the second half of the king's reign", likely because its "plan and decoration resembles the Great Temple of Abu Simbel (minus the colossal seated statues against the facade)."&lt;ref&gt;Baines and Málek, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abu Simbel]] was built between Year 24 and Year 31 of Ramesses' reign.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joyce Tyldesley, the Temple of Derr was built by [[Setau]], who is known to have served as Ramesses' [[Viceroy of Kush]] or Nubia between Year 38 to 63 of this pharaoh's reign.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce Tyldesley, ''Ramesses: Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh'', Penguin Books, 2001 paperback, pp.104 &amp; 167&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorations and architecture==

[[Image:Temple of Derr relief of Ramesses II.jpg|thumb|Relief of Ramesses II in the temple of Derr]]
The temple of Derr is more elaborate than the ''speos'' of [[Beit el-Wali]] and "consisted of a sequence of two [[hypostyle]] halls (probably preceded by a forecourt and a [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]) leading to a triple sanctuary where a cult of statues of Ramesses II, Amon-Re, Ra-Horakhty and Ptah was celebrated."&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.259&lt;/ref&gt; When cleaned and restored in modern times, Derr proved to contain unusually bright and vivid relief decorations which contrasted sharply "with the more subdued color tones" from other Egyptian temples.&lt;ref&gt;Baines and Málek, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the temple was dismantled and relocated, along with the Temple of [[Amada]], to a new site.&lt;ref&gt;David, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hobson, Exploring the World of the Pharaohs: A complete guide to Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson 1993 paperback, p.177&lt;/ref&gt; Early travellers visited the original site, and the temple itself was first studied and published by [[Aylward Blackman]]&lt;ref&gt;David, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Aylward M. Blackman, ''The Temple of Derr'', (Cairo 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tridentine Calendar''' is the [[calendar of saints]] to be honoured in the course of the [[liturgical year]] in the official [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Rite]] as reformed by [[Pope Pius V]], implementing a decision of the [[Council of Trent]], which entrusted the task to the Pope.

The text of the Tridentine Calendar can be found in the original editions of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine]] [[Roman Breviary]]&lt;ref&gt;''Breviarium Romanum ex Decreto Sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum'' Apud Paulum Manutium, Roma 1568. Facsimile: Achille Maria Triacca, ''Breviarium Romanum. Editio princeps (1568)'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Città del Vaticano 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] [[Roman Missal]].&lt;ref&gt;''Missale Romanum ex Decreto Sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum Pii V. Pont. Max. editum'' Apud haeredes Bartholomaei Faletti, Ioannem Varisei et socios, Roma 1570. Facsimile: Manlio Sodi, Antonio Maria Triacca, ''Missale Romanum. Editio princeps (1570)'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, Città del Vaticano 1998, {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of both these texts, which included Pius V's revised calendar, was made obligatory throughout the [[Latin Rite]] except where other texts of at least two centuries' antiquity were in use, and departures from it were not allowed. The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Quod a nobis'', which imposed use of the Tridentine Roman Breviary, and the corresponding Apostolic Constitution ''[[Quo primum]]'' concerning the Tridentine Roman Missal both decreed: "No one whosoever is permitted to alter this letter or heedlessly to venture to go contrary to this notice of Our permission, statute, ordinance, command, precept, grant, indult, declaration, will, decree and prohibition. Should anyone, however, presume to commit such an act, he should know that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius05/p5quopri.htm Quo Primum]&lt;/ref&gt; See the article on ''[[Quo primum]]''.

Pius V himself altered his Calendar when, after the victory in 1571 of the [[battle of Lepanto]], he added the feast of Our Lady of Victory. In 1585, [[Pope Sixtus V]] restored the feast of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary, which Pope Pius V had removed. See, below, "Some differences in relation to later editions of the Roman calendar".

==Some of Pope Pius V's alterations of the existing Roman Calendar==
Pius V removed from the existing Roman calendar many mediaeval saints, keeping only about half a dozen who had been canonized after the eleventh century. His calendar did not include Saints [[Joachim]], [[Saint Anne|Anne]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Nicholas of Tolentino]], [[Francis of Paola]], [[Bernardino of Siena]] or [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], nor any anatomical feasts, such as that of the [[Stigmata]] of Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], or the Precious Blood or the Five Wounds of Christ. He removed the word "Immaculate" from the title of the 8 December feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of the Blessed Virgin Mary, abolished the previously existing special Mass for that day, whose Introit and Collect would be restored by [[Pope Pius IX]], and directed that the Mass of the [[Nativity of Mary]] should be used instead, but with the word "Conception" (not "Immaculate Conception") replacing the word "Nativity" when used on 8 December. He raised to the rank of double the feasts of the four Eastern Saints [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], and, while he did not give them the title of Doctor of the Church, he assigned to them the common used for the four Western Doctors, [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]] and [[Ambrose]]. On the other hand, he lowered the ranks of many saints' feasts, in order to allow celebration of Sundays and the ferias of Advent and Lent, for any double feast outranked an ordinary Sunday of the year until St. Pius X (see [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]), and it was not until the reforms of [[John XXIII]] that ferias of Lent and, from 17 to 23 December, those of Advent outranked third-class feasts (which included most of the feasts formerly of Double rank).&lt;ref&gt;John XXIII's [[Code or Rubrics]], 24 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://civitas-dei.eu/cavendish.htm Paul Cavendish, ''The Tridentine Mass'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some differences in relation to later editions of the Roman calendar==
In the Tridentine Calendar, the [[ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite|rank of feasts]] is expressly indicated only if they are ranked as Double or Semidouble, while absence of an indication means that a feast is of the rank of Simple. (For the meaning of these terms see [[Ranking of liturgical days in the Roman Rite]].) This tripartite ranking as Double, Semidouble, and Simple originated in the thirteenth century and, apart from deciding precedence in the case of two celebrations coinciding on the same day (as when a feast of the fixed calendar coincided with a Sunday, or with a feast or [[octave (liturgy)|octave]] whose date depended on that of Easter), was of practical importance more for the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] than for the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

[[Pope Clement VIII]] introduced the rank of Major Double in 1602. This distinction and those of Double of the First Class and Double of the Second Class are absent in the Tridentine Calendar.

While St Pius V reduced the number of feast days, later Popes repeatedly added more and altered the ranking of already existing feasts. Even the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar, which kept significantly fewer feasts than before, still had more than Pius V's Tridentine Calendar. The [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] published the following chart to document the incremental growth of saints' days down to 1907.

Soon after the publication of this 1907 table, [[Pope Pius X]] made a general revision of the rubrics of the calendar, the result of which (with a few additions by [[Pope Pius XI]]) can be seen in [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]]. This was followed by [[Pope Pius XII]]'s simplifying revision of 1955 (see [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]]). Pope John XXIII's [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]] reduced the number of celebrations and completely abandoned the ranking as Doubles, Simples, etc. This calendar is still authorized for use in accordance with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], which states that the [[Tridentine Mass]] was never abrogated. For the 1969 revision, which with subsequent adjustments is in general use in the [[Latin Church]] (the present [[General Roman Calendar]], observed for instance by the Pope himself) see [[General Roman Calendar of 1969]].

The '''Udvada Atash Behram,''' also known as the '''Iran Shah''', "King of Iran",  is a temple in [[Udvada]], [[Gujarat]] on the west coast of India. It is one of the eight [[fire temple]]s (holy place of worship) of the [[Zoroastrian religion]] in the country. The [[Atash Bahram]], meaning "Victorious Fire", is one of the oldest fire temples in India, dated to the eight century, and represents the historical cultural and religious links with Iran. The current temple was built in 1742 by Dinshaw Dorabjee Mistry from [[Bombay]]. The temple structure, built spaciously, is well decorated and contains the Dasturji Koyaji Mirza hall and a museum. The main hall of the temple is accessed through a two-stage staircase. The temple attracts [[Zoroastrian]] pilgrims from all parts of India, Pakistan and from around the world.

==Location==
The Udvada Atash Behram, also called the Iran Shah,{{Sfn|Rose|2014|p=190}} "King of Iran",{{Sfn|Meri|2005|p=877}} is a fire temple of the [[Zoroastrian religion]]; one of the eight in India. It is located in [[Udvada]] (also spelled Udwada) in [[Gujarat]] on the west coast of India. Outside India, [[Yazd]] in Central Iran has the only other Atash Behram. Udvada, a small coastal village, of about {{Convert|2|km2}} area,&lt;ref name=Sagar&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sagar|first= Homai |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091004/spectrum/main5.htm|title=Fire of faith |accessdate=10 April 2015|date=4 October 2009|newspaper=The Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on the southern coast of Gujarat. The village was gifted to the priests by the king of [[Mandvi]].&lt;ref name=Mehta&gt;{{Cite web |last=Mehta |first=Behram |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-fire-temple-at-udvada-is-central-to-parsi-religion-1535653 |title=Fire temple at Udvada is central to Parsi religion |date=24 April 2011 |publisher=DNA India}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approachable by road and rail. It is {{Convert|206|km}} away from [[Mumbai]] towards the north, situated between [[Vapi]] town and [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] on the [[National Highway 8 (India)(old numbering)|National Highway (NH8)]] which passes through Manor. The nearest railway station is also in Udvada which is on the [[Virar railway station|Virar]]-[[Surat railway station|Surat]] section.&lt;ref name=Sagar/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Udvada Fire Temple 1905.JPG|right|thumb|[[Udvada]] Atash Bahram in 1905]]
Udvada Atash Behram is one of the oldest existing fire temples in India, representing the cultural and religious link with Iran.{{Sfn|Rose|2014|p=190}} The Atash Bahram fire was moved from Iran to India in 715, consequent to the migration of [[Zoroastrians]] in [[Greater Persia]] due to the persecution by the [[Islamic]] rulers who conquered that country; those who moved to India are called [[Parsis]];{{Sfn|Hartz|2009|p=59-60}}{{Sfn|Joshi |2012|p=177}}  the earliest link of worship of the sacred fire in Zoroastrian temples is dated to the 4th century BC.{{Sfn|krishnan|2009|p=156}} The Parsis traveled by ship from [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and landed on the Indian coast at [[Diu, India|Diu]]. They then moved along the coast to [[Sanjan (Gujarat)|Sanjan]], where the local [[Hindu]] king, [[Jadi Rana]], gave them asylum and land to settle down but under a few stipulations.{{Sfn|Hartz|2009|pp=59&amp;ndash;60}}{{Sfn|Joshi |2012|p=177}} They settled down in Sanjan and then established their first Atash Bahram, a first-grade fire temple (fire drawn from sixteen sources) in India in 721 by enshrining the holy fire that had been brought from Iran.{{Sfn|Hartman|1980|p=20}} This temple thus created a ''[[silsila]]'', a traditional link, for the Parsi community of Sanjan with Iran. The consecration ceremony involved long and winding rites, which lasted for many months. The temple flourished, the community took firm roots, and it was their only such temple during that period, though as a community they spread to other regions of India.&lt;ref name= Kotwal&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kotwal|first= Firoze M. |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4006324&amp;fileId=S0041977X00127557|title=Some observations on the history of the Parsi Dar-i Mihrs|accessdate=10 April 2015|publisher=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stay in Sanjan lasted for about four centuries till political events took a turn. In 1297, the [[Muslim]] ruler, Sultan Mahmud, invaded Gujarat and occupied the Sanjan area also; during this battle the Parsis had sided with the Hindus but it was a lost cause. The Parsis then took shelter in the [[Bahrot caves]] and kept the sacred fire there for 12 years. As the safety conditions improved, the Sanjan priests then shifted, with the holy fire, to another village known as [[Bansda]], and remained there for 14 years, when pilgrims started visiting the fire shrine.{{Sfn|Hartz|2009|pp=59&amp;ndash;60}}&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iransah|title=Irānšāh|work=Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, one of the pilgrims, Changashah, also known as Changa Asa, of Navsari, who was also a benefactor, who used to travel to Bansda, persuaded the priests of Sanjan to move to Navsari.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;

In 1419, the holy fire was moved by the priests to Navsari, a town near [[Surat]], where they established themselves for more than 300 years (1419 to 1740).&lt;ref name=Mehta/&gt; Due to security concerns created by [[Pindari|Pindharas]] (nomadic robbers), the fire was temporarily moved to Surat, and as the situation eased it was brought back to Navsari.&lt;ref name=Mehta/&gt; The Sanjan priests and the Bhagarias (local priests) of Navsari had a working arrangement to run the sacred fire temple, but this understanding broke down and legal issues ensued. Disturbed by this development, the Sanjan priests moved out of Navsari with their sacred fire, and housed the fire in one of the two agiaris (the first level of fire temples) in [[Bulsar]] (now known as Valsad), {{Convert|32|km}} away from Navsari. Even here the Sanjan priests could not come to amicable terms with the local priests of the agiari and in 1741 they decided to move to Udvada, which was under the Sanjan community.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref name= Hinnells&gt;{{Cite web|last1= Hinnells |first1= John R. |last2= Williams |first2= Alan |url=https://archive.org/stream/ParsisInIndiaAndTheDiaspora/John_Hinnells_Parsis_in_India_and_the_Diaspora_BookFi.org_djvu.txt. |title=Parsis In India And The Diaspora|publisher= I J Routledge , J. Taylor &amp; Francis Group|pp=22,23, 103}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later Zoroastrians built an Atash Behram in Udvada and moved the sacred fire to it;{{Sfn|Hartz|2009|p=61}} it was consecrated by two high priests (dasturs) who had carried the fire from Navsari.&lt;ref name=Mehta/&gt;{{Sfn|Hartz|2009|pp=59&amp;ndash;60}}&lt;ref name= Hinnells/&gt;

The Atash Behram ("Iran Shah fire") is a symbolic representation of the [[Sasanian Empire|Zoroastrian monarchy]] of Iran that was overthrown by [[Arabs]] {{Sfn|Meri|2005|p=877}}), which had been first established at Sanjan in the 90th year of the Yezdezardi era by the first [[Shehenshahi]] Zoroastrian immigrants in India, is now maintained at Udvada by their descendants;{{Sfn|Giara|2002|p=2}} these are nine families of priests who were descendants of the three priests who had retrieved the sacred fire from Sanjan to safety. The presiding High Priest or [[Dastur]] of the temple is chosen by a rotation system among these nine families.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;

To retain the heritage status of the fire temple and the Udvada town, a development plan was initiated in 2007 by the [[Government of India]] and [[Government of Gujarat]] with a fund of [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 15 million. This involved the preservation of the heritage buildings including the fire temple in Udvada without allowing to make it a tourist hub.&lt;ref name=Sagar/&gt;

==Features==
The architect and builder of the temple was Dinshaw Dorabjee Mistry from Mumbai. The temple structure has been built spaciously and well decorated. The main hall of the temple, which is {{Convert|50|x|25|ft}}, is accessed through a two-stage staircase. The flooring in the hall is paved with [[Mintons|Minton tiles]]. A portrait of the [[Zoroaster]] is fixed in the main hall at a vantage position. In the first floor, there is a very large hall of {{Convert|100|x|50|ft}} size. The color scheme, the quality of carpets, and the type of tiles used in the temple have received appreciation from the devotees.{{Sfn|Giara|2002|p=2}} The ''urwisgah'', or place of the rituals for worship, is accessed from the doors on the right at the entrance.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=302}} Within this temple, there are the Dasturji Koyaji Mirza hall and a museum.{{Sfn|Rose|2014|p=190}}

In Sanjan, the holy fire was placed in a traditional "altar-like pillar with hollow top" similar to those used in Iran. In Navasari, the fire was kept in an ''āfrinagān'', which was shaped like a vase. A larger version of this was developed as a model for adoption at all other Atash Bahrams.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;

The ''boi'' ritual involves the enthroning of the (machi) of the fire. It is done with ten sticks of [[sandalwood]] of {{Convert|45|cm}} length each; at other similar shrines the number of sandalwood sticks used are seven of {{Convert|30|cm}} length each.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=305}}

Portrait of important priests and the religious organizations, who have played a significant role in establishing the temple, are fixed on the outer walls of the temple.{{Sfn|Godrej|Mistree|2002|p=302}} The original temple was refurbished by Lady Motlibhai Wadia in 1894.&lt;ref name= Mulchandani &gt;{{Cite news |last= Mulchandani |first=Anil |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/magazine/article1350436.ece?service=print |title=Eternal flame of Gujarat |date=30 November 2012 |newspaper=The New Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rituals==
The first ''boi'' and ''maachi'', the ceremony that accompanies the regular tending of fire five times a day, was offered to the holy fire at the new temple by Dastur Pheroozi's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Parsiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zwvAAAAYAAJ|year=1996|publisher=P. Warden|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilgrimage==
Zoroastrian pilgrims from all parts of India, Canada, Pakistan, and Australia visit the temple on pilgrimage.&lt;ref name=Sagar/&gt; Newly wed couples also visit Udvada on pilgrimage, and on their behalf, their parents offer a ''machi'' (throne of wood to the fire{{Sfn|Kreyenbroek|2013|p=338}}) at the temple.{{Sfn|Kreyenbroek|2013|p=34}}

==Festivals==
The anniversary, known as ''sālgiri'', corresponding to the date of establishing the Atash Behram in Udvada and also in other Atash Bahrams in India, is celebrated every year according to the [[Zoroastrian calendar|Shenshai Zoroastrian calendar]] on the day called ''Ādur'' of the month also called ''Ādur'', the ninth Zoroastrian month and the ninth day of the month&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iransah|title=I Ādur|work=Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;); pilgrims visit not only on the day of the month but also throughout the Ādur month.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt; Apart from the ''salgiri'', the other religious observance held every month is the "Bahrām" day (the twentieth day of the month). The [[Nowruz|Parsi New Year]], normally held in August, is also celebrated here when a large number of devotees flock to the shrine.&lt;ref name=Sagar/&gt;

On festive occasions, the Udvada shrine comes to life with large number of pilgrims engaged in buying sandalwood, flowers and other religious paraphernalia  to offer to the fire.&lt;ref name= Mulchandani/&gt;

The '''Vizsoly Bible,''' also called '''Károli Bible''' was the first [[Bible]] printed in the [[Hungarian language]].&lt;ref name="typographia"&gt;[http://typographia.oszk.hu/html/uk/nyomdak/bornmant_uk.htm The Bornemisza-Mantskovit Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812778.stm Thieves steal treasured Hungarian bible]&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated in the 16th century by pastor [[Gáspár Károli]] and fellow [[Calvinist]]s and was printed in 1590 by Bálint Mantskovit. A copy is kept on permanent display in the Hungarian village of [[Vizsoly]].

==History==
&lt;!--A Hungarian translation of the Bible was already planned by [[Péter Bornemisza]], a prominent Lutheran theologian and author, back when Mantskovit was working for him. It is mentioned in a post script of a letter dated February&amp;nbsp;18, 1580.&lt;ref&gt;Schulek: Bornemisza 373&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;[[Gáspár Károli]], Calvinist pastor in the town of [[Gönc]], began working on the translation in 1586 and finished it three years later. Since it would have been impossible for one person to translate the complete Bible in such a short time, others must have worked on it too; examination of the vocabulary and phrases used suggests that at least four people worked on it but the [[New Testament]] was translated by Károli in its entirety.

Printing began on February 28, 1589 by Bálint Mantskovit who moved his press from [[Galgóc]] to Vizsoly.&lt;ref&gt;Bottyán János: Hitünk hősei, 58.old&lt;/ref&gt; He imported type from the Netherlands and paper from Poland. Mantskovit was of Polish origin, and in a note he asks the reader to overlook the errors he possibly left in the text. When printing began, the full translation was not ready yet, so Károli's manuscripts were taken page by page to Mantskovit by students at Gönc, among them [[Albert Szenczi Molnár]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonc.hu/tortenelem.htm History of Gönc]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 1589 Archduke Ernest and the royal secretary Faustus Verantius accused Manstkovit of printing calendars and other forbidden books, and asked for the press to be confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Protestáns Egyháztörténeti Adattár XI. Bp. 1927&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, [[Sigismund Rákóczi]], the future Prince of Transylvania, to whose estate Vizsoly belonged, denied the accusations and asked to be allowed to finish the printing of the Bible. Thanks to Rákóczi and other powerful nobles supporting the cause, the printing was finished on July&amp;nbsp;20, 1590.&lt;ref name="typographia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Around 700–800 copies of the book were printed during this time.

==The book==
Károli names his sources in the foreword: the [[Vulgata]], the [[Septuaginta]], translations and commentaries by [[Franciscus Vatablus]], [[Sebastian Münster]], [[Santes Pagninus]] and [[Immanuel Tremellius]]; he also used the Hebrew and Greek texts. It is not clear to what extent he utilized earlier, incomplete Hungarian translations; he does refer to those of [[Gáspár Heltai]] and [[Péter Melius Juhász]], and he used the translation of Psalm 74 by [[István Székely]].

The book has 2,412 pages and weighs about 6&amp;nbsp;kg. It consists of three volumes. The first volume, with the coat of arms of Hungary on its cover, includes the first 28 books of the [[Old Testament]], with a table of contents and a lengthy foreword by Károli addressed to “the lords and heroic nobles, God-fearing communities, preachers in Hungary and in Transylvania” and is dated January 1, 1589. The second volume includes the remaining books of the Old Testament, while the third volume is the “New Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ”, including a large folded-in page with Jesus's genealogy.

Károli also included short summaries and commentaries before each chapter, explaining some of the verses with parallels to situations that were well known in the period. For example, to the ''Take off your sandals!'' part he added the following commentary: “Just like the Turks are known to take off their boots when entering their churches; it is done as a sign of respect for the place” &amp;ndash; aspects of Islamic culture were well known in Hungary during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], when the borders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] reached as far as [[Abaúj County]].

Károli was aware that the translation was not without errors, as he wrote in the foreword:&lt;ref&gt;Vasárnapi Újság 1890/38.szám&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I don't doubt that this work of ours, after it becomes known among people, will be envied and slandered. For just as the body is followed by the shadow, virtue, by which I mean good deeds, is followed by envy. And those who are born to slander, since they are unable to do deeds or create works similar to those of others, slander them if they cannot do more harm to them. But I care not for the envy and slanders, for as God and my good conscience are my witnesses, I've done this for nothing else but the glory of God and I had only the strengthening of His house in view.&lt;!--this sounds quite archaic in original, should be written with archaic English but I'm not very good at it--&gt;}}
He asks all Christian readers not to scold him for his errors, but to pinpoint them to him, so that he can correct them. His death shortly after the first publication prevented him from revising his translation. In 1608 a former student, Albert Szenczi Molnár, published a revised edition known as the [[Hanau Bible]].

==The Bibles today==
[[Image:Vizsolyibiblia.jpg|thumb|150px|The Vizsoly Bible, in Vizsoly]]
Only 51 copies of the Vizsoly Bible exist today. Károli himself possessed twenty of them at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Gulyás: Könyvnyomtatás, 178&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty of the fifty-one surviving copies are in Hungary, fourteen are in [[Romania]] (Transylvania), thirteen in Slovakia, two in the [[Czech Republic]], one in [[Austria]] and one in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://parokia.net/helyszini/vizsoly/kozmazsolt.doc A Vizsolyi Biblia hagyatéka és örököseinek kötelezése] (.doc)&lt;/ref&gt;

Original Vizsoly Bibles reach a high price at auction. On November 28, 2003 an almost intact copy was sold at a Budapest auction for 12&amp;nbsp;million forints (53,571 USD),&lt;ref&gt;Calculated using the currency rate on November&amp;nbsp;28, 2003 on oanda.com&lt;/ref&gt; although experts assessed its value at 25–30&amp;nbsp;million forints;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20031128tizenket.html&lt;/ref&gt; on another auction in London it reached that price in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberpress.sopron.hu/article_plain.php?id=8288 CyberPress.Sopron]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 an Old Testament in good condition was auctioned for 2,2 million&amp;nbsp;forints.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mitortent.hu/atiranyit/207133/vizsolyi-biblia-22-millio-forintert.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, 28,000&amp;nbsp;copies of the Bible were reprinted.

A copy has been exhibited in the church of Vizsoly since October&amp;nbsp;31, 1940. After several pages had been stolen, the book was then secured in a glass display case. On February&amp;nbsp;10, 2002 it was stolen again, and found in September 2003 in a neglected building in [[Komárno]], [[Slovakia]]. It is occasionally lent for exhibitions and was on display in the House of Tokay Wines in [[Tokaj]] between August&amp;nbsp;13 and September&amp;nbsp;3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boon.hu/hirek/BORSOD-ABAUJ-ZEMPLEN/cikk/a-vizsolyi-biblia-tokajban/cn/haon-news-FCUWeb-20080808-0759499334]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''vāhegurū'' is [[folk etymology|traditionally explained]] as being composed of ''vāhe'' "wondrous", ''gu'' "darkness", and ''ru'' "light", together said to carry the meaning - The wondrous Lord who dispells the darkness of ignorance and bestows the light of truth, knowledge and enlightenment.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The word ''Vaheguru or Waheguru'' is also used in Sikhism as a main [[mantra]], called {{lang|hi|gurmantra}} or {{lang|pa|gur mantar}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12112">'''Xoán M. Paredes''' ({{IPA-gl|ʃo̯aŋ paˈɾeðe̝s|lang}}; born in 1975) is a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] [[geographer]], teacher and ordained [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|druid]] (head of the organized Galician druidic movement).

Paredes is a [[Licentiate (degree)#Spain|''licenciado'']] in Geography by the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (Galicia), where he studied under the direction of [[Carlos Ferrás Sexto|Carlos Ferrás]]. He completed his [[MPhil]] thesis at [[University College Cork]] (Ireland), under the supervision of [[Patrick O'Flanagan]].

During his stay in Ireland (1999-2010), Paredes worked as a teaching and library assistant at UCC, and collaborated regularly with the Irish Centre for Galician Studies and the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]].

He currently teaches social sciences and modern languages in the private sector,&lt;ref&gt;Xoán at ''[http://xoan.educica.com Centro de Iniciativas Culturais e Académicas]'' (last access August 08, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; while he remains involved in a number of [[grassroots]] organisations and projects. He is a former academic member and secretary of the [[Galician Institute for Celtic Studies]]. Paredes has been responsible for the organisation of academic seminars and conferences and he is a regular name in the discussions about [[Celtic nations#Iberian Peninsula|Celtic Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://adiante.gal/de-novo-o-celtismo-enxergar-galiza-como-centro/ Paredes as one of the authorities on contemporary Galician Celtic studies]'' (28 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dovigo Paredes Benozzo conference in N.Portugal.jpg|600x200px|thumb|right|Dr Maria Dovigo (left), Xoán Paredes (centre) and Prof. Francesco Benozzo (right). Pitões das Júnias (Montalegre) conference on Celtic culture, Portugal, April 2016.]]

==Research==
Paredes has conducted research in the fields of [[spatial planning]] and [[cultural geography]], with a focus on [[language geography|geolinguistics]], [[Atlantic Europe]] and cultural landscapes. He has helped in defining the concept of [[cultural landscape]] as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"... the environment modified by the human being in the course of time, the long-term combination between anthropic action on this environment and the physical constraints limiting or conditioning human activity. It is a geographical area – including natural and cultural resources – associated to historical evolution, which gives way to a recognizable landscape for a particular human group, up to the point of being identifiable as such by others."''&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, X.M. (2015) "A utilidade do celtismo. Celticidade galaica no S.XXI". Proceedings of ''Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portuguesas 2012-2014'', DTS and SAGA. p. 175-190.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, X.M. (2015): “Nem ordem nem progresso para o nosso território. O (des)ordenamento territorial na Galiza”. ''Revista Inter. Interdisc. INTERthesis'', v.12, n. 12, Universidade Federal de Sta. Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil, pp. 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like a number of other previous authors such as [[Otero Pedrayo]], Paredes links his native Galicia to a genuinely Atlantic culture despite being part of a Mediterranean [[sovereign state|state]] (Spain). In doing so, he identifies a cultural landscape common to Atlantic (namely Celtic) Europe mainly based on the settlement pattern, use and shared perception of the [[Sociology of space#Third Space|lived space]].

Following on [[John T. Koch|John T. Koch's]] and [[Barry Cunliffe|Barry Cunliffe’s]] “Celtic from the West” postulates,&lt;ref&gt;Cunliffe, B. and Koch, J.T. (2012) ''Celtic from the West: Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature''. Oxbow books.&lt;/ref&gt; Paredes supports the [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory|Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm]], thus coinciding with [[Francesco Benozzo]] when locating the origins of [[Celts|Celtic Culture]] in north-west [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Benozzo, F. and Alinei, M. (2007): "[http://www.continuitas.org/texts/alinei_benozzo_area-gallega.pdf A área galega na prehistoria lingüística e cultural de Europa]", in ''A Trabe de Ouro'', no. 71, p. 13-39, Santiago de Compostela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2016) "[https://www.diarioliberdade.org/entrevistas/cultura-m%c3%basica/60709-f-benozzo-a-galiza-e-o-norte-de-portugal-s%c3%a3o-a-origem-da-celticidade-europeia.html F. Benozzo: 'A Galiza e Norte de Portugal são a origem da celticidade europeia']", interview with Francesco Benozzo in ''Diário Liberdade'' conducted by X.Paredes (last access August 08, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; Once again, Paredes considers that there is a particular Celtic cultural landscape (although presenting variations in scale) which  demonstrates in itself a social and cultural unity and continuity.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, X.M. (2017) ''[https://milesio.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/i-can-see-my-hillfort-from-here/ "I can see my hillfort from here"], personal site (last access July 30, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding planning and territorial management, Paredes defends a deep restructuring of the Galician official administrative jurisdictions, considered to be the result of forced foreign (Spanish) intervention and therefore in disarray with the traditional – and still operating at a popular and psychological level – Galician territorial tiers. His research also criticises the governmental improvisation and lack of strategic planning in Galician territorial implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Paredes, X.M. (2007) "[https://milesio.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/conclusions.pdf Conclusions]", ''Territorial management and planning in Galicia: From its origins to end of Fraga administration, 1950s – 2004''. MPhil Thesis, Dept. of Geography, University College Cork, Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2016) "[http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/11582/galicia-precisa-dun-modelo-territorial-de-aqui-a-10-20-30-ou-mais-anos-vista/ Galicia precisa dun modelo territorial de aquí a 10, 20, 30 ou máis anos vista]", interview with Xoán Paredes in ''Praza Pública'' conducted by Marcos Pérez Lema (last access August 08, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Paredes is the current head of the ''[http://www.durvate.org Irmandade Druídica Galaica]'' (Pan-Galician Druidic Fellowship), an officially registered religious organisation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://maper.mjusticia.gob.es/Maper/DetalleEntidadReligiosa.action?numeroInscripcion=022549 Detalle de entidades religiosas]", official record from the Spanish Ministry of Justice (last access August 09, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; He is therefore a believer in [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|reconstructionist Druidry]], although following an orthodox approach unlike most contemporary neo-druidic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Milésio, X. (2017) "[https://durvate.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/druids-and-druidry-in-the-21st-century-idg.pdf Druids and Druidry in the 21st century]", in ''A Revista da Tradição Lvsitana'', n. 3, Assembleia da Tradição Druídica Lusitana. p. 66-74.&lt;/ref&gt; In these contexts the initiated name of ''Milésio'' is often used in reference to the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]].

As a religious figure alone, he has appeared in national and international media on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://praza.gal/movementos-sociais/14021/non-so-catolicos-en-galicia-hai-277-lugares-de-culto-doutras-confesions/ Non só católicos: En Galicia hai 277 lugares de culto doutras confesións]", in ''Praza Pública'', 13 April 2017, accessed 26 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2017) “[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTvH3aE7HPw Galicia and Druidry]”, interview in ''Spectacular Spain'' (S01 E06), [[Channel 5 (UK)]] (first aired 05/05/17), conducted by [[Alex Polizzi]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melide, R.

=== Political views ===
In his works, mostly in his essays and publications on social media, Paredes is an advocate for [[social justice]] and often associates himself with [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] positions. Likewise, he is a strong supporter of full [[Galician nationalism|Galician independence]] from Spain.

'''Yativṛṣabha''', also known as '''Jadivasaha''',  was a [[mathematician]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] monk. He is believed to have lived during the 6th century, probably during 500-570. He lived and worked between the periods of two great [[India]]n mathematicians, [[Aryabhata]] (476 – 550) and [[Brahmagupta]] (598-668). He wrote the book named ''Tiloyapannatti'' which describes [[cosmology]] from the point of view of Jain religion and philosophy. "The work also gives various units for measuring distances and time." [[Tiloya Panatti]] postulated different concepts about [[infinity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1676">The '''Zarmihrid dynasty''' was a local dynasty of [[Tabaristan]] which ruled over parts of the mountainous areas of the region since the reign of [[Sasanian]] king [[Khosrau I]] to 785.

The family claimed its origin from a powerful [[House of Karen|Karen]] lord named [[Sukhra]], a descendant of [[Kaveh the blacksmith]], the national hero of Iran, and who was one of the leading nobles of the empire during the reign of [[Balash]] and [[Kavadh I]]. According to a traditional story, Sukhra left two children, Karin and [[Zarmihr Karen|Zarmihr]], who helped [[Khosrau I]] protect the eastern borders of his empire when it was invaded by [[Turkic people|Turkic nomads]]. Karin was rewarded with land in the south of [[Amol]], and was given title of [[Ispahbadh]], thus starting the [[House of Karen|Karen dynasty]] of [[Tabaristan]]. Zarmihr was rewarded with parts of [[Tabaristan]] and was given the title of [[Marzban]] and Masmughan. Eastern Tabaristan was mainly divided between the [[House of Karen|Karenids]], the Zarmihrids and the [[Marzban]] of Tomisha.

In 783, the [[House of Karen|Karenids]], along with the [[Bavand dynasty|Bavandids]] and the Zarmihrids revolted against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the alliance was, however, defeated in 785, and thus the Zarmihrids disappeared from history afterwards.
