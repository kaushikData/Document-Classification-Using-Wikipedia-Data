The '''American Airlines Arena''' is a sports and entertainment [[arena]] located in [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] [[Miami]], [[Florida]] along [[Biscayne Bay]]. It was constructed beginning in 1998 as a replacement for the [[Miami Arena]] and designed by the architecture firms [[Arquitectonica]] and [[360 Architecture]]. The Arena is home to the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]].

The American Airlines Arena is directly served by the [[Miami Metrorail]] at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] station via free transfers to [[Metromover]] Omni Loop, providing direct service to [[Freedom Tower (Metromover station)|Freedom Tower]] and [[Park West (Metromover station)|Park West]] stations. The Arena is also within walking distance from the [[Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre (Metrorail station)|Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre]] Metrorail station.

The American Airlines Arena has 2,105 club seats, 80 luxury suites, and 76 private boxes.  The '''Waterfront Theater''' is  Florida's largest theater which is housed within the arena, that can seat between 3,000 and 5,800. The theater can be configured for [[concerts]], family events, [[musical theatre]] and other stage shows. [[American Airlines]] which has a hub at [[Miami International Airport]] maintains the American Airlines Arena Travel Center at the venue.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/aboutUs/whereWeFly/tickets/tc_MIA.jsp Miami And Coral Gables, FL Travel Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406052306/http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=%2FaboutUs%2FwhereWeFly%2Ftickets%2Ftc_MIA.jsp |date=2009-04-06 }}." ''[[American Airlines]]''. Retrieved on April 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The airline also holds the naming rights for another NBA venue, the [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[Dallas Mavericks]], which opened in 2001.

==History==
The American Airlines Arena opened on December 31, 1999 and its construction cost was $213 million. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The American Airlines Arena was inaugurated with a concert by [[Gloria Estefan]].  Two days later, on January 2, 2000, the Miami Heat played its first game in the new arena by defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] 111–103.

[[Image:AAArena Night.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The main façade of the arena at night]]
As part of its sponsorship arrangement, [[American Airlines]] had a giant aircraft painted atop the arena's roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design is visible from airplanes taking off and landing at [[Miami International Airport]], where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called "Flagship Lounges", a trademark originally used for American's premium-class lounges at certain airports.

Local sportscasters often refer to the arena as the "triple-A". Some sports reporters on the local news stations such as [[WSVN]] have referred to the arena as "A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;" (A cubed). The arena is known for its unusual [[scoreboard]], designed by Artist Christopher Janney. Drawing on the underwater anemone forms, the scoreboard also changes colors depending on the atmosphere. For concerts in an arena configuration, end stage capacity is 12,202 for 180° shows, 15,402 for 270° shows, 18,309 for 360° shows. For center stage concerts the arena can seat 19,146.

The Miami Heat has not had to pay to use the $357-million venue, which sits on $38 million of county land; the county has paid $64 million in operating subsidies. "It was never a good deal," says former Miami-Dade Commissioner Katy Sorenson, who opposed the new arena in 1996. "There are certain politicians who just get stars in their eyes and don't really think about what the real cost is going to be."

[[WTVJ]], the city's NBC owned-and-operated station in Miami, had their Downtown Miami Studios in the back of the arena from 2001 till 2011.

Despite American Airlines' logo change, American Airlines Arena still uses the airline's old logo.

==Accessibility ==

===Transportation===
[[File:American Airlines Arena, June 2015.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|The arena as seen from [[Freedom Tower station]].]]
Traffic congestion after events can cause delays for those who choose to drive to the arena. Visitors to the American Airlines Arena are encouraged to take [[Metrorail (Miami-Dade County)|Metrorail]], [[Metromover]], or [[Metrobus (Miami)|Metrobus]], as parking can be scarce and expensive. Metromover's [[Freedom Tower station]] is located two blocks west of the arena. The nearest Metrorail stations are [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] and [[Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre (Metrorail station)|Historic Overtown]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">In [[ice hockey]], a '''backhanded shot''' (or backhander) is a shot taken from the backside of the [[Hockey stick|blade]]. This type of shot is often used on [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaways]], penalty shots and in shootouts and is used for deking. Compared to a forehand shot, it is less accurate, less powerful, but more confusing to goaltenders. It is also used when a player can not pass the puck to someone who is facing the outside bend of the stick.

The setup of this shot begins with the puck on the backhand heel side of the hockey stick. The puck location at this point will be even with or on the outside of the skate opposite of the intended direction of the shot. There will be a weight transfer from one skate to the other, also in the shot direction, when shot commences. At this time the puck will slide along the blade from the heel towards the toe with the eventual release of the puck toward the net. With a backhand shot it is much easier to release the puck from the middle of the blade, rather than the toe, because when shooting backhand the curve is in the opposite direction. The shooter does have some control over the direction of the backhand shot -- by pointing the stick blade during the follow through, the player can direct the action of the puck. This shot can obviously be used with a straight stick, but can have different shot results.

'''Breese Stevens Municipal Athletic Field''' is an athletic field owned by the city of [[Madison, Wisconsin]] and operated by Big Top Baseball. Located eight blocks northeast of the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] on the [[Madison Isthmus]], it is the oldest extant masonry grandstand in Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The field is named in honor of [[Breese J. Stevens]] (1834–1903), a mayor of Madison and a [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] regent, on the wishes of his widow who sold the land to the city. This complex is a Madison Landmark and was nominated by the Madison Trust{{clarify|nominated for what?|date=September 2015}} in 1995. It was accepted for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and the Wisconsin State Register of Historic Places by the Wisconsin Historic Preservation Review Board on November 21, 2014.

Breese Stevens Field is home to Edgewood College teams; Madison East High School teams, the [[Madison 56ers]] amateur soccer team; and the professional Ultimate frisbee team, the [[Madison Radicals]]. It has hosted [[Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association]]'s girls' soccer tournaments and an exhibition match of Australian Football. The field has also hosted ice skating, boxing, wrestling, track and field, [[midget car]] racing, rodeos, circuses, [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] competitions, concerts, and fraternal and religious gatherings.

== History ==

===Acquiring the park===
Addressing the concern that Madison's sports facilities were insufficient, the city council began efforts to establish a new athletic field in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;"Plan Joint City, School Athletic Field", ''The Capital Times'', August 21, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; After first trying to obtain the land by donation, a joint committee of the council and the Association of Commerce considered sites such as Olbrich Park and what is today's Georgia O'Keeffe Middle School playground.&lt;ref&gt;"Engineers Draw Map of New Athletic Field", ''The Capital Times'', August 22, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; The council ultimately selected a block of 18 lots fronting East Washington Avenue and bounded by Mifflin, Brearly and Paterson streets. The site also had the advantage of being midway between Central High School and [[Madison East High School|East High School]]. The property was owned by the widow of Breese Stevens.&lt;ref&gt;"Committee To Work For City Athletic Field", ''The Capital Times'', January 13, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; To help raise money for the project, [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] Justice [[Burr W. Jones]] consented to the selling of property at Livingston and East Washington that he had previously donated to the city as a playground, on condition the new athletic field be named for him.&lt;ref&gt;"Athletic Field On East Side Is New Plan", ''The Capital Times'', April 17, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 1923, the city council acceded to Mrs. Stevens's terms that the field be named for her late husband instead, and purchased the property for $35,000.&lt;ref&gt;"Council Votes to Buy Municipal Athletic Field", ''The Capital Times'', September 29, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
The city of Madison built the brick grandstand in 1925. The original grandstand, designed by the Madison architectural firm of [[Claude and Starck]] in the [[Mediterranean Revival Style Architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] style, was constructed from 1925 to 1926 and dedicated on May 5, 1926. The stone wall surrounding the perimeter was built in 1934 as a project of the [[Civil Works Administration]] using quarry rock from Madison's Hoyt Park. The concrete bleachers were also built in 1934, and the wooden press box was added in 1939. Three heating units were installed in 1945, and two years later the field's first electric scoreboard was erected.

The first night baseball game in Wisconsin was held at the field on July 7, 1930, resulting in a defeat of the California Owls, a team that toured with its own floodlights.&lt;ref&gt;"Blues Battle Owl Nine in Night Game", ''The Capital Times'', July 7, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance was impressive enough that the field was outfitted with lights the next year. Until the mid-1960s, the field was the only city park with floodlights.

===Sporting events===
Upon its inception, Breese Stevens Field became the premiere site for Madison's major athletic events outside the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]]. A multi-purpose facility with a cinder track, the field was employed year-round for sports, ranging from marbles tournaments&lt;ref&gt;"30 Champions of School Mibs To Enter City Finals Saturday", ''The Capital Times'', April 30, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[National Football League]] games.

====Baseball====
Breese Stevens Field was the home of semi-professional baseball team the Madison Blues from 1924 to 1942. Administered by the Madison Athletic Association and captained by manager Eddie Lenehan,&lt;ref&gt;"Eddie Lenehan Signed to Manage Madison Club", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', April 9, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; the Blues played in various leagues, joining the Wisconsin State League in 1928, and the Wisconsin-Illinois League four years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Madison Blues Join Nine-Team Baseball Circuit", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', April 19, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; They won the championship of the newly formed Tri-State League in 1938, defeating the [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] Chairs.&lt;ref&gt;"Blues Clinch Title in Tri-State With Room to Spare", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', September 6, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; They joined the [[Three-I League]] in 1940.

The field also held special exhibition games with major league teams such as the [[Chicago Cubs]],&lt;ref&gt;"Blues Hold Cubs to 1 to 1 Tie Through Eight Innings", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', July 12, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chicago White Sox]]&lt;ref&gt;"White Sox Lambast Blues, 13-3", ''The Capital Times'', August 10, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[St. Louis Browns]],&lt;ref&gt;advertisement, ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 26, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to games against [[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] teams and traveling clubs like the [[House of David (commune)|House of David]].&lt;ref&gt;advertisement, ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 16, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 legendary ace pitcher [[Satchel Paige]] of the Negro Leagues' [[Kansas City Monarchs]] defeated the Industrial League All-Stars 14-5.&lt;ref&gt;"Monarchs Crush All-Stars, 14-5", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', July 18, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warren Spahn]], later the star left-handed pitcher for the [[Milwaukee Braves]], took the Breese mound many times in 1941 as a member of the visiting [[Evansville, Wisconsin|Evansville]] Bees. Although he was known as a University of Wisconsin football player, [[Elroy "Crazy Legs" Hirsch]] belted a grand slam home run in an exhibition game/war bond rally in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;"'Crazy Legs' Blasts Home Run in Fifth With Bases Loaded", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 27, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 the New York Yankees held a three-day tryout camp at Breese.&lt;ref&gt;"Bobby Mattick Will Conduct Yankee Camp", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', August 10, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1932 the Madison city council opened the field's gates to amateur baseball, allowing twenty teams in two leagues to play free games on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;"No Foolin' Now" column by Henry McCormick, ''Wisconsin State Journal'', May 27, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; The diamond was also used by the [[Wisconsin Badgers baseball|University of Wisconsin Badger baseball]] team, and the Madison Industrial League, which formed in 1943.

National league [[softball]] games were first played there in 1933, with Madison defeating [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin|Beaver Dam]], 21-1.&lt;ref&gt;"Madison is 21-1 Victor in Opening Softball Contest", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', May 23, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls' softball games were held as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin State Journal'', August 20, 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Football=====
High school football games were a staple of the field's schedule, with nearly all local high school home games played there. For many years Madison East and Central High Schools made a tradition of facing off on [[Armistice Day]].&lt;ref&gt;"A part of history will die when Breese Stevens falls", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 6, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only three [[National Football League]] games were played at Breese: In 1927 the [[Milwaukee Badgers]] were beaten by the [[Duluth Eskimos]], 32-0.&lt;ref&gt;''Stevens Point Journal'', October 18, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 legendary halfback [[Red Grange]] helped his team, the [[Chicago Bears]], defeat the [[Minneapolis Red Jackets]], 19-6.&lt;ref&gt;"Grange Wins and Draws", ''Decatur Herald'', September 23, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 star fullback [[Ernie Nevers]] led his [[Chicago Cardinals]] to trounce the Chicago Mills, 25-0.&lt;ref&gt;"Cardinals Swamp Mills, 25 to 0", ''The Capital Times'', September 17, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

High school football returned in 2015, when Madison East resumed playing its varsity home games at the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/sports/high-school/football/prep-football-madison-east-football-returns-to-historic-breese-stevens/article_0c2e22d0-bd09-5e6a-aaa3-996fbf5ebe30.html|title=Prep football: Madison East football returns to historic Breese Stevens Field on Friday night|last=Masson|first=Jon|date=|work=madison.com|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other sports====
[[Jesse Owens]], gold medalist sprinter of the [[1936 Berlin Olympics]], ran in three exhibition races at the field in 1938 following a Madison Blues baseball game.

The Madison Stampede rodeo event was held over six days in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;"Madison Merchants Feature Special 'Stampede' Bargains", ''The Capital Times'', July 12, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 midget auto races were held before being banned the next year over concerns of noise and damage to the field's track.&lt;ref&gt;"Council May Shelve Midget Race Request," ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 18, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium hosted WIAA soccer tournaments from 1989 to 2002, and was also the home field for the Madison East and Madison La Follette high school teams.

Since 2013, the [[Madison Radicals]] of the [[American Ultimate Disc League]] (AUDL) have played their home games at the field.  The AUDL championship weekend will be held at Breese Stevens Field for the second time, on August 11-12, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/sports/madison-radicals-open-home-season-saturday-at-breese-stevens-field/article_977fbf36-2391-559f-93f0-12d04b4324ab.html|title=Madison Radicals open home season Saturday at Breese Stevens Field|last=Polzin|first=Jim|date=|work=Wisconsin State Journal|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2019, [[Forward Madison FC]] will begin play at the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/sports/soccer/it-s-official-madison-pro-soccer-team-will-join-usl/article_aadac090-87fa-5d69-a583-6d4cac48d5cf.html|title=It's official: Madison pro soccer team will join USL Division III league as founding member in 2019|last=Milewski|first=Todd D.|date=|work=Wisconsin State Journal|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and revival===
By the late 1960s, Breese Stevens Field lost its status as the city's premier athletic complex as modern facilities, such as [[Mansfield Stadium]], began to appear in suburban Madison.

On August 3, 1968, a weekly teen dance held at Breese broke out in racially charged fights, with the violence escalating outside when a black teenager was struck by a car that was then attacked. The "Breese Stevens incident" prompted criticism of Madison police, and led to a city investigation of local race relations.&lt;ref&gt;"Madison Stares At Own Racism", ''The Capital Times'', May 2, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Breese further showed its age in the 1970s, proposals were made for the city to use the property for other facilities. In 1972 Madison Mayor [[William Dyke|Bill Dyke]] supported placing a long-anticipated civic auditorium there.&lt;ref&gt;"Full Review Urged on Auditorium Sites", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', March 2, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later the city removed legal obstacles to making the field part of a planned East Washington Avenue campus for [[Madison Area Technical College]], but support for site dropped.&lt;ref&gt;"City Clears Way to Give Breese Field to MATC", ''The Capital Times'', June 4, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Support fades for MATC site", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', August 29, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1979 estimate for restoring the facility was put at $240,000.&lt;ref name="The Capital Times 1981"&gt;"Breese Stevens stands to come down", ''The Capital Times'', June 5, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the city council voted to allocate $60,000 to demolish the grandstand and shore up the exterior wall and Mifflin Street bleachers. "It's a matter of liability,' said Parks Department Superintendent Dan Stapay. "We've got letters on file dating back to 1967 that warn of structural problems."&lt;ref name="The Capital Times 1981"/&gt;

A public outcry led instead to the establishment of the field as a soccer venue in 1982. Minor league baseball returned to Breese on April 27, 1982, when the [[Madison Muskies]] made their debut there before adopting Warner Park as their home field.&lt;ref&gt;"Muskies get 'A' for debut", ''The Capital Times'', May 6, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 the city council voted to allocate $230,000 to gradually restore the park by fixing the grandstand roof, sagging walls and broken toilets.&lt;ref&gt;"New life for an old ballpark", ''The Capital Times'', March 25, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial turf replaced the original grass field in 2014.

'''Canyons Resort''' was one of three [[Alpine skiing|alpine]] [[ski resort]]s located in [[Park City, Utah|Park City]], [[Utah]]. Prior to 2015, there were 19 [[chairlifts]], {{convert|4000|acre}} of skiable terrain and an average of {{convert|355|in}} of snow each winter, making Canyons the largest ski and snowboard resort in [[Utah]]. The base area is located 32 miles (51&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[Salt Lake City International Airport]], accessed via [[Interstate 80 (Utah)|Interstate 80]], and is four miles (7&amp;nbsp;km) from Main Street in Park City, along [[Utah State Route 224|State Route 224]].

In the summer of 2010, Canyons was significantly upgraded by Talisker Corporation in order to compete with the other nearby resorts. In 2013, Talisker and [[Vail Resorts]] signed a 50-year lease for Vail to run the resort operations. One year later, Vail Resorts purchased neighboring [[Park City Mountain Resort]] and merged the two resorts via an interconnect [[Gondola lift|gondola]], re-branding as '''Park City''' at that time. The former Canyons base area was then renamed as '''Canyons Village at Park City'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-trb-utah-park-city-ski-resort-20150729-story.html|title=Goodbye Canyons, hello Park City: Utah ski resort on track to be biggest in U.S.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 29, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ski Beach.JPG|thumb|Ski Beach with Orange Bubble in the background]]

==History==
The [[ski area]] opened as '''Park City West''' in 1968, a sister resort to the nearby [[Park City Mountain Resort]] which opened five years earlier. It was renamed '''ParkWest''' in 1975 after a change in ownership, and the name was changed again in 1995 to '''Wolf Mountain''' (not to be confused with the small [[ski area]] currently known as [[Wolf Mountain]] near [[Ogden, Utah]]) for two seasons, then became '''The Canyons''' in 1997, after the acquisition by [[American Skiing Company]]. In 2007, American Skiing Company sold all of its assets and dissolved as an active corporation. The Canyons sale to Talisker Corporation was finalized in 2008.

In 2010, Talisker finished significant upgrades to the resort and officially changed the name to '''Canyons Resort'''. The upgrades included relocating the base terminal of Red Pine [[Gondola lift|Gondola]] to a new gathering area called Ski Beach, installing two [[Detachable chairlift|high speed quads]] (including Orange Bubble Express, the first chairlift in North America with heated seats), opening Iron Mountain and 300 acres of new terrain, and many new dining and retail outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archivedate=February 22, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222162933/http://www.canyonsresort.com/resort_history.html|url=http://www.canyonsresort.com/resort_history.html|title=Canyons Resort History|publisher=Canyons Resort|accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, 2013, it was announced that [[Vail Resorts]] would operate Canyons under a 50-year lease, with six 50-year renewal options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/money/56379849-79/vail-resorts-ski-talisker.html.csp|title=Vail Resorts to operate Canyons Resort in Park City|work=Salt Lake Tribune|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canyons under Vail Resorts===
Vail Resort announced a plan to combine Canyons Resort with [[Park City Mountain Resort]] through an interconnect gondola between Iron Mountain at Canyons and the Silverlode lift at PCMR in 2015. The combined areas are operating as Park City Mountain Resort, but the former Canyons base area has been renamed '''Canyons Village at Park City'''. In addition, Vail has improved snowmaking and the mid-mountain chalet, Red Pine Lodge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.vailresorts.com/corporate/vail-resorts-park-city-improvements.htm|title=Vail Resorts to Invest an Unprecedented $50 million in Park City Mountain Resort in One Season|work=Vail Resorts|date=December 8, 2014|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resort description==

In [[sport]], a '''championship''' is a [[Competition#Sports|competition]] in which the aim is to decide which individual or team is the [[champion]].

== Championship systems ==
Various forms of competition can be referred to by the term championship.

=== Title match system ===
In this system, a competitor has to challenge the current champion to win the championship. A competitor (called ''number 1 contender'') can challenge the current champion after defeating other challengers. This form of championship is used in [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], [[mixed martial arts]] and other combat sports.

=== Tournament system ===
The term championships (in the plural) is often used to refer to [[tournaments|tournament competitions]], either using a [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout format]], such as at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and other championships in [[tennis]], or a mixed format with a [[Tournament#Group tournaments|group stage]] followed by knockout rounds, such as used in the [[UEFA European Football Championships|European Football Championships]].

A variation of the knockout format is the "best-of-X" or series format where two teams face each other for a specified number of times until one team wins the majority of specified games, most of the time the remaining games are not played anymore; only then is the losing team eliminated from contention and the winning team advances to the next level. This format is predominant in American sports such as baseball, ice hockey and basketball, and on test cricket.

=== League system ===
Championships in various sports, including [[rugby union]] and [[association football|soccer]] use a [[sports league|league system]] in which all competitors in the league play each other, either once or a number of times.

===Playoff system===
In many sport leagues, a playoff system is used to determine a championship winner.  Teams compete in a [[regular season]] of varying formats and a limited number of teams qualify for [[playoffs]]. Although this system is mostly identified with the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], it is frequently found in other [[North America]]n countries, and is also standard in sports influenced by North America (e.g. basketball, baseball, ice hockey) as well as most football codes other than soccer. The playoffs (known in some countries, notably [[Australia]], as the "finals series") are a tournament where teams play head-to-head in knockout competition.  The championship is often considered the final of the playoffs (e.g., [[Super Bowl]], [[Stanley Cup|Stanley Cup Final]], [[NBA Finals]], [[World Series]], etc.).  The playoff system can be seen as a hybrid between the league system and tournament system, where a league is used to determine qualifiers for the tournament.

In the [[National Football League|NFL]], the term "Championship game" is used to refer to the matches which decide the champions of each of the two conferences, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] and [[American Football Conference|AFC]]. These games are effectively [[semi-finals]] as they determine the two competitors in the Super Bowl.

== English football ==
In [[football in England|English football]], since the [[2004-05 in English football|2004-2005 season]], the '''EFL Championship''' has been used to refer to the second level of league football, properly called the [[EFL Championship]].  The Championship is one [[Division (sport)|division]] below the [[FA Premier League]] and a division above [[Football League One]]. It had previously been known as the [[Football League First Division]].

==Usage in professional wrestling==

==The Championship==
'''The championship''' may refer to :
* [[Football League Championship|The Championship]], an alternate name for the Football League Championship
* [[The Championship (TV series)]], a [[The Football League|Football League]] highlights programme in the UK
* [[The Rugby Championship]], the name for the Southern Hemisphere rugby union competition known as the Tri Nations before Argentina's entry in 2012
* The [[Rugby Football League Championship]], England's pre-Super League competition
* The Rugby Football League Championships, an alternative name for the English [[Championship (rugby league)|Kingston Press Championship]] and [[League 1 (rugby league)|Kingston Press League 1]].

'''Club Deportivo Universidad Católica'''  is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Santiago, Chile]], which plays in the [[Primera División de Chile|Primera División]].

Universidad Católica is one of the most successful and popular Chilean football clubs and considered one of the Chile's "Big Three".

Its traditional rival is [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]. They contest the [[Clásico Universitario]]. [[Colo-Colo]] is the other big rival of the club.

==Overview==
[[File:Universidad Católica en 1939.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Universidad Católica 1939.]]
[[File:UC campeones 1949.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Universidad Católica 1949.]]

While the club was born as one of the many sport branches of the [[Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile|Universidad Católica de Chile]], officially founded in 1937, it began, strictly speaking, around 1910, when students of the University would reunite to play football matches, frequently facing historical rival [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]. In time, the idea of creating a professional club emerged, and on 21 April 1937, the club officially and legally began. It made its professional debut, in the second division, against the Universidad de Chile. Rivalry, both in sports and in academic issues, made these matches between the universities become more and more important, eventually reaching the national status of "Universities' Derby". The rivalry maintains itself until today, with each match between these teams being considered a must-see for every football fan in the country.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Universidad Católica has attained fame as a favorite of the higher classes, because of many factors, which range from the location of the club's stadium, San Carlos de Apoquindo (in one of the most exclusive neighborhoods of the capital) and Headquarters, although there are "UC" fans all around the country, including popular regions or towns. For this reason, is planned to build a new stadium in a more popular place of Santiago. Due to the neighbourhood's strong influence (wealthy families), the club has been unable to be approved for projects to enlarge the stadium and thus draw larger crowds. Only until in recent years the club was allowed by the commune of Las Condes, to host their clasicos matches against [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and [[Colo-Colo]] in their own stadium. Although just a limited number of its rivals' supporters are allowed to be present at these matches due to security reasons inside the stadium and around its high-end neighborhood.

The club has reached notoriety, both in a national and South American level, as owner of one of the best infrastructures and training centers in the continent. As such, it is a good source of young talents, which occasionally rise to stardom in the club. Its most recent youth academy produced player known worldwide is [[Gary Medel]], currently playing for turkish side [[Beşiktaş J.K.]], among other clubs such as Boca Juniors, Sevilla and Internazionale, as well as playing a big role in Chile's 2010 and 2014 World Cup squads.

The club has won 12 national tournaments, and one international cup: Inter-American cup. Also, in 1993, Universidad Católica was the runner-up in the most important international tournament in South America: the [[Copa Libertadores de América]], losing in the finals against the biggest club in Brazil and defending Libertadores' Champion [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] They lost to what was considered{{By whom|date=September 2015}} the best team of the decade, a team that defeated Johan Cruyff's Barcelona Dream Team in 1992 and the Mighty Milan of Fabio Capelo em 1993. Between the two legs after a heavy defeat away la Catolica won the second leg but lost the title on aggregate. In 1997 the club celebrated its 60th anniversary with a friendly tournament where they beat [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] 3–2 in the Copa 60º Aniversario de Universidad Católica.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chil-intclub-friend.html Chilean Clubs&amp;nbsp;– Friendly Matches 1991–2001 (Rsssf)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{When|date=September 2015}} the club has been reemerged in international competition, advancing to the [[2005 Copa Sudamericana]] semifinal before being knocked out by the powerful [[Boca Juniors]] from Argentina, who would go on to win the tournament. In 2006 the team made a good presentation in the [[2006 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]], but was eliminated at the last minute by [[Tigres UANL]] of Mexico and failed to advance beyond the group stage. Universidad Católica did not qualify for the [[2007 Copa Libertadores]].

Católica again played Copa Libertadores in 2008 with no luck, being eliminated in group stage by goal difference by [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Club América|América]]. In 2010, their performance was no better, finishing third in group stage behind [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]].

In the 2011 edition, Católica finished first on the round robin, and then advanced to the quarter-finals, knocking out [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] of Brazil on the best 16 round, and falling to [[Peñarol]] of Uruguay 2–0 in Montevideo and winning their home match 2–1, which was not enough to advance.

In 2012 the club, under coach and former player [[Mario Lepe]], finished last on the group stage, winning only 1 home game and losing on their away games in Colombia and Bolivia.

== History ==
The history of the stadium goes back to the 1970s, where the land which had been former farm called Totolco was acquired by the CEL and which would later be transferred to Jose Gregorio Martinez, the founder of [[C.D. Chalatenango]].
Don Gregorio Martínez was a close friend of General Carlos Humberto Romero, who at that time was the president of El Salvador, and with his assistance a new stadium was built.
The idea was to create a multi sport complex, which included a football stadium, basketball courts and swimming pools. However, the last of these failed to be completed since president Romero was ousted from the presidency in October 1979 and funding was lost.
The stadium was built with a capacity of 15,000 fans, with natural grass and which created a unique structure that help give the stadium its first name the 'Sombrero'. 
In 1984, The club held a vote to change the name of the club, the options were between the former president [[Carlos Humberto Romero]] and the founder of the [[C.D. Chalatenango]] José Gregorio Martinez. By a large majority the club opted to rename the stadium Estadio José Gregorio Martínez. "

The '''Field of Dreams''' is a [[baseball field]] and [[pop-culture tourism|pop-culture tourist]] [[tourist attraction|attraction]] built originally for the [[Field of Dreams|movie of the same name]]. It is in [[Dubuque County, Iowa]], near [[Dyersville, Iowa|Dyersville]].

==Site history==
The studio built the baseball diamond on two farms, a few miles outside Dyersville. When production completed, the baseball diamond created for the movie was left behind. Most of the baseball field, including the diamond and the adjacent house, was on one farm owned by the Lansing family, but the left and center field were on an adjacent property owned by the Ameskamp family. The field was built on the two properties because the producers wanted the field in a location where sunset shots would be uninhibited.

After filming completed, the Lansing family kept their portion of the field intact, and added a small hut where visitors could buy souvenirs. The Ameskamp family returned their land to farming for a year, but then restored the remainder of the field and opened up their own souvenir stand. The two owners had operated separate tourist facilities and had also been at odds regarding commercialization of the site.

Keith Rahe, a neighboring farmer, put together a baseball team dubbed the "Ghost Players" to entertain the visitors at the field. The team's presence at the field on Sunday afternoons once a month attracted thousands of additional fans to the field. In 1991 and 1992, the Upper Deck Company sponsored a celebrity game at the field. Executive producer Tony Loiacono, who later received the key to the city, brought Hall of Famers like Bob Gibson, Reggie Jackson and Bob Feller to take on Hollywood stars like Kelsey Grammer and Meatloaf in a charity game. The two games raised over $100,000 for local charities.

=== Rolling Roadshow ===
[[File:Netflix Rolling Roadshow at Field of Dreams.jpg|right|thumbnail|The Kevin Costner Band]]
On August 11, 2006, Austin, Texas' [[Alamo Drafthouse]] "Rolling Roadshow" (which screens films in locations unique to each film) showed ''Field of Dreams'' at the Field of Dreams Site in Dyersville. A giant, outdoor screen was set up adjacent to the field with seating, concession, and parking along left and center field. Only the property owned by the Ameskamp family was allowed to be used for this event; the Lansing property was closed to the public. Before the screening of the film, [[Kevin Costner]] and his band (unnamed at the time, now known as [[Kevin Costner and Modern West]]) performed for two hours for the attending crowd of close to 1,000 people. Costner and his band played a selection of original songs and popular covers, including a song about Iowa that he wrote during the filming of ''Field of Dreams'' 17 years earlier. The event was sponsored by [[Netflix]] and hosted by [[Lisa Loeb]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Consolidation of land and Go the Distance operation ===
In August 2007, Rita Ameskamp sold the land containing her portion of the baseball field to Don and Becky Lansing - the owners of the remainder of the field. As a result the movie site was, for the first time, entirely owned by the Lansing family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hogstrom | first = Erik | coauthors = | title = Left &amp; Center Field of Dreams sold | work = Telegraph Herald | pages = | publisher = Woodward Communications, Inc. | date = 2007-08-18 | url = http://www.thonline.com/article.cfm?id=169879 | access-date = 2007-08-18 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2010, the Lansings announced they were putting the farm used for the movie up for sale.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5186685 For sale: 'Field of Dreams' farm]". Associated Press. May 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, 2011, it was reported that a sale had been agreed upon with a private partnership called Go the Distance Baseball, headed by Denise Stillman.&lt;ref&gt;Dodd, Mike (October 30, 2011). [http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2011/10/field-of-dreams-sold/1 "Field of Dreams movie site in Iowa is sold"]. ''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Go the Distance has owned and preserved the movie site since December 28, 2012.

Under Go the Distance, new events have been held at the venue. The Ghost Players returned in 2013. Over Father's Day weekend 2014, the field was home to a series of events to commemorate its 25th anniversary, including an exhibition game featuring [[Kevin Costner]], [[Dwier Brown]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/14/cast-fans-gather-again-at-field-of-dreams/10543325/|work=Des Moines Register/USA TODAY|first=Kyle|last=Munson|date=14 June 2014|access-date=29 April 2018|title=Cast, fans gather again at Field of Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events drew an estimated 12,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/local/kyle-munson/2014/06/13/kevin-costner-catch-sons-field-of-dreams/10444203/|work=Des Moines Register|first=Kyle|last=Munson|date=13 June 2014|title=Field of Dreams: Kevin Costner, other stars reminisce|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under new ownership, visitor traffic has increased from 65,000 to 100,000 visitors per year, according to Go the Distance.{{r|th}} Additionally, in March 2018, Go the Distance began renting the house and ballfield to tourists at a cost of $2,200 per night on weekdays and $2,500 per night on weekends.&lt;ref name="th2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphherald.com/news/public_announcements/article_7e81436a-77d6-52d8-9500-b721e4f33ce6.html|work=Telegraph Herald|first=John|last=Kruse|date=8 March 2018|access-date=29 March 2018|title=For rent: Tourists now can book iconic Field of Dreams ballfield, home}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional development===
Not long after buying the movie site, Go the Distance Baseball announced plans for a 24-field youth baseball and softball complex known as All-Star Ballpark Heaven. The project was initially intended to open in 2014, coinciding with the film's 25th anniversary, but confronted difficulties finding funding and legal action from neighboring property owners, who objected to the commercial rezoning of the site.&lt;ref name="th"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphherald.com/news/business/article_ef100d47-7fde-5c5d-bc38-0e32db9173fd.html|first=John|last=Kruse|work=Telegraph Herald|date=20 March 2016|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the cost has ballooned from the initially proposed $38 million to more than $70 million; while the Iowa state legislature passed a tax incentive for the project, developers failed to meet deadlines to secure it. The project still has not materialized.

== Dimensions and capacity==
The ballpark is {{convert|281|ft}} to left field, {{convert|314|ft}} to center and {{convert|262|ft}} to right field. With additional temporary [[bleacher]]s, the venue held nearly 6,000 spectators for the 2013 Team of Dreams celebrity ball game.

The '''Pankritio Stadium''' ({{lang-el|Παγκρήτιο Στάδιο}}, ''Pagkritio Stadio'' literally:''Pancretan Stadium'') is a multi-purpose sports [[stadium]] located in [[Heraklion]] on the island of [[Crete]]. It was completed on 31 December 2003, and officially opened on August 11, 2004. As one of the most modern sports venues in [[Greece]] at the time, it was used as one of the [[association football|football]] venues to host matches of the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics Football tournament]]. It has a capacity of 26,240 seats, and is currently the home ground of [[Heraklion]] [[association football|football]] club [[Ergotelis F.C.|Ergotelis]], and on occasion, the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]].

==Location==
The Pankritio Stadium is located in [[Heraklion]], at the Lido district to the west of the city center. It has been built about 50 meters from the island coast, and is neighbored by the [[Lido Indoor Hall]] and the city's outdoor pool venue,&lt;ref name="stadia"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=stadia.gr|title=Παγκρήτιο Στάδιο | language=Greek |url=http://www.stadia.gr/pankritio/pankritio-gr.html|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the whole district is named after ([[Lido]]).

==History==
The stadium broke ground sometime during the late 80s, however construction work was never completed on time, and was eventually indefinitely postponed.&lt;ref name="stadia"/&gt; Once [[Greece]] won the bid to host the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], construction of the stadium was finally picked up once again in 2001.&lt;ref name="stadia"/&gt; It was eventually completed on 31 December 2003.&lt;ref name="stadia"/&gt; The total construction cost was estimated at €50.000.000.&lt;ref name="stadia"/&gt; The new stadium was officially opened on 11 August 2004, to host an international [[exhibition game|friendly game]] between [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympic venues.] Volume 2. p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its size, age and ranking, the Pankritio was selected as one of the football venues of the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics Football Tournament]], hosting in total 10 matches (5 [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|men's Group Stage matches]], 2 [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's Group Stage]] matches, one [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|men's Quarterfinals match]], one [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's Quarterfinals match]] and one [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's Semi-Final match]]).&lt;ref name="aahaeota"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Heraklion Sports Development  A.E. O.T.A.|title=Παγκρήτιο Στάδιο | language=Greek |url=http://www.aahaeota.gr/node/189|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the tournament, the stadium was rented out, and has since been used as a training and home ground of the city's [[association football|football]] club [[Ergotelis F.C.|Ergotelis]], and occasionally also by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]].&lt;ref name="aahaeota"/&gt; In 2006, the Pankritio hosted the [[2005–06 Greek Cup]] Final, the first to be played in [[Heraklion]] since 1931.

Although primarily considered a [[association football|football]] stadium, the Pankritio, has also been used to host major [[Sport of athletics|athletics]] events, such as the [[Athens Grand Prix Tsiklitiria|2004 Tsiklitiria]] annual [[IAAF World Challenge]] meeting and the [[2015 European Team Championships]] First League.&lt;ref name="aahaeota"/&gt; The stadium has also been used for a number of music concerts, most notably hosting [[Deep Purple]] and [[Vasilis Papakonstantinou]] on May 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=rocking.gr|title=Deep Purple / Βασίλης Παπακωνσταντίνου και στην Κρήτη | language=Greek |url=http://www.rocking.gr/news/Deep_Purple__Basilis_Papakwnstantinou_kai_stin_Kriti/9474|date=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
The Pankritio Stadium sports complex features in total two football grounds built to international standards (main stadium and training ground), an 8-lane track, an auxiliary 6-lane track, an indoor gym and swimming pool, multi-purpose halls for [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[fencing]], [[dance]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[shooting]] and [[tae kwon do]], a [[rowing]] simulator and a physiotherapy room with sauna and hot tub.&lt;ref name="aahaeota"/&gt; Additionally, the stadium features seminar meeting rooms, a dining room, and a showroom featuring exhibits from the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] and [[2011 Special Olympics World Summer Games|2011 Special Olympics]].&lt;ref name="aahaeota"/&gt;

The complex is neighbored by the city's outdoor swimming pool and the [[Lido Indoor Hall]].&lt;ref name="stadia"/&gt;

== Tenants ==
The stadium has been used as the home ground of [[Football League (Greece)|Football League]] football team [[Ergotelis F.C.|Ergotelis]], since its opening in 2004, as their traditional home turf [[Nikos Kazantzakis Stadium]] was declared unfit for use in official matches at any level of the [[Greek football league system]] since 2004. Between 2006 and 2009, the stadium was also used by [[Ergotelis F.C.|Ergotelis]]' rival [[OFI Crete F.C.|OFI]], before they returned to their original home ground, [[Theodoros Vardinogiannis Stadium]].

On occasion, the Pankritio has also hosted home games of the [[Greece national football team|Greek national football team]], notably attracting large numbers of spectators from all over the [[Crete|island]].

== Records ==
Τhe stadium attendance record and first ever sold-out event was set on 20 February 2005, in a [[Superleague Greece|Superleague]] match between [[Ergotelis F.C.|Ergotelis]] and reigning champions [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] with 27,950 tickets being sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=gazzetta.gr|title=Τα sold out των ελληνικών γηπέδων (Greek) |url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/node/173593|date=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a 2−1 victory for the home team.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Pankritio Stadium hosted six games of the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|men's football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics]], and four games of the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's Olympic Football tournament]].

The '''''scudetto''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for: "little shield") is a decoration worn by Italian sports clubs that win the annual championship of their respective sport in the previous season.

The ''scudetto'' was created in the 1920s to honour the [[List of Italian football champions|winner]] of the national association football league (which eventually become [[Serie A]] in 1929) and the first ever team to wear it was [[Genoa C.F.C.]] in 1924.

Later, it was adopted by the teams of other sports.

== Origin ==
[[File:Andrea Marcato 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Andrea Marcato]], a rugby union player, wearing the ''scudetto'' won with [[Benetton Rugby|Benetton Treviso]] the season before]]
Sources generally agree that the inventor of the ''scudetto'' was the Italian poet and playwright [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]. In his youth, D'Annunzio was a keen follower of football and in 1887 he bought in [[London]] a leather ball from the same manufacturer that used to supply the [[English Football League|Football League]]&lt;ref name="Gazzetta"&gt;{{cite news|author=Paolo Pierangelodate=8 April 2013|title=150 anni di D'Annunzio, l'ideatore dello scudetto sulle maglie da gioco|trans-title=D'Annunzio's 150th Birthday: He Was the Inventor of the ''scudetto'' on Sports Jerseys|url=http://www.fantagazzetta.com/blogs/18_04_2013/150-anni-di-dannunziolideatore-dello-scudetto-sulle-maglie-da-gioco-170340|language=italian|newspaper=[[la Gazzetta dello Sport]]|location=[[Milan]]|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used to play football with his friends on the beach of [[Pescara]], his native place.&lt;ref name="Gazzetta"/&gt;

Later in 1920, once the former Austro-Hungarian city of [[Rijeka|Fiume]] (now the [[Croatia]]n [[Rijeka]]) was annexed to Italy, D'Annunzio proposed that the local football team wear on its jerseys a small shield with the [[Flag of Italy|tricolore]] ([[green]], [[white]] and [[red]]) to symbolize the Italian sovereignty over the city.&lt;ref name="Gazzetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.focus.it/cultura/storia/inventore-scudetto-d-annunzio|title=Chi ha inventato lo Scudetto?|trans-title=Who Invented the ''scudetto''?|date=25 April 2016|author=Roberto Graziosi|accessdate=9 December 2016|newspaper=[[Focus (Italian magazine)|Focus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the [[Italian Football Federation]] approved the decision to honour the defending champion allowing them to wear the ''scudetto'' on their jerseys. Since then, the ''scudetto'' has become the symbol of the defending champions of every sports league in Italy.

The Italian [[Top12|rugby union championship]] which started in 1928 also adopted the ''scudetto'' on the champion team's jerseys and so did the other team sports in Italy.

The '''Stadio Artemio Franchi''' is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  It is currently the home of [[ACF Fiorentina]]. The stadium was temporarily noticed as the host of Italy's Six Nations matches from [[2012 Six Nations Championship|2012]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/Italians-in-new-threat-to.6746124.jp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/12941136.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; The old nickname of the stadium was "Comunale."  When it was first constructed, it was known as the '''Stadio Giovanni Berta''', [[:it:Giovanni Berta|after a Florentine fascist]].

The stadium was officially opened on 13 September 1931 with a match between Fiorentina and [[Admira Wien]] (1-0), though it took until 1932 for the stadium to be completely finished and currently holds 47,282.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stadiumguide.com/artemiofranchi/&lt;/ref&gt; The architect is [[Pier Luigi Nervi]]&lt;ref name="zucconi"&gt;{{cite book | first=Guido | last=Zucconi | year=1995 | title=Florence: An Architectural Guide | edition=2001 Reprint | publisher=Arsenale Editrice | location=San Giovanni Lupatoto (Vr) | isbn=88-7743-147-4 | page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; (known for the [[Nervi Hall]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]) and it is one of the most relevant examples of 20th-century architecture in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firenzemadeintuscany.com/en/arts/articles/florence-rationalist/ ''Florence Rationalist'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is built entirely of reinforced concrete with a 70-meter (230&amp;nbsp;ft) tower that bears the stadium's flagstaff.  The tower is called the "Tower of Marathon".  Around the base of the tower, spiral ramps lead from the ground floor to the upper edge of the grandstand.&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt;

It hosted some of the matches of the [[1934 World Cup]], as well as [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|football]] preliminaries for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1960/OR1960v1.pdf 1960 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. pp. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1945, it hosted the [[Spaghetti Bowl (American football)|Spaghetti Bowl]] between American service teams.

The stadium was originally called the "Comunale" but was renamed after the former [[Italian Football Federation|FIGC]] president, [[Artemio Franchi]], in 1991.

The stadium itself underwent renovations for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref name=zucconi/&gt; which included removing the running track and increasing the [[seating capacity]]. At the World Cup, the ground hosted three matches in Group A and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s penalty shootout win over [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 Match Schedule|url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/CUPS/1990/wc90index.html|publisher=PlanetWorldCup.com|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official record attendance is 58,271 on 25 November 1984, at a [[Serie A]] match between [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]].

==Concerts==

[[David Bowie]] performed at the stadium during his [[Glass Spider Tour]] on 9 June 1987.

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed, with [[Level 42]] as her opening act, the final show of her [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] at the stadium on 6 September 1987. This performance was filmed &amp; later released as a [[VHS]] &amp; later as a [[DVD]], titled ''[[Ciao, Italia! – Live from Italy]]''. She performed at the stadium again 25 years later on 16 June 2012 to a sold out crowd of 42,434 people during her [[MDNA Tour]] .

[[Bruce Springsteen]] performed on 8 June 2003 at the stadium during his [[The Rising Tour]] and on 10 June 2012 for the [[Wrecking Ball World Tour]], in front of 42,658 people. It rained for the entire duration of the 2012 concert.

On Sunday 23 June 2013, the stadium hosted a Jovanotti concert.  Jovanotti is from [[Cortona]], a city relatively close to [[Firenze|Florence]], and many members of his family were in the audience including his wife, child and parents.

==National team - football==
The [[Italy national football team]] has played at the stadium, the first occasion being on 7 May 1933 in a 2-0 win over [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. The national team played only one game there between 1982 and 2006; a 2-0 friendly win against Mexico on 20 January 1993. On 1 March 2006, they played a friendly against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and won 4-1.  The stadium hosted two matches in [[Euro 2012]] qualifying: a 5-0 win over the [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], and a 1-0 win over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] on 6 September 2011 which was its most recent international hosting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadio Comunale Artemio Franchi|url=http://eu-football.info/_venue.php?id=1790|publisher=EU-Football.info|accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the match with Faroe Islands, [[Fabio Quagliarella]]  (a member of Juventus at the time) scored a goal.  Because Fiorentina fans have such a strong rivalry with Juventus, the fans at the stadium booed Quagliarella.

==National team - rugby==
{{see also|Italy national rugby union team}}
The stadium has also hosted international [[rugby union]] matches.  [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] played [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] on 20 November 2010, losing by a score of 14-32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=federugby.it|title=ITALIA v AUSTRALIA A FIRENZE IL 20 NOVEMBRE|url=http://www.federugby.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1745:italia-v-australia-a-firenze-il-20-novembre-il-vice-sindaco-nardella-una-grande-occasioneq&amp;catid=109:italia&amp;Itemid=415|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=theaustralian.com.au|title=Wallabies back on course with 32-14 win over Italy|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/wallabies-back-on-course-with-32-14-win-over-italy/story-fn6aueer-1225957652615|accessdate=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy won a famous victory against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] on 19 November 2016, beating the Springboks for the first time in their history. The final score was 20-18.

==Mass UFO Sighting of 1954==
On 27 October 1954, a reserve game between Fiorentina and nearby rivals Pistoiese was under way at the Stadio Artemio Franchi when a group of [[UFO]]s traveling at high speed abruptly stopped over the stadium. The stadium became silent as the crowd of around 10,000 spectators witnessed the event and described the UFOs as cigar shaped. It was suggested that the most likely explanation was that the silk of mass migrating spiders had agglomerated high in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The day UFOs hovered over Fiorentina's Stadio Artemio Franchi|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/20917594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The day UFOs stopped play|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29342407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1934 FIFA World Cup==
The stadium was one of the venues of the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], and held the following matches:

A '''steeplechase''' is a distance [[horse race]] in which competitors are required to jump diverse fence and ditch obstacles. Steeplechasing is primarily conducted in [[Ireland]] (where it originated), the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[United States]], [[Australia]] and [[France]]. The name is derived from early races in which orientation of the course was by reference to a [[Church (building)|church]] [[steeple]], jumping fences and ditches and generally traversing the many intervening obstacles in the countryside.

Modern usage of the term "steeplechase" differs between countries. In Ireland and the United Kingdom, it refers only to races run over large, fixed obstacles, in contrast to "[[Hurdling (horse race)|hurdle]]" races where the obstacles are much smaller. The collective term "jump racing" or "[[National Hunt racing]]" is used when referring to steeplechases and hurdle races collectively (although, properly speaking, National Hunt racing also includes some [[flat racing|flat races]]). Elsewhere in the world, "steeplechase" is used to refer to any race that involves jumping obstacles.

The most famous steeplechase in the world is the [[Grand National]] run annually at [[Aintree Racecourse]], in [[Liverpool]], since its inception in 1836 (the official race was held three years later), which in 2014 offered a prize fund of [[Pound sterling|£]]1 million.

== History ==
[[File:Anonymous.The Lads of the Village.JPG|thumb|"The lads from the village" - the first recorded English steeplechase 1830]]
The steeplechase originated in Ireland in the 18th century as an analogue to [[Cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]] thoroughbred horse races which went from [[Steeple (architecture)|church steeple]] to church steeple, hence "steeplechase". The first steeplechase is said to have been the result of a wager in 1752 between Cornelius O'Callaghan and Edmund Blake, racing four miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) cross-country from St John's Church in [[Buttevant]] to St Mary's Church (Church of Ireland) in [[Doneraile]], in [[County Cork|Cork]], [[Ireland]].{{sfn|Barrett|1995|p=9}} An account of the race was believed to have been in the library of the O'Briens of [[Dromoland Castle]]. Most of the earlier steeplechases were contested cross-country rather than on a track, and resembled English [[Cross-country equestrianism|cross country]] as it exists today. The first recorded steeplechase over a prepared track with fences was run at [[Bedford Racecourse|Bedford]] in 1810, although a race had been run at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]] in 1794 over a mile (1600 m) with five-foot (1.5 m) bars every quarter mile (400 m).&lt;ref name="Stevens 103"&gt;Stevens, Peter, History of the National Hunt Chase 1860–2010, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and the first recorded steeplechase of any kind in England took place in [[Leicestershire]] in 1792, when three horses raced the eight miles from Barkby Holt to Billesdon Coplow and back.{{sfn|Barrett|1995|p=10}}

The first recorded hurdle race took place at [[Durdham Down]] near [[Bristol]] in 1821. There were 5 hurdles on the mile long course, and the race was run in three heats.{{sfn|Barrett|1995|p=12}}

The first recognised English National Steeplechase took place on Monday 8 March 1830. The {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} race, organised by Thomas Coleman of [[St Albans]], was run from Bury Orchard, [[Harlington, Bedfordshire|Harlington]] in Bedfordshire to the Obelisk in Wrest Park, Bedfordshire. The winner was Captain Macdowall on "The Wonder", owned by Lord Ranelagh, who won in a time of 16 minutes 25 seconds. Report of the event appeared in the May and July editions of ''Sporting Magazine'' in 1830.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Steeplechasing by country==

===Europe===

====Great Britain and Ireland====
{{further|National Hunt racing}}
In Great Britain and Ireland, "steeplechase" only refers to one branch of jump racing.

Collectively, Great Britain and Ireland account for over 50% of all jump races worldwide, carding 4,800 races over fences in 2008. Jump racing in Great Britain and Ireland is officially known as [[National Hunt racing]].

====France====
French jump racing is similar to British and Irish National Hunt races, with a few notable differences. Hurdles are not collapsible, being more akin to small brush fences. Chases often have large fences called bullfinches, a large hedge up to {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall that horses have to jump through rather than over. There are also a larger number of cross-country chases where horses have to jump up and down banks, gallop through water, jump over stone walls as well as jump normal chasing fences.

Unlike in most countries where the thoroughbred is almost exclusively used for jump racing, many of the horses in French jump racing are [[AQPS]] (Autre Que Pur Sang), a breed of horse developed in France crossing thoroughbreds with saddle horses and other local breeds.

[[Auteuil Hippodrome|Auteuil]] in Paris is perhaps the best known racecourse in France for French jump racing.

====Czech Republic====
The [[Velká pardubická]] Steeplechase in Pardubice in the Czech Republic is the location of one of the longest steeplechase races in Europe. The first Velka Pardubice Steeplechase was held on 5 November 1874 and it has been hosted annually since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://becher123.webs.com/thecourse.htm Velka Pardubicka Steeplechase] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110034859/http://becher123.webs.com/thecourse.htm |date=2010-11-10 }} Retrieved 2010-10-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rest of the world===

====United States====
[[File:Civil War steeplechase2.jpg|thumb|right|325px|[[Saint Patrick's Day]] celebration in the [[Army of the Potomac]].  Depicts a steeplechase race among the [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]], 17 March 1863, by [[Edwin Forbes]].  Digitally restored.]]

In the United States, there are two forms of steeplechasing (or jumps racing): hurdle and timber.

Hurdle races occur almost always over the National fences, standardized plastic and steel fences that are 52&amp;nbsp;inches tall, with traditional natural fences of packed pine (Springdale Race Course in [[Camden, South Carolina]]) and live hedges ([[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier,]] Virginia) in use on a few courses. National fences stand 52&amp;nbsp;inches tall at the highest point, but are mostly made of synthetic "brush" that can be brushed through (much like the synthetic fences now used in other countries). The hurdle horse is trained to jump in as much of a regular stride as possible. This allows the horse to maintain its speed upon landing. Since it is not always possible to meet a fence in stride, the horses are also schooled in how to jump out of stride. An out of stride jump can decrease a horse's speed drastically. Hurdle races are commonly run at distances of 2–3 miles (3–5&amp;nbsp;km). Hurdle races occur at steeplechase meets mainly in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast and on the turf courses of several racetracks – Saratoga, Colonial Downs, Penn National, Monmouth Park and others.

Timber racing is conducted over solid and immovable wooden rail fences that, in the most extreme case, may reach five feet (1.5 m) high. The distances are longer, ranging from three to four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km), and the jumping effort required of the horse is much different. Because of the size of the fences and their solid and unyielding construction, a timber horse is trained to jump with an arc, unlike a hurdle racer. An important factor in success at timber racing is for the horse to land in stride, so that it can carry its speed forward on the flat part of the race course. This is harder than in hurdle races because the nature of the obstacle being jumped. If a horse hits a timber fence hard enough, it can bring it almost to a complete stop. Most notable US timber races include the [[Maryland Hunt Cup]] in [[Glyndon, Maryland|Glyndon]] and the [[Virginia Gold Cup]] in [[The Plains, Virginia|The Plains]]. Timber races currently are not held at any major US tracks (since the fences are not portable) but can be found at almost all steeplechase meets.

American jump racing happens in 11 states: Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. The [[National Steeplechase Association]] is the official sanctioning body of American jump racing. ''Steeplechase Times'' newspaper covers the sport.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.steeplechasetimes.com Steeplechase Times]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hitchcock]] (1860–1941) is known as the father of American steeplechasing. In the late 1800s, he built a steeplechase training center on his {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} property in [[Aiken, South Carolina]] and trained horses imported from England. No less important are the contributions by fellow Aiken seasonal resident [[F. Ambrose Clark]]. Clark held many important chases on his Brookville (Long Island) estate, Broad Hollow, in the 1920s and 1930s. Ford Conger Field was built by F. Ambrose Clark and is the site of the annual Aiken Steeplechase, a part of the Triple Crown in March. The first Steeplechase Meet in Aiken was held March 14, 1930 in Hitchcock Woods. In addition to the Aiken Steeplechase, South Carolina is also home to the Colonial Cup and the Carolina Cup, which is the largest event on the circuit.  Both of these races are held in [[Camden, South Carolina]].

The Virginia Gold Cup is also among the oldest steeplechase races in the United States, with its first running in 1922. Up until recently, the Gold Cup was a four-mile (6&amp;nbsp;km) long hurdle race. The length of this race prompted many jokes - such as the jockeys putting marbles in their mouth and spitting one out each lap to keep track of what lap they had completed. Since the Gold Cup moved to the present course, it has been changed into a timber race with a very large purse. Every first Saturday in May, more than 50,000 spectators gather at [[Great Meadow]] near The Plains, Virginia (45 miles (72&amp;nbsp;km) west of Washington, DC). The {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} grass course with {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} high timber fences is often referred to as the "crown jewel of steeplechasing."

Tennessee State Historian Walter T. Durham's book ''Grasslands'' relates the history of the Southern Grasslands Hunt and Racing Foundation, a group that organized the first international steeplechase held on U.S. soil 80 years ago at Grassland Downs, a {{convert|24|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} course located in Gallatin, TN between 1929 and 1932.

In addition to holding an inaugural race in 1930, two international steeplechases were held at Grasslands in 1930 and 1931. The winners were awarded a gold trophy designed by [[King Alfonso XIII]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;tennessean.com [http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101111/GALLATIN01/101110151/Durham-s-book-shares-oft-forgotten-part-of-Gallatin-s-history Gallatin's history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Iroquois Steeplechase]] event is held in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. Beginning in 1941, with one year off during [[World War II]], the race has been run continuously at Percy Warner Park on a course inspired by Marcellus Frost and designed by William duPont.

The Queens Cup Steeplechase is held annually on the last Saturday of April at [[Brooklandwood]], a farm and estate in [[Mineral Springs, North Carolina]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Charlotte]].

The [[Breeders' Cup Grand National Steeplechase]] (formerly known as the [[American Grand National]]) is held each October at the [[Far Hills Races]] in [[Far Hills, New Jersey]] and draws about 50,000 spectators for a single day race-meet. It is the richest event in American steeplechasing with a purse of $500,000.

During the 1940s and 50s, the [[Broad Hollow Steeplechase Handicap]], the [[Brook National Steeplechase Handicap]] and the American Grand National were regarded as American steeplechasing's [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].

[[Kentucky Downs]] near [[Franklin, Kentucky]] (originally Dueling Grounds Race Course) was built in 1990 as a steeplechase track, with a kidney-shaped turf circuit. At its inception, the track offered some of the richest purses in the history of American steeplechase including a $750,000 race. The track has undergone numerous ownership changes, with steeplechase races playing an on-and-off role (mainly off) in the track's limited live race meets.

The Stoneybrook Steeplechase was initiated in [[Southern Pines, North Carolina]] on a private farm owned by [[Michael G. Walsh]] in 1949 and was held annually in the spring until 1996, with attendance near 20,000. It resumed as an annual spring event at the new [[Carolina Horse Park]] in 2001, but was discontinued after 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronofhorse.com/article/carolina-horse-park-no-longer-hosting-stoneybrook-steeplechase|title=Carolina Horse Park No Longer Hosting Stoneybrook Steeplechase|date=November 22, 2016|publisher=Chronicle of the Horse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Turf Writers Cup]] is held each year at [[Saratoga Race Course]], attracting the best steeplechasing horses in the U.S.

====Australia====
[[File:Steeplechasing (AUS).jpg|thumb|250px|A steeplechase at [[Five Dock, New South Wales|Five Dock, NSW.]]]]
[[Australia]] has a long history of jumps racing which was introduced by British settlers. In the late 20th century, the northern states of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] shut down jumps racing, while Tasmania ceased jumps racing in April 2007 due to economic unfeasibility and a lack of entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jumping season in Australia normally takes place from March until September. (some minor races are held either side of these months). Horses used for steeplechasing are primarily former flat racing horses, rather than horses specifically bred for jumping.

There is an emphasis on safety in Australia which has led to a reduction in the size of obstacles. As jumps races take place at flat racing meetings there is also a need for portable jumps. Most chasing occurs on steeple lanes but also includes parts of the main flat racing track. From Easter to May the major distance races occur: The [[Great Eastern Steeplechase]] is held on Easter Monday at [[Oakbank, South Australia]] drawing crowds of over 100,000, and the [[Grand Annual]], which has the most fences of any steeplechase in the world, is held in May at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]].

Each state holds its own Grand National race: the most prestigious is the VRC Grand National at [[Flemington Racecourse|Flemington]] run in the winter. The jumping season culminates with the set-weights-and-penalties Hiskens Steeple run at [[Moonee Valley Racecourse|Moonee Valley]]. The Hiskens is regarded as the [[Cox Plate]] of jumps racing.

The most famous Australian horse in the field was [[Crisp (horse)|Crisp]], who was narrowly beaten by the champion [[Red Rum]] in the 1973 English Grand National. Crisp subsequently beat Red Rum at set weights. More recently [[Karasi]] has won the [[Nakayama Grand Jump]], the world's richest jumps race held in [[Japan]], three times.

Jumps racing was set to end in Victoria after the 2010 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/horseracing/jumps-racing-hits-the-wall-20091127-jvol.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Jumps racing hits the wall | date=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, having satisfied a limit on the maximum number of deaths among starting horses, hurdle racing was granted a 3-year extension by Racing Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racingvictoria.net.au/news/JR/n_Board_decision_on_Hurdle_and_Steeplechase_Racing.aspx|title=Board decision on Hurdle and Steeplechase Racing|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Racing Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision regarding steeplechase was postponed until October 2010 when a program for the 2011 season only was granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One year steeplechase racing program approved|url=http://www.racingvictoria.net.au/news/JR/n_One_year_steeplechase_racing_program_approved.aspx|work=Racing Victoria Jumps Racing website news|publisher=[[Racing Victoria]]|accessdate=11 March 2011|date=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, both hurdle races and steeplechases have been approved by Racing Victoria.

==Opposition to jumps racing==

===Australia===
Jumps racing in Australia is only run in Victoria and South Australia.

The NSW government officially shut down jumps racing in 1997 after a bill was put through linked with bird tethering, but by that stage there had not been regular jumps race meetings in NSW since World War II, when it was ceased due to the war efforts, except for a handful of exhibition events on an annual basis in the 1980s.

In 2012, the [[Victoria Racing Club|VRC]] Grand National Steeplechase was worth $250,000 and the [[Grand Annual|Warrnambool Grand Annual Steeplechase]] was worth $252,000.

Jumps racing is opposed in Australia by groups including the [[animal rights]] organisations the [[RSPCA Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Eventing==
The equestrian sport of [[eventing]] had a steeplechase phase, which was held in its CCI 3 Day event format. This phase is called cross country phase B when in the context of eventing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/15205/eventings-short-and-long-formats-compared|website=thehorse.com|accessdate=9 October 2017|title=Eventing's Short and Long Formats Compared|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a roads and tracks phase, a steeplechase phase, a second, faster roads and track phase and finally the cross country jumps course. Now only the cross country jumps course remains (changes were due to space required for the additional courses and logistics). Unlike the racing form, which is far closer to the sport of hunting, the horses do not race each other over the course, but rather are required to come within a pre-set "optimum time period." Penalty points are added to the competitor's score if they exceed or come in well under the optimum time.&lt;ref name="Three Day Events - Rules; Specifications for Three-Day Events"&gt;{{cite book|title=USEF Rules for Eventing (2016)|date=2016|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation/Master Print, Inc.|pages=63–66, Appendix 8|url=http://useventing.com/sites/default/files/USEA_2016_RuleBook_5.6.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While phase B obstacles are similar to those found on actual steeplechase courses, the [[cross country obstacles]] for phase D are usually extremely varied, some being topped with brush as in steeplechasing, others being solid, others are into and out of water and others are over ditches. There are often combinations of several fences to test the horse's agility. The variety in obstacles is used to make the horse demonstrate agility, power, intelligence, and bravery. The long format was phased out at the FEI level between 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wofford|first1=Jim|title=Jim Wofford: Short Format "Dumbs Down" Eventing|url=https://practicalhorsemanmag.com/training/short_format_122308|website=Practical Horseman|publisher=Practical Horseman|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chronofhorse.com/forum/forum/discussion-forums/eventing/27716-fei-set-to-remove-all-reference-to-long-format-cci-in-2009|title=FEI set to remove all reference to long format CCI in 2009 -

The '''Super Eight Most Valuable Player''' is an award for the best individual performance during the [[MIAA Division IA Baseball Championship|Super Eight]] in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]]. The recipient of the award is announced at the completion of the Super Eight Championship Game. The award is similar to [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series MVP|World Series Most Valuable Player]] award.

Since 2014, the winner of the award has received a wooden bat engraved with the award title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/high-school/post/_/id/43138/braintrees-scott-creedon-is-2016-espnboston-mr-baseball|title=Braintree's Scott Creedon is 2016 ESPNBoston Mr. Baseball|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody has yet to win the award from the losing team of the Super Eight Baseball Tournament. The Super Eight started in 2014, and the award has been given out every year, from the start.

Braintree's [[Scott Creedon]] became the first and only player to win back-to-back MVP Awards. In 2016, Creedon was also named ESPNBoston Mr. Baseball for best player in the state throughout the season.
==Voting process==
The press attending and covering the tournament vote on the Most Valuable Player during the game. The award is distributed by [[ESPN]]Boston.com&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/high-school/post/_/id/32776/norths-sbordone-is-espn-bostons-super-8-mvp|title=North's Sbordone is ESPN Boston's Super 8 MVP|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Most Valuable Player is announced following the awarding of trophies to the runner-up and championship teams. If a second game of the championship series is necessary, the ballots taken during the second game are discarded, and a new round of balloting is conducted during the third and deciding game.

'''The Northern Echo Arena''' is a [[rugby union]] and former [[Soccer-specific stadium|football stadium]], located in [[Darlington]], [[County Durham]].

The arena was opened in the summer of 2003, as the new home ground of [[Darlington F.C.]], following the decision to leave their previous ground, [[Feethams]], after the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]]. With a [[seating capacity]] of 25,000, the arena rarely attracted large audiences, with the usual attendance being around 2,000. The cost of the arena caused the club to go into administration three times. Eventually, the club decided to leave the arena after nine years following the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12 season]].

In December 2012, after rumours that the arena could be closed down and be replaced with different reported purposes, rugby union team, [[Darlington Mowden Park RFC]] purchased the arena for £2 million; the owner of the club later stated that he believed that the arena could lead to much more success for the club.&lt;ref name="DMP"/&gt;

Prior to moving to the ground in 2003, [[Darlington F.C.]] had been playing at [[Feethams]], located near to the town centre. The current stadium was built on a greenfield site next to Darlington's [[A66 road|A66 bypass]]. Upon completion the arena was originally called the '''Reynolds Arena''', after the club's then owner, [[George Reynolds (business)|George Reynolds]]. After Reynolds' bankruptcy and arrest on charges of [[money laundering]], the name was changed to the '''New Stadium''' in April 2004.

The Arena consists of four equally sided stands. The West Stand, located behind the goal, was generally the more vocal of the two sides used by home supporters.

A crowd of 11,600 watched the first game in the new stadium for a 2–0 defeat to [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Darlington 0–2 Kidderminster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/3137569.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2003 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the ground averaged a gate of around 1,500 to 2,000 supporters, although certain fixtures such as the derby match defeat against local rivals [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in March 2007 (10,121 spectators), pulled in a significantly larger turnout. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The club has sold the naming rights for the stadium to various sponsors: Williamson Motors, 96.6 TFM, Balfour Webnet, and in 2009 ''[[The Northern Echo]]''; since [[Darlington Mowden Park RFC]] have used the arena, it has been named ''The Northern Echo Arena'', rather than the previous name ''The Northern Echo Darlington Arena''.

It was the largest [[Conference National]] venue with a capacity of 25,000.&lt;ref name=FLclubpage/&gt; Attendances for football matches were restricted to 10,000 by local planning regulations,&lt;ref name=planapp/&gt; because of poor access roads around the stadium, although the club was allowed to apply for an exception for special occasions.

It was announced in May 2012 that Darlington would no longer play at the Darlington Arena, with the club later folding and being replaced by a new club – [[Darlington 1883]]. The club initially agreed a ground share deal with [[Shildon A.F.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17990221|title=Darlington seal groundshare deal with Shildon AFC|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; before deciding to share with [[Bishop Auckland F.C.]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9736049.QUAKERS_LATEST__Darlington_to_play_at_Bishop_Auckland__not_Shildon/ |title=Darlington to play at Bishop Auckland, not Shildon |first=Joe |last=Willis |work=The Northern Echo |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement that the football club would no longer play at the arena, it was reported that the arena may be closed down and be replaced by a housing estate.&lt;ref name="What's Next"/&gt; However, in December 2012, [[Darlington Mowden Park R.F.C.]] bought the arena for £2 million, as well as {{convert|17|acres}} of adjoining land, with the intention of developing a multi-sports facility; the club owner stated that he hoped that playing at the arena would improve Mowden Park's performances.&lt;ref name="DMP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-union/20626002 |title=Darlington Mowden Park: Rugby team buy The Arena |publisher=BBC SEport |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be proved to be true, as they were promoted to [[National League 1]], the third tier of English rugby union, beginning in the [[2014–15 National League 1|2014–15 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mowdenpark.com/news/dmprfc-30--ampthill-rfc-28-1213914.html | title=DMPRFC 30 – Ampthill RFC 28 | publisher=DMP | first=Andy | last = Craggs | date=3 May 2014 | accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club played their first game at the arena on 2 February 2013, in front of a crowd of over 1,000 spectators, defeating [[Bromsgrove RFC|Bromsgrove]] 62–7 in a [[National League 2 North]] league game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/rugby/local/10203133.MATCH_REPORT__Darlington_Mowden_Park_62_Bromsgrove_7/ |title=Darlington Mowden Park make dream start at Northern Echo Arena |publisher=The Northern Echo |date=2 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular attendances would bring in around 700–1,300 spectators.

==Other uses==
The Arena also played host to the first professional [[rugby league]] match to be played in [[County Durham]], when [[Newcastle Thunder|Gateshead Thunder]] used the ground for their fifth round [[2009 Challenge Cup]] game against [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] due to a fixture clash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/4355805.Super_League_dream_for_Thunder_supremo_Findlay/ |title=Super League dream for Thunder supremo Findlay |first=Scott |last=Wilson |work=The Northern Echo |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerts===
Darlington planned to use the stadium for musical concerts to increase club revenue. [[Elton John]] was the first act to play at the stadium, on 5 July 2008, attracting a crowd of 17,000.&lt;ref name="What's Next"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/sport/9690713.What_next_for_the_Darlington_Arena_/ |title=What next for the Darlington Arena? |first=Stuart |last=Arnold |work=Darlington and Stockton Times |date=5 May 2012|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, it was announced that [[A-ha]] and [[Steps (group)|Steps]], with [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]] and [[Blue (English band)|Blue]] as Steps' opening acts, would perform at the stadium in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/ha-steps-aqua-blue-play-13898293&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Twenty Four Seven''''' is a 1997 British [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed and written by [[Shane Meadows]]. It was co-written by frequent Meadows collaborator Paul Fraser.

==Plot==
In a typical English working-class town, the juveniles have nothing more to do than hang around in gangs. One day, Alan Darcy ([[Bob Hoskins]]), a highly motivated man with the same kind of youth experience, starts trying to get the young people off the street and into doing something they can believe in; boxing. Soon, he opens a training facility which is accepted gratefully by them and the gangs start to grow together into friends. Darcy manages to organise a public fight for them to prove what they have learned. A training camp with hiking tours into the mountains of Wales forge the group into a tightly-knit club society. With the day of the fight drawing closer, the young boxers get more and more excited.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">In North American sports contracts, '''waivers''' is a type of player transaction.  A player under contract to a team is placed on "waivers" for a specified period of time; during this time other teams may submit a claim for that player's contract.  Based on a priority system, the team with the highest priority earns either the right to negotiate with the player's current team, or in some cases, the right to assume the contract of that player from the current team.  Each of the four [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league sports]] has somewhat different procedures for handling waivers.  The purpose of waivers is to prevent teams from colluding to exchange players outside of the normal [[Trade (sports)|trade]] rules, as well as to encourage parity by giving lower-ranked teams the [[right of first refusal]] to claim players which are no longer wanted by their former club.

== Major League Baseball ==
{{main|Waivers (MLB)}}

Players may be placed on waivers at any time, though teams who wish to trade players during the season but after July 31 ''must'' waive those players before [[trade (sports)|trading]] them.  Teams may claim any waived player during the first three days after being placed on waivers.  If more than one team claims the player during the three-day window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority.  Once a player is claimed, the player's current team may either negotiate a trade, rescind the waiver, or do nothing and allow the claiming team to assume the player's contract.  Any player that remains unclaimed (or whose waiver offer is not rescinded) after three days, the player may be sent to a club's [[minor league baseball]] affiliate (called "designated for assignment" or "sent to the farm", colloquially) or granted unrestricted [[free agency]] to sign with any club.

== National Football League ==
{{main|Waivers (American football)}}

Players in the National Football League may be placed on waivers at any point between July 4 to February 1.  Between July 4 and the end of the regular season, the waiver window is 24 hours.  Between the end of the regular season and February 1 the waiver window is three days.  If more than one team claims the player during the waiver window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority.  Once another team claims a player on waivers, they assume that players contract without the need to negotiate with the player's former club.  Any player that clears the waiver window becomes a [[free agent]].  Waivers are not possible between February 1 and July 4; players released outside of the season become free agents without having to clear waivers.

== National Hockey League ==
{{main|Waivers (NHL)}}

Players in the National Hockey League are placed on waivers following any of several conditions.  Firstly, players who meet a certain threshold of league experience (based on a complex formula based on position, age, and time spent in the NHL) cannot be designated for assignment to a minor league club unless first placed on waivers.  Secondly, the same players brought back to their parent NHL club from the minors also have to clear waivers.  Thirdly, players who spend at least one season playing in another country's major professional hockey league are placed on waivers when returning to the NHL.  Fourthly, players who are released from their parent club unconditionally are placed on waivers before they become free agents.  Teams have 24 hours (measured from noon [[Eastern time]] following the announcement of the transaction) to place a claim on a player.  If more than one team claims the player during the 24-hour window, the team with the lowest win-loss-tie point total has first priority.  The claiming team then assumes the contract.  If the player clears waivers, the intended transaction (either changing teams or outright release) proceeds.

== National Basketball Association ==
{{main|Waivers (NBA)}}

Players in the National Basketball association are placed on waivers if they are released by their parent club during the season.  Other teams have 48 hours to claim the waived player.  If more than one team claims the player during the two-day window, the team with the lowest win percentage has first priority.  The claiming team assumes the player's contract when they claim them, however for players signed off of waivers after March 1, they are ineligible to participate in that season's playoffs.  Players who clear waivers become unrestricted free agents.  Players released by their parent clubs in the off-season do not have to clear waivers before signing with another club.

'''Warrior Sports''' is an American manufacturer of [[lacrosse]], [[ice hockey]] and [[association football|soccer]] equipment and [[clothing]] based in [[Warren, Michigan]]. Warrior entered the soccer market in 2012, producing [[jersey (clothing)|kit]]s and training equipment for several clubs around the world, although the soccer sponsorship and products were later discontinued with its parent company [[New Balance]]'s entry into the category.

==History==
Warrior Sports was founded in 1992 by [[David Morrow (sports)|David Morrow]], a former lacrosse player. The company name is derived from Morrow's roots as a member of the Brother Rice Lacrosse team, the Warriors, in [[Birmingham, Michigan]]. The company started out as the first manufacturer of titanium lacrosse shafts, which changed the game due to their strength and light weight.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Morrow went on to highlight the breakthrough shaft as he played for the Princeton Tigers lacrosse team. He also went on to be the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] player of the year. In 2004, the [[privately held company]], [[New Balance|New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.]] obtained controlling interest in Warrior. One year later, Warrior moved into the [[ice hockey]] industry when it acquired [[California]]–based manufacturer Innovative Hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Warrior |url=http://www.warrior.com/company-info/about |publisher=Warrior Sports |access-date= May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Warrior History |url=http://www.warrior.com/company-info/history |publisher=Warrior Sports |access-date= May 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Warrior acquired the Boston-based Brine Sporting Goods to further establish their market share in lacrosse.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.warrior.com/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Beginning in July 2012, Warrior Lacrosse embroiled itself in controversy by launching a Twitter marketing campaign for which users were entered into a raffle to win a free pair of shoes if they used the [[hashtag]] #ninjaplease. The campaign has been widely derided throughout the industry and in the lacrosse world. As Warrior was a founding factor in Major League Lacrosse (MLL) and sponsors all teams, some African-American players in the league have protested, with the possibility of retiring from the league should the controversy not be handled appropriately. Warrior suspended the campaign and the MLL removed all references to it on October 29, 2012, when the meaning of the hashtag used in the campaign came to the attention of officials of both organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Wilson |first= Connor|title=When Marketing Goes Awry: #NinjaPlease|url=http://laxallstars.com/when-marketing-goes-awry-ninjaplease/|publisher=Lacrosse All Stars|date= November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Foy |first= Terry |title= Jovan Miller, Warrior Respond to 'Dojo' Campaign, Mainstream Media Attention |url= http://insidelacrosse.com/ilgear/news/2012/11/09/jovan-miller-warrior-respond-dojo-campaign-mainstream-media-attention |work= Inside Lacrosse |date= November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Warrior Sports reportedly signed a sponsorship agreement for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] worth [[Pound sign|£]]25 million per season as of the 2012–13 season while [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] reduced their annual sponsorship to just half of that, overtaking the English club record of £23.3 million paid by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for supplying [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the previous deal from [[Adidas]] worth £13 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Liverpool's Mammoth £25m-a-Year Warrior Kit Deal Rewrites the Record Books |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1379466/Liverpools-mammoth-25m-year-Warrior-kit-deal-rewrites-record-books.html |work= [[The Daily Mail]] |access-date= May 25, 2011 |location=London|date= April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Abelson |first= Jenn |date= April 23, 2011 |title= New Balance Unit in Deal with Liverpool FC |url= http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/04/23/new_balance_unit_in_deal_with_liverpool_fc/ |work= Boston.com |access-date= January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Harris |first= Rob |date= May 13, 2011 |title= Liverpool Plans to Reclaim Record from Manchester United |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2011-05-13-2687927294_x.htm |work= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press]] |access-date= January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 2012, Liverpool and Warrior Sports announced a deal between the two organisations, whereby Warrior became the Liverpool kit sponsor effective from June 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Liverpool Signs New Kit Deal with US firm Warrior |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16627867 |publisher= [[BBC News]] |access-date= January 19, 2012 |date= January 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Liverpool home kits were launched on the official Liverpool website on May 11, 2012, and were notable for their classic design and a return to a more simplified club badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our New Home Kit for 2012—13 |url= http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/our-new-home-kit-for-2012-13 |publisher= Liverpool FC |access-date= May 11, 2012 |date= May 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was welcomed by most fans but has angered some.

In February 2015, parent company New Balance announced it was entering the global soccer market. As part of the move, all clubs and players sponsored by Warrior would be outfitted by New Balance while Warrior would go back to just hockey and lacrosse going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New Balance Challenges Nike and Adidas with Entry into Global Soccer Market |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/02/04/new-balance-enters-global-soccer-market/ |first= Kurt |last= Badenhausen |work= Forbes |date= February 4, 2015|access-date= February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice facility of the [[Boston Bruins]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and the home arena of the [[Boston Pride]] of the [[National Women's Hockey League (2015)|National Women's Hockey League]] is named [[Warrior Ice Arena]]. The arena, part of a larger project called Boston Landing is owned by Warrior's parent company New Balance.

The '''Wildwoods Convention Center''' is a [[convention center]] and [[Arena|indoor arena]] in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]].  Built in 2001 to replace an older Convention Hall, the center has exhibition space of {{convert|260000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}}.  The building includes the '''Oceanfront Arena''', an indoor arena that can seat up to 7,000 spectators.  It is owned by the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] and managed by The Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority (GWTIDA). The architect for the Convention Center is LMN Architects.

==History==
In 1972, Wildwood Convention Hall, a {{convert|18000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} building, opened with several stores in front. Located on the Boardwalk at 4522 Ocean Avenue, it was used until the need for a larger convention center and arena were made in 1999. NJSEA promptly joined in, and broke ground in 2000, tearing a {{convert|40|ft|m}} hole in the boardwalk in the process, opening the new building in 2001, and the following year, razed the old hall, creating the new dramatic entrance way for the facility.

The [[Wildwood Hi-Rollers]] played home games at the Wildwoods Convention Center during the 1981–82 [[Continental Basketball Association]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildwood Hi Rollers; CBA 1981-1982|url=http://www.cbamuseum.com:80/teams/wildhiro.html|website=cbamuseum.com|accessdate=March 14, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426010635/http://www.cbamuseum.com:80/teams/wildhiro.html|archivedate=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual events==
[[WWE]]'s [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand has staged an annual event every July in the arena, setting a record attendance in 2005. In addition, annual concerts celebrating the 1960s (in May) and 1950's (in October) are staged there, as well as an annual [[Basketball#High school basketball|high school basketball]] tournament billed as the largest in the country running from December 26 (the day after [[Christmas]]) through New Year's Eve (December 31) for both boys and girls teams. This venue was bidding for [[Miss World 2015]], but lost to the [[Crown of Beauty Theatre|Beauty Crown Grand Theatre]] in [[Sanya]], [[Hainan|Hainan Island]], [[China|China PR]].

{{distinguish|Zone defense}}
In [[Australian rules football]], '''zoning''' (originally called '''district football''', or '''electorate football''' in South Australia) refers to a system whereby a given area, either region or lower-level football league, is reserved exclusively for one club.&lt;ref name="blueseum"&gt;[http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Victorian+Recruiting+Zones Victorian Recruiting Zones]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoning has been historically an important part of most major Australian football leagues, being usually justified as necessary to ensure a reasonably equitable competition.&lt;ref&gt;See Groot, Loek; “Competitive Balance in Team Sports: The Scoring Context, Referees, and Overtime”; ''Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics'' 165 (2009), pp. 384–400. {{ISSN|0932-4569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metropolitan zoning==
In the early years of Australian rules football, players, though required to be [[amateur]]s, were free agents.

Problems arose as a small number of clubs (Carlton, Geelong and South Melbourne in the VFA, [[Norwood Football Club|Norwood]], Port Adelaide and South Adelaide in the SAFA and [[Fremantle Football Club (1881–1899)|Fremantle]] in the WAFA) perennially dominated the competition, leaving considerable pressure on the leagues to eliminate this inequality in order to retain interest.

District football was first introduced in the SANFL in 1897, with compulsory district qualification from 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Adelaide Observer|publication-place=Adelaide, SA|title=The Football Difficult|date=6 May 1899|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under district football, a player could only play for the club whose district he resided in.

The effect on the competitiveness of the SANFL was noteworthy: between 1877 to 1899, Norwood, South Adelaide and Port Adelaide won 22 of the 24 premierships,&lt;ref&gt;South Adelaide and Victorian were joint premiers in 1877.&lt;/ref&gt; including several sequences of successive premierships (for instance, South Adelaide had won six of the last eight, and Norwood had won 11 premierships in their first 17 years, including sequences of six and three in succession). In the years between 1900 and 1912, two teams who had previously been perennially been close to or at the bottom of the ladder won premierships: North Adelaide in 1900, 1902, and 1905, and West Adelaide in 1908–1909 and 1911–1912 (four premierships in five years).

The VFL formally adopted metropolitan zoning for the 1916 season under laws which required a player to play for the club in his zone he lived, unless he:

* a) moved home after becoming an established player for three years, or
* b) was discarded by the club to which he was zoned&lt;ref name="QC"&gt;Wilson, David; “QC warns of Loopholes in League Rules: VFL Zoning in Doubt”; ''[[The Age]]'', 23 July 1981; p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Metropolitan zoning has been seen by historians of the VFL as improving the competitive balance of the league in the years following [[World War I]]. When [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were admitted for the 1925 season, they were allocated zones. Over time, boundaries were changed to cope with [[demography|demographic]] shifts.

Whilst recent studies have shown that metropolitan zoning became less effective at equalising playing strength following the admittance of the three new clubs in 1925,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Booth, Ross; “History of Player Recruitment, Transfer and Payment Rules in the Victorian and Australian Football League”; in ASSH Bulletin No. 26 (June 1997); pp. 13–33&lt;/ref&gt; it was already firmly accepted by the majority of club officials in most Australian Rules competitions by the late 1920s and at no stage during the following forty years was there ever any thought of abolishing it, while a tradition of club loyalty further entrenched the viewpoint that zoning was a legitimate policy.

With the great [[urban sprawl]] after [[World War II]], newly developed areas were zoned almost as soon as they were developed. In the case of the VFL, such areas were quite often zoned to a different club from the one who held adjacent previously developed areas, whereas the SANFL tried to keep zones contiguous. These and other leagues remained concerned about the possible impacts if zoning were removed, and this caused their zoning laws to ossify.

==Country zoning==
In the early days of Australian Rules football, metropolitan clubs were unable to buy players from [[rural]] leagues, but the growth of [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]] due to [[urbanization]] in the 1950s meant that city clubs could offer much more money (even if not as direct payments) than country clubs could.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This permitted wealthier clubs to circumvent the restrictions imposed by metropolitan zoning, as top country players tended to go to the club who was able to offer them most money by gifts such as motor cars and signing-on fees.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R.K.; “The economic development of the Victorian Football League 1960–1984” ''Sporting Traditions'', 1985 Vol. 1 No. 2 pp. 2–26&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1960s, [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]], [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] (and to a lesser extent [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]) perennially dominated the competition because their greater wealth allowed them to monopolise top country players and build up greater playing strength than was previously possible, while [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]], [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] were in grave danger of folding.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Ross; “The Economics of Achieving Competitive Balance in the Australian Football League, 1897–2004”; Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy, Volume 23, Issue 4 (December 2004), pp. 325–344&lt;/ref&gt;

The VFL’s response was to zone rural Victoria and the [[Riverina]] of [[New South Wales]] in a similar manner to metropolitan Melbourne. Because of the sparseness of Australia’s rural population, the country zones related not to ''the player’s address'', but rather ''to the league in which he played''. This difference made zone boundaries impossible to adjust and was a critical component of the failure of country zoning.

Because the VFL was aware that discrepancies existed in the strength of each zone, it was originally planned that the zones would be ''rotated'' every year so that each club would obtain a chance of receiving the best young country players. However, [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] had productive zones and were naturally unwilling to give them up for less productive ones,&lt;ref name="blueseum"/&gt; so the zones remained the same from the inception of country zoning until it was abolished in 1986. There was also no provision for [[demography|demographic changes]] which occurred in the various country zones, which exacerbated the problems mentioned above.

===Effects of country zoning===
Although the more even distribution of top country players at the beginning of the 1970s was such that the [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] and [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]] quickly adopted country zoning, its gains were very short-lived. Carlton, [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] won every [[AFL Grand Final|VFL premiership]] between 1967 and 1983, a period of dominance not known in any other era, as strong country zones gave these clubs lists more powerful than any club could build without zoning.

In contrast, the clubs with the worst zones, [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], took eight wooden spoons between them in that period. South Melbourne played only two finals [[1970 VFL season|in 1970]] [[1977 VFL season|and 1977]], whilst Melbourne did not play a final [[1987 VFL season|until 1987]], after country zoning had been abolished.

Some writers on VFL history have argued that the inequalities created by country zoning were much greater than those created by club wealth beforehand and that some clubs lost many players they would have gained were players able to move to the club nearest to them. Most significantly, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda’s]] return to the bottom of the ladder in the mid-1970s after a period of success from 1961-1973 has been related to its loss of many players to Hawthorn from the [[City of Frankston|Frankston]] area, which was already becoming part of metropolitan Melbourne when country zoning began.&lt;ref&gt;“How [[Darrel Baldock|the Doc]] Hopes to Cure the Ailing Saints”; in ''[[The Age]]'', 12 February 1987, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Defenders of country zoning have argued that it provided greater incentive for VFL clubs to look for players in country leagues, and that its abolition has meant that this incentive has been lost.

==End of VFL zoning==
In 1981, the system of player permits based on country and metropolitan zoning was threatened by two cases.

In the better-known of these, a full-back from [[South Australian National Football League|SANFL]] club West Torrens, [[Doug Cox (footballer)|Doug Cox]], had his permit to play with St Kilda challenged because he had played in 1975 for South Mildura,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson; David; “The Cox Wrangle: The Year That Cost 8 Points”; ''The Age'', 22 May 1981, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; which was within Richmond’s country zone.&lt;ref name="league"&gt;Carter, Ron; “League Takes All St Kilda’s Points”; ''The Age'', 21 May 1981; p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; St Kilda temporarily lost eight points for two wins against [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] and Melbourne, later reinstated on appeal,&lt;ref name="regains"&gt;Carter, Ron; “St Kilda Regains Points”; ''The Age'', 30 July 1981, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and were fined $5,000 for playing Cox in the first eight rounds. Soon afterwards, South Melbourne centre-half forward [[Michael Smith (Australian footballer)|Michael Smith]] admitted he gave false information on his application for a permit to play with South, and his true address was in St Kilda’s zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Ron and Slattery, Geoff; “Second Wrong Permit in VFL: South’s Turn to Lose Points”; ''The Age'', 22 June 1981, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; South were going to lose four points but since the VFL, challenged by the Cox case to be more lenient about its now-archaic zoning laws, was considering changing the rules, South were not punished.&lt;ref name="regains"/&gt;

The ''Foschini Case'' of 1983, where teenage rover/forward, [[Silvio Foschini]] did not want to move to Sydney when South Melbourne did so in 1981/1982 but was refused a clearance to play with [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], declared previously unchallenged zoning an illegal labour market restraint. Although the VFL retained zoning for two more years, it had to radically alter the system of clearances and player contracts, and in 1985, with the competition less competitive than ever (only six clubs had made the Grand Final since 1972), reform of the system of player trading began. Zoning was replaced with a [[AFL draft|player draft]], which studies have shown to be much more effective at equalising club strength than country zoning ever was.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In competitions such as the SANFL and [[West Australian Football League|WAFL]], however, country and metropolitan zoning are still used today, despite the declarations concerning their use in the VFL. The SANFL, which introduced country zoning of [[South Australia]] in 1973 has made efforts to make country zoning less inflexible than it proved in the VFL though making provisions for the adjustment of zone boundaries. In the WAFL, however, there is already distinct concern country zoning is creating inequalities in available talent.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Next Generation Academies==
In 2010, the AFL had set up four junior development academies, two each in Queensland and New South Wales, which were run by the AFL clubs based in those states ({{AFL BL}}, {{AFL GC}}, {{AFL GWS}} and {{AFL Syd}}). The academies were designed to aid the development of junior footballers from the states traditionally dominated by rugby league. The AFL club which ran each academy was afforded priority access (but not exclusive access) to draft graduates from their academies, providing a direct incentive for those AFL clubs to invest in junior development which would not otherwise have existed under the draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neafl.com.au/index.php?id=114|title=AFL Academy Programs|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2015, the AFL developed a plan to enable all AFL clubs to establish similar academies, known as 'Next Generation Academies', with each club allocated a zone and juniors qualifying residentially. This was designed to give all clubs an incentive to invest directly in junior development, particularly focussing on diverse and indigenous backgrounds. As with the northern clubs' academies, a club will have the ability to draft its academy's graduates with a discounted draft pick, but will not have exclusive recruitment rights. In February 2016, the AFL announced the allocation of Victorian and Northern Territorian zones amongst the ten Victorian clubs; unlike historical zones, not all clubs were given both a metropolitan and a country zone, with most clubs receiving either one or the other. These academies will be established in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/2016-02-04/blues-allocated-region-for-academy|title=Blues allocated region for academy|date=4 February 2016|accessdate=6 February 2016|author=Peter Ryan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Australian and Western Australian AFL clubs ({{AFL Ade}}, {{AFL PA}}, {{AFL Fre}} and {{AFL WC}}) were designated [[SANFL]] and [[Western Australian Football League|WAFL]] clubs and their respective country and metropolitan zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2016-04-12/sa-and-wa-clubs-get-their-indigenous-and-multicultural-zones|title=SA, WA clubs get indigenous, multicultural zones|date=12 April 2016|accessdate=29 March 2018|author=Callum Twomey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
