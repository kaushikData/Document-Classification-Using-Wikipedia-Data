      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">In geophysics, '''admittance''' describes the small effects of atmospheric pressure on earth gravity.  Studies have also been carried out regarding the gravity of Venus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1029/2003JE002171|title=Admittance survey of type 1 coronae on Venus|year=2004|last1=Hoogenboom|first1=Trudi|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Admittance in geophysics takes atmospheric pressure as the input and measures small changes in the gravitational field as the output.  Geophysics admittance is commonly measured in μGal/mbar.  These units convert according to  1 Gal&amp;nbsp;= 0.01&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 bar&amp;nbsp;= 100 kPa, so in SI units the measurement would be in units of;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2}{\mathrm{Pa}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^2}{\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{m}^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{m}^3}{\mathrm{N}\cdot \mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; or, in primary units &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{m}^2}{\mathrm{kg}}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the relationship is not a straightforward one of proportionality.  Rather, an ''admittance function'' is described which is time and frequency dependent in a complex way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Abd El-Gelil|author2 =Pagiatakis|author3 =El-Rabbany |title=Atmospheric Air Density Admittance Function for High Precision Gravity Reduction|journal=Elements: the newsletter of the Canadian Geophysical Union|volume =24 |issue= 2|date=July 2006|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.90.4441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plateau formed {{Ma|100|94|Ma}} together with [[Northeast Georgia Rise]] and [[Maud Rise]] (now located near the Falkland Island and Antarctica respectively) when the region passed over the [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet hotspot]].&lt;ref name="G, U-N-2001-intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann|2001|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann|2001|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011-timing"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Grobys|2011|loc=Timing and extent of Large Igneous Province formation, pp. 384-385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

===History of research===
The Agulhas Plateau is one of the key structures in the reconstruction of the [[Gondwana#Breakup|Gondwana break-up]].  It was first mapped in 1964 (i.e. part of what would become the [[Bruce C. Heezen|Heezen]]-[[Marie Tharp|Tharp]] map of the world's ocean floor finally published in 1977), but its crustal composition, paleoposition, and geological origin remained enigmatic for decades.&lt;ref name="U-N, G-1999-intro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G, U-N-2001-intro" /&gt;

The boundary between the Earth's crust and the mantle (the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]]) rises from {{Convert|25|to|15|km|abbr=on}} between the [[Agulhas Bank]] (south of South Africa) and the Agulhas passage (south of the bank), typical for a [[Continent-ocean boundary|continent-ocean transition]].  The [[Agulhas Passage]] consists of 120-160 Ma-old oceanic crust, whereas the 100-80 Ma-old Agulhas Plateau rises {{Convert|2.5|km|abbr=on}} above the surrounding ocean floor while the Moho dips to between {{Convert|20|-|22|km|abbr=on}} below it.&lt;ref name="Stan-Wit-2013"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stankiewicz|de Wit|2013|loc=1.6. Oceanic crust, p. 683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The morphology of the [[Basement (geology)|basement]] below the northern plateau is irregular, suggestive of an [[Oceanic crust|oceanic]] origin.  The basement below the southern plateau, however, is smooth, which has been interpreted as indicative of a possible [[Continental crust|continental]] origin.  [[Ocean Drilling Program|ODP]] drilling at the [[Northeast Georgia Rise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ciesielski|Kristoffersen|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; (north-east of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]) indicated that the Agulhas Plateau and the rise formed together and must have an oceanic origin.&lt;ref name="G, U-N-2001-intro" /&gt;  Some researchers, nevertheless, remained convinced that the plateau was at least partly of continental origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucholke|Houtz|Barrett|1981|loc=Discussion, p. 3800}}; {{Harvnb|Ben-Avraham|Hartnady|le Roex|1995|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over several decades analyses of [[geoid]], [[Magsat|MAGSAT]], [[gravity anomaly|gravitational]], and [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] data collected across the plateau were used as arguments for both an oceanic and a continental origin.&lt;ref name="G, U-N-2001-intro" /&gt;

{{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|Ehrhardt|1999}} finally could present seismic evidence that showed that the Agulhas Plateau was a [[large igneous province]] (LIP) made entirely of oceanic crust.&lt;ref name="U-N, G-1999-Abst"&gt;{{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|Ehrhardt|1999|loc=Abstract, p. 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large igneous province===
The Agulhas Plateau is the remaining core of a large-scale volcanism that started in the [[Lazarev Sea]] (today off Antarctica) with the emplacement of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo basalts]] 184 Ma.&lt;ref name="König-Jokat-2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|König|Jokat|2010|loc=Fig. 16; Conclusion, pp. 177-178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process continued with the formation of the [[Mozambique Ridge]] (MOZR)-Agulhas Plateau LIP which was active in phases between 140-95 Ma.  This formation coincides with the formation of the [[Kerguelen Plateau|Kerguelen-Heard Plateau]].&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011-Abst"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|Grobys|2011|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MOZR formed 140-122 Ma and must have reached its maximum extent about 120 Ma while the spreading zone between Africa and Antarctica was located under its eastern flank.&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011-timing" /&gt;

The [[South Atlantic Ocean]] started to open-up 130 Ma when the Falkland Plateau moved westwards along what was becoming the [[Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone]] (AFFZ).  In the wake of the Falkland Plateau, during the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Cretaceous quiet interval]], first the [[Natal Valley]] formed, then the [[Transkei Basin]], a process completed 90 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Huhn|2009|loc=Geological background pp. 65-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process continued with the formation of the Agulhas Plateau—[[Northeast Georgia Rise]]—[[Maud Rise]] LIP (AP-NEGR-MR LIP or Southeast African LIP) at the end of the [[Early Cretaceous]] (100 Ma).&lt;ref name="Parsiegla-etal-2008-Fig12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Parsiegla|Gohl|Uenzelmann-Neben|2008|loc=Fig. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AP-NEGR-MR LIP formed when the region passed over the Bouvet hotspot.  About 94 Ma the main eruption ended and seafloor spreading detached the NEGR and MR from the AP.  Before this separation the AP-NEGR-MR LIP consisted of {{Convert|1.2|e6km2|abbr=on}} of oceanic plateau.&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011-timing" /&gt;

The MOZR and AP are today connected by a crustal corridor, the Transkei Rise, which rises {{Convert|500|-|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the surrounding ocean floor.  This rise is thought to be the product of continuous but reduced volcanism during the 20 Ma period between the formation of the MOZR-AP LIP and AP-NEGR-MR LIP.&lt;ref name="Gohl-etal-2011-timing" /&gt;

Volcanic layers on the southern Agulhas Plateau where later overlaid by sediments in which traces of either sub-areal or shallow marine erosions indicate that the plateau was near sea-level.&lt;ref name="U-N, G-1999-concl"&gt;{{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Gohl|Ehrhardt|1999|loc=Conclusions, pp. 1943-1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern Africa experienced two periods of [[erosion]] and [[denudation]] during the Early and Mid-late Cretaceous.  The driving forces behind these events is poorly understood, but both periods coincide with LIP formation: the first period (130-120 Ma) coincides with the initial stages of the Gondwana break-up and the second period (100-90 Ma) with the formation of the Agulhas LIP.  Somehow, these two events led to the Mesozoic uplift of southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tinker|de Wit|Brown|2008|loc=Regional implications and discussion, p. 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanography==
The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] (AABW) flows north-eastward into the Transkei Basin throw the Agulhas Passage and across the southern margin of the Agulhas Plateau.  AABW then flows into the Mozambique Basin.  Palaeoceanographic evidences show the presence of proto-AABW during the [[Oligocene]] (34-23 Ma) and that proto-AABW was strengthened 15 Ma and deflected southward by the increased flow of [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW).  NADW flows north of the Agulhas Plateau through the Agulhas Passage into the Transkei Basin where it splits in two and continues into the Natal valley and the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name="Uenzel-etal-2009-2011"&gt;{{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Huhn|2009|loc=Oceanographic setting, pp. 66-67}}; {{Harvnb|Uenzelmann-Neben|Watkeys|Kretzinger|Frank|2011|loc=Geological and Oceanographic Background, p. 451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antarctic Intermediate Water]] (AAIW) originates at the water surface around Antarctica and flows northward into the Indian Ocean.  At {{Convert|1500|m|abbr=on}}, it then flows westward along the African east-coast and the Agulhas Bank before retroflecting eastward across the Agulhas Plateau into the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name="Uenzel-etal-2009-2011" /&gt;

The [[Agulhas Current]], the [[western boundary current]] of the Indian Ocean, retroflects abruptly into the Indian Ocean south-west of South Africa and becomes the [[Agulhas Return Current]].  Over the Agulhas Plateau the return current forms a major northward loop to bypass it.&lt;ref name="Uenzel-etal-2009-2011" /&gt;

In the ancient [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]], '''''ambrosia''''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|m|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|ʒ|ə}}, {{lang-grc|ἀμβροσία, "immortality"}}) is sometimes the food or drink of the Greek gods,&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ambrosia |volume=1 |page=800}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depicted as conferring [[longevity]] or [[immortality]] upon whoever consumed it.&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Griffiths  | first = Alan H.  | contribution = Ambrosia  | year = 1996  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | isbn = 0-19-521693-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was brought to the gods in [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] by [[doves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xii.62&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ambrosia'' is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a [[nymph]] labeled with that name.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth E. Leader-Newby, ''Silver and Society in Late Antiquity: Functions and Meanings of Silver Plate in the Fourth to Seventh Centuries'' (Ashgate, 2004), p. 133; Christine Kondoleon, ''Domestic and Divine: Roman Mosaics in the House of Dionysos'' (Cornell University Press, 1995), p. 246; Katherine M. D. Dunbabin, ''Mosaics of the Greek and Roman World'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 136, 142, 276–277.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[#Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia|myth of Lycurgus]], an opponent to the wine god [[Dionysus]], violence committed against Ambrosia turns her into a grapevine.

==Definition==
{{For|its Indian equivalent|Amrita}}
Ambrosia is very closely related to the gods' other form of sustenance, ''[[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]]''. The two terms may not have originally been distinguished;&lt;ref&gt;"Attempts to draw any significant distinctions between the functions of nectar and ambrosia have failed." Clay, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; though in [[Homer]]'s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods; it was with ambrosia Hera "cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh",&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' xiv.170&lt;/ref&gt; and with ambrosia Athena prepared [[Penelope]] in her sleep,&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' xviii.188ff&lt;/ref&gt; so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors, the effects of years had been stripped away, and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her. On the other hand, in [[Alcman]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcman]], fragment 42&lt;/ref&gt; nectar is the food, and in [[Sappho]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sappho]], fragment 141 LP&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anaxandrides]], ambrosia is the drink.&lt;ref&gt;When Anaxandrides says "I eat nectar and drink ambrosia", though, Wright, p. 5, suggested he was using comic inversion.&lt;/ref&gt; A character in [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights|Knights]]'' says, "I dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head—out of a ladle." Both descriptions could be correct, as ambrosia could be a liquid considered a food (such as [[honey]]).

The consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings. Upon his assumption into immortality on Olympus, [[Heracles]] is given ambrosia by [[Athena]], while the hero [[Tydeus]] is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains. In one version of the myth of [[Tantalus]], part of Tantalus' crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself, he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' 1. 50. ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins, but [[ichor]] the blood of immortals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' v. 340, 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant, and may be used as [[perfume]]: in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' Menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins, "and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore; but the goddess saved us; she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils."&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' iv.444–46&lt;/ref&gt; Homer speaks of ambrosial raiment, ambrosial locks of hair, even the gods' ambrosial sandals.

Among later writers, ''ambrosia'' has been so often used with generic meanings of "delightful liquid" that such late writers as [[Athenaeus]], [[Saint Paul|Paul]]us and [[Dioscurides]] employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;In Athenaeus, a sauce of oil, water and fruit juice.&lt;/ref&gt; medicine,&lt;ref name="In Paulus, a medicinal draught"&gt;In Paulus, a medicinal draught.&lt;/ref&gt; and botany.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dioscurides remarked its Latin name was ''ros marinus'', "sea-dew", or [[rosemary]]; these uses were noted by Wright 1917:6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny]] used the term in connection with different plants, as did early herbalists.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;"Ambrosia" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some modern [[Ethnomycology|ethnomycologists]], such as [[Danny Staples]], identify ambrosia with the [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] mushroom ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'': "it was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices", Staples asserts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Carl A.P. Ruck and Danny Staples, ''The World of Classical Myth'' 1994:26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. H. Roscher]] thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of [[honey]], in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey,&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which is in fact anti-septic, and because fermented honey ([[mead]]) preceded [[wine]] as an [[entheogen]] in the Aegean world; on some Minoan seals, goddesses were represented with [[bee]] faces (compare [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]] and [[Melissa]]).

== Etymology ==
The concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] areas: Greek and [[Sanskrit]]. The Greek ἀμβροσία (''ambrosia'') is semantically linked to the Sanskrit {{lang-sa2|अमृत}} (''[[amṛta]]'') as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form *''ṇ-mṛ-tós'', "un-dying"&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=J. P. |last1=Mallory |editor-first1=J. P. |editor-last1=Mallory |editor-first2=Douglas Q. |editor-last2=Adams |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]] |title=Sacred drink |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1997 |page=538}} Mallory also connects to this root an Avestan word, and notes that the root is "dialectally restricted to the IE southeast".&lt;/ref&gt; (''n-'': negative prefix from which the prefix ''a-'' in both Greek and Sanskrit are derived; ''mṛ'': [[Ablaut|zero grade]] of *''mer-'', "to die"; and ''-to-'': adjectival suffix). A semantically similar etymology exists for [[Nectar#Etymology|nectar]], the beverage of the gods (Greek: νέκταρ ''néktar'') presumed to be a compound of the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] roots ''*nek-'', "death", and ''-*tar'', "overcoming".

== Other examples in mythology ==
[[File:Johann Balthasar Probst 002.jpg|thumb|Thetis anoints Achilles with ambrosia, by [[Johann Balthasar Probst]] (1673–1748)]]
*In one version of the story of the birth of [[Achilles]], [[Thetis]] anoints the infant with ambrosia and passes the child through the fire to make him immortal but [[Peleus]], appalled, stops her, leaving only his heel unimmortalised (''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869-879).
*In the ''[[Iliad]]'' xvi, [[Apollo]] washes the black blood from the corpse of [[Sarpedon]] and anoints it with ambrosia, readying it for its dreamlike return to Sarpedon's native [[Lycia]]. Similarly, [[Thetis]] anoints the corpse of [[Patroclus]] in order to preserve it. Additionally, both ambrosia and nectar are depicted as [[unguent]]s (xiv. 170; xix. 38).
*In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] is described as having "spread a table with ambrosia and set it by [[Hermes]], and mixed the rosy-red nectar."  It is ambiguous whether he means the ambrosia itself is rosy-red, or if he is describing a rosy-red nectar Hermes drinks along with the ambrosia.  Later, [[Circe]] mentions to [[Odysseus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' xii.62: "the trembling doves that carry ambrosia to Father Zeus."&lt;/ref&gt; that a flock of doves are the bringers of ambrosia to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].
*In the ''Odyssey'' (ix.345&amp;ndash;359), [[Polyphemus]] likens the wine given to him by [[Odysseus]] to ambrosia and nectar.
*One of the impieties of [[Tantalus]], according to [[Pindar]], was that he offered to his guests the ambrosia of the Deathless Ones, a theft akin to that of [[Prometheus]], [[Karl Kerenyi]] noted (in ''Heroes of the Greeks''){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.
*In the [[Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]], the goddess uses "ambrosial bridal oil that she had ready perfumed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Homeric hymns; Homeric apocrypha; Lives of Homer|date=2014|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780674996069}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the story of ''[[Cupid and Psyche]]'' as told by [[Apuleius]], Psyche is given ambrosia upon her completion of the quests set by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and her acceptance on Olympus.  After she partakes, she and Cupid are wed as gods.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Esoteric Codex: Magic Objects I|last=Rogers|first=Mark|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=1312114568|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some ancient Egyptian statues of [[Anubis]] read,"...I am death...I eat ambrosia and drink blood..." which hints that ambrosia is a food of some sort.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In the ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Aeneas]] encounters his mother in an alternate, or illusory form. When she became her godly form "Her hair's ambrosia breathed a holy fragrance." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Illustrations of the Holy Scriptures, derived principally from the manners, customs, rites, traditions and works of art and literature, of the eastern nations|author=Harmer|author2=Burder|author3=Paxton|author4=Roberts|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=[[Brattleboro Typographic Company]]|year=1839|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lycurgus of Thrace, an antagonist of [[Dionysus]], forbade the cult of Dionysus, whom he drove from [[Thrace]], and was driven mad by the god. In his fit of insanity he killed his son, whom he mistook for a stock of mature [[ivy]], and the nymph Ambrosia, who was transformed into the [[Vitis|grapevine]].

==Features==
The centre complex was officially opened in July 2009, after three years of construction, at a cost of just under €7 million.

===Building===
The contemporary building was designed by QVE Arquitectos of [[Madrid]], Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-architect.co.uk/spain/ataria_vitoria.htm |title=Ataria Vitoria, Building Spain, Centro de Interpretación de la Naturaleza de Salburúa |first= |last= |work=e-architect.co.uk |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shortlisted for the [[World Architecture Festival]] in 2008&lt;ref name=wbd /&gt; and nominated for the "Mies Arch Award" in 2009.&lt;ref name=miesa&gt;{{cite web|title=ATARIA - Nature Interpretation Centre of Salburúa |url=http://www.miesarch.com/index.php?option=com_mipress_anterior&amp;cerca=ataria&amp;autor=-1&amp;tipologia=-1&amp;classificacio=-1&amp;pais=-1&amp;edicio=-1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129053659/http://www.miesarch.com/index.php?option=com_mipress_anterior&amp;cerca=ataria&amp;autor=-1&amp;tipologia=-1&amp;classificacio=-1&amp;pais=-1&amp;edicio=-1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2013 |publisher=Mies Arch |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction is considered unique in that the building extends over the wetlands it examines.&lt;ref name=biop&gt;{{cite book|last=Beatley|first=Timothy|title=Biophilic Cities: Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning|year=2010|publisher=Island Press|pages=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9Y4z68WSgUC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=ataria+salburua&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RzWTT8ezC-T66QG2g9SeBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ataria%20salburua&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100,000 visits to the centre were recorded in the first year of operation.&lt;ref name=DDN/&gt;

The building houses an [[auditorium]], interactive exhibits, classrooms and laboratories for educational use, a café, and offices for the Vitoria-Gasteiz Centre for Environmental Studies.&lt;ref name=wbd&gt;{{cite web|title=ATARIA - Centro de Interpretación de la Naturaleza de Salburúa |url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=1009 |work=World Buildings Directory |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-news-archives-2009-urban-wetlands-how-to/main/ramsar/1-26-45-84%5E24039_4000_0__ |title= Urban wetlands – how to implement Resolution X.27 |first= Tobias |last= Salathé |work=ramsar.org |date=16  September 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observation deck===
A [[cantilever]]ed observation deck, {{convert|19.2|m|ft}} long, allows visitors to look out over the marshlands. The enclosed walkway [[Deck (building)|deck]] was constructed of [[laminated veneer lumber]] and steel bar trusses. Concrete and steel anchors transfer the force to the ground. The structure was described as "singular" in a paper by Professor J. L. Fernández-Cabo, who compared it to the large cantilevered timber roof of a pavilion at Hanover fairgrounds.&lt;ref name=Cabo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernández-Cabo |first=José L. |title=A timber cantilevered view walkway in Vitoria, Spain |journal=Proceedings of the ICE - Construction Materials |date=1 November 2009 |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=167–174 |doi=10.1680/coma.2009.162.4.167 |url=http://www.ewpa.com/Archive/2008/june/Paper_265.pdf |accessdate=23 April 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015004/http://www.ewpa.com/Archive/2008/june/Paper_265.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All vectors are unit length. &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt; points toward the light source. &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; points toward the viewer (camera). &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the surface normal.]]

The '''bidirectional reflectance distribution function''' ('''BRDF'''; &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is a function of four real variables that defines how light is reflected at an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface. It is employed in the [[optics]] of real-world light, in [[computer graphics]] algorithms, and in [[computer vision]] algorithms. The function takes an incoming light direction, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt;, and outgoing direction, &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; (taken in a coordinate system where the [[Normal (geometry)|surface normal]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt; lies along the ''z''-axis), and returns the ratio of reflected [[radiance]] exiting along &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[irradiance]] incident on the surface from direction &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt;. Each direction &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is itself [[Spherical coordinate system|parameterized by]] [[azimuth angle]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and [[zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, therefore the BRDF as a whole is a function of  4 variables. The BRDF has units sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, with [[steradian]]s (sr) being a unit of [[solid angle]].

==Definition==
The BRDF was first defined by Fred Nicodemus around 1965.&lt;ref name='nicodemus_1965'&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}}) \,=\, \frac{\operatorname dL_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{r}})}{\operatorname dE_{\text{i}}(\omega_{\text{i}})} \,=\, \frac{\operatorname dL_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{r}})}{L_{\text{i}}(\omega_{\text{i}})\cos\theta_{\text{i}}\,\operatorname d\omega_{\text{i}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[radiance]], or [[power (physics)|power]] per unit [[solid angle|solid-angle]]-in-the-direction-of-a-ray per unit [[projected area|projected-area]]-perpendicular-to-the-ray, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is [[irradiance]], or power per unit ''surface area'', and &lt;math&gt;\theta_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\text{i}}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[surface normal]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n&lt;/math&gt;. The index &lt;math&gt;\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; indicates incident light, whereas the index &lt;math&gt;\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; indicates reflected light.

The reason the function is defined as a quotient of two [[Differential of a function|differentials]] and not directly as a quotient between the undifferentiated quantities, is because other irradiating light than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname dE_{\text{i}}(\omega_{\text{i}})&lt;/math&gt;, which are of no interest for &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt;, might illuminate the surface which would unintentionally affect &lt;math&gt;L_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt;, whereas &lt;math&gt;\operatorname dL_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt; is only affected by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname dE_{\text{i}}(\omega_{\text{i}})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Related functions==

The '''Spatially Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function''' (SVBRDF) is a 6-dimensional function, &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{r}},\,\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; describes a 2D location over an object's surface.

The '''Bidirectional Texture Function''' ([[Bidirectional texture function|BTF]]) is appropriate for modeling non-flat surfaces, and has the same parameterization as the SVBRDF; however in contrast, the BTF includes non-local scattering effects like shadowing, masking, interreflections or [[subsurface scattering]]. The functions defined by the BTF at each point on the surface are thus called '''Apparent BRDFs'''.

The '''Bidirectional Surface Scattering Reflectance Distribution Function''' ([[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|BSSRDF]]), is a further generalized 8-dimensional function &lt;math&gt;S(\mathbf{x}_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\mathbf{x}_{\text{r}},\,\omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt; in which light entering the surface may scatter internally and exit at another location.

In all these cases, the dependence on the [[wavelength]] of light has been ignored and binned into [[RGB]] channels. In reality, the BRDF is wavelength dependent, and to account for effects such as [[iridescence]] or [[luminescence]] the dependence on wavelength must be made explicit: &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\lambda_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\lambda_{\text{r}},\,\omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt;. Note that in the typical case where all optical elements are [[linear optics|linear]], the function will obey &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\lambda_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\lambda_{\text{r}},\,\omega_{\text{r}}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; except when &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\text{i}} = \lambda_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt;: that is, it will only emit light at wavelength equal to the incoming light. In this case it can be paramaterized as &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\lambda,\,\omega_{\text{i}},\,\omega_{\text{r}})&lt;/math&gt;, with only one wavelength parameter.

==Physically based BRDFs==

Physically realistic BRDFs have additional properties,&lt;ref name='Duvenhage_2013'&gt;

* positivity: &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}}) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;
* obeying [[Helmholtz reciprocity]]: &lt;math&gt;f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}}) = f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{r}},\, \omega_{\text{i}})&lt;/math&gt;
* conserving energy: &lt;math&gt;\forall \omega_{\text{i}},\, \int_\Omega f_{\text{r}}(\omega_{\text{i}},\, \omega_{\text{r}})\,\cos{\theta_{\text{r}}} d\omega_{\text{r}} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The BRDF is a fundamental [[radiometric]] concept, and accordingly is used in [[computer graphics]] for [[Rendering (computer graphics)|photorealistic rendering]] of synthetic scenes (see the [[rendering equation]]), as well as in [[computer vision]] for many [[inverse problem]]s such as [[object recognition]]. BRDF has also been used for modeling light trapping in [[solar cell]]s (e.g. using the [[OPTOS formalism]]) or low concentration [[solar photovoltaic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Rob W.; Pollard, Andrew; Pearce, Joshua M., "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744136 Photovoltaic system performance enhancement with non-tracking planar concentrators: Experimental results and BRDF based modelling]," Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC), 2013 IEEE 39th, pp.0229,0234, 16–21 June 2013. doi: 10.1109/PVSC.2013.6744136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/16836963/Photovoltaic_System_Performance_Enhancement_With_Non-Tracking_Planar_Concentrators_Experimental_Results_and_Bi-Directional_Reflectance_Function_BDRF_Based_Modelling  Andrews, R.W.; Pollard, A.; Pearce, J.M., "Photovoltaic System Performance Enhancement With Nontracking Planar Concentrators: Experimental Results and Bidirectional Reflectance Function (BDRF)-Based Modeling]," ''IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics'' 5(6), pp.1626–1635 (2015). DOI: 10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2478064&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of satellite remote sensing, NASA uses a BRDF model to characterise surface anisotropy. For a given land area, the BRDF is established based on selected multiangular observations of surface reflectance. While single observations depend on view geometry and solar angle, the MODIS BRDF/Albedo product describes intrinsic surface properties in several spectral bands, at a resolution of 500 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/brdf.html|title=BRDF/Albedo|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center|access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BRDF/Albedo product can be used to model surface [[albedo]] depending on atmospheric scattering.

==Models==
BRDFs can be measured directly from real objects using calibrated cameras and lightsources;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rusinkiewicz, S. |title=A Survey of BRDF Representation for Computer Graphics |accessdate=2007-09-05 |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/cs348c-97/surveypaper.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many phenomenological and [[analytic model]]s have been proposed including the [[Lambertian reflectance]] model frequently assumed in computer graphics. Some useful features of recent models include:

* accommodating [[anisotropic]] reflection
* editable using a small number of intuitive parameters
* accounting for [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel effects]] at grazing angles
* being well-suited to [[Monte Carlo method]]s.

W. Matusik et al. found that interpolating between measured samples produced realistic results and was easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Matusik, Hanspeter Pfister, Matt Brand, and Leonard McMillan.

In: GraphiCon'2009.; 2009. p. 198-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
Traditionally, BRDF measurement devices called [[Gonioreflectometer|gonioreflectometers]] employ one or more goniometric arms to position a light source and a detector at various directions from a flat sample of the material to be measured. To measure a full BRDF, this process must be repeated many times, moving the light source each time to measure a different incidence angle.&lt;ref&gt;Marschner S.R., Westin S.H., Lafortune E.P.F., Torrance K.E., Greenberg D.P. (1999) Image-Based BRDF Measurement Including Human Skin. In: Lischinski D., Larson G.W. (eds) Rendering Techniques’ 99. Eurographics. Springer, Vienna

&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, using such a device to densely measure the BRDF is very time consuming. One of the first improvements on these techniques used a half-silvered mirror and a digital camera to take many BRDF samples of a planar target at once. Since this work, many researchers have developed other devices for efficiently acquiring BRDFs from real world samples, and it remains an active area of research.

There is an alternative way to measure BRDF based on [[High Dynamic Range Imaging|HDR images]]. The standard algorithm is to measure the BRDF point cloud from images and optimize it by one of the BRDF models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebedev.as/index.php?p=1_7_BRDFRecon BRDFRecon project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706085118/http://lebedev.as/index.php?p=1_7_BRDFRecon |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Run State Park''' is a public recreation area located at the northern end of the [[Savage River Reservoir]], an impoundment of the [[Savage River (Maryland)|Savage River]], in [[Garrett County, Maryland|Garrett County]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The [[state park]] occupies {{convert|300|acre}} in [[Savage River State Forest]] and encompasses the confluence of Monroe Run and Big Run.&lt;ref name=wildernet/&gt; Park activities include boating, fishing, hiking, picknicking, and camping.

==History==
The park originated as the {{convert|50|acre|adj=on}} Big Run Recreation Area. In 1952, the Maryland State Planning Commission recommended that the "lightly used" recreation area be expanded to take advantage of its location on the reservoir that had been newly created on the Savage River.&lt;ref name=masterplan/&gt;

==Ecology==
;Climate
The park's climate is similar to mountain weather; cold winters accompanied by mild, humid summers. The park is located within the Western Appalachian Plateau, which gives rise to colder temperatures.&lt;ref name="Overview Big Run" /&gt; The [[Savage River Reservoir]] rests in a canyon that experiences high winds, contributing to the weather changes.&lt;ref name="Trail Guide"/&gt;
*Average coolest month: January (30-34&amp;nbsp;°F)
*Average warmest month: July (74-80&amp;nbsp;°F)
*Average wettest month: May&lt;ref name="Overview Big Run" /&gt;
;Wildlife
Red-tailed hawk, broad-winged hawk, great-horned owl, screech owl, songbirds, indigo bunting and other forest interior dwellers can be spotted within Big Run.&lt;ref name="Mt. Aetna"/&gt; Black bear, bobcat, white-tailed deer and raccoon are among the park's mammalian inhabitants. Grouse, great blue herons, minks, and ducks may be seen seasonally along the reservoir edge.&lt;ref name="Trail Guide" /&gt;
;Flora
The park's forests contain oak, hickory and native hardwoods.&lt;ref name="Trail Guide" /&gt; [[Trout lilies]] and spring beauties bloom in April, [[trilliums]] and lady slippers in the months of May and June, while rhododendrons, [[bee balm]] and cardinal flowers bloom in July.&lt;ref name="Mt. Aetna" /&gt;

==Activities and amenities==
The park is accessible on New Germany Road from Interstate 68, Exit 24. It offers primitive campsites, group campsites, youth group campsite, and pavilions. Picnicking facilities are located in the park's day use area. The Savage River Reservoir is used for non-motorized boating, electric motoring, and fishing. Facilities include a boat ramp. Fishermen may find walleye, largemouth bass, crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, suckers and trout. The Monroe Run hiking trail and other trails are accessible from the state park.&lt;ref name=mdnr/&gt; The adjacent Savage River State Forest has trails for multi-purpose use including snowshoeing or snowmobiling.&lt;ref name="Trail Guide"/&gt;

A '''binary cycle power plant''' is a type of [[geothermal power]] plant that allows cooler [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] reservoirs to be used than is necessary for [[dry steam plant|dry steam]] and [[Geothermal electricity#Flash steam power plants|flash steam plant]]s. As of 2010, flash steam plants are the most common type of geothermal power generation plants in operation today, which use water at temperatures greater than {{Convert|182|C|K F}} that is pumped under high pressure to the generation equipment at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/powerplants.html|title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Hydrothermal Power Systems|date=2010-07-06|work=Geothermal Technologies Program: Technologies|publisher=U.S. DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)|accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With binary cycle geothermal power plants, [[pump]]s are used to pump hot water from a geothermal well, through a [[heat exchanger]], and the cooled water is returned to the underground reservoir. A second "working" or "binary" fluid with a low [[boiling point]], typically a [[butane]] or [[pentane]] [[hydrocarbon]], is pumped at fairly high pressure ({{Convert|500|psi|MPa|lk=on|abbr=on}}){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} through the heat exchanger, where it is vaporized and then directed through a [[turbine]]. The vapor exiting the turbine is then condensed by cold air [[radiator]]s or cold water and cycled back through the heat exchanger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brighthub.com/environment/renewable-energy/articles/53953.aspx| title=Geothermal Energy Power Plants and How They Produce Green Electricity| first=Willie| last=Scott| date=15 November 2010| publisher=Bright Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A binary vapor cycle is defined in thermodynamics as a power cycle that is a combination of two cycles, one in a high temperature region and the other in a lower temperature region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Çengel, Yunus A. |author2=Michael A. Boles  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach, Seventh Edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston|year=2002 |pages=Chapter 10 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction to Binary Cycles==
The use of mercury-water cycles in the United States can be dated back to the late 1920s. A small mercury-water plant which produced about 40 megawatts (MW) was in use in New Hampshire in the 1950s, with a higher [[thermal efficiency]] than most of the power plants in use during the 1950s. Unfortunately, binary vapor cycles have a high initial cost and so they are not as economically attractive.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[Çengel, Yunus A., and Michael A. Boles. "Chapter 10: Vapor and Combined Power Cycles."Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach. 7th ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2002. 557-89. Print.], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the optimal working fluid to use in vapor cycles because it is the closest to an ideal working fluid that is currently available. The binary cycle is a process designed to overcome the imperfections of water as a working fluid. The cycle uses two fluids in an attempt to approach an ideal working fluid.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

== Characteristics of Optimal Working Fluids&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; ==

Finding the optimal [[working fluids]] has pivotal importance, since they make a significant impact on the performance of binary cycles.

#	A high critical temperature and maximum pressure
#	Low [[Properties of water#Triple point|triple-point]] temperature
#	A condenser pressure that is not too low (a substance with a saturation pressure at the ambient temperature is too low)
#	A high [[enthalpy of vaporization]] (hfg)
#	A saturation dome that resembles an inverted U
#	High thermal conductivity (good heat transfer characteristics)
#	Other properties: nontoxic, inert,  inexpensive, and readily available

==Systems==

===Rankine Vapor Cycle===
The Rankine cycle is the ideal form of a vapor power cycle. The ideal conditions can be reached by superheating the steam in the boiler and condensing it completely in the condenser. The ideal Rankine cycle does not involve any internal irreversibilities and consists of four processes; isentropic compression in a pump, constant pressure heat addition in a boiler, isentropic expansion in a turbine, and constant pressure heat rejection in a condenser.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

===Dual Pressure===
This process is designed to reduce the thermodynamic losses incurred in the brine heat exchangers of the basic cycle. The losses occur through the process of transferring heat across a large temperature difference between the high temperature brine and the lower temperature of the working fluid. Losses are reduced by maintaining a closer match between the brine cooling curve and the working fluid heating curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ronald DiPippo |title=Geothermal Power Plants: Principles, Applications, Case Studies and Environmental Impact |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |location=Amsterdam|year=2008 |pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dual Fluid===
“Power is extracted from a stream of hot fluid, such as geothermal water, by passing the stream in heat exchange relationship with a working fluid to vaporize the latter, expanding the vapor through a turbine, and condensing the vapor in a conventional Rankine cycle. Additional power is obtained in a second Rankine cycle by employing a portion of the hot fluid after heat exchange with the working fluid to vaporize a second working fluid having a lower boiling point and higher vapor density than the first fluid.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3795103.html|title=DUAL FLUID CYCLE|year=1974|work=United States, Patent No.3795103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boleslav Vladimirovich Likhterman''' (1902–1967) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[medical researcher]]. He is best remembered as a pioneer in the use of high frequency electrical currents in the treatment of physical ailments and as an editor of the [[academic journal]] ''Voprosi Kurortologii, Physiotherapii i Lechebnoi Physicheskoi Kultury''&lt;ref&gt;''World Directory of Physical Medicine Specialists'', op. cit., p.133&lt;/ref&gt; (Problems of Balneology, Physiotherapy, and Therapeutic Physical Exercises).

==Biography==

===Early years===

'''Boleslav Vladimirovich Likhterman''' ('''{{lang-ru|Болеслав Владимирович Лихтерман}}''') was born 14 October 1902 New Style, of ethnic [[Jewish]] parents in [[Simferopol]], [[Tavricheskaya Gubernia]], [[Ukraine]], which was then part of the [[Russian empire]]. His father, Vladimir (Wulf) Aaronovich Lichterman ({{lang-ru|Владимир (Вульф) Ааронович Лихтерман}}) was an [[Lawyer|attorney]].

Likhterman attended [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Simferopol until his graduation, at which time he was awarded a gold medal for academic excellence. Following graduation, Likhterman enrolled in the Medical Department of Crimean (Tavrichesky) University, from which he graduated in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

A 13-month stint in the military followed, with Likhterman serving in [[Sevastopol]] as part of the [[Red Fleet]] on the [[Black sea]] ({{lang-ru|Черноморский флот}}).&lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1926, Likhterman married Sara Evseevna Brusilovskaya, who later became a teacher of [[English (language)|English]].

===Medical career===

As 1926 came to a close, Likhterman received his first medical appointment, serving as head of a medical office in [[Belorezk]], [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkiria]], part of the [[Ministry of Health (Soviet Union)|Bashkirian People's Commissariat for Health]].

In June 1928, Likhterman moved to the Sevastopol city polyclinic, where he assumed a position as a [[neurology|neurologist]] and [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]]. He also worked as a consultant for the city's primary hospital. Likhterman remained in this position until the coming of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., pp.63-78&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1929, Boleslav worked at the I.M. Sechenov State Research Institute of Physical Methods of Treatment, founded by Professor Alexander E. Scherbak in Sevastopol. There he was a member of the committee studying the use of short waves as a part of  therapeutic practice. He was made head of the Clinical Department and Neurological Clinic at the Sechenov Institute in 1932, achieving the title of Docent (Associate Professor).

In 1939, Likhterman was awarded the “Excellence in Healthcare” prize by the USSR People's Commissariat of Health.

In September 1941, in light of the invasion of the Soviet Union by [[Nazi Germany]], Likhterman and the rest of the Sechenov Institute was evacuated to [[Kazakhstan]] in Soviet [[Central Asia]]. There Likhterman worked as a chief of the Clinical Department in the hospital for the wounded and as a consultant at the Red Army Central Tuberculosis Sanatorium. His work with the ill took its toll and in 1942 Likhterman himself contracted [[pulmonary tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., pp.79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1943, as the tide of the war began to turn, the Sechenov Institute was transferred west to [[Kislovodsk]] in [[Stavropol Krai]], Russia. In the fall of 1944, the institute was moved back to the Crimea again, this time to the southern resort city of [[Yalta]]. For the next two decades, Likhterman would work as the head of the Neurological Clinic of the renamed I.M. Sechenov Institute of Physical Methods of Treatment and Climatotherapy in Yalta. He became a member of the editorial board of the academic journal “Voprosi Kurortologii, Physiotherapii i Lechebnoi Physicheskoi Kultury” (Problems of Balneology, Physiotherapy, and Therapeutic Physical Exercises) and editor of sections on  [[physiotherapy]] and [[balneology]] for the authoritative ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' as well as the ''[[Small Soviet Encyclopedia]].''&lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., pp.114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 upon the recommendation of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, Boleslav Likhterman was conferred the degree of the Doctor of Medical Sciences for his academic publications to date without a formal defense of a dissertation. He was granted the academic rank of the Professor in Nervous Diseases.

In 1952 for his outstanding service in the field of medical science, Likhterman was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] by the Presidium of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]].

In 1965, Likhterman was elected an honorary member of the All-Union Society of Physiotherapists and Balneologists.

===Death and legacy===

In 1966, Likhterman became ill with [[leukemia]], dying of the disease on 20 January 1967 at Yalta.

Likhterman's remains were interned at the Yalta City Cemetery.

==Works==

Likhterman was the author of 4 [[monograph]]s on medical topics:

* ''О терапевтичском применении коротких волн'' (On the Therapeutic Use of Short Waves). With M.A. Borodina, V.M. Linchenko, and M.M. Orlov. Sevastopol: Sechenov Institute, 1936. This book was in fact the first fundamental guide on the use of short waves in medical [[Dielectric heating|diathermy]] &lt;ref&gt;Likhterman, op. cit., pp.72-73&lt;/ref&gt; and received very positive reviews in several academic journals,.&lt;ref&gt;''Archives of Physical Therapy, X-ray, Radium'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal de Radiologie et d'Electrologie'', op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Лечение больных неврастенией в санаторных условиях Южного берега Крыма (Краткие методические указания)'' (Treatment of Patients with Neurasthenia in Sanatorium Conditions of the Southern Coast of the Crimea: Brief Guidelines). With B.F. Zimovskii. Simferopol: Krymizdat, 1955.
* ''Лечение больных неврастенией в санаторных условиях'' (Treatment of Patients with Neurasthenia in Sanatorium Conditions). With B.F. Zimovskii. Moscow: Medgiz, 1958.
* ''Лечение начального церебрального атеросклероза в санаторных условиях.'' (Treatment of Initial Cerebral Atherosclerosis in Sanatorium Conditions). Posthumous publication, with V.A. Ezhova, E.S. Volkov, and L.A. Kunitsina. Moscow: Meditsina, 1969.

Likhterman also wrote over 100 other scientific works on the role of the nervous system, with an emphasis on matters relating to  [[balneology]] and [[physiotherapy]] in the treatment and prevention of nervous and endocrine disorders. Another important topic of interest for Likhterman was the effects of high and ultrahigh frequency currents on healthy and diseased organisms, research which resulted in the development of various methods for the direct and indirect applications of such electrical energy for medical treatment. In particular, he developed a calcium collar electrode method and studied reflex effects of [[electrophoresis]]. He also studied the effect of energy treatment upon the brain, including the use of such therapies in conjunction with [[spa treatment]], for treatment of  [[neurasthenic]] syndromes, [[trauma (medical)|trauma]] and other disorders.

The '''core–mantle boundary''' (CMB in the parlance of solid earth [[geophysics|geophysicists]]) of the Earth lies between the planet's [[silicate]] [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and its liquid [[iron]]-[[nickel]] [[outer core]]. This boundary is located at approximately 2891&amp;nbsp;km (1796&amp;nbsp;mi) depth beneath the Earth's surface. The boundary is observed via the discontinuity in [[seismic wave]] velocities at that depth due to the differences between the [[Acoustic impedance|acoustic impedances]] of the solid mantle and the molten outer core. [[P-wave]] velocities are much slower in the outer core than in the deep mantle while [[S-wave]]s do not exist at all in the liquid portion of the core.  Recent evidence suggests a distinct boundary layer directly above the CMB possibly made of a novel phase of the basic [[silicate perovskite|perovskite]] mineralogy of the deep mantle named [[post-perovskite]]. [[Seismic tomography]] studies have shown significant irregularities within the boundary zone and appear to be dominated by the African and Pacific [[large low-shear-velocity provinces]] (LLSVPs).&lt;ref name="LLSVP"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lekic, V.|first=|author2=Cottaar, S.|author3=Dziewonski, A.|author4=Romanowicz, B.|last-author-amp=yes|date=|year=2012|title=Cluster analysis of global lower mantle|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12005109|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=357-358|issue=1–3|pages=68-77|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2012.09.014|via=|bibcode=2012E&amp;PSL.357...68L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uppermost section of the outer core is thought to be about 500–1,800 K hotter than the overlying mantle, creating a thermal boundary layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lay|first=Thorne|last2=Hernlund|first2=John|last3=Buffett|first3=Bruce A.|date=2008|title=Core–mantle boundary heat flow|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo.2007.44|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=1|issue=1|pages=25–32|doi=10.1038/ngeo.2007.44|issn=1752-0894|via=|bibcode=2008NatGe...1...25L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary is thought to harbor topography, much like Earth's surface, that is supported by solid-state convection within the overlying mantle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}  Variations in the thermal properties of the core-mantle boundary may affect how the outer core's iron-rich fluids flow, which are ultimately responsible for Earth's magnetic field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== The D″ region ===
The approx. 200&amp;nbsp;km thick layer of the lower mantle directly above the boundary is referred to as the '''D″ region''' ("D double-prime" or "D prime prime") and is sometimes included in discussions regarding the core–mantle boundary zone.&lt;ref name="Peltier"&gt;{{cite book &lt;!--|chapter=Mantle dynamics and the D-doubleprime layer implications of the post-perovskite phase --&gt;|contribution=Mantle Dynamics and the D" Layer: Impacts of the Post Perovskite Phase |author=WR Peltier |url=http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/~peltier/pubs_books/W.R.%20Peltier,%20Mantle%20Dynamics%20and%20the%20D%20doubleprime%20Layer.Implications%20of%20the%20Post-perovskite%20Phase,%20AGU%20Geodynamics%20Series%20Monograph,%20AGU%20Books,%20pages%20217-227,%202007.pdf |year=2007  |pages=217–227 |title=Post-Perovskite: The Last Mantle Phase Transition|work=Volume 174 in AGU Geophysical Monographs|editor1=Kei Hirose |editor2=John Brodholt |editor3=Thome Lay |editor4=David Yuen |isbn=978-0-87590-439-9 |publisher=American Geophysical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D″ name originates from mathematician [[Keith Edward Bullen|Keith Bullen]]'s designations for the Earth's layers. His system was to label each layer alphabetically, A through G, with the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] as 'A' and the inner [[Planetary core|core]] as 'G'. In his 1942 publication of his model, the entire lower mantle was the D&amp;nbsp;layer. In 1950, Bullen found his 'D'&amp;nbsp;layer to actually be two different layers. The upper part of the D layer, about 1800&amp;nbsp;km thick, was renamed D′ (D prime) and the lower part (the bottom 200&amp;nbsp;km) was named D″.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

&lt;!--(Commenting this out until someone can make it make sense.) Slow small-scaled structures have been discovered on the core-mantle boundary; these are dubbed [[Ultra low velocity zone|ultra-low velocity zone]]s (ULVZs). It is suggested that large scale inhomogeneities of D" are formed by high density matter flowing on the core. Correlation between these inhomogeneities (c(ore)-continents)  and position of [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] was found by 
&lt;ref name="Czechowski"&gt;{{cite |title= The Origin of Hotspots and The D” Layer.|author1=Czechowski L.|journal=In: Montag H., Reigber C. (eds) Geodesy and Physics of the Earth. International Association of Geodesy Symposia|volume=112|pages=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Seismic discontinuity===
A '''seismic discontinuity''' occurs within Earth's interior at a depth of about 2,900 km (1,800 mi) below the surface, where there is an abrupt change in the speed of seismic waves (generated by earthquakes or explosions) that travel through Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1981-06-01|title=Preliminary reference Earth model|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031920181900467|journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=297–356|doi=10.1016/0031-9201(81)90046-7|issn=0031-9201|bibcode=1981PEPI...25..297D}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this depth, primary seismic waves (P waves) decrease in velocity while secondary seismic waves (S waves) disappear completely. S waves shear material, and cannot transmit through liquids, so it is thought that the unit above the discontinuity is solid, while the unit below is in a liquid or molten form.

The discontinuity was discovered by [[Beno Gutenberg]] (1889-1960), a seismologist who made several important contributions to the study and understanding of the Earth's interior.  The CMB has also been referred to as the Gutenberg discontinuity, the Oldham-Gutenberg discontinuity, or the Wiechert-Gutenberg discontinuity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.  In modern times, however, the term [[Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary|Gutenberg discontinuity or the "G"]] is most commonly used in reference to a decrease in seismic velocity with depth that is sometimes observed at about 100 km below the Earth's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmerr|first=N.|date=2012-03-22|title=The Gutenberg Discontinuity: Melt at the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1215433|journal=Science|volume=335|issue=6075|pages=1480–1483|doi=10.1126/science.1215433|issn=0036-8075|bibcode=2012Sci...335.1480S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The boundary between the core and the mantle does not remain constant. As the heat of the earth's interior is constantly but slowly dissipated, the molten core within Earth gradually solidifies and shrinks, causing the core mantle boundary to slowly move deeper and deeper within Earth's core.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}--&gt;

'''David Tipling''' is a professional wildlife photographer with an international reputation. His highly distinctive images have earned him many awards and accolades. Sir [[David Bellamy]] described Tipling's photographs in ''The National Parks and other Wild Places of Britain and Ireland'' as "windows of wonder".&lt;ref&gt;''The National Parks and other Wild Places of Britain and Ireland'', Elphick J. and Tipling. D pub. New Holland 2002, Foreword.&lt;/ref&gt;
He has won the documentary award for the European Nature Photographer of the Year for his work on [[emperor penguins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdtfoto.de/content.php?siteloc=151 Link to the 2001 European Nature Photographer of the Year documentary section win]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author or commissioned photographer for more than 30 books that include ''Collins Top Birding Spots in Britain &amp; Ireland'',&lt;ref&gt;''Collins Top Birding Spots in Britain &amp; Ireland'', Tipling D., Collins 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ''The National Parks and Other Wild Places of Britain &amp; Ireland'',&lt;ref&gt;''The National Parks and Other Wild Places of Britain &amp; Ireland'', New Holland Publishers, March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; ''Attracting Wildlife to your Garden'', and most recently ''The RSPB Guide to Digital Wildlife Photography''.&lt;ref&gt;''The RSPB Guide to Digital Wildlife Photography'', Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This information was taken from the ''Birds and People website''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Born in [[Hove]] Sussex, David Tipling was educated at the [[Wildernesse School]] in Sevenoaks.  A keen [[birdwatcher]] from an early age, his parents bought him his first camera in his teens.  Tipling was soon recording the birds in his local area.

A largely self-taught wildlife photographer, Tipling came under the watchful eye of Roy Coles, the then warden of nearby [[Bough Beech]] Reservoir, a [[nature reserve]] in Kent.  Tipling learned his craft largely by 'trial and error' and by training his eye, studying the work of various artist's who gave him his distinctive 'artistic' sense of composition.

Between 1983 and 1994 he travelled throughout Britain following [[birdwatchers]] to photograph the rarities they were travelling to see.  This gave him a good grounding in [[fieldcraft]] and [[ornithology]]. A taste for the rare and unseen, with an artist's sense of composition, was the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rspb-images.com/respages/Lightbox.asp?LightBox=82639355-7AEC-4877-9086-BBDF4CD7ACBA Favourite Images selected by the RSPB]&lt;/ref&gt; Tipling's work was soon widely published in magazines such as ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]'', ''Birds Illustrated'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdsillustrated.com/back_issues.html Birds Illustrated] VOLUME 2, ISSUE 1 Autumn 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Birdwatch]]'', ''[[Dutch Birding]]'' and ''[[Birding World]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdingworld.co.uk/CleyAutumn2006.htm Birdingworld: Photographs by David Tipling on Cley Marshes]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being used in national newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'' Monday, 14 January 2008, ''Loss of Antarctic ice has soared by 75 per cent in just 10 years'' By Steve Connor, Science Editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and interests==
[[File:Hsü Wei 001.jpg|thumb|''Bamboos'' &lt;!-- タケ亜科 ??? --&gt; by [[Xu Wei]]&lt;br/&gt;([[Freer Gallery of Art]])]]
[[Wildlife]] is usually difficult to find, troublesome to approach and often impossible to capture, thus a knowledge of animal behaviour is a necessary skill in all great [[wildlife photography]]. The animal photographer needs above all to be able to predict actions. An ability to stalk animals is often a requirement. 

What makes Tipling's photographic work distinctive is his artistic sense of composition. His work is influenced by the Swedish painter [[Bruno Liljefors]] whose often brooding depictions of predator-prey action – the hunts engaged between sea eagle and eider, goshawk and black grouse – help to create their darkly primitive atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} and by [[Robert Gillmor]]'s strong graphic,.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tipling cites some of the great Eastern painters who practised [[Oriental]] [[ink painting]] which has its roots in [[calligraphy]], as influential.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}} Much of his work resonates with that sense of proportion achieved in the light, striking shapes of [[Xu Wei]]'s work.{{citation needed|date=June 2008}}

A keen [[conservation movement|conservationist]], Tipling is perhaps closer than others to witnessing the dangers birds in the wild face. In 1994 his article in the ''[[New Scientist]]'' alerted its readers to the declining state of the [[barn owl]]:

{{quote|
Once a familiar bird to every country dweller, [[pesticides]], destruction of [[habitat]], fluctuation in climate and a decline in available prey have all contributed to its decline. Barn owl populations do rise and fall in cycle with [[vole]] populations and, being largely nocturnal, there may also be appreciable numbers going unrecorded. However, the population appears to have fallen by 43 per cent since the first atlas, and a similar decline has been reported in many other European countries.|David Tipling&lt;ref&gt;David Tipling, Reviews A Domesday book of Survival, New Scientist Print Edition, 5 March 1994&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Birds and People''==
Tipling's latest project with author and [[naturalist]] [[Mark Cocker]] and [[natural history]] researcher [[Jonathan Elphick]], is ''[[Birds and People]]''.&lt;ref name="Birds and People website"&gt;[http://www.birdsandpeople.org  Birds and People website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birds and People]] is a ten-year-long collaboration between the publishers [[Random House]] and [[BirdLife International]], to survey and document worldwide, the cultural significance of birds,&lt;ref name="Birdwatch"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071018012456/http://www.birdwatch.co.uk/website/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=476&amp;Itemid=32 Birdwatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipling's role within the ''Birds and People'' project, as the commissioned photographer and picture editor, is both to photograph and find images that illustrate the connection between man and bird as depicted in the stories recorded and covered by the project.&lt;ref name="Birdwatch"/&gt;

Images will range from depictions of the birds themselves to pieces of art, objects such as ceramics, architecture and of course people. The ''Birds and People'' project involves an open [[internet forum]],&lt;ref name="Birds and People website" /&gt; for individuals worldwide to document their reflections, experiences and stories about birds.

==Additional information==
Tipling's latest work, undertaken with the ornithologist [[Jonathan Elphick]], and due to be published later this year, is ''GREAT BIRDS: 200 Star Species of Britain''.&lt;ref&gt;''GREAT BIRDS: 200 Star Species of Britain'', Elphick. J and Tipling. D, pub. Duncan Baird Publishers, London 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipling is a photographic consultant for ''[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]]''. From 1994 to 2003 he had a monthly quizbird column in Bird Watching Magazine.  Picture credits include over 500 book covers for example ''Pecked to Death by Ducks'' by [[Tim Cahill]],&lt;ref&gt;''Pecked to Death by Ducks'', Cahill, T. pub. Random House; 1st edition, 26 January 1993&lt;/ref&gt; various [[Lonely Planet]] guides including [[Antarctica]]&lt;ref&gt;Antarctica (Country Guide)
by Jeff Rubin, pub. Lonely Planet Guides, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Secret Life of Birds'' by [[Dominic Couzens]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0713675136 Secret Lives of British Birds, Dominic Couzens, RSPB]&lt;/ref&gt;

Books completely illustrated by Tipling include ''Collins Gem Guide to Garden Birds'', ''Understanding Bird Behaviour'' by [[Stephen Moss]],&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Bird Behaviour'', Moss. S. pub, New Holland Publishers, Ltd. 30 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bird Identification and Fieldcraft'' by Mark Ward.  Tipling has also undertaken major advertising work for clients including Pedigree Chum and Fuji Film (who ran an advertising campaign using his emperor penguins from 2001–2003.  Tipling's [[emperor penguins]] were also used in the [[Walmart]] ad campaign in the United States in 2002.

{{for|the undergarment|Diaper}}

[[File:Subduction-en.svg|thumb|400px|diapirs in a subducting plate boundary]]

A '''diapir''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aɪ|.|ə|p|ɪər}};&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin, 2000). {{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/93/D0199300.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208205057/http://www.bartleby.com/61/93/D0199300.html |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[French language|French]], from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''diapeirein'', to pierce through) is a type of geologic [[intrusion]] in which a more mobile and ductily deformable material is forced into brittle overlying rocks. Depending on the tectonic environment, diapirs can range from idealized mushroom-shaped [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor-instability]]-type structures in regions with low tectonic stress such as in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to narrow [[dike (geology)|dike]]s of material that move along tectonically induced fractures in surrounding rock. The term was introduced by the [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[geologist]] [[Ludovic Mrazek]], who was the first to understand the principle of [[salt intrusion]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. The term "diapir" may be applied to [[igneous]] structures, but it is more commonly applied to non-igneous, relatively cold materials, such as [[salt dome]]s and [[mud]] diapirs.

[[File:1990s Mathmos Astro.jpg|thumb|left|A [[lava lamp]] illustrates [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]]-type diapirism in which the tectonic stresses are low.]]
In addition to Earth-based observations, diapirism is thought to occur on Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], Saturn's moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], and Uranus's moon [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations, [http://ciclops.org/view/5156/Enceladus_Rev_80_Flyby Enceladus Rev 80 Flyby: Aug 11 '08]. Retrieved 2008-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diapirs commonly intrude vertically upward along fractures or zones of structural weakness through denser overlying [[rocks]] because of [[density]] contrast between a less dense, lower rock mass and overlying denser rocks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The density contrast manifests as a force of buoyancy. The process is known as ''diapirism''. The resulting structures are also referred to as ''piercement structures''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

In the process, segments of the existing strata can be disconnected and pushed upwards. While moving higher, they retain much of their original properties such as pressure, which can be significantly different from that of the shallower strata they get pushed into.{{clarify|reason=why/how is the pressure different? How is pressure in a fluid retained when gaining potential energy?|date=October 2018}} Such overpressured ''Floaters'' pose a significant risk when trying to [[well drilling|drill]] through them.{{clarify|reason=risk of what?|date=August 2018}} There is an analogy to a [[Galilean thermometer]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;

{{cite book |title=Plates, plumes, and planetary processes; ''Volume 430 of Special Papers'' |chapter=The eclogite engine: Chemical geodynamics as a Galileo thermometer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9a7tIJBYbkC&amp;pg=PA47
|author=Don L. Anderson |editor=Gillian R. Foulger, Donna M. Jurdy |isbn=0-8137-2430-9 |year=2007 |publisher=American Geological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock types such as [[evaporite|evaporitic]] salt deposits, and gas charged muds are potential sources of diapirs. Diapirs also form in the [[earth's mantle]] when a sufficient mass of hot, less dense [[magma]] assembles. Diapirism in the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] is thought to be associated with the development of [[large igneous province]]s and some [[mantle plume]]s.

Explosive, hot [[Volatiles|volatile]] rich magma or [[volcanic eruption]]s are referred to generally as [[diatreme]]s. Diatremes are not usually associated with diapirs, as they are small-volume magmas which ascend by volatile plumes, not by density contrast with the surrounding mantle.

==Economic importance of diapirs==
[[File:Salt dome hg.png|thumb|240px|Geological cross section through the Northwestern Basin of Germany (Ostfriesland-Nordheide). Salt domes have penetrated younger layers and moved near to the surface. They sometimes form pockets where petroleum and natural gas can collect. Excavated salt domes are also used for underground storage.]]

Diapirs or piercement structures are structures resulting from the penetration of overlaying material. By pushing upward and piercing overlying rock layers, diapirs can form [[anticline]]s, [[salt dome]]s and other structures capable of trapping [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. Igneous intrusions themselves are typically too hot to allow the preservation of preexisting [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, on-line at [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=diapir].

'''Dion''' or '''Dio''' ({{lang-grc|Δίον}}, ''Díon''; {{lang-el|Δίο}}, ''Dío''; {{lang-la|Dium}}) is a village and a former municipality in the [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria regional unit]], [[Greece]]. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality [[Dio-Olympos]], of which it is a municipal unit.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]] at a distance of 17km from the capital city of [[Katerini]].

It is best known for its great ancient Macedonian sanctuary of [[Zeus]] and city, much of which is visible in the [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Archaeological Park of  Dion]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancientdion.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archaeological Museum of Dion]].

==History==
[[File:Dion Greece reconstruction.jpg|thumb|Plan of Dion. The sanctuaries and the city (Archive of the excavation of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki/Drawing of Orkopoulos – Palli 1995) [Pandermalis (1997), p. 14-15].]]
[[File:DionArchaeologicalSiteStatue.jpg|thumb|left|220px|View of a statue, Sanctuary of Isis.]]

The ancient city owes its name to the most important Macedonian sanctuary dedicated to [[Zeus]] (''Dios'', "of Zeus"), leader of the [[Olympian gods|gods who dwelt on Mount Olympus]]; as recorded by  [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', [[Thyia]], daughter of [[Deucalion]], bore Zeus two sons, [[Magnes (mythology)|Magnes]] and [[Makednos]], [[eponym]]s of [[Magnetes]] and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], who dwelt in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]] at the foot of Mount Olympus.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Catalogue of Women'' [[:s:Catalogue of Women#7|fr. 7]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence from very ancient times, a large altar had been set up for the worship of Olympian Zeus and his daughters, the Muses, in a unique environment characterised by rich vegetation, towering trees, countless springs and a navigable river. For this reason Dion was the "sacred place" of the [[Ancient Macedonians]]. It was the place where the kings made splendid sacrifices to celebrate the new year of the Macedonian calendar at the end of September. In the Spring, purification rites of the army and victory feasts were held.

The first mention of Dion in history comes from [[Thucydides]], who reports that it was the first city reached by the [[Sparta]]n general [[Brasidas]] after crossing from [[Thessaly]] into [[Macedon]] on his way through the realm of his ally [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas II]] during his expedition against the Athenian colonies of [[Thrace]] in 424 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Thucydides|4.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], it was [[Archelaus I of Macedon|Archelaus I]] who, at the end of the 5th century BC when the Macedonian state acquired great power and emerged onto the stage of history, gave the city and its sanctuary their subsequent importance by instituting a nine-day festival of games that included athletic and dramatic competitions in honor of Zeus and the [[Muse]]s, whose organisation was overseen by the Macedonian kings themselves.

[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and [[Alexander the Great]] celebrated victories here, and Alexander assembled his armies and performed magnificent sacrifices here on the eve of his campaign to Asia in 334BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus: Bibliotheca historica&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient authors speak of the sculptural bronze masterpiece by [[Lysippos]] made for Alexander depicting 25 mounted companions who fell at the [[Battle of the Granicus]] and later taken to Rome by [[Caecilius Metellus|Metellus]].

A city was built adjacent to the sacred sites that acquired monumental form during the reigns of Alexander the Great's successors and [[Cassander]] took a great interest in the city erecting strong walls and public buildings, so that in Hellenistic times Dion was renowned far and wide for its fortification and splendid monuments. Dion and its sanctuary was destroyed during the [[Social War (220–217 BC)|Social War]] in 219 BC by Aetolian invaders but was immediately rebuilt by [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]]. Many of the dedications from the sanctuary that had been destroyed were buried in pits, including royal inscriptions and treaties, and these have been discovered recently.

[[File:The fortification Wall, Ancient Dion (6948460798).jpg|thumb|Fortification wall]]

It fell to the Romans in 169 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Livy|44.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city was given a new lease of life in 32/31 BC when [[Octavian]] founded the Colony of COLONIA JULIA AUGUSTA DIENSIS here.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pliny|4.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Ptolemy|3.13.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coins of colonial Dion survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DGRG|title=Dium}}&lt;/ref&gt; It experienced its second heyday during the reigns of 2nd- and 3rd-century AD Roman emperors who were fond of Alexander the Great. Dion's final important period was in the 4th and 5th centuries AD when it became the seat of a bishopric. It was abandoned following major earthquakes and floods.

The modern village at the site was called ''Malathria'' until 1961, when it was renamed to ''Dio''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandektis.ekt.gr/pandektis/handle/10442/171001 Name changes of settlements in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Dion Mosaic4.jpg|thumb|A mosaic floor]]

The site of ancient Dion was first identified by the English traveler [[William Martin Leake]] on December 2, 1806, in the ruins adjoining the village of [[Malathria]].  He published his discovery in the third volume of his ''[[Travels in Northern Greece]]'' in 1835. [[Léon Heuzey]] visited the site during his famous Macedonian archaeological mission of 1855 and again in 1861 when he also detected the ancient [[Leivithra]].  Later, the [[epigraphist]] G. Oikonomos published the first series of inscriptions.  Nevertheless, systematic archaeological exploration did not begin until 1928.  From then until 1931, G. Sotiriadis carried out a series of surveys, uncovering a 4th-century BC Macedonian tomb and an early Christian basilica. Excavations were not resumed until 1960 under the direction of G. Bakalakis in the area of the theatre and the wall.  Since 1973, Professor D. Pandermalis of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] has conducted archaeological research in the city.

Dion is the site of a large temple dedicated to Zeus, as well as a series of temples to Demeter and to Isis (the Egyptian goddess was a favorite of [[Alexander]]).

Excavation of the magnificent House of Dionysos revealed a mosaic of exceptionally fine quality.

A rare and unusual find in the museum is a bronze "hydraulis" or hydraulic musical pipe organ found in a former workshop.
[[File:Dion hydraulis.jpg|thumb|Dion hydraulis]]
In 2006, a statue of [[Hera]] was found built into the walls of the city.  The statue, 2200 years old, had been used by the early Christians of Dion as filling for the city's defensive wall.&lt;ref name="Kantouris"&gt;Kantouris, Costas.

==Administration==

In October 1992, the municipality Dio (''Dimos Diou'') was formed. At the 1997 [[Kapodistrias reform]], it was expanded with the former communities [[Agios Spyridonas, Pieria|Agios Spyridonas]], [[Karitsa, Pieria|Karitsa]], [[Kondariotissa]], [[Nea Efesos]] and [[Vrontou, Pieria|Vrontou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6279 EETAA local government changes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106185517/http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6279 |date=2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrative center was in the village of [[Kondariotissa]]. At the 2011 local government reform Dio merged with the former municipalities [[East Olympos]] and [[Litochoro]] to form the new municipality [[Dio-Olympos]]. Dio became a municipal unit of the newly formed municipality, and the former municipal districts became communities.&lt;ref name=Kallikratis/&gt; The community of Dion consists of the village of the same name and [[Platanakia]].&lt;ref name=census11/&gt; The municipal unit has an area of 172.743 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the community 31.375 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antarctica.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Eastern Antarctica on the right.]]
[[Image:Sea Ice and Icebergs off East Antarctica.jpg|thumb|Image of a variety of ice types off the coast of East Antarctica.]]

'''East Antarctica''', also called '''Greater Antarctica''', constitutes the majority (two-thirds) of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[continent]], lying on the [[Indian Ocean]] side of the continent, separated from [[West Antarctica]] by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. It lies almost entirely within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] and its name has been accepted for more than a century. It is generally higher than West Antarctica and includes the [[Gamburtsev Mountain Range]] in the centre.

Apart from small areas of the coast, East Antarctica is permanently covered by ice. The only terrestrial plant life is lichens, mosses and algae clinging to rocks, and there are a limited range of invertebrates including [[nematode]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[mite]]s and [[midge]]s. The coasts are the breeding ground for various seabirds and penguins, and the [[leopard seal]], [[Weddell seal]], [[elephant seal]], [[crabeater seal]] and [[Ross seal]] breed on the surrounding pack ice in summer.  

==Location and description==
Almost completely covered in thick, permanent ice, East Antarctica comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Kemp Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land]], [[Princess Elizabeth Land]], [[Wilhelm II Land]], [[Queen Mary Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], [[Adélie Land]], [[George V Land]], [[Oates Land]] and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]], a fact that has suggested the name. The name has been in existence for more than 90 years (Balch, 1902; Nordenskjöld, 1904), but its greatest use followed the [[International Geophysical Year]] (1957–58) and explorations disclosing that the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], provide a useful regional separation of East Antarctica and [[West Antarctica]]. The name was approved in the [[United States]] by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (US-ACAN) in 1962. East Antarctica is generally higher than West Antarctica, and is considered the coldest place on [[Earth]].

The subglacial [[Gamburtsev Mountain Range]], about the size of the European Alps, in the center of East Antarctica, are believed to have been the nucleation site for the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]], just underneath [[Dome A]].

==Flora and fauna==
Very little of East Antarctica is not covered with [[ice]]. The small areas that remain free of ice ([[Antarctic oasis]]), including the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] inland, constitute a [[tundra|tundra-type]] [[biodiversity]] region known as '''Maudlandia''' Antarctic [[desert]], after [[Queen Maud Land]]. There are no trees or shrubs, as only very limited plant life can survive here; the flora consists of [[lichen]]s, [[moss]], and [[algae]] that are adapted to the cold and wind, and cling to rocks.

The coasts are home to seabirds, penguins, and seals, which feed in the surrounding ocean, including the [[emperor penguin]], which famously breeds in the cold, dark Antarctic winter.

Seabirds of the coast include southern fulmar ''([[Fulmarus glacialoides]])'', the scavenging southern giant petrel ''([[Macronectes giganteus]])'', Cape petrel ''([[Daption capense]])'', snow petrel ''([[Pagodroma nivea]])'', the small Wilson's storm-petrel ''([[Oceanites oceanicus]])'', the large south polar skua ''([[Catharacta maccormicki]])'', and Antarctic petrel ''([[Thalassoica antarctica]])''.

The seals of the [[Antarctic Ocean]] include [[leopard seal]] ''(Hydrurga leptonyx)'', [[Weddell seal]] ''(Leptonychotes weddellii)'', the huge [[southern elephant seal]] ''(Mirounga leonina)'', [[crabeater seal]] ''(Lobodon carcinophagus)'' and [[Ross seal]] (''[[Ommatophoca rossii]]'').

There are no large land animals but [[bacteria]], [[nematode]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[mite]]s, and [[midge]]s live on the mosses and lichens.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Maudlandia Antarctic desert|id=an1102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
The remote and extremely cold bulk of Antarctica remains almost entirely untouched by human intervention. The area is protected by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] which bans industrial development, waste disposal and nuclear testing, while the [[Barwick Valley]], one of the Dry Valleys, and [[Cryptogam Ridge]] on [[Mount Melbourne]] are specially protected areas for their undisturbed plant life.

'''Edaphology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἔδαφος}}, ''edaphos'', "ground", and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is one of two main divisions of [[soil science]], the other being [[pedology]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 ''in'' {{Cite book

(Pedology deals with pedogenesis, soil morphology, and soil classification.)

In Russia, edaphology is considered equivalent to pedology, but is recognized to have an applied sense consistent with [[agrophysics]] and agrochemistry outside Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tseits |first=M.

== History ==
[[Xenophon]] (431&amp;ndash;355 BC), and [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] (234&amp;ndash;149 BC), were early edaphologists. Xenophon noted the beneficial effect of turning a cover crop into the earth. Cato wrote [[De Agri Cultura]] ("On Farming") which recommended [[tillage]], [[crop rotation]] and the use of [[legumes]] in the rotation to build soil nitrogen. He also devised the first soil [[Land use capability map|capability classification]] for specific crops.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1577&amp;ndash;1644) performed a famous experiment, growing a willow tree in a pot of soil and supplying only rainwater for five years. The weight gained by the tree was greater than the weight loss of the soil. He concluded that the willow was made of water. Although only partly correct, his experiment reignited interest in edaphology.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Cato and Van Helmont: see page 9-12 ''in'' {{Cite book | last = Miller | first = Raymond W. | last2 = Gardiner | first2 = Duane T. | title = Soils in Our Environment | place = Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458 | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 1998 | edition = 8th | isbn = 978-0-13-610882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
===Agricultural  soil science===
{{main|Agricultural soil science}}
Agricultural soil science is the application of soil chemistry, physics, and biology dealing with the production of crops. In terms of [[soil chemistry]], it places particular emphasis on [[plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] of importance to [[farming]] and [[horticulture]], especially with regard to [[fertility (soil)|soil fertility]] and [[fertilizer]] components. 

[[soil physics|Physical edaphology]] is strongly associated with crop [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]]. 

Soil husbandry is a strong tradition within agricultural soil science.  Beyond preventing [[soil erosion]] and [[soil degradation|degradation]] in cropland, soil husbandry seeks to sustain the agricultural soil resource though the use of [[soil conditioner]]s and [[cover crop]]s.

===Environmental soil science===
{{main|Environmental soil science}}
Environmental soil science studies our interaction with the [[pedosphere]] on beyond crop production. Fundamental and applied aspects of the field address [[vadose zone]] functions, [[septic drain field]] site assessment and function, land treatment of [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[erosion]] control, [[soil contamination]] with metals and pesticides, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated soils, restoration of [[wetlands]], [[soil degradation]], and environmental [[nutrient management]].   It also studies soil in the context of [[land-use planning]], [[global warming]], and [[acid rain]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''Edeowie glass''' is a [[slag]]-like, [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], locally-abundant [[natural]] [[glass]] found as [[Vesicular texture|vesicular]] free forms or sheet-like/ropy masses. It is located throughout a semi-continuous swath in baked pod-like [[clay|clay-bearing]] [[Sedimentary rock|sediment]], about 55&amp;nbsp;km long and 10&amp;nbsp;km wide along the western side of the [[Flinders Ranges]] near [[Parachilna, South Australia]] and [[Lake Torrens]]. The region in which this glass is found is mostly restricted to concentrations correlated to the ancient shoreline terrace sequence at the locality. 
It is typically black in appearance, but can occur as variegated grey-green with various streak-like impurities. Pale grey and red-brownish surfaces can be caused by [[chemical weathering]] ([[oxidation]], [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]]) and [[devitrification]].&lt;ref name="HainesOthers2001"&gt;Haines, P.W., R.J.F.

==Origin==

An origin for Edeowie glass has been assigned to either [[lightning]] strikes, or [[hypervelocity impact]] by one or several [[asteroids]] or [[comets]]. Many of its notable features, such as planar deformation features ([[shocked quartz|PDFs]]) in quartz crystals found within and associated with Edeowie glass, are recognized to have been caused by pressures only exerted by such events capable of rapid shock metamorphism.&lt;ref name="HainesOthers2001"&gt;Haines, P.W., R.J.F.

A '''gravel road''' is a type of [[Pavement (material)|unpaved]] [[road]] surfaced with [[gravel]] that has been brought to the site from a [[quarry]] or [[stream bed]]. They are common in less-developed nations, and also in the rural areas of developed nations such as [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. In New Zealand, and other [[British Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries, they may be known as ''''[[Road metal|metal roads]]''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry.co.nz/kiwi.htm Kiwi - Words &amp; Phrases] (from a private website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/metal|title=Metal|last=Anon|work=Online etymological dictionary|publisher=2001 Douglas Harper|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be referred to as 'dirt roads' in common speech, but that term is used more for [[dirt road|unimproved roads]] with no surface material added.  If well constructed and maintained, a gravel road is an all-weather road.

==Characteristics==

===Construction===

Compared to [[sealed road]]s, which require large machinery to work and pour [[concrete]] or to lay and smooth a [[bitumen]]-based surface, gravel roads are easy and cheap to build.  However, compared to [[dirt road]]s, all-weather gravel highways are quite expensive to build, as they require [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]]s, [[dump trucks]], [[grader]]s, and [[roadrollers]] to provide a [[base course]] of compacted earth or other material, sometimes [[macadam]]ised, covered with one or more different layers of gravel.  Graders are also used to produce a more extreme [[Cant (road/rail)|camber]] compared to a paved road to aid drainage, as well as to construct drainage ditches and [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]]s in low-lying areas. [[Cellular confinement]] systems can be used to prevent the [[washboarding]] effect.

===Materials===
The gravel used consists of varying amount of crushed stone, [[sand]], and ''fines''. Fines are [[silt]] or [[clay]] particles smaller than {{convert|.075|mm|in}}, which can act as a binder. Crushed stone is used because gravel with fractured faces will stay in place better than rounded river pebbles. A good gravel for a gravel road will have a higher percentage of fines than gravel used as a [[Subbase_(pavement)|subbase]] for a paved road. This often causes problems if a gravel road is paved without adding sand and gravel sized stone to dilute the percentage of fines.&lt;ref name="gravel roads"&gt;{{Citation

A gravel road is quite different from a 'gravel drive', popular as private [[driveway]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].  This uses clean gravel consisting of uniform, rounded stones and small [[pebble]]s.

====Laterite and murram roads====
In [[Africa]] and parts of [[Asia]] and [[South America]], [[laterite]] soils are used to build [[dirt road]]s. However [[laterite]],  called ''murram'' in [[East Africa]], varies considerably in the proportion of stones (which are usually very small) to earth and sand.  It ranges from a hard gravel to a softer earth embedded with small stones.  Not all laterite and murram roads are therefore strictly gravel roads.  Laterite and murram which contains a significant proportion of clay becomes very slippery when wet, and in the rainy season, it may be difficult even for [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles to avoid slipping off very [[Wiktionary:camber|cambered]] roads into the drainage ditches at the side of the road.  As it dries out, such laterite can become very hard, like [[sun-dried brick]]s.

===Maintenance===

Gravel roads require much more frequent maintenance than paved roads, especially after wet periods and when accommodating increased traffic.  Wheel motion shoves material to the outside (as well as in-between travelled lanes), leading to rutting, reduced water-runoff, and eventual road destruction if unchecked. As long as the process is interrupted early enough, simple re-grading is sufficient, with material being pushed back into shape.

Segments of gravel roads on [[grade (slope)|grades]] also [[rut (roads)|rut]] easily as a result of flowing water. When grading or building the road, [[waterbar]]s are used to direct water off the road. As an alternative method, humps can be formed in the [[gravel]] along the road to impede water flow, thereby reducing rutting.

Another problem with gravel roads is [[washboarding]] — the formation of corrugations across the surface at right angles to the direction of travel. They can become severe enough to cause vibration in vehicles so that bolts loosen or cracks form in components. Grading removes the corrugations, and reconstruction with careful choice of good quality gravel can help prevent them reforming.  Additionally, installing a [[cellular confinement|cellular confinement system]] will prevent the washboard-like corrugations from occurring.

Gravel roads are often found in cold climates because they are less vulnerable to freeze / thaw damage than [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]] roads. The inferior surface of gravel is not an issue if the road is covered by snow and ice for extended periods.

===Driving===

Although well-constructed and graded gravel roads are suitable for speeds of up to 100&amp;nbsp;km/h (60&amp;nbsp;mph), driving on them requires far more attention to variations of the surface and it is easier to lose control than on a paved road. In addition to potholes, ruts and loose stony or sandy ridges at the edges or in the middle of the road, problems associated with driving on gravel roads include:
*sharper and larger stones cutting and puncturing tires, or being thrown up by the wheels and damaging the underside, especially puncturing the fuel tank of unmodified cars
*stones skipping up hitting the [[car body]], lights or [[windshield]]s when two vehicles pass at high speed
*dust thrown up from a passing vehicle reducing visibility
*'[[Washboarding|washboard]]' corrugations cause loss of control or damage to vehicles due to excessive [[vibration]]. These are most often found near intersections as stopping or braking causes them to form or otherwise if heavy farm or other equipment often uses these roads.
*skidding on mud after rain
*vehicle [[fishtailing]] as a result of [[rut (roads)|ruts]] in the surface of the gravel. Often found on frequently traveled roads
*In higher rainfall areas, the increased camber required to drain water, and open drainage ditches at the sides of the road, often cause vehicles with a high [[centre of gravity]], such as trucks and off-road vehicles, to overturn if they do not keep close to the crown of the road
*Excess dust permeates door-opening rubber moulding breaking the seal
*Lost binder in the form of road dust, when mixed with rain, will wear away the painted surfaces of vehicles
*Many gravel roads are only [[single track road|one lane wide]] or slightly larger, thus requiring special attention when driving at higher speeds

===Forest service road===
{{See also|Fire trail}}

A 'Forest Service Road' is a type of rudimentary access road, built by the [[United States Forest Service]] to access remote undeveloped areas. These roads are built mainly for the purposes of the [[logging|logging industry]] and [[Wood management|forest management]] workers, although in some cases they are also used for [[backcountry]] recreation access.

Networks of tributary roads branch off from a [[trunk road|trunk]] FSR. Roads are usually named after a regional district, and branches have an [[alphanumeric]] designation.

Typically, a high-clearance four-wheel drive vehicle is required to travel effectively on a road, especially where large [[pothole]]s and/or [[waterbar]]s are present. [[hairpin turn|Switchback]]s are employed to make the road passable through steep terrain.

These roads rapidly fall into disrepair and quickly become impassable. Remnants of old roads can exist for decades. They are eventually erased by [[Washout (erosion)|washout]], [[erosion]], and [[ecological succession]].

===Logging roads===

Logging [[road]]s are constructed to provide access to the forest for [[logging]] and other [[wood management|forest management]] operations.  They are commonly narrow, winding, and unpaved, but main haul roads can be widened, straightened or paved if traffic volume warrants it.

The choice of [[road design]] [[Technical standard|standards]] is a trade off between construction costs and haul costs (which the road is designed to reduce).  A road that serves only a few stands will be used by relatively few trucks over its lifetime, so it makes sense to save construction costs with a narrow, winding, unpaved road that adds to the time (and haul costs) of these few trips.  A main haul road serving a large area however will be used by many trucks each day, and each trip will be shorter(saving time and money) if the road is straighter and wider, with a smoother surface.

[[Logging truck]]s are generally given right of way. In areas where this practice is regulated (or is supposed to be) non-highway roads with heavy logging traffic may be "radio-controlled", which is to say a [[Citizens' band radio|CB radio]] on board any vehicle on the road is advised for safety reasons.

'''Hatila Valley National Park''' ({{lang-tr|Hatila Vadisi Millî Parkı}}) is a national park in [[Artvin Province]] in northeastern Turkey. It consists of a steep-sided river valley at the eastern end of the [[Kaçkar Mountains]]. The area is close to the [[Black Sea]] and has a [[Mediterranean climate]] with warm summers, cool winters and plentiful rainfall throughout the year.&lt;ref name=Gibbons&gt;{{cite book|author=Gibbons, Bob|title=Wildflower Wonders: The 50 Best Wildflower Sites in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CIGaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165 |year=2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4729-1120-9 |pages=165–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valley provides habitats for a diverse community of plants and animals.&lt;ref name=NationalPark/&gt;

==Park==
The [[Hatila River]] is a tributary of the [[Çoruh River]] and has carved out a narrow, steep-sided, V-shaped valley with many waterfalls. The rock is mostly of volcanic origin and has an unusual [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] structure and geology, which has created a distinctive landscape.  The park occupies an area of about {{convert|16900|hectare}}.&lt;ref name=NationalPark&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalparksofturkey.com/hatila-valley-national-park/ |title=Hatila Valley National Park |publisher=National Parks of Turkey |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower parts of the valley are dry and warm but the higher parts are cool and humid with snow cover in winter. The valley is densely vegetated, especially in its middle and lower sections. Between 1994 and 1997, a botanical survey carried out identified 769 [[species]] of plant in 87 [[Family (biology)|families]] and 324 [[Genus|genera]] here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eminagaoglu, Ozgur |author2=Anşin, Rahim |year=2003 |title=The Flora of Hatila Valley National Park and its Close Environs (Artvin) |journal=Turkish Journal of Botany |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–27 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259440360_The_Flora_of_Hatila_Valley_National_Park_and_its_Close_Environs_Artvin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
[[File:Primula, from Riza DSC071156565.JPG|thumb|right|Primula vulgaris'' subsp. ''sibthorpii'']]
The forests on the mountain slopes in the park consist of both deciduous and evergreen tree species. These include [[Quercus petraea|sessile oak]], [[Castanea sativa|sweet chestnut]], [[Carpinus orientalis|oriental hornbeam]], [[Carpinus betulus|common hornbeam]], [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]], [[Fagus orientalis|oriental beech]], [[Picea orientalis|oriental spruce]], [[Abies nordmanniana|Caucasian fir]] and [[Scots pine]]. On the higher slopes, the [[Populus tremula|common aspen]] is added to these as well as [[rhododendron]], [[juniper]], ''[[Vaccinium]]'', [[willow]], [[birch]] and [[Rubus idaeus|European raspberry]].&lt;ref name=Baskaya/&gt;

The Hatila Valley has a very rich flora and a long botanical season, with different flowering periods for different zones depending on altitude. In spring in the lower parts of the valley, forest clearings are abloom with [[hellebore]]s, magenta ''[[Cyclamen coum]]'', blue [[Omphalodes cappadocica|Cappadocian navelwort]] and pink [[Primula vulgaris|''Primula vulgaris'' subsp. ''sibthorpii'']].

The '''High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program''' ('''HAARP''') was initiated as an [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research program jointly funded by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet"&gt;

Its original purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance.&lt;ref name="Purpose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/prpeis.html |title=Purpose and Objectives of the HAARP Program |publisher=HAARP |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001114140/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/prpeis.html |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere.

The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]] facility operating in the [[high frequency]] (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the [[ionosphere]]. Other instruments, such as a [[VHF]] and a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radar]], a [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]], a digisonde (an [[ionospheric sounding]] device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

Work on the HAARP facility began in 1993. The current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was [[BAE Systems Inc.|BAE Systems Advanced Technologies]].&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet" /&gt; As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year.&lt;ref name="ADNCole2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |title=Air Force prepares to dismantle HAARP ahead of summer shutdown |author=Dermot Cole |date=2014-05-14 |publisher=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517010257/http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility and its equipment was transferred to the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] in August 2015.&lt;ref name="UAF"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rozell |first=Ned |date=6 September 2015 |title=Under new management, Alaska's HAARP facility open for business again |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150906/under-new-management-alaskas-haarp-facility-open-business-again |newspaper=Alaska Dispatch News |access-date=10 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAARP is a target of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], who claim that it is capable of [[Weather warfare|"weaponizing" weather]]. Commentators and scientists say that advocates of this theory are uninformed, as claims made fall well outside the abilities of the facility, if not the scope of natural science.&lt;ref name=PopSci /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naiditch"/&gt;

==History==
HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) began in 1990. [[Ted Stevens]], Republican U.S. senator from Alaska, helped win approval for the facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/news/us-ionospheric-research-facility-to-close-1.15243|title = US ionospheric research facility to close|date = 16 May 2014|accessdate = 18 August 2014|website = Nature|publisher = Nature|last = Weinberger|first = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began in 1993.

In early May 2013, HAARP was temporarily shut down, awaiting a change between contractors to operate the facility. In July 2013, HAARP program manager James Keeney said, "[[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is expected on site as a client to finish up some research in fall 2013 and winter 2014."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAARP Facility Shuts Down|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/view/haarp-facility-shuts-down|publisher=ARRL|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EarthSky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrd|first=Deborah|title=Crazy weather?

[[Ahtna, Incorporated]], the [[Alaska native corporation|Alaska Native corporation]] serving the region of Alaska where the HAARP site is located, was reportedly in talks to take over the facility administration contract from Marsh Creek, LLC.&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Ben|title=Alaska's controversial HAARP facility closed – will it come back online?|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20130717/alaska-s-controversial-haarp-facility-closed-will-it-come-back-online|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Alaska Dispatch|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the Air Force announced that the HAARP program would be shut down later in 2014.&lt;ref name="ADNCole2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bye-Bye To The Home Of A Favorite Internet Conspiracy Theory | url = https://www.npr.org/2014/06/10/319539712/bye-bye-to-the-home-of-a-favorite-internet-conspiracy-theory | first = Geoff | last = Brumfiel | date = 10 June 2014 | work = NPR | accessdate = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While experiments ended in the summer of 2014, the complete shutdown and dismantling of the facility was postponed until at least May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = HAARP closure postponed until 2015 | url = http://www.adn.com/article/20140702/haarp-closure-postponed-until-2015 | first = Dermot | last = Cole | date = 2 July 2014 | work = Alaska Dispatch News | accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-August 2015 control of the facility and its equipment was turned over to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which is making the facilities available for researchers on a pay-per-use basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2015/abstract/future-operations-of-haarp-with-the-uafs-geophysical-institute/ |title=Future Operations of HAARP with the UAF's Geophysical Institute |book-title=Agu Fall Meeting Abstracts |year=2015 |id=AE22A–07 |last1=McCoy |first1=Robert|conference=American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2015 |access-date=10 September 2015|bibcode=2015AGUFMAE22A..07M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project overview==
[[File:HAARP20l.jpg|thumb|HAARP antenna array]]
The HAARP project directs a 3.6 [[megawatt|MW]] signal, in the 2.8–10 [[megahertz|MHz]] region of the HF (high-frequency) band, into the [[ionosphere]]. The signal may be pulsed or continuous. Effects of the transmission and any recovery period can be examined using associated instrumentation, including VHF and UHF radars, HF receivers, and optical cameras. According to the HAARP team, this will advance the study of basic natural processes that occur in the ionosphere under the natural but much stronger influence of solar interaction. HAARP also enables studies of how the natural ionosphere affects radio signals.

The insights gleaned at HAARP will enable scientists to develop methods to mitigate these effects to improve the reliability or performance of communication and navigation systems which would have a wide range of both civilian and military uses, such as an increased accuracy of GPS navigation and advances in underwater and underground research and applications. This may lead, among other things, to improved methods for submarine communication or an ability to remotely sense and map the mineral content of the terrestrial subsurface, and perhaps underground complexes, of regions or countries. The current facility lacks range to be used in regions like the oil-rich Middle East, according to one of the researchers involved, but the technology could be put on a mobile platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/irans-nuclear-molemen/ Pentagon Scientists Target Iran’s Nuclear Mole Men]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was originally funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and jointly managed by the ONR and [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], with principal involvement of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Many other US universities and educational institutions were involved in the development of the project and its instruments, namely the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[Stanford University]], [[Penn State University]] (ARL), [[Boston College]], [[UCLA]], [[Clemson University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Tulsa]]. The project's specifications were developed by the universities, who continued to play a major role in the design of future research efforts.

According to HAARP's original management, the project strove for openness, and all activities were logged and publicly available, a practice which continues under the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Scientists without security clearances, even foreign nationals, were routinely allowed on site, which also continues today. HAARP hosts an open house annually, during which time any civilian can tour the entire facility. In addition, scientific results obtained using HAARP are routinely published in major research journals (such as ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' and ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]''), written both by university scientists (American and foreign) and by [[U.S. Department of Defense]] research lab scientists.

==Research==
HAARP's main goal is basic science research in the uppermost portion of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], termed the [[ionosphere]]. Essentially a transition between the atmosphere and the [[magnetosphere]], the ionosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough that the sun's X-rays and UV rays can reach it, but thick enough that there are enough molecules present to absorb those rays. Consequently, the ionosphere consists of a rapid increase in density of free electrons, beginning at {{abbr|~|approximately}}70&amp;nbsp;km, reaching a peak at ~300&amp;nbsp;km, and then falling off again as the atmosphere disappears entirely by ~1,000&amp;nbsp;km. Various aspects of HAARP can study all of the main layers of the ionosphere.

The profile of the ionosphere is highly variable, changing constantly on timescales of minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years. This profile becomes even more complex near Earth's magnetic poles, where the nearly vertical alignment and intensity of earth's magnetic field can cause physical effects like [[aurora (astronomy)|the aurora]].

The ionosphere is traditionally very difficult to measure. Balloons cannot reach it because the air is too thin, but satellites cannot orbit there because the air is too thick. Hence, most experiments on the ionosphere give only small pieces of information. HAARP approaches the study of the ionosphere by following in the footsteps of an ionospheric heater called [[EISCAT]] near [[Tromsø]], Norway. There, scientists pioneered exploration of the ionosphere by perturbing it with radio waves in the 2–10&amp;nbsp;MHz range, and studying how the ionosphere reacts. HAARP performs the same functions but with more power and a more flexible and agile HF beam.

Some of the main scientific findings from HAARP include:
#Generating [[very low frequency]] (VLF) radio waves by modulated heating of the auroral [[electrojet]], useful because generating VLF waves ordinarily requires gigantic antennas
#Generating weak luminous glow (measurable, but below that visible with a naked eye) from absorbing HAARP's signal
#Generating [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) waves in the 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz range. These are next to impossible to produce any other way, because the length of an antenna is dictated by the wavelength of the signal it emits or receives.
#Generating [[Whistler (radio)|whistler-mode]] VLF signals that enter the [[magnetosphere]] and propagate to the other hemisphere, interacting with [[Van Allen radiation belt]] particles along the way
#VLF remote sensing of the heated ionosphere

#Stimulated electron emission observations
#[[Gyro frequency]] heating research
#Spread F observations (blurring of ionospheric echoes of radio waves due to irregularities in electron density in the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]])

#[[Polar mesospheric summer echoes]] (PMSE) have been studied, probing the [[mesosphere]] using the IRI as a powerful [[radar]], and with a 28&amp;nbsp;MHz radar and two VHF radars at 49&amp;nbsp;MHz and 139&amp;nbsp;MHz. The presence of multiple radars spanning both [[High frequency|HF]] and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] bands allows scientists to make comparative measurements that may someday lead to an understanding of the processes that form these elusive phenomena.

== Instrumentation and operation ==
The main instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI). This is a high-power, high-frequency [[phased array]] radio [[transmitter]] with a set of 180 [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], disposed in an array of 12x15 units that occupy a rectangle of about {{convert|30-40|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/read/18620/chapter/2 "Opportunities for High-Power, High-Frequency Transmitters to Advance Ionospheric/Thermospheric Research: Report of a Workshop"], National Academies Press. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2014. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq "Ionospheric Manipulation Made Easy"], Abe Streep. Popular Science Vol. 273, No. 1. July 2008. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRI is used to temporarily energize a small portion of the [[ionosphere]]. The study of these disturbed volumes yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.

During active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] and transmitted in an upward direction. At an altitude between {{convert|70|to|350|km|0|abbr=on}} (depending on operating frequency), the signal is partially absorbed in a small volume several tens of kilometers in diameter and a few meters thick over the IRI. The intensity of the [[High frequency|HF]] signal in the ionosphere is less than 3&amp;nbsp;µW/cm², tens of thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun's natural [[ultraviolet]] (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced, however, can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility, and these observations can provide information about the dynamics of [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part of the two section crossed dipoles are individually fed from a specially designed, custom-built transmitter that operates at very low distortion levels. The [[Effective Radiated Power]] (ERP) of the IRI is limited by more than a factor of 10 at its lower operating frequencies. Much of this is due to higher antenna losses and a less efficient antenna pattern.

The IRI can transmit between 2.7 and 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens' Band frequency allocations. However, HAARP is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or less. The IRI can transmit in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses as short as 10 microseconds (µs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated is used as a radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with pulsed transmissions.

There are other geophysical instruments for research located at the HAARP facility. Some of them are:
* A [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]] built by the University of Alaska Fairbanks [[Geophysical Institute]], available to chart variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Rapid and sharp changes of the magnetic field may indicate a [[geomagnetic storm]].
* A [[ionospheric sounding|digisonde]] that can provide ionospheric profiles, allowing scientists to choose appropriate frequencies for IRI operation. The HAARP makes current and historic digisonde information available online.
* An induction magnetometer, provided by the [[University of Tokyo]], that measures the changing geomagnetic field in the [[Ultra Low Frequency]] (ULF) range of 0–5&amp;nbsp;Hz.
The facility is powered by a set of five (5) 2500 kilowatt generators being driven by EMD 20-645-E4 diesel locomotive engines.

The project site ({{Coord|62|23|30|N|145|09|03|W|}}) is north of [[Gakona, Alaska|Gakona]], [[Alaska]] just west of [[Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park]]. An [[environmental impact statement]] led to permission for an array of up to 180 [[antennas]] to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; HAARP was constructed at the previous site of an [[over-the-horizon radar]] (OTH) installation. A large structure, built to house the OTH now houses the HAARP control room, kitchen and offices. Several other small structures house various instruments.

The HAARP site was constructed in three distinct phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

#The '''Developmental Prototype''' (DP) had 18 antenna elements, organized in three columns by six rows. It was fed with a total of 360 kilowatts (kW) combined transmitter output power. The DP transmitted just enough power for the most basic of ionospheric testing.
#The '''Filled Developmental Prototype''' (FDP) had 48 antenna units arrayed in six columns by eight rows, with 960&amp;nbsp;kW of transmitter power. It was fairly comparable to other [[Ionospheric heater#Current facilities|ionospheric heating facilities]]. This was used for a number of successful scientific experiments and ionospheric exploration campaigns over the years.
#The '''Final IRI''' (FIRI) is the final build of the IRI. It has 180 antenna units, organized in 15 columns by 12 rows, yielding a theoretical maximum gain of 31&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]. A total of 3.6&amp;nbsp;MW of transmitter power will feed it, but the power is focused in the upward direction by the geometry of the large [[phased array]] of antennas which allow the antennas to work together in controlling the direction. {{As of|March 2007}}, all the antennas were in place, the final phase was completed and the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] was undergoing testing aimed at fine-tuning its performance to comply with safety requirements required by regulatory agencies. The facility officially began full operations in its final 3.6 MW transmitter power completed status in the summer of 2007, yielding an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.1 [[Gigawatts]] or 97.1 [[dBW]] at maximum output. However, the site typically operates at a fraction of that value due to the lower [[antenna gain]] exhibited at standard operational frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;

In America, there are two related [[ionospheric heater|ionospheric heating]] facilities: the [[HIPAS]], near [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], which was dismantled in 2009, and one at the [[Arecibo Observatory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naic.edu/general_int/gen_wshops/AGRP%20workshop%20report5.pdf Link text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203075110/http://www.naic.edu/general_int/gen_wshops/AGRP%20workshop%20report5.pdf |date=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Puerto Rico]] (currently offline for reconstruction). The [[European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association]] (EISCAT) operates an ionospheric heating facility capable of transmitting over 1&amp;nbsp;GW [[effective radiated power]] (ERP), near [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=B.

==Conspiracy theories==
{{see also|List of conspiracy theories#Weaponry|l1=List of conspiracy theories: Weaponry}}

HAARP is the subject of numerous [[conspiracy theories]]. Various individuals have speculated about hidden motivations and capabilities of the project. For example, [[Rosalie Bertell]] warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Rosalie Bertell}}, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45492.html Background on the HAARP Project]. Global Policy Forum, 5 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Chossudovsky]] stated in a book published by the [[Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform]] that "recent scientific evidence suggests that HAARP is fully operational and has the capability of triggering [[flood]]s, [[hurricane]]s, [[drought]]s and  [[earthquake]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Michel Chossudovsky}}, ''Climate Manipulation as a War Weapon'', p181-182.

Allegations include the following:
* Nick Begich Jr., the son of the late [[U.S. Representative]] [[Nick Begich]] and brother of former [[U.S. Senator]] [[Mark Begich]], is the author of ''Angels Don't Play This HAARP.'' He has claimed that the HAARP facility could trigger earthquakes and turn the upper atmosphere into a giant lens so that "the sky would literally appear to burn." He maintains a website that claims HAARP is a mind control device.&lt;ref name=Shachtman&gt;{{cite news|last=Shachtman|first=Noah|title=Strange New Air Force Facility Energizes Ionosphere, Fans Conspiracy Flames|url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-08/mf_haarp?currentPage=all|publisher=Wired Magazine|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=About us - Dr. Nick Begich|url=http://www.earthpulse.com/src/category.asp?catid=13|accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Former [[Governor of Minnesota]], ex-professional wrestler, and documentary maker [[Jesse Ventura]] questioned whether the government is using the site to manipulate the weather or to bombard people with mind-controlling radio waves. An Air Force spokeswoman said Ventura made an official request to visit the research station but was rejected.

* Physicist [[Bernard Eastlund]] claimed that HAARP includes technology based on his own patents that has the capability to modify weather and neutralize satellites.&lt;ref name=PopSci/&gt;
* It has been proposed as a cause of [[The Hum|low frequency background hums]] said to be heard in various locales.&lt;ref name=SYSK/&gt;

Two Georgia men arrested on drug charges in November 2016 were reportedly plotting domestic terrorism based on conspiracy theories about HAARP. The Coffee County Sheriff's Office said the men possessed a "massive arsenal" that included [[Colt AR-15|AR-15]] rifles, [[Glock]] handguns, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition. According to police, the men wanted to destroy HAARP because they believed the facility manipulates the weather, controls minds and even traps the souls of people. Police say the men confessed that "God told them to go and blow this machine up that kept souls, so souls could be released."&lt;ref name="ADN"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Annie|title=Georgia men plotted attack on Alaska aurora research facility to 'release souls,' detective says|url=https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2016/11/01/2-men-arrested-in-georgia-planned-to-attack-alaska-aurora-research-facility-investigators-say/|website=ADN.com|publisher=Alaska Dispatch News|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WALB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckets|first1=Re-Essa|title=Suspected terrorists believe research facility controls minds, traps souls|url=http://www.walb.com/story/33541811/suspected-terrorists-believes-research-facility-controls-minds-traps-souls|website=WALB.com|publisher=WALB news|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University]] professor [[Umran Inan]] told ''[[Popular Science]]'' that weather-control conspiracy theories were "completely uninformed," explaining that "there's absolutely nothing we can do to disturb the Earth's [weather] systems. Even though the power HAARP radiates is very large, it's minuscule compared with the power of a lightning flash—and there are 50 to 100 lightning flashes every second. HAARP's intensity is very small."&lt;ref name=PopSci&gt;{{cite web|last=Streep|first=Abe|title=The Military's Mystery Machine: The High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program, or HAARP, has been called a missile-defense tool and a mind-control device.

The facility doesn't open its doors in the same way as other federally-funded research facilities around the country, and it doesn't go to great efforts to explain the importance of its research to the public."&lt;ref name="Alaska Dispatch"/&gt; In 2016, in response to these claims, the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] [[Geophysical Institute]], which manages the facility, announced that HAARP will host an annual open house in August, allowing visitors to tour the complex.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2016/08/24/haarps-new-owner-holds-open-house-to-prove-facility-is-not-capable-of-mind-control/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kingwood queen.jpg|right|thumb|300 px|A chess piece made from kingwood.]]

'''Kingwood''' is a classic furniture wood, almost exclusively used for inlays on very fine furniture. It was the most expensive wood in general use for furniture making in the seventeenth century, at which time it was known as princes wood.

Occasionally it is used in the solid for small items and turned work, including parts of billiard cues, e.g., those made by [[John Parris]]. It is brownish-purple with many fine darker stripes and occasional irregular swirls. Occasionally it contains pale streaks of a similar colour to the sapwood, as in the picture.

The wood is very dense and hard and can be brought to a spectacular finish. It turns well but due to its density and hardness it can be difficult to work with hand tools.  It also has a tendency to blunt tools due to its abrasive properties.

It is available only in small sizes (it is yielded by a smallish tree, ''[[Dalbergia cearensis]]'', restricted to a small area in Brazil). Other woods yielded by the [[Dalbergia|same genus]] are [[cocobolo]], [[rosewood]], [[African blackwood]], [[Bombay blackwood]] and [[tulipwood]].

The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s. '''''Lìqiū''''', ''Risshū'', ''Ipchu'', or ''Lập thu'' ({{CJKV|t=立秋|s=立秋|p=lìqiū|j=立秋|r=risshū|k=입추|rr=ipchu|v=lập thu|l=start of autumn}}) is the 13th solar term. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 135° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 150°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 135°. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around August 7 and ends around August 23.

Liqiu signifies the beginning of autumn in East Asian cultures.

The '''list of Florida hurricanes from 1900 to 1949''' encompasses 108 [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic tropical cyclones]] that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in about $4&amp;nbsp;billion (2008&amp;nbsp;USD) in damage. Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were directly responsible for about 3,550&amp;nbsp;fatalities during the time period, most of which from the [[1928 Okeechobee Hurricane]]. The [[1947 Atlantic hurricane season|1947 season]] was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, with a total of 6&amp;nbsp;systems. The [[1905 Atlantic hurricane season|1905]], [[1908 Atlantic hurricane season|1908]], [[1913 Atlantic hurricane season|1913]], [[1927 Atlantic hurricane season|1927]], [[1931 Atlantic hurricane season|1931]], [[1942 Atlantic hurricane season|1942]], and [[1943 Atlantic hurricane season|1943]] seasons were the only years during the time period in which a storm did not affect the Floridian coasts.

The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the time period was the [[Labor Day Hurricane of 1935]], which also bears the distinction of being the strongest recorded hurricane to strike the United States.&lt;ref name="damage 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/NWS-TPC-5.pdf|title=THE DEADLIEST, COSTLIEST, AND MOST INTENSE UNITED STATES TROPICAL CYCLONES FROM 1851 TO 2006 (AND OTHER FREQUENTLY REQUESTED HURRICANE FACTS) |author1=Eric S.

Landsea |date=April 2007|accessdate=2007-04-11|pages=26|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other major hurricanes struck the state during the time period, including the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]], the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, and a cyclone each in 1945 and 1949. All of these storms made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] as [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] hurricanes.

This is a list of the thirty-seven 6000 metre [[mountain|peaks]] in [[Peru]] as defined by a regain height, or [[Topographic prominence|prominence]], above a col of 300m or more. This list is taken from the full set of Peruvian IGM maps&lt;ref&gt;Peruvian Instituto Geografico Militar 1:100, 000 map series published in Lima, various dates from 1950's to present, Sheets 18-h, 19-h, 19-i, 20-i, 21-j, 27-q, 28-t, 28-u, 30-y, 31-q, 32-q, 32-s and 33-s cover the 6000m peaks of Peru.&lt;/ref&gt; alongside various climbing and mountaineering records.&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Peaks less than 6000m==
Many peaks in Peru frequently quoted as being over 6000m are under this height according to the most recent surveys published by the Peruvian IGM. These peaks include:- [[Pumasillo]] 5,991m, Lasunayoc 5,936m, [[Yanarahu (Asunción-Carhuaz-Yungay)|Yanarahu]] 5,954m, [[Artesonraju]] 5,999m, [[Sabancaya]] 5,976m, [[Palumani]] 5,723m, Sara Sara 5,505m, Helancoma 5,367m.

==Sub-peaks with less than 300m re-ascent==
Other 6,000 m peaks which are often defined as individual peaks but which have less than 300 m of re-ascent or [[prominence]], include:- Huandoy W 6,342 m (prominence between 200-250m), Sarapu 6,127 (prominence between 180-230m), Callangate North 6,000 m (less than 295m prominence).

Qaras E (6025m) and [[Rasac]] (6,017 m) may or may not have 300m prominence. There is insufficient data on the relevant Peruvian IGM maps.

== Mountain ranges ==
Peru is home to a number of mountain ranges, including the following:

The lists can be contradictory but are all useful. They use different criteria of [[prominence]] or re-ascent for defining major peaks and sub-peaks.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of the [[United States]] and [[North America]].  Denali is the third-most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third-most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''200 [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of the [[United States]] with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]]. The summit may be near its key col or quite far away. The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, only [[Denali]] exceeds {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.  Four major summits exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, nine exceed {{convert|4500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 4000-meter summits of the United States|104 exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], 220 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and 302 major summits exceed 3000 meters' (9843 feet) elevation.

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
{{see also|List of the major 4000-meter summits of the United States|List of the major 3000-meter summits of the United States|List of United States fourteeners}}
Of these 200 highest major summits of the United States, 88 are located in Colorado, 49 in Alaska, 22 in California, 14 in Wyoming, eight in New Mexico, five in Utah, four in Nevada, three in Montana, two in Washington, two in Hawai{{okina}}i, two in Idaho, and one in Arizona.  Five of these peaks lie on the international border between Alaska and Yukon, and two lie on the international border between Alaska and British Columbia.  The ten highest major summits of the United States are all located in Alaska.

[[Animal]]s are [[multicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms that form the [[Kingdom (biology)|biological kingdom]] '''Animalia'''. With few exceptions, animals [[Heterotroph|consume organic material]], [[Cellular_respiration#Aerobic_respiration|breathe oxygen]], are [[Motility|able to move]], [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]], and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the [[blastula]], during [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. Over 1.5 million [[Extant taxon|living]] animal species have been [[Species description|described]]—of which around 1 million are [[Insecta|insects]]—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million in total. Animals range in size from 8.5&amp;nbsp;millionths of a metre to {{convert|33.6|m|ft}} long and have [[Ecology|complex interactions]] with each other and their environments, forming intricate [[food web]]s. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].

Animals may be listed or indexed by many criteria, including [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], status as [[endangered species]], their geographical location, and their portrayal and/or naming in human culture.

[[File:Giovanni Bellini and Titian - The Feast of the Gods - Detail- figures right &amp; tub with script.jpg|thumb|Priapus and Lotis, detail of ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' by [[Giovanni Bellini]] (c. 1514)]]
[[File:Palumba lotis.jpg|thumb|The story of [[Priapus]] and Lotis, engraving by [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], c. 1510]]
'''Lotis''' was a [[nymph]] mentioned by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheLotis.html Theoi Project - Lotis] gives the two passages&lt;/ref&gt;   In his account, at the [[Liberalia]] festival, [[Priapus]] tried to rape her when everyone had fallen asleep, but she was awakened by a sudden cry of [[Silenus]]'s donkey and ran off, leaving Priapus in embarrassment as everyone else woke up too and became aware of his intentions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', 1. 391 ff&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, she was changed into a [[lotus tree]] to escape Priapus; later, [[Dryope]] picked a flower off the tree Lotis had become, and was transformed into a [[black poplar]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', 9. 347 ff&lt;/ref&gt;  

In Book 6 of the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' Ovid tells much the same story, but with the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] rather than Lotis as the intended victim.  According to some sources, Lotis was the daughter of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] or [[Nereus]].  Ovid suggests that Priapus later kills the donkey.

==In art==
The story does not seem to feature in [[Ancient Greek vase-painting]], and only occasionally in later weird pictures.  Priapus and Lotis appear in the right foreground of ''[[The Feast of the Gods]]'' by [[Giovanni Bellini]] (c. 1514),&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 242&lt;/ref&gt; in an [[engraving]] by [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]] (c. 1510), and a drawing by [[Parmigianino]] of the 1530s.  Bellini keeps Priapus's aroused state visible under his clothes,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 253&lt;/ref&gt; Palumba has it out in the open, as Parmigianino originally did, but this has been altered subsequently,&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, 196; [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715864&amp;partId=1 British Museum collection database]&lt;/ref&gt; as very explicit details often were in art.  There are also some depictions of Lotis as a tree-hugger.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Carboniferous stages}}
The '''Mississippian''' (also known as '''Lower Carboniferous''' or '''Early Carboniferous''') is a [[period (geology)|subperiod]] in the [[geologic timescale]] or a [[system (stratigraphy)|subsystem]] of the [[geologic record]]. It is the earliest/lowermost of two subperiods of the [[Carboniferous]] [[period (geology)|period]] lasting from roughly 358.9 to 323.2 million years ago. As with most other [[geochronology|geochronologic]] units, the [[stratum|rock bed]]s that define the Mississippian are well identified, but the exact start and end dates are uncertain by a few million years. The Mississippian is so named because rocks with this age are exposed in the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi River valley]]. 

The Mississippian was a period of [[marine transgression]] in the Northern Hemisphere: the sea level was so high that only the [[Baltic Shield|Fennoscandian Shield]] and the [[Canadian Shield|Laurentian Shield]] were dry land. The [[craton]]s were surrounded by extensive delta systems and [[lagoon]]s, and carbonate sedimentation on the surrounding continental platforms, covered by shallow seas.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare Emiliani, ''Planet Earth: Cosmology, Geology, and the Evolution of Life and Environment'' 1992 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North America]], where the interval consists primarily of marine [[limestone]]s, it is treated as a geologic period between the [[Devonian]] and the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]]. During the Mississippian an important phase of [[orogeny]] occurred in the [[Appalachian Mountains]].  It is a major rock-building period named for the exposures in the [[Mississippi Valley]] region. The USGS geologic time scale shows its relation to other periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2007/3015/ USGS Timescale]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are one more-or-less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the [[Carboniferous]] [[system (stratigraphy)|system]], and sometimes called the ''[[Upper Carboniferous]]'' and ''Lower Carboniferous'' instead.

==Subdivisions==
In the official geologic timescale, the Mississippian is subdivided into three stages:
*[[Serpukhovian]] ({{Period start|Serpukhovian}} to {{Period end|Serpukhovian}} mya)
*[[Visean]] ({{Period start|Visean}} to {{Period end|Visean}} mya)
*[[Tournaisian]] ({{Period start|Tournaisian}} to {{Period end|Tournaisian}} mya)

The lower two come from European stratigraphy, the top from Russian stratigraphy. Besides Europe and Russia, there are many local subdivisions that are used as alternatives for the international timescale. In the North American system, the Mississippian is subdivided into four stages:
*[[Chesterian]] (top of the Visean plus the Serpukhovian)
*[[Meramecian]] (middle Visean)
*[[Osagean]] (top of the Tournaisian and bottom of the Visean)
*[[Kinderhookian]] (the lower two-thirds of the Tournaisian)

[[File:Mount Osorezan Relief Map, SRTM-1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Osore Volcano]]
{{Nihongo|'''Mount Osore'''|恐山|Osore-zan}} is the name of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist temple]] and [[folk religion]] pilgrimage destination in the center of remote [[Shimokita Peninsula]] of [[Aomori Prefecture]], in the northern [[Tōhoku region]] of northern [[Japan]]. The temple is located in the [[caldera]] of an active volcano and is believed in Japanese mythology to be one of the gates to the underworld.

==Mount Osore volcano==
The mountain is one peak of the {{nihongo|'''Osorezan Mountain Range'''|恐山山地|Osore Sanchi}}, a series of eight [[somma volcano]]s ranging from east to west in the centre of Shimokita Peninsula. Mount Osore has a height of {{convert|879|m|ft}}. Although Mount Osore last erupted over 10,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History states that an eruption occurred in 1787, but this is not corroborated by Japanese sources&lt;/ref&gt; the area has many [[fumarole]]s emitting steam and/or [[volcanic gas]]es (especially [[sulfur dioxide]]) indicating that it is still an active volcano. [[Lake Usori]] is a [[caldera lake]] at the center of Mount Osore, with highly acidic waters.

During the [[Meiji period]], [[sulphur]] deposits in the area were exploited, partly to meet the demand for [[gunpowder]] production by the growing Japanese military; however the deposits were not economical to mine due to the remoteness of the site and the increasing availability of sulphur as a byproduct of [[petroleum refining]].

==Bodai-ji temple and pilgrimage location==
The mountain is the location of a [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] Buddhist temple, {{Nihongo|'''Bodai-ji'''|菩提寺|}},  which claims to have been founded in 862 AD by the famed monk [[Ennin]], with [[Kshitigarbha|Jizo Bosatsu]] as its main image.The temple was abandoned in 1457 and restored back to use in 1530&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://planetyze.com/en/japan/aomori/mount-osore/information|title=About Mount Osore - Aomori Travel Guide {{!}} Planetyze|website=Planetyze|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In popular folk religion, the otherworldly setting of Mount Osore, with its charred landscape of blasted rocks filled with bubbling pits noted for unearthly hues and noxious fumes came to be one of several places in Japan identified to be an entrance to [[Hell]]. A small brook running to the neighboring [[Lake Usori]] was equated to the [[Sanzu River]], a river that deceased souls need to cross of their way to the afterlife.

A unique feature of Bodai-ji is the presence of [[mediumship|mediums]] known as ''[[itako]]'' who claim to summon the souls of the dead and deliver messages in their voices. These mediums were traditionally blind and had to receive extensive spiritual training and purification rituals; however, in modern times their number has dwindled and not all are blind. The temple has a twice-yearly ''Itako Taisai'' festival held in summer and autumn.

The temple also maintains a [[onsen|hot spring resort]] for use by pilgrims and tourists.

===In modern culture===
The work of contemporary artist [[Nara Yoshitomo]], who is a native of Aomori Prefecture, is believed to be influenced, if at least subconsciously, by Mount Osore (Ivy, 2010).  For instance, his piece entitled “Not Everything But/ Green House” depicts a small female child standing over a pile of discarded dolls of varying characteristics and eras much like those observed at Mount Osore.&lt;ref&gt;A picture of this piece while at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in March 2009 may be seen [http://arrestedmotion.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_0360.jpg here].&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a collection of ''fictional [[fungi]]'', artist [[Takeshi Yamada]] created the Oh-dokuro-dake (or “skull mushroom”) and the story surrounding their presence on Mount Osore for his "center for medical mycology" art project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takeshiyamada.weebly.com/center-for-medical-mycology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626210303/http://takeshiyamada.weebly.com/center-for-medical-mycology.html |archivedate=2015-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mount Logan.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Logan]] in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]] of [[Yukon]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[summit]] of [[Canada]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Canada]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 100 highest major summits of Canada by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=range/&gt;&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].

'''National parks''' are a [[devolution|devolved]] matter with each of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] having its own policies and arrangements. Counted together, the United Kingdom has fifteen [[national park]]s with ten in [[England]], three in [[Wales]] and two in [[Scotland]]. These parks are not truly national parks according to the internationally accepted standard of the [[IUCN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even though the IUCN call category II 'national parks', the UK's national parks are actually in category V.|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/nationalparksareprotectedareas/iucncategories|work=www.nationalparks.gov.uk|publisher=UK ANPA|accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are areas of outstanding [[landscape]] where habitation and commercial activities are restricted. 

There are currently no national parks in [[Northern Ireland]] though there are controversial moves to establish one in the [[Mourne Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6388157.stm |title=Northern Ireland &amp;#124; Community split over national park |publisher=BBC News|first=Martin |last=Cassidy |date=|accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If established, it would stretch from [[Carlingford Lough]] to [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]] and [[Slieve Croob]].  Though it might create jobs in tourism, there are fears that it would drive up the area's cost of living.

All fifteen national parks share two statutory purposes; To conserve and enhance the natural and cultural heritage of the area, and to promote understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the national park by the public. The Scottish national parks have two further statutory purposes; To promote sustainable use of the natural resources of the area, and to promote sustainable economic and social development of the area’s communities. 

[[The Broads]] was not established as a national park, but was described at the time as having a 'status equivalent to that of a national park'. It has since adopted the title 'national park' and is a member of the UK national parks family, with the same level of landscape protection and an additional statutory purpose; to protect the interests of navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aims and purposes of National Parks|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/aimsandpurposesofnationalparks|work=www.nationalparks.gov.uk|publisher=UK ANPA|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All fifteen national parks in the UK are members of the [[Association of National Park Authorities]] (ANPA), which works to promote the UK national parks family and to facilitate training and development between staff and members of all parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ANPA|url=http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus/about_anpa|work=www.nationalparks.gov.uk|publisher=UK ANPA|accessdate=15 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223174220/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/aboutus/about_anpa|archivedate=23 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 2014 there was a movement to establish the [[Greater London]] area as a kind of national park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2014/may/27/greater-london-national-park-city |title=Why Greater London should be made into an urban national park |publisher=The Guardian|first=Daniel |last=Raven-Ellison |date=|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear power]] is a major source of energy in France, with a 40% share of energy consumption in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/Sankey/index.html#?c=France&amp;s=Balance&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nuclear power is the largest source of electricity in the country, with a generation of 379.1 [[terawatt-hour|TWh]], or 71.6%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryDetails.aspx?current=FR|title=PRIS - Country Details|website=pris.iaea.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the country's total production of 519.4 TWh, the highest percentage in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Facts-and-Figures/Nuclear-generation-by-country/#.UkrawYakrOM |title=Nuclear shares of electricity generation |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
France has a long relationship with nuclear power, starting with [[Henri Becquerel]]'s discovery of natural radioactivity in the 1890s and continued by famous nuclear scientists like [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Marie Curie]].

Before [[World War II]], France had been mainly involved in nuclear research through the work of the [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Joliot]]-[[Irène Joliot-Curie|Curie]]s. In 1945 the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF) created the ''[[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]]'' (CEA) governmental agency, and [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]] winner [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], member of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) since 1942, was appointed high-commissioner. He was relieved of his duties in 1950 for [[Cold War|political reasons]], and would be one of the 11 signatories to the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]] in 1955. The CEA was created by [[Charles de Gaulle]] on 18 October 1945.  Its mandate is to conduct [[fundamental research|fundamental]] and [[applied research]] into many areas, including the design of [[nuclear reactor]]s, the manufacturing of [[integrated circuits]], the use of [[radionuclide]]s for medical treatments, [[seismology]] and [[tsunami]] propagation, and the safety of [[computer|computerized systems]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Nuclear research was discontinued for a time after the war because of the instability of the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] and the lack of finances available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/france/nuke.htm Notice on France] on ''[[Global Security]]'' {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1950s a civil nuclear research program was started, a by-product of which would be [[plutonium]].  In 1956 a secret Committee for the Military Applications of Atomic Energy was formed and a development program for delivery vehicles started. In 1957, soon after the [[Suez Crisis]] and the diplomatic tension with both the [[USSR]] and the United States, French president [[René Coty]] decided the creation of the C.S.E.M. in what was then [[French rule in Algeria|French Sahara]], a new nuclear testing facility replacing the [[CIEES]] testing facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/content/download/60823/571529/file/SAHARA.pdf Sahara] on the website of the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Minister of Defence]] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[France and nuclear weapons]].

The first nuclear power plant by EDF in France was opened in 1962.&lt;ref name=edf-history /&gt;

===Messmer Plan===
As a direct result of the [[1973 oil crisis]], on 6 March 1974 Prime Minister [[Pierre Messmer]] unexpectedly announced what became known as the 'Messmer Plan', a huge nuclear power program aimed at generating all of France's electricity from nuclear power.&lt;ref name=edf-history&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Electriciteacute;-de-France-Company-History.html Electricité de France Company History] [[Electricité de France]], accessed 2011-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the oil crisis most of France's electricity came from foreign oil.  Nuclear power allowed France to compensate for its lack of indigenous energy resources by applying its strengths in heavy engineering.&lt;ref name="WNA"&gt;{{cite web|author = World Nuclear Association|title = Nuclear Power in France|accessdate = 25 August 2007|date=August 2007|url = http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Country-Profiles/Countries-A-F/France/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frontline1997"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Frontline|episode=Nuclear Reaction|date=24 April 1997|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/etc/script.html|quote=Jean-Pierre CHAUSAUDE, Electricité de France: In France we have no oil, no gas, no coal, no choice. And for the French people, it was very positive to develop national energy with nuclear energy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was summarized in a slogan: "In France, we do not have oil, but we have ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Valérie Lehmann|author2=Valérie Colomb|author3=Bernard Motulsky|title=Communication et grands projets: les nouveaux défis|date=2013|publisher=PUQ|isbn=9782760536777|page=141|quote=En France, on a toutes sortes de choses, on a la meilleure cuisine du monde, une industrie puissante, la pétanque, une histoire glorieuse, on a aussi une situation géographique privilégiée, la Tour Eiffel et la pêche à la ligne, oui en France on a tout ça et bien plus encore, pourtant une chose nous manque, une chose essentielle, le pétrole, le pétrole nous sommes obligés de l’acheter à d’autres, cher, trop cher.  En France, on n’a pas de pétrole, mais on a des idées.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of the Messmer Plan, which was enacted without public or parliamentary debate,&lt;ref name=cahiers /&gt;&lt;ref name=dor&gt;Nelkin, Dorothy and Michael Pollak, "Ideology as Strategy: The Discourse of the Anti-Nuclear Movement in France and Germany" ''Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values'', Vol. 5, No. 30 (Winter, 1980), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; also led to the foundation of the ''[[Groupement des scientifiques pour l'information sur l'énergie nucléaire]]'' (Association of Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy), formed after around 4,000 scientists signed a [[petition]] of concern over the government's action, known as the ''Appeal of the 400'' after the 400 scientists who initially signed it.&lt;ref name=cahiers /&gt;

The plan envisaged the construction of around 80 nuclear plants by 1985 and a total of 170 plants by 2000.&lt;ref name=cahiers&gt;[http://chrhc.revues.org/index214.html Les physiciens dans le mouvement antinucléaire : entre science, expertise et politique] Cahiers d'histoire, published 2007, accessed 2011-04-11&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the first three plants, at [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant|Tricastin]], [[Gravelines Nuclear Power Station|Gravelines]], and [[Dampierre Nuclear Power Plant|Dampierre]] started the same year&lt;ref name=edf-history /&gt; and France installed 56 reactors over the next 15 years.&lt;ref name=palfreman /&gt;

===Recent developments===
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], the head of France's nuclear safety agency has said that France needs to upgrade the protection of vital functions in all its nuclear reactors to avoid a disaster in the event of a natural calamity, adding there was no need to close any plants. "There is a need to add a layer to protect safety mechanisms in reactors that are vital for the protection of the reactor such as cooling functions and electric powering," Jacques Repussard, head of the IRSN, said.&lt;ref name=reu11/&gt; Opinion polls show support for atomic energy has dropped since Fukushima. Forty percent of the French "are 'hesitant' about nuclear energy while a third are in favor and 17 percent are against, according to a survey by pollster Ifop published November 13".&lt;ref name=reu11&gt;{{cite web | first= Tara | last= Patel | title= Atomic Spat Rocks French Election as Sarkozy Rival Backs Halts | work= Bloomberg | date= 1 December 2011 | url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-01/atomic-spat-rocks-french-election-as-sarkozy-rival-backs-halts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, President Sarkozy decided to extend the life of existing nuclear reactors beyond 40 years, following the [[Court of Audit of France|Court of Audit]] decision that this is the best option as new nuclear capacity or other forms of energy would be more costly and available too late. Within ten years 22 out of the 58 reactors will have been operating for over 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= France to extend life of nuclear plants&amp;nbsp;– minister | date= 12 February 2012 | publisher=

The court expects EDF's projected investment programme in existing plant, including post [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] safety improvements, will add between 9.5% and 14.5% to generation costs, taking costs to between 37.9 and 54.2 EUR/MWh. Generation costs from the new Flamanville EPR reactor are estimated to be at least in the 70 to 90 EUR/MWh range, depending on construction outcome.&lt;ref name=comptes-summary&gt;{{cite report | title= The costs of the nuclear power sector&amp;nbsp;– Summary in English | publisher= Cour des Comptes | date= January 2012 | url= http://www.ccomptes.fr/en/JF/documents/divers/Costs_nuclear_power_sector_summary.pdf | accessdate= 11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Academics at [[Paris Dauphine University]] forecast that domestic electricity prices will rise by about 30% by 2020.&lt;ref name=bbc-20140111&gt;{{cite news | first= Rob | last= Broomby | title= France struggles to cut down on nuclear power | publisher= BBC | date= 11 January 2014 | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25674581 | accessdate= 14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[François Hollande]]'s victory in the [[French presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], it was thought that there might be a partial nuclear phaseout in France. This followed a national debate in the run-up to the election, with President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] backing nuclear power and François Hollande proposing a cut in nuclear power's electricity contribution by more than a third by 2025.&lt;ref name=nweek11&gt;

It seemed certain that Hollande would at least order the closure of the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] by 2017 &lt;ref&gt;

where there has been an ongoing closure campaign due to concerns about seismic activity and flooding.

Active efforts by the French government to market the advanced [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|European Pressurized Reactor]] have been hampered by cost overruns, delays, and competition from other nations, such as [[South Korea]], which offer simpler, cheaper reactors.&lt;ref name=NYT5715&gt;

In 2015, the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] voted that by 2025 only 50% of France's energy will be produced by nuclear plants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-French-energy-transition-bill-adopted-2307155.html&lt;/ref&gt; Environment Minister [[Nicolas Hulot]] noted in November 2017 that this goal is unrealistic, postponing the reduction to 2030 or 2035.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-nuclearpower/france-postpones-target-for-cutting-nuclear-share-of-power-production-idUSKBN1D71TM&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016, following a discovery at [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant]], about 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 have been found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns, likely to continue over the winter high electricity demand period into 2017. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply.&lt;ref name=ft-20161028&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/f86a3c6c-9c60-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a |title=French nuclear outages threaten higher UK power bills |author=Andrew Ward |newspaper=Financial Times |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=large-2016&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/france/PageFiles/266171/Note_LargeAndAssociates_EN_26092016.pdf |title=Irregularities and Anomalies Relating to the Forged Components of Le Creusot Forge |author=John Large |work=Large Associates |publisher=Greenpeace France |date=26 September 2016 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late October 2016, 20 of France's 58 reactors are offline.&lt;ref name=powermag-20161101&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.powermag.com/frances-nuclear-storm-many-power-plants-down-due-to-quality-concerns/?printmode=1 |title=France's Nuclear Storm: Many Power Plants Down Due to Quality Concerns |author=Lee Buchsbaum |newspaper=POWER |date=1 November 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters-20161108&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-power-winteroutlook-idUKKBN1332C6 |title=France could face winter power cuts, hit by nuclear dependence |author=Bate Felix, Geert De Clercq |publisher=Reuters |date=8 November 2016 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steel quality concerns may prevent the regulator giving the life extensions from 40 to 50 years, that had been assumed by energy planners, for many reactors.&lt;ref name=economist-20161203&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21711087-electricit-de-france-has-had-shut-down-18-its-58-nuclear-reactors-frances-nuclear-energy |title=France's nuclear-energy champion is in turmoil |newspaper=The Economist |date=3 December 2016 |accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' characterised the problem as a "decades long coverup of manufacturing problems", with Areva executives acknowledging that Le Creusot had been falsifying documents.&lt;ref name=wsj-20161213&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/problems-at-nuclear-components-supplier-spark-global-reviews-1481625005 |title=Coverup at French Nuclear Supplier Sparks Global Review |author1=Matthew Dalton |author2=Inti Landauro |author3=Rebecca Smith |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=13 December 2016 |accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[President Macron]] announced the 50% nuclear power reduction target is being delayed to 2035, and would involve closing fourteen 900 MWe reactors. The two oldest reactors, units 1 and 2 at Fessenheim, will close in 2020.

EdF said its third-generation nuclear reactor EPR project at its Flamanville, northern France, plant will be delayed until 2016, due to "both structural and economic reasons," which will bring the project's total cost to EUR8.5 billion.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[g]https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/03/us-edf-nuclear-flamanville-idUSBRE8B214620121203 Retrieved 31 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the cost of the EPR to be built at Olkiluoto, Finland has escalated. Areva and the utility involved "are in bitter dispute over who will bear the cost overruns and there is a real risk now that the utility will default.  EDF has suggested that if the political environment causes the EPR costs to overrun, the design would be replaced with a cheaper and simpler Franco-Japanese design, the [[Atmea]] for which the design will be completed by 2013, or the already operating Franco-Chinese design, the [[CPR-1000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5990b898-0ed8-11e1-9dbb-00144feabdc0.html |title=EDF searches for reactor suppliers |author=Ed Crooks |date=14 November 2011 |newspaper=Financial Times |accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/industrie/energie-environnement/20111113trib000663723/en-pleine-polemique-sur-flamanville-edf-se-prepare-a-abandonner-l-epr.html |title=FEn pleine polémique sur Flamanville, EDF se prépare à abandonner l'EPR |author=Marie-Caroline Lopez |date=13 November 2011 |newspaper=La Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, EDF further delayed fuel loading to Q4 2019 and increased the project's cost estimate by a further €400 million ($467.1 million USD).

[[File:Nuclear power plants map France-en 2.svg|thumb|Map of operating French nuclear power reactors, by class]]
Drawing such a large percentage of overall electrical production from nuclear power is unique to France.  This reliance has resulted in certain necessary deviations from the standard design and function of other nuclear power programs. For instance, in order to meet changing demand throughout the day, some plants must work as [[peaking power plant]], whereas most nuclear plants in the world operate as [[base load power plant|base-load plants]], and allow other fossil or hydro units to adjust to demand. Nuclear power in France has a total [[capacity factor]] of around 77%, which is low due to load following. However availability is around 84%, indicating excellent overall performance of the plants.

The first eight power reactors in the nation were gas cooled reactor types ([[UNGG reactor]]), whose development was pioneered by CEA. Coinciding with a [[uranium enrichment]] program, EDF developed [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) technology which eventually became the dominant type. The gas-cooled reactors located at [[Brennilis Nuclear Power Plant|Brennilis]], [[Bugey Nuclear Power Plant|Bugey]], [[Chinon Nuclear Power Plant|Chinon]], and [[Marcoule Nuclear Power Plant|Marcoule]] have all been shut down.

All operating plants today are PWRs. The sodium-cooled fast [[breeder reactor]] technology development reactors, [[Phénix]] and [[Superphénix]], have been shut down with work ongoing for a more advanced replacement in the form of the [[ASTRID (reactor)]].

The PWR plants were all developed by [[Framatome]] (now [[Areva]]) from the initial [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] design.&lt;ref name=nyt-19810124&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/24/business/france-set-to-build-reactors.html |title=France Set to Build Reactors |first=Paul |last=Lewis |newspaper=New York Times |date=24 January 1981 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fundinguniverse-1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/framatome-sa-history/ |title=Framatome SA History |work=International Directory of Company Histories |publisher=FundingUniverse |year=1998 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pubs-1976&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v054n002.p005 |title=Westinghouse sells French nuclear stake |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |year=1976 |volume=54 |issue=2 |doi=10.1021/cen-v054n002.p005 |accessdate=21 April 2017 |quote=Westinghouse will continue to receive license royalties at present rates on the existing and planned nuclear reactors designed around its pressurized-water reactor system.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All currently operating PWR plants are of three design variations, having output powers of 900&amp;nbsp;[[MWe]], 1300&amp;nbsp;MWe, and 1450&amp;nbsp;MWe. The repeated use of these standard variants of a design has afforded France the greatest degree of nuclear plant standardization in the world.

===900 MWe class (CP0, CP1 and CP2 designs)===
[[File:Saint-laurent-nouan.JPG|thumb|The [[Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant|Saint-Laurent]] site, showing two CP2, 900&amp;nbsp;MWe class reactors and the cooling tower on the right]]

There are a total of 34 of these reactors in operation; most were constructed in the 1970s and the early 1980s. In 2002, they had a uniform review and all were granted a 10-year life extension.

With the CP0 and CP1 designs, two reactors share the same machine and command room. With the CP2 design, each reactor has its own machine and command room. Apart from this difference, CP1 and CP2 use the same technologies, and the two types are frequently referred to as ''CPY''. Compared to CP0 they have an additional cooling circuit between the emergency system that in case of an accident allows to spray water into the containment and the circuit which contains river water, a more flexible control system and some minor difference in the layout of the building.&lt;ref name=asn-rapport&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

This three loop design (three steam generators and three primary circulation pumps) was also exported to a number of other countries, including:

* South Africa&amp;nbsp;– two units at the [[Koeberg nuclear power station]]
* [[South Korea]]&amp;nbsp;– two units at the [[Ulchin Nuclear Power Plant]]
* [[Nuclear power in China|People's Republic of China]], where it was later developed into the 1000&amp;nbsp;MWe [[CPR-1000]] design:
** Two units at the [[Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant]]
** Two units at the [[Ling Ao Nuclear Power Plant]]

===1300 MWe class (P4 and P'4 designs)===
[[File:Nuclear Power Plant Cattenom.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant|Cattenom]] site houses four 1300&amp;nbsp;MWe class reactors]]
There are 20 reactors of this design (four steam generators and four primary circulation pumps) operating in France. The P4 and P'4 type have some minor difference in the layout of the building, especially for the structure which contain the fuel rods and the circuitry.&lt;ref name="asn-rapport" /&gt;

===1450 MWe class (N4 design)===
[[File:Centrale-nucleaire-civaux.jpg|thumb|The [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant|Civaux]] site houses two 1450&amp;nbsp;MWe class reactors, the most recent design operating today]]
There are only 4 of these reactors, housed at two separate sites: [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant|Civaux]] and [[Chooz Nuclear Power Plant|Chooz]]. Construction of these reactors started between 1984 and 1991, but full commercial operation did not begin until between 2000 and 2002 because of thermal fatigue flaws in the heat removal system requiring the redesign and replacement of parts in each N4 power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olkiluoto.info/en/13/3/74/|title=Facts about Olkiluoto 3 financing|publisher=olkiluoto.info|accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the stations were all uprated to 1500&amp;nbsp;MWe.

===1650 MWe class (EPR design)===
The next generation design for French reactors is the [[EPR (nuclear reactor)|EPR]], which will have a broader scope than France alone, with a [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant|plant in Finland]] and [[Taishan Nuclear Power Plant|two in China]] undergoing construction, and [[Hinkley Point C nuclear power station|two more proposed]] for the United Kingdom. The first French EPR is under construction at the [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant]]. As a result of delays and cost overruns, completion is now scheduled for 2017.&lt;ref name=ft-20141118&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/adc90b3e-6f67-11e4-8d86-00144feabdc0.html |title=EDF in fresh delay for flagship nuclear plant |author=Michael Stothard |newspaper=Financial Times |date=18 November 2014 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional EPR reactor was planned for the [[Penly Nuclear Power Plant]], but this project has now been abandoned.

The reactor design was developed by [[Areva]] contributing its N4 reactor technology and the German company [[Siemens]] contributing its Konvoi reactor technology. In keeping with the French approach of highly standardized plants and proven technology, it uses more traditional active safety systems and is more similar to current plant designs than international competitors such as the [[AP1000]] or the [[ESBWR]].

In 2013, EDF acknowledged the difficulties it was having building the EPR design.&lt;ref name=reuters-20130321&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/21/edf-reactors-idUSL6N0CD1J820130321 |title=EDF eyes development of new, smaller reactors - papers |publisher=Reuters |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015 EDF's chief executive, [[Jean-Bernard Lévy]], stated that the design of a "New Model" EPR was being worked on, which will be easier and cheaper to build, which would be ready for orders from about 2020.&lt;ref name=independent-20150923&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/only-china-wants-to-invest-in-britains-new-2bn-hinkley-point-nuclear-plant-because-no-one-else-10513752.html |title=Only China wants to invest in Britain's new££2bn Hinkley Point nuclear plant because no one else thinks it will work, EDF admits |author=Geert De Clercq |newspaper=The Independent |date=23 September 2015 |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 EDF planned to build two New Model EPR reactors in France by 2030 to prepare for renewing its fleet of older reactors.&lt;ref name=reuters-20160121&gt;{{cite news |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/edf-nuclear-epr/edf-plans-two-new-nuclear-reactors-in-france-by-2030-document-idUKL8N1554S4 |title=EDF plans two new nuclear reactors in France by 2030-document |publisher=Reuters |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However following financial difficulties at Areva, and its merger with EDF, French Energy Minister [[Nicolas Hulot]] said in January 2018 "for now [building a New Model EPR] is neither a priority or a plan. Right now the priority is to develop renewable energy and to reduce the share of nuclear."&lt;ref name=reuters-20180122&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/france-nuclear/update-1-separate-unit-for-edf-nuclear-arm-has-been-discussed-says-minister-hulot-idUSL8N1PH4D6 |title=UPDATE 1-Separate unit for EDF nuclear arm has been discussed, says minister Hulot |publisher=Reuters |date=22 January 2018 |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooling===
[[File:Gravelines nuclear power plant.jpg|thumb|The [[Gravelines Nuclear Power Station|Gravelines]] site on the [[North Sea]] between [[Calais]] and [[Dunkirk]] ]]
The majority of nuclear plants in France are located away from the coasts and obtain their cooling water from rivers. These plants employ [[cooling towers]] to reduce their impact on the environment. The temperature of emitted water carrying the waste heat is strictly limited by the French government, and this has proved to be problematic during recent heat waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/utilities/article6626811.ece|title=France imports UK electricity as plants shut|author=Robin Pagnamenta|date=3 July 2009|publisher=The Times|accessdate=10 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five plants, equaling 18 reactors are located on the coast:

* [[Gravelines Nuclear Power Station]]
* [[Penly Nuclear Power Plant]]
* [[Paluel Nuclear Power Plant]]
* [[Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant]]
* [[Blayais Nuclear Power Plant]]

These five get their cooling water directly from the ocean and can thus dump their waste heat directly back into the sea, which is slightly more economical.

===Fuel cycle===
[[File:LSMHM-03.jpg|thumb|right|Active work going on for the ultimate underground repository]]
France is one of the few countries in the world with an active [[nuclear reprocessing]] program, with the [[COGEMA La Hague site]]. Enrichment work, some [[MOX fuel]] fabrication, and other activities take place at the [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Centre]]. Enrichment is completely domestic and is powered by 2/3 of the output of the nuclear plant at Tricastin. Reprocessing of fuel from other countries has been done for the United States and Japan, who have expressed the desire to develop a more closed fuel cycle similar to what France has achieved. MOX fuel fabrication services have also been sold to other countries, notably to the [[United States|USA]] for the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]], using [[plutonium]] from dismantled [[nuclear weapons]].

While France does not mine [[uranium]] for the front end of the fuel cycle domestically, French companies have various holdings in the [[uranium market]]. Uranium for the French program totals 10,500 tonnes per year{{Citation needed|reason=as of when?|date=October 2015}} coming from various locations such as:

* Canada&amp;nbsp;– 4500&amp;nbsp;tU/yr{{Citation needed|reason=as of when?|date=October 2015}}
* Niger&amp;nbsp;– 3200&amp;nbsp;tU/yr{{Citation needed|reason=as of when?|date=October 2015}}

Final disposal of the high level nuclear waste is planned to be done at the [[Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory]] [[deep geological repository]].

==Operational considerations==
France's nuclear reactors comprise 90 per cent of EDFs capacity and so they are used in [[Load following power plant|load-following mode]] and some reactors close at weekends because there is no market for the electricity.&lt;ref name=nei/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooke/&gt; This means that the [[capacity factor]] is low by world standards, usually in the high seventies as a percentage, which is not an ideal economic situation for nuclear plants.&lt;ref name=nei/&gt;

During periods of high demand EDF has been routinely "forced into the relatively expensive spot and short-term power markets because it lacks adequate peak load generating capacity".&lt;ref name=cooke&gt;[[Stephanie Cooke]] (2009). ''[[In Mortal Hands: A Cautionary History of the Nuclear Age]]'', Black Inc., p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; France heavily relies on electric heating, with about one third of existing and three-quarters of new houses using electric space heating due to the low off-peak tariffs offered.&lt;ref name=kyodo-20120411&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2012/04/152117.html |title=Nuclear power post-Fukushima: Maybe France no exception after all |author=Mycle Schneider |publisher=Kyodo News |date=11 April 2012 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this residential heating demand, about 2.3&amp;nbsp;GW of extra power is needed for every degree Celsius of temperature drop.&lt;ref name=kyodo-20120411/&gt; This means that during cold snaps, French electricity demand increases dramatically, forcing the country to import at full capacity from its neighbours during peak demand. For example, in February 2012, Germany "came to the rescue of France during last week's cold snap by massively exporting electricity to its neighbour".&lt;ref name=reuters-20120214&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/14/europe-power-supply-idUSL5E8DD87020120214 |title=Germany powers France in cold despite nuclear u-turn |publisher=Reuters |date=14 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All but five of EDFs plants are inland and require fresh water for cooling. Eleven of these 15 inland plants have cooling towers, using [[Cooling tower|evaporative cooling]], while the others use lake or river water directly.  In very hot summers, generation output may be restricted.&lt;ref name=nei/&gt;

In 2008, nuclear power accounted for 16% of final energy consumption in France. As is common in all industrialized nations, fossil fuels still dominate energy consumption, particularly in the transportation and heating sectors.&lt;ref name=nei/&gt; 
However, nuclear constitutes a higher level of total energy consumption in France than in any other country. 
In 2001, nuclear power accounted for 37% of the total energy consumption in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/05/france_78_nuclear.php |title=France Gets X Percent of its Energy from Nuclear Plants (Energy Priorities Archives) |publisher=Energypriorities.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2011 France consumed ~ 11 [[Quad (unit)|quadrillion]] [[BTU]]s (3224 TWh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convert-measurement-units.com/convert+Terawatt+hour+to+British+thermal+unit.php |title=convert Terawatt hour [TWh&amp;#93; to British thermal unit [Btu&amp;#93; |publisher=Convert-measurement-units.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of energy according to the [[Energy Information Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=FR |title=France&amp;nbsp;– U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) |publisher=Eia.gov |date=30 May 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, 18,000 litres (4,755 gallons) of uranium solution containing [[natural uranium]] were accidentally released from [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Centre]]. Due to cleaning and repair work the containment system for a uranium solution holding tank was not functional when the tank filled. The inflow exceeded the tank's capacity and 30 cubic metres of uranium solution leaked, with 18 cubic metres spilled on the ground. Testing found elevated uranium levels in the nearby Gaffière and Lauzon rivers. The liquid that escaped to the ground contained about 75&amp;nbsp;kg of natural uranium, which is toxic as a heavy metal, but only slightly radioactive. Estimates for the releases were initially higher, up to 360&amp;nbsp;kg of natural uranium, but revised downward later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jul/10/nuclearpower.pollution| title =  River use banned after French uranium leak| publisher = The Guardian| accessdate = 10 July 2008 | author = Angelique Chrisafis| date = 10 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; French authorities banned the use of water from the Gaffière and Lauzon for drinking and watering of crops for 2 weeks. Swimming, water sports and fishing were also banned.

In October 2017 EDF announced it would repair fire safety system pipes at 20 nuclear reactors to increase seismic safety after discovering thinning metal in some sections of pipes. EDF classified this as a Level 2 (incident) on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].&lt;ref name=nei-20171017&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsedf-repairs-pumping-stations-at-20-power-reactors-5951201 |title=EDF repairs pumping stations at 20 power reactors |publisher=Nuclear Engineering International |date=17 October 2017 |accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear safety==
In 2006 the [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire]] (ASN) was created as the independent French nuclear safety regulator, replacing the General Direction for Nuclear Safety and Radioprotection.

In 2012, the ASN released a report announcing a sweeping safety upgrade to all the country's reactors. The ASN's report states plainly that a loss of coolant or electricity could, in the worst cases, see meltdowns at nuclear reactors in hours. It also lists many shortcomings found during 'stress tests', in which some safety aspects of plants were found not to meet existing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7380/full/481113a.html |title=Get tough on nuclear safety |date=12 January 2012 |work=Nature |volume=481 |doi=10.1038/481113a |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will now require all power plants to build a set of safety systems of last resort, contained in bunkers that will be hardened to withstand more extreme earthquakes, floods and other threats than plants themselves are designed to cope with. It will also adopt a proposal by EDF to create an elite force that is specifically trained to tackle nuclear accidents and could be deployed to any site within hours. Both moves are a response to the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/france-imagines-the-unimaginable-1.9780 |title=France 'imagines the unimaginable' |author=Declan Butler |date=11 January 2012  |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismicity===
[[File:Rhinegraben fessenheim.png|thumb|right|The location of the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]] in the [[Upper Rhine Plain|Rhine Rift Valley]] near the [[Fault (geology)|fault]] that caused the [[1356 Basel earthquake]] is causing concern.]]
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] there has been an increased focus on the risks associated with [[earthquake|seismic activity]] in France, with particular attention focused on the [[Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant]].

General seismic risk in France is categorised on a five-point scale, with zone 1 being very low risk, through to zone 5 in areas with a 'very strong' risk.&lt;ref name=plan-seisme-zoneage&gt;[http://www.planseisme.fr/Zonage-sismique-de-la-France.html Zonage sismique de la France] ''Le Plan Séisme'', accessed 2011-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Metropolitan France]] the areas of highest risk are rated at 4, 'strong', and are located in the [[Pyrenees]], [[Alps]], the south of the [[Haut-Rhin]] [[Departments of France|''département'']], the [[Territoire de Belfort]] and a few communes in [[Doubs]].&lt;ref name=plan-seisme-zoneage /&gt; A new zoning map comes into force on 1 May 2011, which significantly increases the rating for many areas.&lt;ref name=plan-seisme-zoneage /&gt; The major nuclear research facilities at [[Cadarache]] are located in a zone 4 area near the fault that caused the [[1909 Lambesc earthquake]], while the [[Marcoule]] research centre and the nuclear power plants at [[Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant|Tricastin]], [[Cruas Nuclear Power Plant|Cruas]], [[Saint-Alban Nuclear Power Plant|Saint-Alban]], [[Bugey Nuclear Power Plant|Bugey]] and [[Fessenheim]] (near the fault that caused the [[1356 Basel earthquake]]) are all within zone 3.&lt;ref name=quatre-11-03-15&gt;[http://les4elements.typepad.fr/blog/2011/03/alsace-et-paca-quatre-centrales-sur-une-zone-sismique.html Quatre centrales sur une zone sismique] ''Les quatre éléments'' published 2011-03-15, accessed 2011-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; A further 6 plants lie within zone 2.&lt;ref name=quatre-11-03-15 /&gt;

The current process for evaluating the seismic hazard for a nuclear plant is set out in ''Règle Fondamentale de Sûreté'' (Fundamental Safety Rule) RFS 2001-01, published by the [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire|Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety]], which uses more detailed [[Seismotectonics|seismotectonic]] zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irsn.fr/FR/base_de_connaissances/Installations_nucleaires/La_surete_Nucleaire/risque_sismique_installations_nucleaires/Pages/8-Evaluation_de_l_alea_sismique-Reglementation_applicable_aux_sites_nucleaires_francais.aspx Evaluation de l’aléa sismique&amp;nbsp;– La réglementation applicable aux sites nucléaires français] [[Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire]], accessed 2011-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; RFS 2001-01 replaced RFS I.2.c, published in 1981, however it has been criticised for continuing to require a deterministic assessment (rather than a [[Probabilistic risk assessment|probabilistic approach]]) that relies primarily on the strongest 'historically known' earthquake near a site.&lt;ref name=resonance&gt;[http://www.kantonslabor-bs.ch/files/presse/93_3_Expertise-Fessenheim-f.pdf Centrale Nucléaire de Fessenheim : appréciation du risque sismique] RÉSONANCE Ingénieurs-Conseils SA, published 2007-09-05, accessed 2011-03-30&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a number of problems including the short period (in [[Geologic time scale|geological timescales]]) for which there are records, the difficulty of assessing the characteristics of earthquakes that occurred prior to the use of [[seismometer]]s, the difficulty of identifying the existence of all earthquakes that pre-date the historic record, and ultimately the reliance on one single earthquake scenario.&lt;ref name=resonance /&gt; Other criticisms include the use of [[Seismic scale|intensity]] in the evaluation method, rather than [[spectral acceleration]], which is commonly used elsewhere.&lt;ref name=resonance /&gt;

==Public opinion==
[[File:Anti-EPR demonstration in Toulouse 0166 2007-03-17.jpg|thumb|right|Protest against new French nuclear plants (March 2007)]]
Following the 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] an OpinionWay poll at the end of March found that 57% of the French population were opposed to nuclear energy in France.&lt;ref name=reuters-11-04-13&gt;[https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFLDE73C0ZI20110413 Majority of French want to drop nuclear energy-poll] [[Reuters]], published 2011-04-13, accessed 2011-04-13&lt;/ref&gt; A TNS-Sofres poll in the days following the accident found 55% in favour of nuclear power.&lt;ref name=reuters-11-04-13 /&gt; In 2006, [[BBC]] / [[GlobeScan]] poll found 57% of the French opposed to nuclear energy.&lt;ref name="BBC/GlobeScan"&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC World Service Poll | work =  | accessdate = 28 April 2010 | url = http://www.globescan.com/news_archives/bbcwsenergy/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100924022459/http://globescan.com/news_archives/bbcwsenergy/ | archive-date = 24 September 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, an Ipsos poll found that nearly 70% of the population had a 'good opinion' of nuclear power, however 56% also preferred not to live near a nuclear plant and the same proportion thought that a '[[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl-like accident]]' could occur in France.&lt;ref name=ipsos-summer-2001&gt;{{cite web

When the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] was being constructed in 1997, it was claimed to be welcomed by the local community:

{{quote|In France, unlike in America, nuclear energy is accepted, even popular. Everybody I spoke to in Civaux loves the fact their region was chosen. The nuclear plant has brought jobs and prosperity to the area. Nobody I spoke to, &lt;u&gt;nobody&lt;/u&gt;, expressed any fear.&lt;ref name=palfreman/&gt;}}

A variety of reasons were cited for the popular support; a sense of national independence and reduced reliance on foreign oil, reduction of greenhouse gases, and a cultural interest in large technological projects (like the [[TGV]], [whose high-speed lines are powered by these plants] and [[Concorde]]).&lt;ref name=palfreman /&gt;

===Anti-nuclear movement===
[[File:StéphaneLhommeGrosPlan.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Stéphane Lhomme]] in front of Blayais' nuclear power station]]
{{Main article|Anti-nuclear movement in France}}
In the 1970s, an anti-nuclear movement in France, consisting of citizens' groups and political action committees, emerged. Between 1975 and 1977, some 175,000 people protested against [[nuclear power]] in ten demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert P. Kitschelt. [http://www.marcuse.org/harold/hmimages/seabrook/861KitscheltAntiNuclear4Democracies.pdf Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies] ''British Journal of Political Science'', Vol. 16, 1984, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, up to 15,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Paris against a new generation of nuclear reactors, the [[European Pressurised Reactor]] (EPR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/01/18/1027267.htm Thousands march in Paris anti-nuclear protest] ''ABC News'', 18 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 2007, simultaneous protests, organised by [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]], were staged in 5 French towns to protest against the construction of EPR plants.&lt;ref name=NEI&gt;{{cite news  | title =French protests over EPR  | work =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =Nuclear Engineering International  | date =3 April 2007  | url =http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2043436  | accessdate =10 April 2007  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191242/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=132&amp;storyCode=2043436  | archivedate =27 September 2007  | df =dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title =France hit by anti-nuclear protests  | work =  | pages =  | language =  | publisher =Evening Echo  | date =3 April 2007  | url =http://www.eveningecho.ie/news/bstory.asp?j=13919232&amp;p=y39y9z78&amp;n=13919320  | accessdate =10 April 2007  | deadurl =yes  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070929005415/http://www.eveningecho.ie/news/bstory.asp?j=13919232&amp;p=y39y9z78&amp;n=13919320  | archivedate =29 September 2007  | df =dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Japan's 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], thousands staged [[anti-nuclear protests]] around France, demanding reactors be closed. Protesters' demands were focused on getting France to shut its oldest nuclear power station at Fessenheim. Many people also protested at the Cattenom nuclear plant, France's second most powerful.&lt;ref name=afp11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g-RY6At4kvtH2P31Nk5xiUeIr8mw?docId=CNG.e738123e4ccce6019851c695501ca633.1211 |title=Thousands in France mark Chernobyl with protests  |author=Arnaud Bouvier  |date=25 April 2011  |work=AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, thousands of anti-nuclear protesters delayed a train carrying radioactive waste from France to Germany. Many clashes and obstructions made the journey the slowest one since the annual shipments of radioactive waste began in 1995.&lt;ref name=spieg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,800319,00.html |title=Thousands of Protesters Obstruct Nuclear Waste Transport |date=28 November 2011 |work=Spiegel Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in November 2011, a French court fined nuclear power giant [[Électricité de France]] €1.5m and jailed two senior employees for spying on [[Greenpeace]], including hacking into Greenpeace's computer systems. Greenpeace was awarded €500,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15683090 |title=EDF fined for spying on Greenpeace nuclear campaign |author=Richard Black |publisher=BBC |date=10 November 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first anniversary of the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], organisers of French anti-nuclear demonstrations claim 60,000 supporters formed a human chain 230 kilometres long, stretching from Lyon to Avignon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euronews.com/2012/03/11/anti-nuclear-demos-across-europe-on-fukushima-anniversary/ |title=Anti-nuclear demos across Europe on Fukushima anniversary |date=11 March 2011 |work=Euronews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian Chancellor [[Werner Faymann]] expects anti-nuclear petition drives to start in at least six European Union countries in 2012 with the goal of having the EU abandon nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/12/austria-nuclear-idUSL5E8EC1IN20120312 |title=Austria expects EU anti-nuclear campaign this year |date=12 March 2012 |work=Reuters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, police arrested 57 Greenpeace protesters who used a truck to break through security barriers and enter the Fessenheim nuclear in eastern France. The activists hung antinuclear banners, but France’s nuclear safety authority said that the plant’s security had not been compromised. Although President Hollande promised to close Fessenheim by 2016, and Greenpeace continues to demand immediate closure, Fessenheim continues to operate without problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/world/europe/france-greenpeace-activists-arrested-in-break-in.html?_r=0  |title=France: Greenpeace Activists Arrested in Break-In |date=18 March 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
In 2007, [[Areva NC]] claimed that, due to their reliance on nuclear power, France's [[carbon emissions]] per kWh are less than 1/10 that of Germany and the UK, and 1/13 that of [[Denmark]], which has no nuclear plants.  Its emissions of [[nitrogen oxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] have been reduced by 70% over 20 years, even though the total power output has tripled in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

If done without environmental or health over-sight, conventional mining for uranium can produce large amounts of [[mine tailings|mining tailings]] and contaminated water but as of 2010, about half of the world's uranium supply is increasingly generated from [[In situ leach|In situ recovery]] (ISR) technology, that does not require physical mining in the conventional sense and if responsibly operated is considerably cleaner.&lt;ref name="How"&gt;[https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/uranium/mining.html  Uranium: How Is It Mined?

According to the French embassy to the US, fission-electricity "helps to reduce French greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide (contrary to coal or gas generation) and making France the less carbon emitting country within the [[OECD]]". It further notes that, due to recycling of [[spent nuclear fuel]], French fission-electric stations, produce 10&amp;nbsp;g/year/inhabitant of "[[nuclear waste]]", which is primarily [[fission products]] and other safety concerning solid decaying radioactive isotopes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-us.org/spip.php?article949 Nuclear Energy in France 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

French environmentalist [[Bruno Comby]] started the group [[Environmentalists For Nuclear Energy]] in 1996, and said in 2005, "If well-managed, nuclear energy is very clean, does not create polluting gases in the atmosphere, produces very little waste and does not contribute to the greenhouse effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Air pollution===

[[File:Deaths from air pollution.png|thumb|300px|Deaths from [[air pollution]] in 2004. Despite a similar level of industrial activity and city dwelling as its immediate neighbors of Germany, Spain and Italy, France has a lower number of yearly deaths from air pollution when compared to every other mainland European nation.]]

Unlike its neighboring countries of Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, France does not rely very much on [[fossil fuel]]s and [[biomass]] for electricity or home heating thanks to an abundance of cheap nuclear power.
Taken as a whole, the country therefore has superior air quality&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euronews.com/2014/11/27/which-countries-in-europe-cause-the-most-air-pollution-damage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-quality/map/real-time-map real-time air quality map]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/fr/air-pollution-state-and-impacts-france Air pollution - State and impacts (France) ]&lt;/ref&gt; and lower pollution related deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015/premature-deaths-attributable-to-air-pollution Premature deaths attributable to air pollution ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/industrial-air-pollution-has-high/industrial-air-pollution-pictures/damage-costs-by-country/image_view_fullscreen absolute cost of air pollution by european country and relative damage per GDP]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Air pollution in France largely comes from cars and a minority is carried by the wind from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Germanys-Nuclear-Cutback-Is-Darkening-European-Skies.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/fr/air-pollution-state-and-impacts-france Air pollution - State and impacts (France)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thelocal.fr/20140318/was-germany-to-blame-for-pollution-in-france&lt;/ref&gt; 
Each year, the coal fired power stations in Germany are the cause of a calculated 1,860 premature domestic deaths and approximately 2,500 deaths abroad.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/report-germany-suffers-more-coal-linked-deaths-than-rest-of-eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor fossil fuel and biomass pollution, from [[particulate matter]] alone, kill more people than is popularly know, approximately 1 million people every year according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/index.html |title=WHO &amp;#124; Air quality and health |publisher=Who.int |date=23 August 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of atmospheric particulate matter, small enough to enter and cause damage to the lungs&amp;nbsp;–is 13 micrograms per cubic metre in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/france/ |title=OECD Better Life Index |publisher=OECD Better Life Index |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cleaner than the air in Germany, where the particulate air pollution is higher at 16 micrograms per cubic metre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/germany/ |title=OECD Better Life Index |publisher=OECD Better Life Index |date=24 May 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric vehicles===
A common criticism of French energy policy is that the country may have over-invested in nuclear power plants, requiring electricity export when French electricity demand is low or "dumping" in the French market, encouraging the use of electricity for space heating and water heating.
This can be regarded as an economically wasteful practice.&lt;ref name=nei/&gt; 
However, as the adoption of [[electric car]]s, such as the French [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]], over internal combustion engine vehicles increases, reducing fossil fuel dependence, France's comparatively cheap peak and off peak electricity prices could act as a strong customer incentive that may spur the speed of the adoption of electric vehicles,&lt;ref name="pnl.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=204 |title=PNNL: News&amp;nbsp;– Mileage from megawatts |publisher=Pnl.gov |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially turning the current perceived glut of relatively cheap fission-electricity into an asset, as demand for [[Electric vehicle|electric vehicle recharging stations]] becomes more and more commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brattle.com/_documents/UploadLibrary/Upload966.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holland |first=Andrew |url=http://www.consumerenergyreport.com/2012/03/26/the-better-place-model-for-electric-vehicles/ |title=The Better Place Model for Electric Vehicles |publisher=Consumerenergyreport.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to France's very [[low-carbon power]] electricity grid, the [[carbon dioxide emission]]s from charging an [[electric car]] from the French electricity grid are 12&amp;nbsp;g per km traveled.&lt;ref name="honestjohn.co.uk"&gt;http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/news/green-motoring/2010-09/renault-ze Renault to sell electric cars for the same price as diesels&lt;/ref&gt; 
This compares favourably to the direct emissions of one of the most successful [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, the [[Toyota Prius]], which produces carbon dioxide emissions at the higher rate of 105&amp;nbsp;g per km traveled.&lt;ref name="honestjohn.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Shades-of-Green-Full-Report.pdf Electric car emissions per country]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fusion research==
[[File:Stop-ITER Pertuis.jpg|thumb|Protest against ITER in France, 2009]]
The nuclear fusion project [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] is constructing the world's largest and most advanced experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] in the south of [[France]]. A collaboration between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]], the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics to electricity-producing [[fusion power]] plants. In 2005, [[Greenpeace International]] issued a press statement criticizing government funding of the ITER, believing the money should have been diverted to renewable energy sources and claiming that fusion energy would result in nuclear waste and nuclear weapons proliferation issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/releases/ITERprojectFrance |title=Nuclear fusion reactor project in France: an expensive and senseless nuclear stupidity |agency= Greenpeace International |website= Greenpeace.org |access-date= 22 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208072418/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/press/releases/ITERprojectFrance |archive-date=8 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]] (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium [[hydrogen]] isotopes used in the fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1631650,00.html France Wins Nuclear Fusion Plant|Germany|Deutsche Welle|28 June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; According to most anti-nuclear groups, nuclear fusion power "remains a distant dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/anti-nuclear/issues/nfc/power/new-reactor-types/ |title=New Reactor Types&amp;nbsp;– pebble bed, thorium, plutonium, fusion |author=Jim Green |year=2012 |work=Friends of the Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Nuclear Association]] says that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author= World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.

[[File:Joda paleontologist.jpg|thumb|A paleontologist at work at [[John Day Fossil Beds National Monument]]]]
'''Paleontology''' or '''palaeontology''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|eɪ|l|i|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i|,_|ˌ|p|æ|l|i|-|,_|-|ə|n|-}}) is the scientific study of life that existed prior to, and sometimes including, the start of the [[Holocene]] Epoch (roughly 11,700 years [[before present]]). It includes the study of fossils to determine organisms' [[evolution]] and interactions with each other and their environments (their [[paleoecology]]). Paleontological observations have been documented as far back as the 5th&amp;nbsp;century BC. The science became established in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century as a result of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s work on [[comparative anatomy]], and developed rapidly in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. The term itself originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] παλαιός, ''palaios'', "old, ancient", ὄν, ''on'' ([[Genitive|gen.]] ''ontos''), "being, creature" and λόγος, ''logos'', "speech, thought, study".&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=paleontology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=paleontology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307065643/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=paleontology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|archivedate=2013-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontology lies on the border between [[biology]] and [[geology]], but differs from [[archaeology]] in that it excludes the study of [[anatomically modern human]]s. It now uses techniques drawn from a wide range of sciences, including [[biochemistry]], [[mathematic]]s, and [[engineering]]. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the [[evolutionary history of life]], almost all the way back to when [[Earth]] became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 [[billion years|billion years ago]]. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of [[fossil]] organisms while others study [[paleoecology|ecology]] and environmental history, such as [[paleoclimatology|ancient climates]].

Body fossils and [[trace fossil]]s are the principal types of evidence about ancient life, and [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] evidence has helped to decipher the evolution of life before there were organisms large enough to leave body fossils. Estimating the dates of these remains is essential but difficult: sometimes adjacent rock layers allow [[radiometric dating]], which provides [[absolute dating|absolute dates]] that are accurate to within 0.5%, but more often paleontologists have to rely on relative dating by solving the "[[jigsaw puzzle]]s" of [[biostratigraphy]]. Classifying ancient organisms is also difficult, as many do not fit well into the [[Linnaean taxonomy]] that is commonly used for classifying living organisms, and paleontologists more often use [[cladistics]] to draw up evolutionary "family trees". The final quarter of the 20th century saw the development of [[molecular phylogenetics]], which investigates how closely organisms are related by measuring how similar the [[DNA]] is in their [[genome]]s. Molecular phylogenetics has also been used to estimate the dates when species diverged, but there is controversy about the reliability of the [[molecular clock]] on which such estimates depend.

== Overview ==
The simplest definition is "the study of ancient life".&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3Pxi"&gt;{{Cite book

=== A historical science ===
[[File:Europasaurus Praeparation.JPG|thumb|The preparation of the fossilised bones of ''[[Europasaurus|Europasaurus holgeri]]'']]

Paleontology is one of the historical sciences, along with [[archaeology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], [[cosmology]], [[philology]] and [[history]] itself.&lt;ref name="Laudan1992WhatSpecialP58"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that it aims to describe phenomena of the past and reconstruct their causes.&lt;ref name="Cleland2002MethodologicalAndEpistemicDifferences" /&gt; Hence it has three main elements: description of the phenomena; developing a general theory about the causes of various types of change; and applying those theories to specific facts.&lt;ref name="Laudan1992WhatSpecialP58" /&gt;
When trying to explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other historical scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a ''[[smoking gun]]'', a piece of evidence that indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Walter Alvarez]] of an [[iridium]]-rich layer at the [[Cretaceous]]–[[Tertiary]] boundary made [[asteroid impact]] and [[volcanism]] the most favored explanations for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="Cleland2002MethodologicalAndEpistemicDifferences"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main type of science is experimental science, which is often said to work by conducting [[experiment]]s to ''disprove'' hypotheses about the workings and causes of natural phenomena&amp;nbsp;– note that this approach cannot confirm a hypothesis is correct, since some later experiment may disprove it. However, when confronted with totally unexpected phenomena, such as the first evidence for invisible [[radiation]], experimental scientists often use the same approach as historical scientists: construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a "smoking gun".&lt;ref name="Cleland2002MethodologicalAndEpistemicDifferences" /&gt;

Paleontology lies on the boundary between [[biology]] and [[geology]] since paleontology focuses on the record of past life but its main source of evidence is [[fossil]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/paleontology|title=paleontology {{!}} science|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824223403/https://www.britannica.com/science/paleontology|archivedate=2017-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are found in rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| isbn=0-07-913665-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For historical reasons paleontology is part of the geology departments of many universities, because in the 19th century and early 20th century geology departments found paleontological evidence important for estimating the ages of rocks while biology departments showed little interest.&lt;ref name="Laudan1992WhatSpecialP57"&gt;{{Cite book

| publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=0-7914-1211-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontology also has some overlap with [[archaeology]], which primarily works with objects made by humans and with human remains, while paleontologists are interested in the characteristics and evolution of humans as organisms. When dealing with evidence about humans, archaeologists and paleontologists may work together&amp;nbsp;– for example paleontologists might identify animal or plant fossils around an [[archaeological site]], to discover what the people who lived there ate; or they might analyze the climate at the time when the site was inhabited by humans.&lt;ref name="UCMPfaqAnthro"&gt;{{cite web

In addition paleontology often uses techniques derived from other sciences, including biology, [[osteology]], [[ecology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3Pxi" /&gt; For example, [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] signatures from rocks may help to discover when life first arose on Earth,&lt;ref name="BrasierMcLoughlinEtAl2006FreshLook"&gt;{{Cite journal

Modern paleontology sets [[Prehistoric life|ancient life]] in its context by studying how long-term physical changes of global geography [[Palaeogeography|paleogeography]] and climate [[paleoclimate]] have affected the [[evolution]] of life, how ecosystems have responded to these changes and have adapted the planetary environment in turn and how these mutual responses have affected today's patterns of [[biodiversity]]. Hence, paleontology overlaps with [[geology]] (the study of rocks and rock formations) as well as with [[botany]], [[biology]], [[zoology]] and [[ecology]]&amp;nbsp;– fields concerned with [[Organism|life forms]] and how they interact.

The major subdivisions of paleontology include [[paleozoology]] (animals), [[paleobotany]] (plants) and [[micropaleontology]] (microfossils). Paleozoologists may specialise in [[invertebrate paleontology]], which deals with animals without backbones or in [[vertebrate palaeontology]], dealing with fossils of animals with backbones, including fossil hominids ([[palaeoanthropology]]). Micropaleontologists study microscopic fossils, including organic-walled microfossils whose study is called [[palynology]].

There are many developing specialities such as [[paleobiology]], [[paleoecology]], [[ichnology]] (the study of tracks and burrows) and [[taphonomy]] (the study of what happens to organisms after they expire). Major areas of study include the correlation of [[rock strata]] with their [[geologic ages]] and the study of evolution of lifeforms.

Paleontology utilises the same classic [[binomial nomenclature]] scheme, devised for the biology of living things by the mid-18th century [[Swedish people|Swedish]] biologist [[Carolus Linnaeus]] and increasingly sets these species in a genealogical framework, showing their degrees of interrelatedness using the still somewhat controversial technique of '[[cladistics]]'.

The primary economic importance of paleontology lies in the use of fossils to determine the age and nature of the rocks that contain them or the layers above or below. This information is vital to the [[mining]] industry and especially the [[petroleum]] industry. Simply looking at the fossils contained in a rock remains one of the fastest and most accurate means of telling how old that rock is.

Fossils were known by primitive humans and were sometimes identified correctly as the remains of ancient lifeforms. The organised study of paleontology dates from the late 18th century. For a more complete historical overview see the article [[History of paleontology]].

[[File:Marrella (fossil).png|thumb|left| This ''[[Marrella]]'' specimen illustrates how clear and detailed the fossils from the [[Burgess Shale]] [[lagerstätte]] are.]]
Fossils of organisms' bodies are usually the most informative type of evidence.

Hence the fossil record is very incomplete, increasingly so further back in time. Despite this, it is often adequate to illustrate the broader patterns of life's history.&lt;ref name="BentonQualityFossilRecord"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Benton MJ|author2=Wills MA|author3=Hitchin R

&lt;/ref&gt; There are also biases in the fossil record: different environments are more favorable to the preservation of different types of organism or parts of organisms.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2003ExceptionalFossilPreservation"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Butterfield, N.J. | date = 2003 | title = Exceptional Fossil Preservation and the Cambrian Explosion | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–177 | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.166 | url = http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | accessdate = June 28, 2008 | pmid = 21680421 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080905073155/http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/1/166 | archivedate = September 5, 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, only the parts of organisms that were already [[Mineralisation (biology)|mineralised]] are usually preserved, such as the shells of molluscs. Since most animal species are soft-bodied, they decay before they can become fossilised. As a result, although there are 30-plus [[phylum|phyla]] of living animals, two-thirds have never been found as fossils.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P61"&gt;{{Cite book

Occasionally, unusual environments may preserve soft tissues. These [[lagerstätte]]n allow paleontologists to examine the internal anatomy of animals that in other sediments are represented only by shells, spines, claws, etc.&amp;nbsp;– if they are preserved at all. However, even lagerstätten present an incomplete picture of life at the time. The majority of organisms living at the time are probably not represented because lagerstätten are restricted to a narrow range of environments, e.g. where soft-bodied organisms can be preserved very quickly by events such as mudslides; and the exceptional events that cause quick burial make it difficult to study the normal environments of the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Butterfield, N.J. | date = 2001 | title = Ecology and evolution of Cambrian plankton

For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. [[genus]] or [[family (biology)|family]] or [[Order (biology)|order]]; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group is moved to a different level it must be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Paleontologists generally use approaches based on [[cladistics]], a technique for working out the evolutionary "family tree" of a set of organisms.&lt;ref name="BrochuSumrall2001" /&gt; It works by the logic that, if groups B and C have more similarities to each other than either has to group A, then B and C are more closely related to each other than either is to A. Characters that are compared may be [[Anatomy|anatomical]], such as the presence of a [[notochord]], or [[Molecular phylogeny|molecular]], by comparing sequences of [[DNA]] or [[protein]]s. The result of a successful analysis is a hierarchy of clades&amp;nbsp;– groups that share a common ancestor. Ideally the "family tree" has only two branches leading from each node ("junction"), but sometimes there is too little information to achieve this and paleontologists have to make do with junctions that have several branches. The cladistic technique is sometimes fallible, as some features, such as wings or [[Evolution of the eye|camera eyes]], evolved more than once, [[convergent evolution|convergently]]&amp;nbsp;– this must be taken into account in analyses.&lt;ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P47To50"&gt;{{Cite book

[[Evolutionary developmental biology]], commonly abbreviated to "Evo Devo", also helps paleontologists to produce "family trees", and understand fossils.&lt;ref name=Tetrop&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Paleozoic Stem Group to Mite Harvestmen Revealed through Integration of Phylogenetics and Development|first=Russell J.|last=Garwood|first2=Prashant P.|last2=Sharma|first3=Jason A.|last3=Dunlop|first4=Gonzalo|last4=Giribet|year=2014|journal=Current Biology|volume=24|issue=9|pages=1017–1023|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2814%2900331-5|accessdate=April 17, 2014|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.039|pmid=24726154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[embryological]] development of some modern [[brachiopod]]s suggests that brachiopods may be descendants of the [[halkieriid]]s, which became extinct in the [[Cambrian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Cohen, B.

Paleontology seeks to map out how living things have changed through time. A substantial hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for [[radiometric dating]]. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age,&lt;!--&lt;ref group=note&gt;Astrochronology can date sediments back to the Eocene{{Confusing|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the link for this note appears not to work --&gt; and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better.&lt;ref name="Martin2000"&gt;{{Cite journal

Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.&lt;ref name="Martin2000" /&gt;

Consequently, paleontologists must usually rely on [[stratigraphy]] to date fossils. Stratigraphy is the science of deciphering the "layer-cake" that is the [[sediment]]ary record, and has been compared to a [[jigsaw puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Family-tree relationships may also help to narrow down the date when lineages first appeared. For instance, if fossils of B or C date to X&amp;nbsp;million years ago and the calculated "family tree" says A was an ancestor of B and C, then A must have evolved more than X&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

It is also possible to estimate how long ago two living clades diverged&amp;nbsp;– i.e. approximately how long ago their last common ancestor must have lived&amp;nbsp;– by assuming that DNA [[mutation]]s accumulate at a constant rate. These "[[molecular clock]]s", however, are fallible, and provide only a very approximate timing: for example, they are not sufficiently precise and reliable for estimating when the groups that feature in the [[Cambrian explosion]] first evolved,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Life on earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542}}. Although they are disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of [[life|life on earth]]. When dominance of particular [[ecological niche]]s passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Benton | first =M.J. | title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | date=2004 | chapter=6.

The fossil record appears to show that the rate of extinction is slowing down, with both the gaps between mass extinctions becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction decreasing. However, it is not certain whether the actual rate of extinction has altered, since both of these observations could be explained in several ways:&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction"&gt;{{cite web| date=2001-01-06| first=Norman| last=MacLeod| title=Extinction!| url=http://www.firstscience.com/home/articles/earth/extinction-page-2-1_1258.html| accessdate=September 11, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404150811/http://www.firstscience.com/home/articles/earth/extinction-page-2-1_1258.html| archivedate=April 4, 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&amp;nbsp;million years and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: [[dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| date=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| page=1

* Reasonably complete [[fossil]]s are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different [[genus|genera]], which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds&amp;nbsp;– the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this.&lt;ref name="WonderfulLifeP194To206"&gt;{{Cite book

Although paleontology became established around 1800, earlier thinkers had noticed aspects of the [[fossil]] record. The ancient Greek [[Philosophy#Ancient philosophy|philosopher]] [[Xenophanes]] (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In [[early modern Europe]], the systematic study of fossils emerged as an integral part of the changes in [[natural philosophy]] that occurred during the [[Age of Reason]]. In the Italian Renaissance, [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] made various significant contributions to the field as well designed numerous fossils. At the end of the 18th century [[Georges Cuvier]]'s work established [[comparative anatomy]] as a scientific discipline and, by proving that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, demonstrated that animals could become [[extinction|extinct]], leading to the emergence of paleontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth and to progress in the definition of the [[geologic time scale]], largely based on fossil evidence. In 1822 Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blanville, editor of ''Journal de Physique'', coined the word "palaeontology" to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge of life's history continued to improve, it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life.

After [[Charles Darwin]] published ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding [[evolution]]ary paths, including [[human evolution]], and evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="BucklandGould"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">A '''pan-region''' is a [[geographic region]] or state’s sphere of economic, political and cultural influence extending beyond that state's borders. For example, the pan-region of the [[United States of America]] (USA) regions both bordering the USA and its close neighbors including, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and many [[South American|South America]] other states.

==Origin of term==
The idea of pan-regions or spheres of economic and cultural influence was first developed by [[Karl Ernst Haushofer]] (8/27/1869-3/10/1946), a German General, [[Geography|geographer]] and [[Geopolitics|geo-politician]]. Pan-regions contributed to Geopolitik or the German theories of [[foreign policy]] during the interwar period (1918–1939) or the time from the end of [[World War I]] and the beginning of [[World War II]]. Haushofer’s pan-regions divided the world under three supreme leading states in [[economy]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Those three states included the USA who controlled [[North America]] and much of South America, [[Germany]] who controlled [[Europe]], much of [[Africa]] and [[western Asia]] and [[Japan]] who controlled central, eastern, and the islands of southern Asia. These leading states could expect their regions to develop economic and [[political alliance]] with their leading state as well as yield to [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and major cultural designations.

==Historical examples==
Historically, the world was divided into three spheres of control, however after the end of World War II, Germany and Japan’s control over their various regions have diminished with the success of other nations. For example, German control over Europe has suffered with the development of the [[Europe]]an Union and emergence of other foreign powers. Japan also is beginning to lose economic dominance over its pan-region with the emergence of a thriving [[Chinese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter, and Colin Flint.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6754">'''Skydrol''' is a fire-resistant aviation [[hydraulic fluid]]&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.eastman.com/Brands/EAS/Skydrol/Pages/Home.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; now manufactured by [[Eastman Chemical Company]], and formerly was manufactured by [[Solutia]] and [[Monsanto]]. There are various lines of Skydrol including Skydrol 500B-4, Skydrol LD-4, and Skydrol 5.

Skydrol is made up of a group of [[chemical additive]]s dissolved into a fire-resistant [[phosphate ester]] base stock which inhibits corrosion and prevents erosion damage to [[Servomechanism|servo]] valves and includes a purple or green dye to ease identification. It has been approved by most [[airframe]] manufacturers including [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] and has been used in their products for over 40 years.

==Characteristics==
Acid number (the proportional content of acid, not [[pH]]) and particulate contamination must be monitored while using Skydrol, and generally hydraulic systems should be sampled every [[Aircraft maintenance checks|C check]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amtonline.com/publication/article.jsp?pubId=1&amp;id=2783 Issue - (Aircraft Maintenance Technology)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally recommended contamination levels should be better than AS4059 Class 7 as new, and should not be allowed to degrade beyond Class 9. Skydrol has a 5-year shelf life from the date of manufacture.

Skydrol fluids are extremely irritating to human tissue. Gloves and goggles are recommended safety equipment when servicing Skydrol systems. If the fluid gets on the skin it creates an itchy, red rash with a persistent burning sensation. The effects subside within a few hours; egg white can be applied to the affected area to neutralize the burning.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.skydrol.com/technical/health_safety_facts.pdf Health &amp; Safety Facts Number: HS-98-01]&lt;/ref&gt; Animal studies have shown that repeated exposure to [[tributylphosphate]], one of the phosphate esters used in Skydrol fluids, may cause urinary bladder damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skydrol.com/pages/glove.asp Skyrol Personal Safety]&lt;/ref&gt; If Skydrol gets in the eyes, it creates an intense stinging sensation. The recommended treatment for this is to use an eye-wash station, sometimes mineral oil or milk is used.

Skydrol fluids are incompatible with many plastics, paints and adhesives, which can be softened and eventually destroyed by exposure to Skydrol. Some materials (for example [[rayon]], [[cellulose acetate|acetate]]) and rubber-soled shoes may also be damaged by Skydrol.&lt;ref &gt;[http://www.skydrol.com/pages/handling.asp Skydrol.com - Product Handling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The Skydrol series of phosphate ester hydraulic fluids were originally jointly developed by the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] and Monsanto in the late 1940s to reduce the fire risk from leaking high pressure mineral oil-based hydraulic fluids impinging on potential ignition sources.

In 1949 Douglas first licensed Monsanto to produce a range of Skydrol materials under their patents. In the 1990s Monsanto became primarily a biotechnology company, and an independent chemical producer, Solutia, was created in 1997 to handle its chemical interests, including Skydrol. In 2012, Solutia was acquired by Eastman Chemical.

Solutia Inc. built a new facility to produce Skydrol and SkyKleen aviation cleaning solutions in [[Anniston, Alabama]] in 2005.

==Uses==
The first type of Skydrol used in aviation was Skydrol 7000 which was dyed green in colour, now obsolete, as a fire-resistant lubricant in Douglas-designed cabin pressure superchargers (as piston-engined airliners do not have '[[bleed air]]' pressurisation) used in the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]] and [[Douglas DC-7|7]] series piston-engined aircraft, and first flight tested by United Airlines in 1949, who also used Skydrol 7000 in the hydraulic systems  of these aircraft, as did quite a number of other airlines including [[Pan American World Airways|Pan-Am]], and [[KLM]] and [[BOAC]] in Europe.

With the introduction of jet aircraft operating at higher altitudes, and lower external temperatures there was a need for improved phosphate ester fluids. The story of the introduction of Skydrol type fluids in civil aviation is covered in a Kindle book entitled "The Skydrol Story",&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite book
  |title=The Skydrol Story
  |author=John Churchill
  |year=2012
  |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Skydrol-Story-Karel-Ledeboer-ebook/dp/B00KGWI04K/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which it describes how the [[Vickers Vanguard]] was the first non US built aircraft to introduce Skydrol as a hydraulic fluid when TCA{{clarify|date=March 2018}} adopted it for their Vanguard fleet.

In the years following, during the flight testing of the [[Boeing 707]] a test aircraft suffered a gear collapse which led to an ensuing fire fueled by leaking hydraulic fluid. As a result of this incident, Boeing implemented the use of Skydrol on the 707 and then later on the [[Boeing 720|720]] and subsequent aircraft. Skydrol 500B (Dyed purple in colour) then proliferated through the aerospace industry due to its flame retardant capability, but predominantly only in the civilian world on transport category aircraft.

Notable exceptions include the BAC Concorde, which used [[silicate ester]] fluid [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] M2V Oronite due to the high temperature requirements.

Also in military applications, Skydrol was never adopted into widespread use, ostensibly because if an aircraft was hit by enemy fire on a mission, it was believed that it is merely academic whether the fluid is flame retardant or not, as the aircraft would have been expected to be destroyed.

The predominant competing mineral oil fluid, MIL-PRF-5606 had higher flammability due to its lower flash point, however modern derivatives such as MIL-PRF-87257 have a [[flash point]] much closer to that of Skydrol.

Some smaller business jets still use MIL-H-5606, such as the [[Dassault Falcon]] series jets, most of the [[Cessna Citation]]s and all models of [[Learjet]]. Business jets using Skydrol include the [[Cessna Citation X]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]]s and [[Bombardier Challenger]].

Special seals had to be developed  for use with Skydrol, as the [[elastomer]]s available at the time were incompatible - the first seals used were made from [[butyl rubber]], which were resistant to the phosphate ester fluid but suffered some early leakages. Modern Skydrol compatible seals are usually made from [[EPDM]] (Ethylene Propylene Dione Monomer) or [[PTFE]] (PolytetrafluroEthylene).

A '''steam engine''' is a [[heat engine]] that performs [[mechanical work]] using [[steam]] as its [[working fluid]]. In simple terms, the steam engine uses the [[thermal expansion|expansion]] principle of chemistry, where heat applied to [[water]] evaporates the water into steam, and the force generated pushes a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is typically transformed, by way of a [[connecting rod]] and [[flywheel]], into [[rotation|rotational]] force for [[work (physics)|work]]. The term "steam engine" is generally applied only to [[reciprocating engine|reciprocating engines]] as just described, not to the [[steam turbine]].

Steam engines are [[external combustion engine]]s,&lt;ref name=miffin&gt;{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=Fourth|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. Non-combustion heat sources such as [[solar power]], [[nuclear power]] or [[geothermal energy]] may be used. The ideal [[thermodynamic]] cycle used to analyze this process is called the [[Rankine cycle]]. In the cycle, water is heated and changes into steam in a boiler operating at a high pressure. When expanded using pistons or turbines mechanical work is done. The reduced-pressure steam is then exhausted to the atmosphere, or condensed and pumped back into the boiler.

In general usage, the term ''steam engine'' can refer to either complete steam plants (including [[boilers]] etc.) such as railway [[steam locomotive]]s and [[portable engine]]s, or may refer to the [[piston]] or turbine machinery alone, as in the [[beam engine]] and [[stationary steam engine]]. However, a more detailed look at the steam locomotive referred to the engine as only that part where the heat in the steam was turned into motion of the piston, and hence enabled separate statements for boiler efficiency and engine efficiency. Specialized devices such as [[steam hammer]]s and steam [[pile driver]]s are dependent on the steam pressure supplied from a separate [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]].

The use of boiling water to produce mechanical motion goes back over 2000 years, but early devices were not practical. The Spanish inventor [[Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont]] obtained a patent for a rudimentary steam-powered water pump in 1606.&lt;ref name=davids&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqXpwBO1AX8C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=jer%C3%B3nimo+de+ayanz+y+beaumont+steam+engine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QA8_DxqLf-&amp;sig=Cpy_OsOQ_oeDDDDuut8GFlpjCD8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UZWxU67kNIyOyAS28YGYCQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGwQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=jer%C3%B3nimo%20de%20ayanz%20y%20beaumont%20steam%20engine&amp;f=false |title=Religion, Technology, and the Great and Little Divergences: China and Europe Compared, C. 700-1800 |first1=Karel |last1=Davids |first2=Carolus A. |last2=Davids |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2012 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004233881}}, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; In 1698 English engineer [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam pump that used steam in direct contact with the water being pumped. Savery's steam pump used condensing steam to create a partial vacuum and draw water into a chamber, and then applied pressurized steam to further pump the water.

The [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|''atmospheric engine'']] created by English inventor [[Thomas Newcomen]] was the first commercial true steam engine using a piston, and was used in 1712 for removing flood water from a mine. 104 were in use by 1733. Eventually over two thousand of them were installed.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Eric James (2012). ''Thomas Newcomen of Dartmouth and the Engine That Changed the World''. Dartmouth History Research Group. {{ISBN|9781899011278}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1781 Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion.{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=63}} Watt's ten-[[horsepower]] engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered. The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or [[wood fuel]] could be obtained. By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000&amp;nbsp;hp had become feasible.{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=223}} The stationary steam engine was a key component of the [[Industrial Revolution]], allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable. The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced, but high-pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as [[traction engine]]s and [[Steam locomotive|railway locomotives]].

Reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage, and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation.&lt;ref Name="Wiser" /&gt; Considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines, the "steam age" is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th and 20th century.

=== Early designs and modifications ===
{{Main|History of the steam engine|Timeline of steam power}}

Although steam-powered devices were developed before the first practical piston steam engine, they were not directly connected to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]].  The [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen engine]] owes its development to the discovery of atmospheric pressure and to shared technical information whose path is traceable.  For the development of the commercial steam engine see: [[History of the steam engine#Development of the commercial steam engine]]

* In [[Roman Egypt]], the ''[[aeolipile]]'' (also known as a ''Hero's engine'') described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD is considered to be the first recorded steam engine. Torque was produced by steam jets exiting the turbine.
* In [[Ottoman Egypt]], the inventor [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]] described a [[steam turbine]] device for rotating a [[Rotisserie|spit]] in 1551.&lt;ref name=Hassan/&gt;
* In the [[Spanish Empire]], the inventor [[Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont]] obtained a patent for a rudimentary steam-powered water pump in 1606.
* [[Thomas Savery]], in 1698, patented the first practical, atmospheric pressure, steam engine of {{conv|1|hp|W}}. It had no piston or moving parts, only taps. It was a ''fire engine'', a kind of thermic siphon, in which steam was admitted to an empty container and then condensed. The vacuum thus created was used to suck water from the sump at the bottom of the mine. The "fire engine" had to be mounted within {{conv|25|feet|m|0|abbr=on}} of the water level though it could then lift the water another {{conv|80|feet|m|0|abbr=on}} using positive pressure.
* [[Thomas Newcomen]], in 1712, developed the first commercially successful piston steam engine of {{conv|5|hp|W}}. Its principle was to condense steam in a cylinder, thus causing atmospheric pressure to drive a piston and produce mechanical work.
* [[James Watt]], in 1781, patented a steam engine that produced continued rotary motion with a power of about {{conv|10|hp|W}}. It was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum. It was an improvement of Newcomen's engine.
* After [[Richard Trevithick]] invented the lightweight, high-pressure steam engine in 1797-1799, steam engines became small enough to be used in smaller businesses and for use in [[steam locomotive]]s.
{{See also|Steam power during the Industrial Revolution}}
Since the early 18th century, steam power has been applied to a variety of practical uses. At first it powered reciprocating pumps, but from the 1780s rotative engines (those converting [[reciprocating motion]] into rotary motion) began to appear, driving factory machinery such as [[power loom]]s. Speed control in response to changing load made direct application of a steam engine to spinning machinery impractical until the invention of the [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss engine]] in 1848.  Until then steam engines were used to pump water to turn a water wheel, which powered the spinning machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Control Engineering 1800-1930 |last=Benett |first= Stuart|year=1986 |publisher =Institution of Engineering and Technology|location=

[[File:Steam powered agricultural ploughing device.png|thumb|Steam powered agricultural ploughing device]]
Steam engines can be said to have been the moving force behind the [[Industrial Revolution]] and saw widespread commercial use driving machinery in factories, mills and mines; powering [[pumping station]]s; and propelling transport appliances such as railway locomotives, ships, [[steamboats]] and road vehicles. Their use in agriculture led to an increase in the land available for cultivation. There have at one time or another been steam-powered farm [[tractor]]s, [[motorcycle]]s (without much success) and even [[automobile]]s as the [[Stanley Steamer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Søren B.

The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the [[power-to-weight ratio]] of a steam plant lower than for [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lightweight steam turbines powered by decomposing [[high-test peroxide]] used neither boilers nor condensers, and were used in the [[V-2]] and other rocket turbopumps, and torpedo propulsion.&lt;/ref&gt; For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or [[electric motor]]s. However, most electric power is generated using [[steam turbine]] plant, so that indirectly the world's industry is still dependent on steam power. Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of [[cogeneration]] processes and as a [[wikt:prime mover|prime mover]]. This is becoming known as the [[Advanced steam technology|Advanced Steam]] movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Pumping engines ===
The first commercial steam-powered device was a water pump, developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.&lt;ref name=Lira&gt;{{cite web|last=Lira|first=Carl T.|title=The Savery Pump|url=http://www.egr.msu.edu/~lira/supp/steam/savery.htm|work=Introductory Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics| publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=11 April 2014|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below, then it used steam pressure to raise it higher. Small engines were effective though larger models were problematic. They proved only to have a limited lift height and were prone to [[boiler explosion]]s. It received some use in mines, [[pumping station]]s and for supplying [[Water wheel|water wheels]] used to power textile machinery.&lt;ref name=Hills16-20&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1989|pp=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attractive feature of the Savery engine was its low cost.

===Piston steam engines===

[[File:Jacob Leupold Steam engine 1720.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jacob Leupold]] Steam engine 1720]]

The first commercially successful true engine, in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine, was the [[atmospheric engine]], invented by [[Thomas Newcomen]] around 1712.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|pp=101}} Landes refers to Thurston's definition of an engine and Thurston's calling Newcomen's the "first true engine."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RBrown&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an improvement over Savery's steam pump, using a piston as proposed by Papin. Newcomen's engine was relatively inefficient, and in most cases was used for pumping water. It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving [[waterwheel]]s at factories sited away from a suitable "head". Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985" /&gt;

In 1720 [[Jacob Leupold]] described a two-cylinder high-pressure steam engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine used two heavy pistons to provide motion to a water pump. Each piston was raised by the steam pressure and returned to its original position by gravity. The two pistons shared a common four way [[rotary valve]] connected directly to a steam boiler.

[[File:Watt steam pumping engine.JPG|thumb|Early [[Watt steam engine|Watt]] pumping engine]]
The next major step occurred when [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] developed (1763–1775) [[Watt steam engine|an improved version]] of Newcomen's engine, with a [[History of the steam engine#Watt's separate condenser|separate condenser]]. [[Boulton and Watt]]'s early engines used half as much coal as [[John Smeaton]]'s improved version of Newcomen's.&lt;ref name=HB&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|Bryant|1991}} Duty comparison was based on a carefully conducted trial in 1778.&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomen's and Watt's early engines were "atmospheric". They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial [[vacuum]] generated by [[condensation|condensing]] steam, instead of the [[pressure]] of expanding steam. The engine [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinders]] had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to [[atmospheric pressure]].&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosen" /&gt;

Watt proceeded to develop his engine further, modifying it to provide a rotary motion suitable for driving factory machinery. This enabled factories to be sited away from rivers, and further accelerated the pace of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book

===High-pressure engines===
The meaning of high pressure, together with an actual value above ambient, depends on the era in which the term was used. For early use of the term Van Reimsdijk&lt;ref&gt;"The Pictorial History Of Steam Power" J.T. Van Reimsdijk and Kenneth Brown, Octopus Books Limited 1989, {{ISBN|0 7064 0976 0}}, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; refers to steam being at a sufficiently high pressure that it could be exhausted to atmosphere without reliance on a vacuum to enable it to perform useful work. Ewing&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/steamengineando02ewingoog#page/n46/mode/2up p.22&lt;/ref&gt; states that Watt's condensing engines were known, at the time, as low pressure compared to high pressure, non-condensing engines of the same period.

Watt's patent prevented others from making high pressure and compound engines. Shortly after Watt's patent expired in 1800, [[Richard Trevithick]] and, separately, [[Oliver Evans]] in 1801&lt;ref name="Thomson 2009"&gt;{{cite book

L. Scott. Baily, 1971, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; These were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications. Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985" /&gt;

The [[Cornish engine]] was developed by Trevithick and others in the 1810s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=601–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively, then condensed the low-pressure steam, making it relatively efficient. The Cornish engine had irregular motion and torque though the cycle, limiting it mainly to pumping. Cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Horizontal stationary engine ===
{{Main|Stationary steam engine}}

Early builders of stationary steam engines considered that horizontal cylinders would be subject to excessive wear. Their engines were therefore arranged with the piston axis vertical. In time the horizontal arrangement became more popular, allowing compact, but powerful engines to be fitted in smaller spaces.

The acme of the horizontal engine was the [[Corliss steam engine]], patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff. When Corliss was given the [[Rumford Medal]], the committee said that "no one invention since Watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine".&lt;ref name="NE Manufacturers 1879"&gt;{{cite book

=== Road vehicles ===
{{Main|History of steam road vehicles}}
[[File:Steam powered road-locomotive from England.png|thumb|Steam powered road-locomotive from England]]
The first experimental road going steam powered vehicles were built in the late 18th century, but it was not until after [[Richard Trevithick]] had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam powered vehicles on roads. Improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s. Steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the [[Second World War]]. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology no steam vehicles are in production at present.

=== Marine engines ===

[[File:Triple expansion marine steam engine.jpg|thumb|right|A triple-expansion [[marine steam engine]] on the 1907 oceangoing tug [[Hercules (1907)|''Hercules'']]]]

{{Main|Marine steam engine}}

Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use. [[Compound steam engine|Compound engines]] exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985"/&gt; Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Wiser"/&gt;

=== Steam turbines ===
{{Main|Steam turbine}}

The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam [[turbine]]s starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a [[connecting rod]] system or similar means.&lt;ref name=smil&gt;{{Citation|page= 62| title=Creating the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations of 1867–1914 and Their Lasting Impact|author= Vaclav Smil|isbn= 0-19-516874-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=Transformer+coltman+1988|accessdate=2009-01-03|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most [[electric power]] is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources.&lt;ref name="Wiser"&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|last= Wiser |first= Wendell H.|year= 2000|publisher= Birkhäuser|isbn= 978-0-387-98744-6|page= 190|url= https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=steam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.

=== Present development ===
{{Main|Advanced steam technology}}

Although the reciprocating steam engine is no longer in widespread commercial use, various companies are exploring or exploiting the potential of the engine as an alternative to internal combustion engines. The company Energiprojekt AB in [[Sweden]] has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam. The efficiency of Energiprojekt's steam engine reaches some 27-30% on high-pressure engines. It is a single-step, 5-cylinder engine (no compound) with superheated steam and consumes approx. {{convert|4|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of steam per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.energiprojekt.com/|title=Energiprojekt LTD – Biomass power plant, Steam pow|publisher= Energiprojekt.com|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2015}}

== Components and accessories of steam engines ==
There are two fundamental components of a steam plant: the [[boiler]] or [[boiler (steam generator)|steam generator]], and the "motor unit", referred to itself as a "steam engine". [[Stationary steam engine]]s in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart. For portable or mobile use, such as [[steam locomotive]]s, the two are mounted together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=495–6}} Description of the Colt portable engine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=}} See description of steam locomotives&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.

Engines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere.

Other components are often present; pumps (such as an [[injector]]) to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the [[latent heat]] of vaporisation, and [[superheater]]s to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin (bunker) to the firebox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Heat source ===
The heat required for boiling the water and raising the temperature of the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (called variously [[combustion chamber]], [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]], [[furnace]]). In some cases the heat source is a [[nuclear reactor]], [[geothermal]] energy, [[solar energy]] or waste heat from an [[internal combustion engine]] or industrial process. In the case of model or toy steam engines, the heat source can be an electric heating element.

=== Boilers ===
{{Main|Boiler (steam generator)}}

[[File:Dampfkessel für eine Stationärdampfmaschine im Textilmuseum Bocholt.jpg|thumb|right|An industrial boiler used for a [[stationary steam engine]]]]

Boilers are [[pressure vessel]]s that contain water to be boiled, and features that [[heat exchanger|transfer the heat to the water]] as effectively as possible.

The two most common types are:
# [[water-tube boiler]] – water is passed through tubes surrounded by hot gas
# [[fire-tube boiler]] – hot gas is passed through tubes immersed in water, the same water also circulates in a water jacket surrounding the firebox and, in high-output locomotive boilers, also passes through tubes in the firebox itself (thermic syphons and security circulators)

Fire tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.

Many boilers raise the temperature of the steam after it has left that part of the boiler where it is in contact with the water. Known as [[superheating]] it turns '[[wet steam]]' into '[[superheated steam]]'. It avoids the steam condensing in the engine cylinders, and gives a significantly higher [[Heat engine#Efficiency|efficiency]].{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=248}}

=== Motor units ===
{{details|#Types of motor units}}

In a steam engine, a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature, using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work.

These "motor units" are often called 'steam engines' in their own right. Engines using compressed air or other gases differ from steam engines only in details that depend on the nature of the gas although [[compressed air]] has been used in steam engines without change.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/thermodynamicss04peabgoog#page/n398/mode/2up p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold sink ===



As with all heat engines, the majority of [[primary energy]] must be emitted as [[waste heat]] at relatively low temperature.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812012523/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment. This is often used on [[steam locomotive]]s, as the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire, which greatly increases engine power, but reduces efficiency.

Sometimes the waste heat is useful itself, and in those cases very high overall efficiency can be obtained. For example, [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) systems use the waste steam for [[district heating]], exceeding 80% combined efficiency.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt;

Where CHP is not used, steam turbines in stationary power plants use [[surface condenser]]s as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by [[cooling tower]]s which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water, is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative (wet) cooling towers use pass the rejected to external water cycle that evaporates some of flow to the air.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} Cooling towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than "once-through" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf Cooling System Retrofit Costs] EPA Workshop on Cooling Water Intake Technologies, John Maulbetsch, Maulbetsch Consulting, May 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Feeley, III, Lindsay Green, James T. Murphy, Jeffrey Hoffmann, and Barbara A. Carney (2005). [http://204.154.137.14/technologies/coalpower/ewr/pubs/IEP_Power_Plant_Water_R&amp;D_Final_1.pdf "Department of Energy/Office of Fossil Energy’s Power Plant Water Management R&amp;D Program."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927104349/http://204.154.137.14/technologies/coalpower/ewr/pubs/IEP_Power_Plant_Water_R%26D_Final_1.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} U.S. Department of Energy, July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaporative water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air, and once the low-pressure steam condenses into water, it is returned to the boiler.

[[File:Boiler Feed Injector Diagram.svg|thumb|right|An [[injector]] uses a jet of steam to force water into the boiler. Injectors are inefficient but simple enough to be suitable for use on locomotives.]]

=== Water pump ===

The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage [[centrifugal pump]]s; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an [[injector]], which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler. Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=341–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the pressurization of the water that circulates through the steam boiler that allows the water to be raised to temperatures well above 100&amp;nbsp;°C boiling point of water at one atmospheric pressure, and by that means to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle.

=== Monitoring and control ===

[[File:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875. See: Indicator diagram (below)]]

For safety reasons, nearly all steam engines are equipped with mechanisms to monitor the boiler, such as a [[pressure gauge]] and a [[sight glass]] to monitor the water level.

Many engines, stationary and mobile, are also fitted with a [[governor (device)|governor]] to regulate the speed of the engine without the need for human interference.

The most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851,&lt;ref name="Hunter 1991"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The governor could not actually hold a set speed, because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1979|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.

=== Simple engine ===
In a simple engine, or "single expansion engine" the charge of steam passes through the entire expansion process in an individual cylinder, although a simple engine may have one or more individual cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Mechanical Engineering by Mohan Sen pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; It is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser. As steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine, its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system; this is known as [[adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature. This causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke, which is a source of inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|High pressure cylinder}}
{{anchor|Low pressure cylinder}}
&lt;!--''High pressure cylinder'' and ''Low pressure cylinder'' both redirect here, hence the bolding of these terms--&gt;

The dominant efficiency loss in reciprocating steam engines is cylinder condensation and re-evaporation. The steam cylinder and adjacent metal parts/ports operate at a temperature about halfway between the steam admission saturation temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the exhaust pressure.  As high pressure steam is admitted into the working cylinder, much of the high temperature steam is condensed as water droplets onto the metal surfaces, significantly reducing the steam available for expansive work.  When the expanding steam reaches low pressure (especially during the exhaust stroke), the previously deposited water droplets that had just been formed within the cylinder/ports now boil away (re-evaporation) and this steam does no further work in the cylinder.

There are practical limits on the expansion ratio of a steam engine cylinder, as increasing cylinder surface area tends to exacerbate the cylinder condensation and re-evaporation issues.  This negates the theoretical advantages associated with a high ratio of expansion in an individual cylinder.

=== Compound engines ===
{{Main|Compound engine}}

A method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by British engineer [[Arthur Woolf]], who patented his ''Woolf high-pressure '''compound engine''''' in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a '''high-pressure (HP) cylinder''' and then enters one or more subsequent '''lower-pressure (LP) cylinders'''. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders, with the overall temperature drop within each cylinder reduced considerably.  By expanding the steam in steps with smaller temperature range (within each cylinder) the condensation and re-evaporation efficiency issue (described above) is reduced. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985" /&gt; To derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and in rare cases the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985" /&gt;

Double-expansion (usually known as '''compound''') engines expanded the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.&lt;ref name="Hunter 1985" /&gt;

Two-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:

* '''Cross compounds''': The cylinders are side by side.
* '''Tandem compounds''': The cylinders are end to end, driving a common [[connecting rod]]
* '''Angle compounds''': The cylinders are arranged in a V (usually at a 90° angle) and drive a common crank.

With two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90° out of phase with each other (''quartered''). When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a four-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180°, the groups being set at 90° to each other. In one case (the first type of [[Vauclain compound]]), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90° as for a two-cylinder engine. With the three-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90° with the HP one at 135° to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120°.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the [[loading gauge]] (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930). However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.&lt;ref name="van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives" /&gt;

[[File:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|An animation of a simplified triple-expansion engine.&lt;br /&gt;High-pressure steam (red) enters from the boiler and passes through the engine, exhausting as low-pressure steam (blue), usually to a condenser.]]

It is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the '''multiple-expansion engine'''. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as ''triple-'' and ''quadruple-expansion engines'' respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double-expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing "system" was used on some [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|marine triple-expansion engines]]. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic'' class]]), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free [[Steam engine#Turbine engines|turbine engine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is noted, however, that triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines were used to drive the World War II [[Liberty ship]]s, by far the largest number of identical ships ever built. Over 2700 ships were built, in the United States, from a British original design.  

The image to the right shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right. The valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder.

Land-based steam engines could exhaust their steam to atmosphere, as feed water was usually readily available. Prior to and during [[World War I]], the expansion engine dominated marine applications, where high vessel speed was not essential. It was, however, superseded by the British invention [[steam turbine]] where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the [[dreadnought battleship]]s, and [[ocean liner]]s. {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, John.

=== Reciprocating piston ===
[[File:Steam engine in action.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Double-acting cylinder|Double acting]] stationary engine. This was the common mill engine of the mid 19th century. Note the [[slide valve]] with concave, almost "D" shaped, underside.]]
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Schematic [[Indicator diagram]] showing the four events in a double piston stroke. See: Monitoring and control (above)]]

{{Main|Reciprocating engine}}

In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the same end of the cylinder. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four ''events'' – admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a ''steam chest'' adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ''ports'' communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by [[valve gear]], of which there are many types.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Many however have a reversing [[Machine|mechanism]] which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually "shortening the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]]" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (''"kick back"'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In the 1840s and 50s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide ''lap'' by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler [[Stephenson valve gear|Stephenson]], [[Joy valve gear|Joy]] and [[Walschaerts valve gear|Walschaerts]] motions. [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss]], and later, [[poppet valve]] gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by [[trip valve|trip mechanisms]] or [[cam]]s profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.&lt;ref name="van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Riemsdijk| first=John|year=1994|title=Compound Locomotives |location=Penrhyn, UK|publisher=Atlantic Transport Publishers|isbn=0-906899-61-3|pages=2–3|ref=van Riemsdijk, Compound locomotives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, George W. &amp; contributors (2000): La locomotive à vapeur, English translation of André Chapelon's seminal work (1938): pp. 56-72; 120 et seq; Camden Miniature Steam Services, UK. {{ISBN|0-9536523-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Compression'''
Before the exhaust phase is quite complete, the exhaust side of the valve closes, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder. This determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing; it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock, which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cycle.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

:'''Lead'''
The above effects are further enhanced by providing ''lead'': as was later discovered with the [[internal combustion engine]], it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase, giving the valve ''lead'' so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the ''clearance volume'' comprising the ports and the cylinder ends (not part of the piston-swept volume) before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston.&lt;ref name="Bel, Locomotives"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A.M.|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Company|year=1950|location=London|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniflow (or unaflow) engine ===

[[File:Uniflow steam engine.gif|thumb|upright=2.25|Schematic animation of a [[uniflow steam engine]].&lt;br /&gt;The [[poppet valves]] are controlled by the rotating [[camshaft]] at the top. High-pressure steam enters, red, and exhausts, yellow.]]

{{Main|Uniflow steam engine}}

Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where, during each stroke, the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam, whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature. The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower. However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. The [[Quasiturbine]] is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas, while exhausting in cold areas.

=== Turbine engines ===
[[File:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|right|A rotor of a modern [[steam turbine]], used in a [[power plant]]]]

{{Main|Steam turbine}}

A steam turbine consists of one or more ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|rotors]]'' (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|stators]]'' (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a [[surface condenser]] that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the United States with 60 Hertz power, and 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

Steam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion. Thus, they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft. This contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating engine.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Turbinia]]'' – the first [[steam turbine]]-powered ship]]

The main use for steam turbines is in [[electricity generation]] (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines)&lt;ref Name="Wiser" /&gt; however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the ''[[Turbinia]]''), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.

Virtually all [[nuclear power]] plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an [[electrical generator]]. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ [[turbo-electric transmission]], where the steam drives a [[turbo generator]] set with propulsion provided by electric motors. A limited number of [[steam turbine locomotive|steam turbine railroad locomotives]] were manufactured. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in [[Sweden]] and for [[LMS Turbomotive|express passenger work in Britain]], but were not repeated. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced. It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:Oscillating cylinder.svg|thumb|right|Operation of a simple [[oscillating cylinder steam engine]]]]

=== Oscillating cylinder steam engines ===
{{Main|Oscillating cylinder steam engine}}

An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require [[valve gear|valves]] to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting ([[trunnion]]). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|ships]] where their compactness is valued.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Rotary steam engines ===
It is possible to use a mechanism based on a [[pistonless rotary engine]] such as the [[Wankel engine]] in place of the cylinders and [[valve gear]] of a conventional reciprocating steam engine. Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and [[thermal expansion]]; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]], is also a serious problem with many such designs.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

By the 1840s, it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press. However, the arrival of electricity on the scene, and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine, led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s, and a few designs had some limited success.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}. The [[Quasiturbine]] is a new type of uniflow rotary steam engine.

Of the few designs that were manufactured in quantity, those of the Hult Brothers Rotary Steam Engine Company of Stockholm, Sweden, and the spherical engine of [[Beauchamp Tower]] are notable. Tower's engines were used by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives, and by the [[Admiralty]] for driving dynamos on board the ships of the [[Royal Navy]]. They were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

=== Rocket type ===
{{Main|Steam rocket}}

The [[aeolipile]] represents the use of steam by the rocket-reaction principle, although not for direct propulsion.

In more modern times there has been limited use of steam for rocketry – particularly for rocket cars. Steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle. The drop in pressure immediately boils some of the water and the steam leaves through a nozzle, creating a propulsive force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/vapori.html Steam Rockets] Tecaeromax&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
Steam engines possess boilers and other components that are [[pressure vessel]]s that contain a great deal of potential energy. Steam escapes and [[boiler explosion]]s (typically [[BLEVE]]s) can and have in the past caused great loss of life. While variations in standards may exist in different countries, stringent legal, testing, training, care with manufacture, operation and certification is applied to ensure safety.

Failure modes may include:
* over-pressurisation of the boiler
* insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure
* buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots, especially in riverboats using dirty feed water
* pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance.
* escape of steam from pipework/boiler causing scalding

Steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such [[safety valve]]s traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Lead [[fusible plug]]s may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the [[lead]] melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Steam cycle ==
{{Main|Rankine cycle}}
{{See also|Thermodynamics|Heat transfer}}

[[File:Rankine cycle layout.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Flow diagram of the four main devices used in the [[Rankine cycle]]. 1). Feedwater pump 2). Boiler or steam generator 3). Turbine or engine 4). Condenser; where ''Q''=heat and ''W''=work. Most of the heat is rejected as waste.]]
The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all [[solar thermal|solar]], [[biomass]], [[Coal power|coal]] and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] [[power plant]]s. It is named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]], a Scottish [[polymath]].

The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical [[Carnot cycle]] because, when an efficient turbine is used, the [[TS diagram]] begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and [[Isothermal process|isothermal]] (constant [[temperature]]) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the [[Carnot cycle]]).&lt;!-- check-the source was too ambiguous--&gt; The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an "open loop" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied. Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its [[Properties of water#Heat capacity and heats of vaporization and fusion|thermodynamic properties]]. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is the working fluid in the [[mercury vapor turbine]]. Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a [[binary cycle]].

The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered [[latent heat]], which was confirmed by the original discoverer [[Joseph Black]], who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.&lt;ref name="Landes" /&gt; The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.

== Efficiency ==
{{Main|Thermal efficiency}}
{{See also|Engine efficiency#Steam engine}}

The efficiency of an engine cycle can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy input to the engine by the burning fuel.

The historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its "duty". The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen designs]]. Duty is the number of [[foot-pounds]] of [[work (physics)|work]] delivered by burning one [[bushel]] (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.&lt;ref&gt;John Enys, [https://books.google.com/books?id=blhqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA457 "Remarks on the Duty of the Steam Engines employed in the Mines of Cornwall at different periods"], ''Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers'', Volume 3 (14 January 1840), pg. 457&lt;/ref&gt;

No heat engine can be more efficient than the [[Carnot cycle]], in which heat is moved from a high temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature, and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference. For the greatest efficiency, steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible ([[superheater|superheated steam]]), and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible.

The efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid. Without the pressure reaching [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|supercritical]] levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565&amp;nbsp;°C (the [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30&amp;nbsp;°C. This gives a theoretical [[Carnot efficiency]] of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a [[gas turbine]]) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in [[Combined cycle|combined-cycle gas turbine]] power stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

One of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine (or reciprocating engine)power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. [[Gas turbine]]s, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In practice, a reciprocating steam engine cycle exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency (including the boiler) in the range of 1-10%, but with the addition of a condenser and multiple expansion, and high steam pressure/temperature, it may be greatly improved, historically into the regime of 10-20%, and very rarely slightly higher.

A modern large electrical power station (producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output) with [[steam reheat]], [[economizer]] etc. will achieve efficiency in the mid 40% range, with the most efficient units approaching 50% thermal efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pepei.pennnet.com/display_article/152601/6/ARTCL/none/none/1/New-Benchmarks-for-Steam-Turbine-Efficiency/|title=Power Engineering and PEI Magazines: Daily coverage of electric power generation technology, fuels, transmission, equipment, coal power plants, renewable energy sources, emission control, more – Power-Gen Worldwide|publisher =Pepei.pennnet.com|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to capture the waste heat using [[cogeneration]] in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12915">According to [[Profit impact of marketing strategy|PIMS]] (profit impact of marketing strategy), an important lever of business success is growth. Among 37 variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio&lt;ref name="Lancaster2001" /&gt; or a strong market position.&lt;ref name="Dibb2005" /&gt; 

The question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:

* The '''sustainable growth rate''' ('''SGR''') concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target [[dividend payout ratio]], target [[profit margin]], target ratio of [[total assets]] to [[net sales]]). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations.&lt;ref name="Higgins1977" /&gt;
* The '''optimal growth''' concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch, Björn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective—independent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.&lt;ref name="Boernsen2011" /&gt;

==From a financial perspective==
The sustainable growth rate according to Robert C. Higgins is the maximum growth rate a company can achieve consistent with the firm`s established financial policy. Basically, it is calculated as: 

'''SGR = (pm*(1-d)*(1+L)) / (T-(pm*(1-d)*(1+L)))''' 
* pm is  the existing and target profit margin
* d is the target dividend payout ratio
* L is the target total debt to equity ratio
* T is the ratio of total assets to sales

In order to grow faster, the company would have to invest more equity capital, increase its [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] or increase the target profit margin.

The sustainable growth rate model assumes several simplifications such as [[depreciation]] is sufficient to maintain the value of existing assets, the [[profit margin]] remains stable (also for new businesses), the proportion of assets and sales remains stable (also for new businesses) and the company maintains its current capital structure and dividend payout policy.
The sustainable growth rate model has implications for valuation models, as for instance the [[Gordon model]] and other [[discounted cash flow]] models require a growth estimate that can be sustained for many years. The sustainable growth rate can be a check if business plans are reasonable.

==Optimal growth rates from a total shareholder value creation and profitability perspective==
'''Optimal Growth''' according to Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch and Björn Heyden is the growth rate which assures sustainable company development – considering the long-term relationship between revenue growth, total [[shareholder value]] creation and profitability. 
Assessment basis: The work is based on assessments on the performance of more than 3500 stock-listed companies with an initial revenue of greater 250 million Euro globally and across industries over a period of 12 years from 1997 till 2009. Due to this long time period, the authors consider their findings as to a large extent independent of specific economic cycles.&lt;ref name="Boernsen2011" /&gt;

===Relationship between revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability===
In the long-term and across industries, total shareholder value creation (stock price development plus dividend payments) rises steadily with increasing revenue growth rates. The more long-term revenue growth companies realize, the more investors appreciate this and the more they get rewarded.

[[File:Graf1 revenue.JPG]]

[[Return on assets]] (ROA), [[return on sales]] (ROS) and [[return on equity]] (ROE) do rise with increasing revenue growth up to 10 to 25% and then fall with further increasing revenue growth rates.

[[File:Graf2 profitability.JPG]]

Also the combined ROX-index (average of ROA, ROS and ROE) shows rises with increasing growth rates to a broad maximum in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth per year and falls towards higher growth rates. 

[[File:Graf3 rox.JPG]]

The authors attribute the continuous profitability increase towards the maximum of two effects:

# '''Profitability drives growth: ''' Companies with substantial profitability have the opportunity to invest more in additional growth.
# '''Growth drives profitability: ''' Substantial growth may be a driver for additional profitability, e.g. by higher attractiveness for high performing young professionals, higher employee motivation, higher attractiveness for business partners as well as higher self-confidence.

Beyond the profitability maximum extra efforts to handle additional growth – e.g. based on integrating new staff in large dimensions and handling culture and quality - do rise sharply and reduce overall profitability. 

The combination of the patterns of revenue growth, total shareholder value creation and profitability indicates three growth zones:

[[File:Graf4 zones of growth.JPG]]

* '''Low Return: ''' Low profitability and low value generation below 10% per year
* '''Long-term Sweet-Spot: ''' Solid value generation and highest on average profitability in the revenue growth interval from 10% to 25% per year
* '''High Speed: ''' Even higher total shareholder value generation however in combination with lower profitability beyond 25% per year

Growth rates of the assessed companies are widely independent of initial company size/ market share which is in alignment with [[Gibrat's law]].  Gibrat's law, sometimes called Gibrat's rule of proportionate growth is a rule defined by [[Robert Gibrat]] (1904–1980) stating that the size of a firm and its growth rate are independent.
Independent of industry consolidation and industry growth rate, companies in many industries with growth rates in the range of 10 to 25% revenue growth p.a. have both, higher total shareholder value generation as well as profitability than their slower growing peers.

===Base strategies and growth moves===
These findings do suggest two base strategies for companies:

* For companies (e.g. in established markets like central Europe and USA) with low single digit growth rates: Consider acceleration of growth given the fact that TSR and profitability are higher in the sweet-spot
* For companies (e.g. in fast growing regional markets like China with India and/ or rapidly growing industry segments) with growth rates beyond 25%: Consider best ways to “digest”/ and to stabilize  rapid growth and ensure a “soft landing” should market growth come to a sudden stop.

===How to achieve long-term growth in the sweet-spot and beyond===
The authors have identified a set of preconditions and levers to achieve long-term growth in their defined sweet-spot and beyond:

====Preconditions====
* Generating a common understanding regarding growth and profit ambitions among the management team as a prerequisite for aligned and coordinated strategy development and implementation
* Understanding relevant markets (current or future promising markets). Generating market foresight when identifying and assessing growth initiatives, e.g.  [[megatrends]] and [[scenario analyses]], segment specific [[benchmarking]] and in depth assessments, market demand projections

====Levers and strategy====
* Applying formulas for rapid growth, e.g. maxing out the number of relevant customers, maxing out the share of wallet and lifecycle potentials, continuous innovation, killer offerings, network based growth, M&amp;A/buy-and-build driven growth, franchising proven business concepts, pyramid-like network expansion and managing value networks
* Defining the growth strategy as a portfolio of best suited growth initiatives considering a multidimensional set of criteria, e.g. ease of implementation, growth and profit impact, expected risk vs. return, [[cash flow]] stability
* Making growth happen: Strategy and corresponding culture must be addressed in a consistent way, e.g. [[change management|creating the case for growth]], clearly defining and communicating vision and strategy as well as actively developing and energizing the organization.&lt;ref name="Boernsen2011" /&gt;

==Criticism==
As described the sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins is based on several assumptions such as constant [[profit margin]], constant [[debt to equity ratio]] or constant asset to sales ratio. Therefore, general applicability of SGR concept in cases where these parameters are not stable is limited.

The Optimal Growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch, Björn Heyden et al.  has no restrictions to certain strategies or business model and is therefore more flexible in its applicability. However, as a broad framework, it only provides an orientation for case/company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.  Additional company and market specific considerations, e.g. market growth, growth culture, appetite for change, are required to come up with the optimal growth rate of a specific company. 

Additionally, considering the increasing criticism of excessive growth and shareholder value orientation by philosophers, economists and also managers, e.g. [[Stéphane Hessel]], [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[Jack Welch]] (nowadays), one might expect that investors' investment criteria might also change in the future. This may lead to changes in the relationship of revenue growth rates and total shareholder value creation. Regular reviews of the optimal growth assessments may be used as an indicator for the development of stock markets` appetite for rapid growth.

The '''Tehuacán Valley matorral''' is a xeric shrubland [[ecoregion]], of the [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[biome]], located in eastern [[Tehuacan|Central Mexico]].

[[Matorral]] is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]  word, along with ''tomillares'', for [[shrubland]], [[thicket]] or [[bushes]].&lt;ref&gt;Velazquez, Mariano (comp.) (1973) "Matorral" ''A New Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages'' (rev. ed.) Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used alone for a [[Mediterranean climate]] ecosystem in Southern Europe.

==Geography==
The Tehuacán Valley matorral ecoregion occupies the [[Tehuacan Valley|Tehuacán Valley]] and Cuicatlán Valley, covering parts of the states of [[Puebla]] and [[Oaxaca]]. The valleys lie in the [[rain shadow]] of the surrounding mountain ranges, and are drier than the surrounding ecoregions.

===Adjacent ecoregions===
The Tehuacán Valley matorral is bounded by the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]] to the northwest, north, and northeast, the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca pine-oak forests]] to the east, and by the [[Balsas dry forests]] to the southeast, south, and southwest.

==Flora==
[[File:Ferocactusrobustus.jpg|thumb|220px|Xeric vegetation in Tehuacán Valley.]]
The Tehuacán Valley matorral is a center of plant diversity, with over 2700 species, of which approximately 30% are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]]. It is a center of diversity for species of ''[[Agave]]'', ''[[Hechtia]]'', ''[[Salvia]]'', and [[cactus]].

The ecoregion has a number of distinct plant communities.

==Fauna==
The ecoregion is notable for its diversity of birds and bats. Of the 90 species of birds present, 10 are endemic, including the [[ocellated thrasher]] (''Toxostoma ocellatum''), and [[bridled sparrow]] (''Aimorphilla mystacalis''). 34 species of bats inhabit the ecoregion, of which 18 are endangered, vulnerable, or rare.

'''Thermal ionization''', also known as '''surface ionization''' or '''contact ionization''', is a physical process whereby the atoms are [[desorption|desorbed]] from a hot surface, and in the process are spontaneously ionized.

Thermal ionization is used to make simple [[ion source]]s, for [[mass spectrometry]] and for generating [[ion beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alton | first1 = G. D. | title = Characterization of a cesium surface ionization source with a porous tungsten ionizer.

==Physics==

[[File:Surface ionization of cesium.svg|thumb|Surface ionization effect in a vaporized [[cesium]] atom at 1500 K, calculated using a [[grand canonical ensemble]]. Y-axis: average number of electrons on the atom; the atom is neutral when it has 55 electrons. X-axis: energy variable (equal to the surface [[work function]]) dependent on electron [[chemical potential]] {{math|''µ''}} and electrostatic potential {{math|''ϕ''}}.]]

The likelihood of ionization is a function of the filament temperature, the [[work function]] of the filament substrate and the [[ionization energy]] of the [[chemical element|element]].

This is summarised in the [[Saha ionization equation|Saha-Langmuir equation]]:&lt;ref name='1.1655755'&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Saha-Langmuir Equation and its Application|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date= January 1968|first=M.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_+}{n_0}  =  \frac{g_+}{g_0} \exp \Bigg(\frac{W-\Delta E_I}{kT}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;
where

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_+}{n_0}&lt;/math&gt; = ratio of ion number density to neutral number density

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{g_+}{g_0}&lt;/math&gt; = ratio of statistical weights (degeneracy) of ionic (g_+) and neutral (g_0) states

::&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; = [[electron charge]]

::&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = [[work function]] of surface

::&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_I&lt;/math&gt; = [[ionization energy]] of desorbed element

::&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; = [[Boltzmann's constant]]

::&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; = surface temperature

Negative ionization can also occur for elements with a large [[electron affinity]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta E_A&lt;/math&gt; against a surface of low work function.

==Thermal ionization mass spectrometry==

{{main|Thermal ionization mass spectrometry}}

One application of thermal ionization is [[thermal ionization mass spectrometry]] (TIMS). In thermal ionization mass spectrometry, a chemically purified material is placed onto a [[Electrical filament|filament]] which is then heated to high temperatures to cause some of the material to be [[ion]]ized as it is thermally desorbed (boiled off) the hot filament.  Filaments are generally flat pieces of metal around 1-2mm wide, 0.1mm thick, bent into an upside-down U shape and attached to two contacts that supply a current.

This method is widely used in [[radiometric dating]], where the sample is ionized under vacuum. The ions being produced at the filament are focussed into an ion beam and then passed through a magnetic field to separate them by mass.  The relative abundances of different isotopes can then be measured, yielding isotope ratios.

When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.&lt;ref name=Dickin&gt;Dickin, A.P., 2005. Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization energy, such as [[strontium]] and [[lead]].

The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500&amp;nbsp;°C, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization energy, such as [[osmium]] and [[tungsten]].  Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization energy can be analyzed more effectively with [[MC-ICP-MS]].

[[File:Moon transit of sun large.ogv|thumb|A solar transit of the [[Moon]] captured during calibration of the [[STEREO]] B spacecraft's ultraviolet imaging. The Moon appears much smaller than it does when seen from [[Earth]], because the spacecraft–Moon separation was several times greater than the [[lunar distance (astronomy)|Earth–Moon distance]].]]

In [[astronomy]], a '''transit''' (or '''astronomical transit''') is a [[celestial event|phenomenon]] when a [[astronomical object|celestial body]] passes directly between a larger body and the observer. As viewed from a particular vantage point, the transiting body appears to move across the face of the larger body, [[eclipse|covering]] a small portion of it.

== Definition ==
[[File:Jupiter-io-transit feb 10 2009.gif|thumb|A simulation of Io transiting Jupiter as seen from the Earth in February 2009. Io's shadow is seen on the surface of Jupiter, leading Io slightly due to the sun and Earth not being in the same line.]]
The word "transit" refers to cases where the nearer object [[apparent size|appears]] considerably smaller than the more distant object. Cases where the nearer object appears larger and completely hides the more distant object are known as [[occultation|''occultations'']]. the probability of a seeing a transiting planet is low, however. The alignment of the two objects must be such that the observer is also in alignment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lco.global/spacebook/transit-method/|title=Transit Method {{!}} Las Cumbres Observatory|website=lco.global|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From transiting many parameters can be determined by about a planet.  

Transiting is the method used to find [[Exoplanet|exoplanets.]] As the exoplanet move in front of its host stars there is a dimming in the luminosity of its host star that can be measured. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html|title=Transit Photometry|website=www.planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger planets tends to make the dip in luminosity more noticeable and easier to detect.   

One example of a transit involves the motion of a [[planet]] between a [[Earth|terrestrial]] observer and the [[Sun]]. This can happen only with [[inferior and superior planets|inferior planets]], namely [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] (see [[transit of Mercury]] and [[transit of Venus]]). However, as seen from outer planets such as [[Mars]], the [[transit of Earth from Mars|Earth itself transits the Sun]] on occasion.

[[File:PIA02879 - A New Year for Jupiter and Io.jpg|left|thumb|[[Io (moon)|Io]] transits across [[Jupiter]] as seen by ''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft]]

The term can also be used to describe the motion of a [[natural satellite|satellite]] across its parent planet, for instance one of the Galilean satellites ([[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]) across [[Jupiter]], as seen from [[Earth]].

A transit requires three bodies to be lined up in a single line.  More rare are cases where four bodies are lined up.  The one closest to the present occurred on 27 June 1586, when Mercury transited the Sun as seen from Venus at the same time as a transit of Mercury from Saturn and a transit of Venus from Saturn. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In recent years the discovery of [[extrasolar planet]]s has excited interest in the possibility of detecting their transits across their own [[star|stellar]] primaries. [[HD 209458b]] is the first such transiting planet to be discovered.

== Mutual planetary transits ==
{{main|Planetary transits and occultations}}
In rare cases, one planet can pass in front of another. If the nearer planet appears smaller than the more distant one, the event is called a ''mutual planetary transit''.

== Contacts ==
[[File:PIA18389-MarsCuriosityRover-MercuryTransitsSun-20140603.gif|thumb|150px|right|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transiting the [[Sun]] as viewed by the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on [[Mars]] (June 3, 2014)&lt;ref name="NASA-20140610"&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Guy |title=Mercury Passes in Front of the Sun, as Seen From Mars |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-183 |date=June 10, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During a transit there are four "contacts", when the [[circumference]] of the small circle (small body disk) touches the circumference of the large circle (large body disk) [[tangent|at a single point]].  Historically, measuring the precise time of each point of contact was one of the most accurate ways to determine the positions of astronomical bodies.  The contacts happen in the following order:
[[File:Astronomical Transit.gif|thumb|150px|left|Artistic animation of a planet transitting its star]]
* '''First contact''': the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving inward ("exterior ingress")
* '''Second contact''': the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving further inward ("interior ingress")
* '''Third contact''': the smaller body is entirely inside the larger body, moving outward ("interior egress")
* '''Fourth contact''': the smaller body is entirely outside the larger body, moving outward ("exterior egress")&lt;ref name="UCLsafety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/safety.htm|title=Transit of Venus&amp;nbsp;– Safety|publisher=University of Central Lancashire|accessdate=21 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925140910/http://www.transit-of-venus.org.uk/safety.htm|archivedate=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fifth named point is that of greatest transit, when the apparent centers of the two bodies are nearest to each other, halfway through the transit.&lt;ref name="UCLsafety" /&gt;

== Notable observations ==
No missions were planned to coincide with the transit of [[Earth]] visible from [[Mars]] on 11 May 1984 and the Viking missions had been terminated a year previously. Consequently, the next opportunity to observe such an alignment will be in 2084.

On December 21, 2012, the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' probe, in orbit around [[Saturn]], observed the planet [[Venus]] transiting the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://spacecoastdaily.com/2012/12/cassini-spacecraft-tracks-venus-transit-from-saturn/ Cassini Spacecraft Tracks Venus Transit From Saturn]'', Space Coast Daily. Retrieved on 2016-02-08. &lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 June 2014, the Mars rover [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']] observed the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] transiting the Sun, marking the first time a [[planetary transit]] has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140610" /&gt;

The '''Volunteer Training Corps''' was a voluntary home defence [[militia]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War I]].

==Early development==
After war had been declared in August 1914, there was a popular demand for a means of service for those men who were over military age or those with business or family commitments which made it difficult for them to volunteer for the armed services. At this stage in the war, Britain relied entirely on a voluntary system of enlistment and many men still held to the Victorian principle that it was the task of  professional troops to fight a war whilst voluntary militias provided for home defence, and civilian local defence groups began to spring up spontaneously as soon as war was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Defining their own patriotism: British Volunteer Training Corps in the First World War|last = Osborne|first = John|date = Jan 1988|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteer movement gained publicity from discourse in the press advocating civilian participation in home defence, with notable proponents being [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. The first elements of central organisation were established by the formation of the London '''Volunteer Defence Force'''. Discussions about the nature and role of the movement ranged from simply drilling volunteers in preparation for their enlistment into the regular or home armies, through augmenting the home army's defence of vulnerable points, to providing a force that would actively oppose an invasion with [[guerrilla warfare]]. Concerned that such a body would undermine recruitment into the regular army and hinder more than help home defence, the War Office banned the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchinson 2005 pp. 68–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite official antipathy, civilians continued to organise themselves, and [[Harold Tennant]], Under-Secretary of State for War, realised that the government could do little to prevent them. Rather than allow the movement to grow unchecked, he decided in September to allow the Central Committee of the London Volunteer Defence Force to continue. Until the War Office had the time and resources to devote to the movement itself, the Central Committee, adopting the name Central Association of Volunteer Training Corps (VTC), became the body to which individual corps could affiliate, and was responsible for drawing up the rules and regulations on a national basis. [[Lord Desborough]] became the President of the Association and General Sir [[O'Moore Creagh]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]] was appointed the Military Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchinson 2005 pp. 72–75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/officialregulati00centrich#page/10/mode/2up Blake, J. P. (editor), ''The Official Regulations for Volunteer Training Corps and for County Volunteer Organisations (England and Wales)'' The Central Association Volunteer Training Corps 1916 (p. 10)]&lt;/ref&gt; In November, the association was officially recognised as the administrative body of the VTC and formally subjected to conditions which prevented interference with recruitment into the regular army, barred members from holding military rank or wearing uniforms other than an armband and denied any state funding.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett 2004 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-military personnel of the [[National Reserve]] played a leading role in the growth of the VTC, providing many of its recruits and lending the nascent organisation an element of martial respectability. Among the many new corps formed were the United Arts Rifles&amp;nbsp;– which numbered in its ranks the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]], [[Robert Bridges]]&amp;nbsp;– a unit of deaf mutes which drilled by sign language, and a unit that went by the name of the Ju Jitsu VTC.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchinson 2005 pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1915, corps began to be organised into county regiments. Some 2,000 individual corps had appeared by June 1915, numbering 590,000 volunteers. Units raised finances for the purchase of weapons by charging membership fees. Amid concerns that they would compete with the established forces for the limited amount of rifles then available&amp;nbsp;– in October 1915, there were 570,600 in the country for the 1.3 million men who needed them&amp;nbsp;– the government prohibited volunteers from buying service rifles and required any purchase to be first cleared with the local military authority. Those corps which could not afford weapons begged or borrowed wherever they could, and dummy rifles, [[air gun]]s and weapons loaned by the Church Lads' Brigade were among those pressed into service by various units.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchinson 2005 pp. 108, 112, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for the services of the VTC increased, and members were employed as guards by the Admiralty on the Scilly Isles, at the many new munitions works and on the rail network. Volunteers also dug trenches around London and assisted in bringing in the harvest. The movement grew out of the same spirit of volunteer service that gave birth to the Volunteer Force in the second half of the previous century, and a [[private member's bill]] introduced in the [[House of Lords]] in October 1915 sought to revive the Volunteer Act of 1863 as an attempt to place the VTC on a more official footing. It was supported by General Sir [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], commander of the Central Force First Army, who, in a letter to ''The Times'', wrote of "the most valuable aid the VTC are giving me". The bill failed due to government fears that it would complicate the [[Irish Home Rule movement|home rule issue]] in Ireland by recognising the [[Ulster Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Volunteers]]. The VTC officially remained unrecognised and outside of the nation's home defence scheme, thus depriving members of legal protection in the performance of their duties. There was some doubt that the armband would be recognised by the enemy as uniform, leaving members vulnerable to execution as ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', and when it was suggested that the VTC might guard prisoners of war, it was pointed out that, technically, a volunteer could be hanged for murder if he shot an escapee.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchinson 2005 pp. 113–115, 120–123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official recognition==

When it was discovered that the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)#Volunteer Act 1863|Volunteer Act 1863]] had never been repealed, it was used in April 1916 to legitimise the movement. VTC Battalions legally became Volunteer Regiments of the new 'Volunteer Force'. Eventually they were allowed to wear khaki uniforms and equipment began to be officially supplied. In July 1918, the War Office decided to include the VTC Battalions into the [[Childers Reforms|County Infantry Regiment system]], and they became numbered "Volunteer" battalions of their local regiment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentfallen.com/PDF%20REPORTS/WEST%20KENT%20UNITS.pdf  Kent War Memorials Transcription Project - Reports - ''West Kent Units'']&lt;/ref&gt; With the introduction of [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscription]] in 1916, came the power of the [[Military Service Tribunals]] to order men to join the VTC; however, the clause in the 1863 act which allowed resignation after fourteen days' notice initially made this unenforceable, so a [[Volunteer Act 1916]] was passed which obliged members to remain in the Corps until the end of the war. By February 1918, there were 285,000 Volunteers, 101,000 of whom had been directed to the Corps by the Tribunals.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, ''A Nation in Arms'', pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment, training and role==
[[File:VolunteerTrainingCorps Uniforms.jpg|thumb|right|The Approved Volunteer Training Corps uniforms, published in February 1915]]
During 1917, [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P.14 Enfield Rifle]]s began to be issued, followed by [[Hotchkiss M1909 Benet-Mercie machine gun|Hotchkiss Mk I machine gun]]s.&lt;ref name=owtram&gt;[http://www.kingsownmuseum.plus.com/ww1-volbnskorlr.htm King's Own Royal Regiment Museum - ''1st &amp; 2nd Volunteer Battalions, King’s Own Royal Lancaster Regiment (Volunteer Training Corps)'' by H. H. Owtram, April 1934]&lt;/ref&gt; The Corps trained in [[Military parade|drill]] and, if the equipment was available, use of the rifle. In case of a German invasion, battalions were tasked with roles such as line of communication defence and forming the garrison of major towns; 42 battalions were to defend London. Volunteers undertook a wide range of other tasks including; guarding vulnerable points, munitions handling, digging anti-invasion defence lines, assisting with harvesting, fire fighting and transport for wounded soldiers.  In north Worcestershire some units helped to man  anti-aircraft guns ringing [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worcestershirevtc.com/worcestershire-vtc/4593399660|title=Introduction to the  Worcestershire Volunteer Force|last=Atkin|first=Malcolm|date=|website=Worcestershire VTC &amp; Volunteer Force|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, when there was an acute shortage of manpower because of [[Operation Michael|the German spring offensive]], c.7,000 Volunteers undertook three-month coast defence duties in [[East Anglia]].

==The Easter Rising in Dublin==
The only time that Volunteer Training Corps men were engaged in actual combat, was in the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] starting on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916. Some 120 members of the 1st (Dublin) Battalion, Associated Volunteer Training Corps were returning from field exercises at [[Ticknock]], when they heard news of the uprising. The commanding officer, Major Harris, decided to march to [[Beggars Bush Barracks]]. They carried rifles but were without ammunition or bayonets. They were fired on by a party of [[Irish Volunteers]] from a railway bridge. Part of the VTC force entered the barracks by the front gate, others made their way to the rear and scaled the wall. About 40 men at the rear of the column were pinned down by fire from surrounding houses and four were killed, including the first-class [[cricket]]er, [[Francis Browning]], who had been second-in-command. The VTC men then assisted the small garrison of regular soldiers to hold the barracks for eight days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/sinnfeinrebellio00dubl#page/22/mode/2up ''Sinn Fein Rebellion handbook, Easter, 1916.'' The Irish Times, 1917 (p. 22)]&lt;/ref&gt; In total, five members of the battalion were killed and seven wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/sinnfeinrebellio00dubl#page/58/mode/2up Irish Times (p.58)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disbandment==
The Volunteer Training Corps was suspended in December 1918, and officially disbanded in January 1920, with the exception of the Volunteer Motor Corps which was retained until April 1921 in case of civil disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, ''A Nation in Arms'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both [[science fiction themes|science fiction]] and [[utopian and dystopian fiction|utopia/dystopian fiction]], authors have made frequent use of the age-old idea of a global [[Sovereign state|state]] and, accordingly, of [[world government]].

==Overview==
In tune with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s vision of a world state based on the voluntary [[political union]] of all countries of this planet in order to avoid [[colonialism]] and in particular any future [[war]] ("Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbürgerlicher Absicht", 1784; "Zum ewigen Frieden", 1795), some of these scenarios depict an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[utopian]] world supervised (rather than controlled) by a benevolent (and usually [[democracy|democratic]]) world government. Others, however, describe the effects of a [[totalitarian]] regime which, after having seized power in one country, [[annexation|annexes]] the rest of the world in order to dominate and oppress all [[human|mankind]].

One major influence was Edward Bellamy's ''[[Looking Backward]]''.  The best-known advocate of world government was [[H. G. Wells]].  He describes such a system in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'', ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' and ''[[The World Set Free]]''.

Some writers have also parodied the idea: E. M. Forster's ''[[The Machine Stops]]'' (1909) and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]''.  Wells himself wrote ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'', an early vision of a dystopian world.

World government themes in science fiction are particularly prominent in the years following [[World War II]], coincident with the involvement of many scientists in the actual [[World Federalist Movement|political movement for world government]] in response to the perceived dangers of [[nuclear holocaust]].  Prominent examples from the [[Cold War]] era include ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953), ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' (1959), ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (from 1966), the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Enemy of the World]]'' (1968) and [[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]] (1968) Later references to a unified world government also appear however in post-Cold War science fiction television series such as ''[[Babylon 5]]''.

The concept also appears frequently in science fiction anime, whether in the form of a strengthened [[United Nations]] or an entirely new organizations with world [[presidential election]]. Examples of anime with this premise are ''[[Macross]]'' (adapted in America as the first part of [[Robotech]]) and ''[[Gundam]]''.

==President of Earth==
'''President of Earth''' (also known as '''President of the World''') is a [[fiction|fictional concept]] or character who is the leader of [[Earth|Planet Earth]]. Examples include the following:

* In [[DC Comics]], superhero [[Bart Allen]] had a presidential grandfather [[President Thawne]]; &lt;ref Name="Vibber"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kelson|last=Vibber|title=President Thawne|date=2004-11-15|url= http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/pres-thawne.html|accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invisible Kid (Jacques Foccart)|Jacques Foccart]], the second [[Invisible Kid]], went on to serve as President of Earth.
* A poem "The President of Earth" by Author [[David Kennedy (b1959)]] in a book with the same title,&lt;ref Name="Salt"&gt;{{cite web| title = David Kennedy; The President of Earth|work=Book Review|date=2007-11-03|url= http://www.saltpublishing.com/books/smp/1876857102.htm|accessdate=2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David|title=The President of Earth: New and Selected Poems|publisher=Salt Publishing|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZNoYhM7k5oC&amp;dq=%22president+of+earth%22+-wikipedia |isbn=1-876857-10-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A fictional character in a fictional universe in ''[[The Adventures of Captain Proton]]'' holoprogram on [[USS Voyager|USS ''Voyager'']]'s [[holodeck]]
* [[Gerry Anderson]]'s 1960s [[supermarionation]] puppet shows, via their ''[[TV Century 21]]'' comic and episodes of ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', featured a World President as head of a unified World Government.
* In the 1968 film ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', Barbarella is sent out by the President of Earth.
* In ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The New Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Lost and Found (The Twilight Zone)|Lost and Found]]" and the [[Phyllis Eisenstein]] 1978 short story of the same title upon which it was based, a woman named Jenny Templeton ([[Akosua Busia]]) will someday be elected the first president of Earth, presumably in the 21st century and will eventually be called "The Great Peacemaker".
* In ''[[Babylon 5: In the Beginning]]'', the president of Earth orders all available ships to form a line around the planet in a vain attempt to stave off the final Minbari obliteration of the human race. This, the Battle of the Line, is the final battle of the war.
* In ''[[Futurama]]'' (which is set in the 31st century), the position of President of Earth is held by [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's Head]],&lt;ref name="Drawn to TV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Booker|first=M. Keith|title=Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt; preceded by "Earth President McNeal".
* In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', several future timelines – most notably the 26th century's Earth Empire – have a President of Earth. In the first such story, ''Frontier in Space'', the President's world government is specifically based on the United States government. The Doctor himself is assigned President of Earth by the United Nations, with full control over the planet's armies, in the episode "[[Death in Heaven]]" – a role he resumes in "[[The Zygon Invasion]]" / "[[The Zygon Inversion]]" and later "[[The Pyramid at the End of the World]]".
* In [[Space Battleship Yamato 2202]], Earth is governed by the Earth Federation under the rule of a President, who is seen in Episode 2.
