The '''Alden Shoe Company''' is a [[shoe]] company founded in 1884 by Charles H. Alden in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/fashion/21SHOES.html |title=At Their Feet, Crafted by Hand |date=April 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alden specializes in handcrafted men's leather [[boots]] and [[dress shoes]], such as [[Oxford shoe|Oxfords]], [[blucher shoe|Blüchers]], [[loafers]], and [[Chukka boots]].

In the 19th century, there were once hundreds of [[Shoemaking|shoemakers]] in [[New England]], but now Alden is one of only a few factories. Alden is considered a heritage, family-owned brand.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes-life-magazine/2008/0915/104.html |title=All-American Team |date=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the company's roughly 100 workers at its factory in Middleborough are second or third generation,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and it sources its leathers mostly from small [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] in Europe and the U.S. &amp;ndash; its [[shell cordovan]] comes from the last such tannery in America, [[Horween Leather Company]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt; Alden has used Horween as their leather supplier since 1930, and is their largest cordovan customer.&lt;ref name="horween1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horween.com/about/a-brief-history/ |title=A Brief History « Horween Leather Company |publisher=Horween.com |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705053917/http://horween.com/about/a-brief-history/ |archivedate=July 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3479900049.html |title=Horween Leather Company |publisher= encyclopedia.com|date= |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicagotribune2003"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-10-27/business/0310270217_1_bob-clevenhagen-rawlings-glove |title=Horween's leather bound by tradition |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=October 27, 2003 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other brands of [[Americana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/01/30/authentic-americana.html |title=Authentic Americana |date=January 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alden has experienced something of a resurgence in 21st century [[men's fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=A Belt, a Brief, and a Man’s Heart Skips a Beat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/fashion/10CODES.html |date=September 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a [[Late-2000s recession|recession in the late-2000s]] and the relatively high prices of their products, Alden has grown again because of a renewed interest in more traditional men's shoes and boots, which can last decades.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; It is this reliance on high-end shoes, especially by those interested in [[business attire]], that has allowed the company to avoid going under despite the decline of American shoe manufacturing.

In popular culture, Alden model 405 boots (commonly referred to as the Alden "Indy" boot) were the shoe of choice for [[Harrison Ford]]'s [[Indiana Jones]] character in the film versions of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indygear.com/igboots.html |work=indygear.com |title=The Boots of Indiana Jones |accessdate=May 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company had created lines of goats to produce recombinant versions of either the MaSpI (Major ampullate spidroin I) or dragline I (for its superior elasticity, flexibility and strength) from ''[[Nephila clavipes]]'', the golden orb weaver) or MaSpII (Major ampullate spidroin 2 or dragline 2 from ''Nephila clavipes'') dragline proteins in their milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The purified silk proteins could be dried, dissolved using solvents (DOPE formation) and transformed into microfibers using wet-spinning fiber production methods. The spun fibers were reported to have [[Tenacity (textile strength)|tenacities]] in the range of 2 - 3 grams/denier and [[Elongation (materials science)|elongation range]] of 25-45%. The "Biosteel biopolymer" had been transformed into [[nanofibers]] and [[nanomesh]]es using the electrospinning technique.&lt;ref&gt;Thesis
Submitted to the Faculty of Drexel University by Milind Ramesh Gandhi, December 2006, CHAPTER 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nexia is the only company which has successfully produced fibres from spider silk expressed in goat's milk.  The Lewis lab has produced fibers from recombinant spider silk protein and synthetic spider silk proteins and [[Chimera (genetics)|genetic chimeras]] produced in both recombinant [[E. coli]] and the milk of recombinant goats, however, no one has been able to produce the silk in commercial quantities thus far. The company was founded in 1993 by Dr. Jeffrey Turner and Paul Ballard, and was sold in 2005 to Pharmathene.

In 2018, two transgenic goats were sold to the [[Canada Agriculture Museum]] after Nexia Biotechnologies went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Spider goats' display angers Ottawa professor|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2012/03/29/ottawa-spider-goats-display-at-agriculture-museum.html|date=Mar 29, 2012|publisher=CBC|work=Foxnews website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has since continued with the help of Randy Lewis, a professor formerly at the University of Wyoming and now at Utah State University. He was also able to successfully breed monkey goats in order to create artificial silk. There are now about 30 spider goats at a university-run farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boatman|first=Liz|title=Bridges made of spider silk? You can thank goats for that.|url=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/bridges-made-of-spider-silk-you-can-thank-the-goats-for-that/|publisher=Berkeley Science Review|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications of artificial spider silk biopolymers include using it for the coating of all kinds of implants and medical products as well as for artificial ligaments and tendons due to its elastic tendencies and also since it is a natural product which will synthesize well with the body. Furthermore, artificial silk biopolymers can be applicated in personal care products as well as in textile products.

The '''Centro de Educación Artística''' (CEA) is an [[Drama school|entertainment educational institution]] in [[Mexico]] run by that country's major [[media conglomerate]], [[Televisa]]. Located at the company's facilities in the [[San Ángel]] neighborhood of [[Mexico City]], the school was founded September 26, 1978 and is an incubator for talent working for the network's famed [[telenovela]]s, dramas and comedies, along with the [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican film industry]] and beyond.

Applicants must be between 17 and 23 years of age, with a very selective process, as only 35 to 40 applicants out of around 5,000 per year are accepted to the three-year program. Tuition for the program is covered by Televisa, and consists of 45 hours per week of coursework and performances. A secondary program is available for younger actors, known as "CEA Infantil".

Often, when people think of the [[ragtime]] era, they think of the music that defined the generation, and although that is certainly a major factor, the era also helped to define a culture in [[clothing]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;An American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals, ca. 1490-1920 - Collection Connections - For Teachers (Library of Congress)." Library of Congress Home. N.p., n.d. Web. 3 December 2009. &lt;https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/connections/american-ballroom/thinking3.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clothing style and class==
Because the ragtime era began in the late 19th century and transitioned into the early 20th century (approximately 1897-1918),&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Edward. "Ragtime". ''The Grove Music Dictionary''. Oxford University Press. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22825?q=Ragtime&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit  Retrieved 2009-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; it also took place during what is known as "the turn of the century".{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}  This was also one of the first observations of class divisions.  The difference between upper class and lower class citizens could clearly be seen. Much of this had to do with their clothing and how they carried themselves in public. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3401293|title=The Riches of Ragtime|first=Patricia K.|last=Shehan|date=1 January 1986|publisher=|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=73|issue=3|pages=22–25|via=|doi=10.2307/3401293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper class==
The upper class could afford to dress well.  Women often appeared in long white [[gown]]s, which were in fashion at the time.  On these dresses were white collars and usually a [[brooch]] that kept the collar closed. Women often wore large white hats and carried [[parasol]]s as accessories.  [[Bustle]]s were commonplace for women as well. Men often wore light, form-fitting suits and wore [[bow tie]]s as accessories.  It was not rare to see men wearing [[Handlebar moustache|handlebar mustaches]].

==Lower class and immigrant population==
Whereas the upper class were put together and proper, and everything was crisp, clean, and uniformed, the [[immigrant]] population was quite the opposite.  This was the very beginning of immigrants being allowed to enter the United States via [[Ellis Island]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search." Ellis Island - FREE Port of New York Passenger Records Search . N.p., n.d. Web. 4 December 2009. &lt;http://www.ellisisland.org/genealogy/annie_moore.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were able to carry very little over to the New World, they had little clothing and little money to buy more when their clothes started to wear out.  They would therefore mismatch their clothing or reuse the fabric from an old article of clothing so that they could get multiple uses out of each garment.

== African American population==
Many [[African American]]s enjoyed the popular music from the ragtime era.  Their sense of style in clothing seemed to reflect this.  Whereas the mostly Caucasian American upper class dressed in clean and light colored fabric (often cream or white), the African Americans dressed in bright and vibrant clothing when they attended clubs that played ragtime music.  Whereas the upper class clothing was form-fitting, their clothes were loose, which allowed for free and easy movement.  Women often adorned their hair with colorful flowers as accessories, and men often wore vests and [[bowler hat]]s as their accessories.

[[Image:Collaborative E-democracy2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a collaborative e-democracy every citizen participates in the policy process, either indirectly, by delegating proxy representatives to vote on their behalf within the different policy domains, or directly, by voting on a particular issue (green arrows).]]

'''Collaborative e-democracy''' or '''super-democracy''' is a democratic conception that combines key features of [[direct democracy]], [[representative democracy]], and [[e-democracy]] (i.e. the use of [[Information and communication technology|ICTs]] for democratic processes). The concept was first published at two international academic conferences in 2009 (see below).

Collaborative e-democracy refers to a [[political system]] in which governmental stakeholders ([[politicians]]/[[political party|parties]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] etc.) and non-governmental stakeholders ([[NGO]]s, [[lobbying|political lobbies]], local communities, individual [[citizens]], etc.) collaborate on the development of public [[law]]s and [[policy|policies]]. This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental [[social networking site]] in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making).

While directly elected [[government officials]] (i.e. [[Liquid democracy#Delegated voting|‘proxy representatives’]]) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final [[voting]] power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable ([[initiative]]). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.

==Theoretical background==
Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components:
* '''‘Collaborative democracy’''', a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collaborative-democracy.com/cdDefinition.cfm www.collaborative-democracy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/cdn/ Collaborative Democracy Network], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''‘Collaborative e-policymaking’''' (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase [[Policy#Policy cycle|policy process]] in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] &lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. ], JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/ Collaborative Policy], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian National University, ANU E Press; [http://epress.anu.edu.au/anzsog/collab_gov/mobile_devices/index.html Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia?]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Proxy voting]] and [[delegative democracy]]''': Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.&lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556176.1556222 "Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making."], [http://www.dgrc.org/ Digital Government Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy process==
Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws &amp; policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; [[domain expert]]s; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives).

* '''Suggestion &amp; ranking phase''': Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy [[crowdsourcing]]). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others.
* '''Evaluation phase''': For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts.
* '''Voting phase''': Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed.
* '''Revision phase''': A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved.
To be clear, CPM is automated as a [[Process (computing)|software process]] that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.

==Principles==
Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles:
* '''[[Self-government]]''', the ideal of direct democracy, and “''quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur''”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “''that which affects all people must be approved by all people''”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies ([[Corporatocracy]]).
* '''[[Open source governance]]''', a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open source]] and [[open content]] movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy.
* '''Aggregation''': One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad-hoc groups to address these issues.
* '''[[Collaboration]]''': Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other.
* '''[[Collective intelligence]]''': The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of [[Web 2.0]].
* '''Collective learning &amp; Adoption''': The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oreilly.com/catalog/web2report/chapter/web20_report_excerpt.pdf O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits &amp; limitations==
The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following '''benefits''':
* '''[[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] and accessibility''': The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet.
* '''[[Political efficacy]]''': Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the [[democratic deficit]].
* '''[[Deliberative democracy|Deliberation]]''': The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information &amp; communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation.
* '''Collective awareness''': Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation’s collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies.

On the contrary the concept has several '''limitations''':
* '''[[Constitution]]al limits''': Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective.
* '''[[Digital divide]]''': People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded.
* '''[[Majority rule]]''': Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy.
* '''[[Naive]]ty''':  Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options.  This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will.  However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem.  Increased education, [[critical thinking]] and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.

==Research &amp; development==
In 2009 the two conceptions, ''collaborative e-democracy'' and ''collaborative e-policy-making'', were  first published at two [[academic conference]]s on [[e-governance]] and [[e-democracy]]:
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making”''; the [http://dgo2009.pbworks.com/ 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: "Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data &amp; Government"] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]];
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”'';  [http://edem2009.ocg.at/ The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* A third publication appears in the [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government", Vol 2, No 1 (2010)].

Current research is conducted at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] where a [[Prototype#Computer programming.2Fcomputer science|prototype]] software for  collaborative e-policymaking is being developed. The software will be featured on an independent web 2.0 platform with open participation; the volunteer participants will be facilitated to collaboratively develop Australian public laws and policies by proceeding through the phases of the CPM process. The start of the trialling period is probably 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/klaus/ QUT Urban Informatics Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cow blowing was the reason why [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] abjured cow milk, saying that "since I had come to know that the cow and the buffalo were subjected to the process of phooka, I had conceived a strong disgust for milk."&lt;ref name="Bapu"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Mohandas K.|title=The Story of My Experiments with Truth|year=1927|pages=part 5, chapter XXIX |url=https://archive.org/stream/AnAutobiographyOrTheStoryOfMyExperimentsWithTruth/autobiography#page/n241/mode/2up/search/phooka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diane Tuft''' (born 1947)&lt;ref name="fortyover"&gt;[http://fortyover40.com/2015-honorees/diane-tuft/ "Diane Tuft,"] Forty Over 40, January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is an American photographer focusing on nature and landscape photography, documenting the effects of the environment on the Earth's landscape. She is based in [[New York City]].

==Early life and education==
Tuft was born and raised in [[East Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="msegal"&gt;Mark Segal, [http://easthamptonstar.com/Lead-c/2017427/Diane-Tuft-Capturing-Moments-Without-Spectral-Boundaries "Diane Tuft: Capturing Moments Without Spectral Boundaries,"] ''[[The East Hampton Star]]'', April 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Connecticut]] with a degree in mathematics.&lt;ref name="wjohnson"&gt;Whitney Johnson, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/whitneyjohnson/2017/02/02/this-activist-uses-her-camera-to-show-us-the-inconvenient-truth/#4311fa0f6925 "This Activist Uses Her Camera To Show Us The Inconvenient Truth,"] ''[[Forbes]]'', February 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, she moved to New York City to work as an actuarial assistant. She later held jobs with the [[Burroughs Corporation]] and Computer Design Corporation.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt; During this time, she studied photography at [[The New School]] and the [[International Center of Photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rauschenberggallery.com/2013/11/2006-exhibition-archives/ "Strictly Black and White,"] Rauschenberg Gallery, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuft married in 1971 and while raising a family studied art at [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn from 1981 to 1989.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wjohnson"/&gt;

==Career==
===''Unseen'' and other work (1998-2011)===
Tuft began her work in 1998 with images of snow and ice in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. There she first experimented with [[infrared film]], where the photos could capture the infrared light waves that were reflected and refracted on the landscape, which are beyond the human visible spectrum. These photographs would become [[platinum prints]], and resulted in her first solo exhibition, ''Distillations'', at [[Hollis Taggart Galleries]] in New York City in 1999.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt; She continued to photograph outside the visible spectrum, focusing on the visual effects of [[ultraviolet light]] waves on the Earth's landscape. Tuft began traveling to ozone-depleted areas where larger amounts of ultraviolet light reach the Earth. This led to an interest in climate change and other environmental issues.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj2017"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/video/photographer-illustrates-a-disappearing-landscape/57E22AC8-860E-4B0D-B69A-DFB31A11ADD3.html "Photographer Illustrates a 'Disappearing Landscape',"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', April 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She began photographing the [[Arctic]] landscape in 2001,&lt;ref name="wsj2017"/&gt; and has said that an aim of her work is to demonstrate the realities of global warming and its effect on the Earth.&lt;ref name="dfoxley"&gt;David Foxley, [https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/10-hauntingly-beautiful-views-of-the-arctic-melting "10 Hauntingly Beautiful Views of the Arctic Melting,"] ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', March 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She often documents icy landscapes through [[aerial photography]]&lt;ref name="wsj2017"/&gt; in order to capture "the sculptural qualities of frozen water."&lt;ref name="mmiller"&gt;Meg Miller, [https://www.fastcodesign.com/90124944/stunning-photos-capture-an-icy-landscape-thats-rapidly-disappearing "Stunning Photos Capture An Icy Landscape That’s Rapidly Disappearing,"] ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'', May 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; She typically zooms in to the landscape to the point of abstraction, framing shots without a sense of scale.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Beans, [http://www.pnas.org/content/114/34/8897.full "Science and Culture: Arctic photographers bring climate change into focus,"] ''PNAS'', vol. 114, no. 34, August 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Tuft published her first [[monograph]], ''Unseen: Beyond the Visible Spectrum'', a retrospective of her photographs between the years 1998 and 2007, featuring the [[American West]], [[Nepal]], [[North Africa]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. The foreword was written by William Fox, director of the Center for Art and Environment at the [[Nevada Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jgaddy"&gt;James Gaddy, [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2017-06-01/stunning-photos-of-the-arctic-circle-s-melting-ice-terrain "Stunning Photos of the Arctic Circle As It Literally Melts Away,"] ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'', June 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Tuft created a room-size installation, ''Internal Reflection'', which combined sculpture, light, sound and photography. It was exhibited at the [[Katonah Museum of Art]] in New York City and at Art LA in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/diane-tuft Diane Tuft bio,] ''[[Huffington Post]]''. Accessed December 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Her 2008 series ''Salt Lake Reconsidered'', exhibited at Ameringer &amp; Yohe Fine Art in New York City and the Kimball Art Center in [[Park City, Utah]], featured aerial photographs of the [[Great Salt Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Maffly, [http://media.virbcdn.com/files/1c/723be472315cfc07-salt-lake-tribune.pdf "Great Salt Lake's hidden palette,"] ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'', January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuft's photographic series ''Icelandic Glaciers'' in 2001 and ''Icelandic Sagas'' in 2008 document the change of Iceland's glaciers due to climate change.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt; In 2010, Tuft revisited Iceland, creating her series ''Aftermath'', a collection of aerial photographs of the center of Iceland and [[Eyjafjallajökull]]'s eruption.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Shuster, [https://www.villagevoice.com/2012/04/11/allan-stones-world-in-a-box-cornells-buddies/ "Allan Stone's 'World in a Box': Cornell's Buddies,"] ''[[Village Voice]]'', April 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Gondwana'' (2012-14)===
Tuft received a 2012 [[National Science Foundation]] grant to explore the visual effects of ozone depletion on Antarctica's landscape.&lt;ref name="cnakano"&gt;Craig Nakano, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-ca-gondwana-antarctica-diane-tuft-20140713-story.html "'Gondwana' reveals the stunning beauty, mystery of Antarctica,"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', July 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, she traveled to Antarctica, living at [[McMurdo Station]] for six weeks.&lt;ref name="msegal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sclemence"&gt;Sara Clemence, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/lake-kora-upgrade-and-gondwana-book-released-1389977155?tesla=y "Lake Kora Upgrade and Gondwana Book Released,"] ''Wall Street Journal'', January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting images collected in her 2014 book ''Gondwana: Images of an Ancient Land'' focused on the effects that the harsh environment of Antarctica had on shaping its landscape. These images include the [[meromictic lakes]] in the dry valleys of Antarctica, where millions of years of gasses have been trapped in the ice, volcanic gas formations, [[glacial striations]] that record millions of years of snow accumulation, and [[ventifacts]] formed by ongoing intense winds.&lt;ref name="cnakano"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sclemence"/&gt; The book's foreword was written by [[Elisabeth Sussman]], curator of photography at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura van Straaten, [https://www.whitewall.art/art/diane-tuft-abstractions-of-antarctica "Diane Tuft: Abstractions of Antarctica,"] ''Whitewall'', March 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Arctic Melt'' (2015-present)===
During the summers of 2015 and 2016, Tuft explored the [[Arctic]] to document the severe melt that was occurring throughout the region. Her journey included the mountain glaciers and surrounding waters of [[Svalbard, Norway]], the sea ice in the [[Arctic Ocean]] including the [[North Pole]], and the icebergs and ice sheet of [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="mmiller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bcudzilo"&gt;Brian Cudzilo, [http://www.danspapers.com/2017/06/artist-diane-tufts-the-arctic-melt-explores-climate-crisis/ "Artist Diane Tuft's 'The Arctic Melt' Explores Climate Crisis,"] ''[[Dan's Papers]]'', June 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John D. Sutter, [http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/03/opinion/arctic-melt-cnnphotos/ "Before it's too late,"] [[CNN]], March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asneed"&gt;Annie Sneed, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ominous-beauty-of-the-arctic-meltdown/ "The Ominous Beauty of the Arctic Meltdown,"] ''[[Scientific American]]'', May 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuft's series, ''The Arctic Melt: Images of a Disappearing Landscape'', has resulted in several exhibitions worldwide, as well as a three-minute film and book. Climate scientist [[Joe Romm]] wrote the book's introduction.&lt;ref name="dfoxley"/&gt; The film was presented on [[Earth Day]] at the [[March for Science]] at the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="bcudzilo"/&gt; and ''The Arctic Melt'' exhibition at [[Marlborough Gallery]] was nominated for a Global Fine Art Award in the Global Planet category in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalfineartawards.org/wp/index.php/2017-award-nominees/ "Congratulations to the 2017 Global Fine Art Award Nominees!"] Global Fine Art Awards, October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epigenetic theories of homosexuality''' concern the studies of changes in [[gene expression]] or cellular [[phenotype]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying [[DNA sequence]], and their role in the development of [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice WR, Friberg U, Gavrilets S. 2013. Homosexuality via canalized sexual development: A testing protocol for a new epigenetic model. BioEssays 35: 343-368 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Rice W. R., Friberg U., and Gavrilets S. 2016. Sexually antagonistic epigenetic marks that canalize sexually dimorphic development. Molecular Ecology 12: DOI: 10.1111/mec.13490 &lt;/ref&gt;
[[Epigenetics]] examines the set of chemical reactions that switch parts of the [[genome]] on and off at strategic times and locations in the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. However, epigenetic theories tangle a multiplicity of initiating causes and of resulting final effects and will never lead to a single cause or a single result. Hence, any interpretation of such theories may not focus just one isolated reason of a multiplicity of causes or of effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/de/evolution/ausbildungskonzepte.html Ausbildungskonzept "Integrated approaches to teach and study the role of evolution for the emergence of biological complexity"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of affecting the organism's DNA sequence, non-genetic factors may cause the organism’s genes to express themselves differently. DNA in the human body is wrapped around [[histone]]s, which are [[protein]]s that package and order DNA into structural units. DNA and histone are covered with [[chemical tag]]s known as the [[epigenome]], which shapes the physical structure of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/ "The Epigenome at a Glance."] Genetic Science Learning Center. The University of Utah, 2013. Web. 10 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It tightly wraps inactive genes on the DNA sequence making those genes unreadable while loosely wrapping active genes making them more expressive. The more tightly wrapped the gene, the less it will be expressed in the organism. These epigenetic tags react to stimuli presented from the outside world. It adjusts specific genes in the genome to respond to humans' rapidly changing environments. 
The idea of epigenetics and gene expression has been a theory applied to the origins of homosexuality in humans. One team of researchers examined the effects of [[epi-mark]]s buffering [[XY sex-determination system|XX]] [[fetus]]es and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] fetuses from certain [[androgen]] exposure and used published data on fetal androgen signaling and [[gene regulation]] through non-genetic changes in DNA packaging to develop a new model for homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, Sabrina. [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33773/title/Can-Epigenetics-Explain-Homosexuality-/ "Can Epigenetics Explain Homosexuality?."] The Scientist. N.p., 1 Jan. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers found that stronger than average epi-marks, epigenomes that are wrapped tightly around the DNA sequence, convert [[sexual preference]] in individuals without altering [[genitalia]] or [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;"National Geographic Explains the Biology of Homosexuality." YouTube. YouTube, 04 Feb. 2009. Web. 13 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
This research gives support to the [[hypothesis]] that homosexuality stems from the under expression of certain genes on the DNA sequence involved with sexual preferences. This theory as well as other concepts involved with epi-marks, [[twin studies]], and fetal androgen signaling will be explored here.

== Epigenetic marks ==
{{details|Epigenetics}}

Epigenetic marks (epi-marks) are temporary "switches" that control how our genes are expressed during [[gestation]] and after birth. Moreover, epi-marks  are modifications of histone proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Ruthenburg, A., C. Allis, and J. Wysocka. "Methylation of Lysine 4 on Histone H3: Intricacy of Writing and Reading a Single Epigenetic Mark." Molecular Cell 25.1 (2007): 15-30. Print. {{pmid|17218268}} {{doi|10.1016/j.molcel.2006.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks are modifications of the [[methyl]] and [[acetyl]] groups that bind to DNA histones thereby changing how the proteins function and as a result, alter gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka E and MJ Lamb (2010). Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In: M Pigliucci and GB Müller Evolution, the expanded synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; Epi-marks change how the histones function and as a result, influence the way genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="Friberg"&gt;William R. Rice, Friberg, Urban and Sergey Gavrilets. "Homosexuality as a Consequence of Epigenetically Canalized Sexual Development." The Quarterly Review of Biology 87.4 (2012): n. pag. Print. {{pmid|23397798}} {{doi|10.1086/668167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetic marks promote normal [[sexual development]] during [[fetal development]]. However, they can be passed on to [[offspring]] through the process of [[mitosis]]. When they are transferred from one parent to an offspring of the opposite sex, it can contribute to an altered sexual development, thus leading to [[masculinization]] of female offspring and [[feminization (biology)|feminization]] of male offspring.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/25431-gene-regulation-homosexuality.html "Gene Regulation May Explain How Homosexuality Flourishes."] LiveScience.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these epi-marks hold no consistency between individuals in regard to strength and variability.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

== Twin studies ==

[[Identical twin]]s have identical DNA, which leads to the perceived conclusion that all identical twins are either [[heterosexual]] or homosexual. However, it is evident that this is not the case, consequently leaving a gap in the explanation for homosexuality. A "gay" gene does not produce homosexuality. Rather, epigenetic modifications act as temporary "switches" that regulate how the genes are expressed.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt; Of the pairs of identical twins in which one twin is homosexual, only twenty percent of the other twins are homosexual, which leads to the hypothesis that even though identical twins share the same DNA, homosexuality is created by something else rather than the genes. Epigenetic transformation allows the on and off switching of certain genes, subsequently shaping how cells respond to androgen signaling, which is critical in sexual development.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;
Another example of epigenetic consequences is evident in [[multiple sclerosis]] in [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins. There are pairs of twins that are discordant with multiple sclerosis and do not both show the trait. After [[gene testing]], it was suggested that DNA was identical and that epigenetic differences contributed to the gene difference between identical twins.&lt;ref&gt;Handunnetthi, Lahiru, Adam Handel, and Sreeram V. Ramagopalan. Contribution of Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Differences to Twin Discordance in Multiple Sclerosis. Ebsco Host. Psyc Info, 2010. Web. {{pmid|20819009}} {{doi|10.1586/ern.10.116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of fetal androgen exposure ==

While in the fetal stages, hormonal influences of [[androgen]], specifically [[testosterone]], cause feminine qualities in regard to sexual development in females and masculine qualities in males. In typical sexual development, females are exposed to minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed to high levels of testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks play a critical role in this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, Charles, Gerard S. Conway, and Melissa Hines. "Androgen and Psychosexual Development: Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Recalled Childhood Gender Role Behavior in Women and Men with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)." Journal of Sex Research 41.1 (2004): 75-81. Online {{pmid|15216426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heritability ==

New epi-marks are usually produced with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between [[generation]]s. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex from the natural disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect sexual preference. However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization can lead to a reversed sexual preference. For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high [[testosterone]], and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks are normally erased and not passed between generations. However, they can sometimes escape erasure and are then transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. When this happens, this may lead to an altered sexual preference.&lt;ref name="Friberg"/&gt; Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that [[gene coding]] for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to same-sex sexual preference in offspring.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The '''flag of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Dannebrog}}, {{IPA-da|ˈdanəˌbʁoˀ|pron}})&lt;ref&gt;The word ''Dannebrog'' is recorded since the 16th century, and in the opinion of A.D. Jørgensen ("Om Danebroges Oprindelse",  ''Historiske Afhandlinger'' 2, 1899) the word may be of medieval coinage.
Old Danish ''brog'' continues Old Norse ''[[:wikt:brók|brók]]'' "piece of cloth; breeches, trousers"; the word is not now current in Danish outside of composition,   the ''[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=brog Ordbog over det danske Sprog ]'' (1920 edition) listed it as "dated or poetic" (''foræld. og poet.'') for "trousers".&lt;/ref&gt; is red with a white [[Nordic Cross Flag|Scandinavian cross]] that extends to the edges of the [[flag]]; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side.

A banner with a white-on-red cross is attested as having been used by the [[kings of Denmark]] since the 14th century.&lt;ref name=bjerg&gt;"Dannebrog" by Hans Christian Bjerg, p.12, {{ISBN|87-7739-906-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
An origin legend with considerable impact on Danish national historiography connects the introduction of the flag to the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] of 1219.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_GfdBAASUQC&amp;pg=PA27 |author=Andrew Evans|title=Iceland|publisher=Bradt|quote=Legend states that a red cloth with the white cross simply fell from the sky in the middle of the 13th-century Battle of Valdemar, after which the Danes were victorious. As a badge of divine right, Denmark flew its cross in the other Scandinavian countries it ruled and as each nation gained independence, they incorporated the Christian symbol.|accessdate=2007-12-31}}
Inge Adriansen, ''Nationale symboler'', Museum Tusculanum Press, 2003, p. 129: "Fra begyndelsen af 1400-tallet kan Dannebrog med sikkerhed dokumenteres som rigsflag, det vil sige statsmagtens og kongens flag" (English: "Dannebrog can with certainty be documented as flag of the [[Reich|realm]], that is the flag of the authority of state and of the king, from the beginning of the 1400s")&lt;/ref&gt; 
The elongated [[Nordic cross]] reflects the use as maritime flag in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;The medieval flags displaying crosses can be traced to the [[crusade]]s and were later used as representing saints (as in the [[St George's Flag]]), the cross representing [[Christianity]]
{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&amp;pg=PA88 |author=Jeroen Temperman|title=State Religion Relationships and Human Rights Law|publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]]|quote=Many predominantly Christian states show a cross, symbolising Christianity, on their national flag. Scandinavian crosses or Nordic crosses on the flags of the Nordic countries–Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden–also represent Christianity.|accessdate=2007-12-31}}.
The elongated cross design was subsequently adopted by other [[Nordic countries]]: [[Flag of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Flag of Norway|Norway]], [[Flag of Finland|Finland]], [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]], and the [[Flag of the Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]], as well as the [[United Kingdom|British]] archipelagos of [[Flag of Shetland|Shetland]] and [[Flag of Orkney|Orkney]].&lt;/ref&gt;
The flag became popular as [[national flag]] in the early 19th century. Its private use was outlawed in 1834, and again permitted in a regulation of 1854. The flag holds the [[world record]] of being the oldest continuously used national flag.&lt;ref name="world-record"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-continuously-used-national-flag/ | title=Oldest continuously used national flag | work=Guinness World Records | accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A red field charged with a white cross extending to the edges; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side. 
In 1748, a regulation defined the correct lengths of the two last fields in the flag as {{frac|6|4}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=59171 |title=Forordning om Coffardi-Skibes og Commis-Farernes samt de octrojerede Compagniers Skibes Flag og Giøs, samt Vimpeler og Fløie af 11. juli 1748 |access-date= 21 August 2016 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 1893 a new regulation to all chiefs of police, stated that the police should not intervene, if the two last fields in the flag were longer than {{frac|6|4}} as long as these did not exceed {{frac|7|4}}, and provided that this was the only rule violated.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
This regulation is still in effect today and thus the legal proportions of the National flag is today 3:1:3 in width and anywhere between 3:1:4.5 and 3:1:5.25 in length.

No official nuance definition of "Dannebrog rød" exists. The private company ''Dansk Standard'', regulation number 359 (2005), defines the red colour of the flag as [[Pantone]] 186c.

== History ==

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Gelre Folio 55v.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Gelre Armorial]] (fol. 55v), the entry for the king of Denmark showing the white-on-red cross banner.]]
The white-on-red cross emblem originates in the age of the [[Crusade]]s. In the 12th century, it was also used as [[Reichssturmfahne|war flag]] by the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

In the ''[[Gelre Armorial]]'', dated {{circa}} 1340–1370, such a banner is shown alongside the [[coat of arms of Denmark|coat of arms]] of the [[king of Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flaggenlexikon.de/fdaen.htm |title=National Flagge des Königreich Dänemark|accessdate=2005-02-14 |author=Volker Preuß|coauthors= |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''The King of Denmark''). This is the earliest known undisputed colour rendering of the Dannebrog.
At about the same time, [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]] displays a cross in his coat of arms on his ''Danælog'' seal (''Rettertingsseglet'', dated 1356).
The image from the Armorial Gelre is nearly identical to an image found in a 15th-century coats of arms book now located in the [[National Archives of Sweden]], (''Riksarkivet'')
The seal of [[Eric of Pomerania]] (1398) as king of the [[Kalmar union]] displays the arms of Denmark chief dexter, three lions. In this version, the lions are holding a Dannebrog banner.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The reason why the kings of Denmark in the 14th century begin displaying the cross banner in their coats of arms is unknown. 
[[Caspar Paludan-Müller]] (1873) suggested that it may reflect a banner sent by the pope to the Danish king in support of the [[Baltic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;
Caspar Paludan-Müller ''Sagnet om den himmelfaldne Danebrogsfane'' (1873)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen]] (1875) identifies the banner as [[Flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|that of the Knights Hospitaller]], which order had a presence in Denmark from the later 12th century.&lt;ref name="Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen 1875"&gt;Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen, ''Danebroges Oprindelse'' (1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several coins, seals and images exist, both foreign and domestic, from the 13th to 15th centuries and even earlier, showing heraldic designs similar to Dannebrog, alongside the [[Coat of Arms of Denmark|royal coat of arms]] (three blue lions on a golden shield.)

===Early military banners===
[[File:Saxo Chr P front version 002.png|thumb|upright|The Danish flag from the front page of [[Christiern Pedersen]]’s version of [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]’s [[Gesta Danorum]], 1514 (see [[:File:Saxo Chr P front version 001.jpg|here]] for a larger version).]]
[[File:Hans Kniepers 1585.jpg|thumb|upright|One of [[Hans Knieper]]’s heroic tapestries of Danish kings from 1585. King [[Eric VI of Denmark|Erik Menved]] storming a castle. Note the two Danish flags. Original located at [[Kronborg]] Castle.]]

There is a record suggesting that the Danish army had a "chief banner" (''hoffuitbanner'') in the early 16th century.
Such a banner is mentioned in 1570 by [[Niels Hemmingsøn]] in the context of a 1520 battle between Danes and Swedes near Uppsala as nearly captured by the Swedes but saved by the heroic actions of the banner-carrier [[Mogens Gyldenstierne]] and [[Peder Skram]].
The legend attributing the [[#Origin_legend|miraculous origin]] of the flag to the campaigns of [[Valdemar II of Denmark]] (r. 1202&amp;ndash;1241)  were recorded by [[Christiern Pedersen]] and [[Petrus Olai]]  in the 1520s.

[[Hans Svaning]]'s ''History of King Hans'' from 1558–1559 and [[Johan Rantzau]]'s ''History about the Last [[Dithmarschen]] War'', from 1569, record the further fate of the Danish ''hoffuitbanner'':
According to this tradition, the original flag from the Battle of Lindanise was used in the small campaign of 1500 when [[Hans of Denmark|King Hans]] tried to conquer [[Dithmarschen]] (in western [[Holstein]] in north [[Germany]]). The flag was lost in a devastating defeat at the [[Battle of Hemmingstedt]] on 17 February 1500. 
In 1559, King [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederik II]] recaptured it during his own [[Dithmarschen]] campaign.
In 1576, the son of ''Johan Rantzau'', [[Henrik Rantzau]], also writes about the war and the fate of the flag. He notes that the flag was in a poor condition when returned. 
Contemporary records describing the battle of Hemmingstedt make no reference to the loss of the original Dannebrog, although the capitulation state that all Danish banners lost in 1500 were to be returned.
In a letter dated 22 February 1500 to [[Oluf Stigsøn]], King John describes the battle, but does not mention the loss of an important flag. In fact, the entire letter gives the impression that the lost battle was of limited importance.
In 1598, [[Neocorus]] wrote that the banner captured in 1500 was brought to the church in [[Wöhrden]] and hung there for the next 59 years, until it was returned to the Danes as part of the peace settlement in 1559.
[[Henrik Rantzau]] in 1576 records that the flag after its return to Denmark was placed in the cathedral in [[City of Schleswig|Slesvig]]. Slesvig historian [[Ulrik Petersen]] (1656–1735) confirms the presence of such a banner in the cathedral in the early 17th century, and records that it had crumbled away by about 1660.

=== Maritime flags ===
The size and shape of the [[civil ensign]] ("''Koffardiflaget''") for merchant ships is given in the regulation of 11 June 1748, which says: ''A red flag with a white cross with no split end. The white cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form and the two outer fields must be {{frac|6|4}} lengths of those''.
The proportions are thus: 3:1:3 vertically and 3:1:4.5 horizontally. This definition are the absolute proportions for the Danish national flag to this day, for both the civil version of the flag ("''Stutflaget''"), as well as the merchant flag ("''Handelsflaget''"). Both flags are identical.

A regulation passed in 1758 required Danish ships sailing in the [[Mediterranean]] to carry the 
[[royal cypher]] in the center of the flag in order to distinguish them from Maltese ships, due to the similarity of the [[flag of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].

According to the regulation of 11 June 1748 the colour was simply red, which is common known today as "Dannebrog rød" ("''Dannebrog red''"). The only available red fabric dye in 1748 was made of [[Rubia|madder root]], which can be processed to produce a brilliant red dye (used historically for British soldiers' jackets). 
A regulation of 4 May 1927 once again states that Danish merchant ships have to fly flags according to the regulation of 1748.

The first regulation regarding the ''Splitflag'' dates from 27 March 1630, in which King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] orders that Norwegian ''Defensionskibe'' (armed merchants ships) may only use the ''Splitflag'' if they are in Danish war service.
In 1685 an order, distributed to a number of cities in [[Duchy of Schleswig|Slesvig]], states that all ships must carry the Danish flag, and in 1690 all merchant ships are forbidden to use the ''Splitflag'', with the exception of ships sailing in the [[East Indies]], [[West Indies]] and along the coast of [[Africa]].
In 1741 it is confirmed that the regulation of 1690 is still very much in effect; that merchant ships may not use the ''Splitflag''. At the same time the [[Danish East India Company]] is allowed to fly the ''Splitflag'' when past the [[equator]].

Some confusion must have existed regarding the ''Splitflag''. In 1696 the Admiralty presented the King with a proposal for a standard regulating both size and shape of the ''Splitflag''. In the same year a royal resolution defines the proportions of the ''Splitflag'', which in this resolution is called ''Kongeflaget'' (the King's flag), as follows: ''The cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flags height. The two first fields must be square in form with the sides three times the cross width. The two outer fields are rectangular and {{Frac|1|1|2}} the length of the square fields. The tails are the length of the flag''.

These numbers are the basic for the ''Splitflag'', or ''Orlogsflag'', today, though the numbers have been slightly altered. The term ''Orlogsflag'' dates from 1806 and denotes use in the Danish Navy.

From about 1750 to early 19th century a number of ships and companies which the government has interests in, received approval to use the ''Splitflag''.

In the royal resolution of 25 October 1939 for the Danish Navy, it is stated that the ''Orlogsflag'' is a ''Splitflag'' with a deep red ("''dybrød''") or madder red ("''kraprød''") colour. Like the National flag, no nuance is given, but in modern days this is given as 195U.
Furthermore, the size and shape is corrected in this resolution to be: "The cross must be {{frac|7}} of the flag's height. The two first fields must be square in form with the height of {{Frac|3|7}} of the flag's height. The two outer fields are rectangular and {{frac|5|4}} the length of the square fields. The tails are {{frac|6|4}} the length of the rectangular fields".
Thus, if compared to the standard of 1696, both the rectangular fields and the tails have decreased in size.

===National flag===
[[File:Tropper 1849.jpg|thumb|300px|Danish soldiers return to Copenhagen after the [[Battle of Fredericia]] (1849), a Danish victory against German insurgents in [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] and [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]] in the [[First Schleswig War]] (1894 painting by [[Otto Bache]])]]
Used as maritime flag since the 16th century, the Dannebrog was introduced as regimental flag in the Danish army in 1785, and
for the militia (landeværn) in 1801. From 1842, it was used as the flag of the entire army.&lt;ref name=Achen108&gt;Sven Tito Achen, '' Heraldikkens femten glæder'' (1978), p. 108f.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to the development of [[Romantic nationalism]] in other European countries, the military flag increasingly came to be seen as representing the nation itself during the first half of the 19th century. Poems of this period invoking the ''Dannebrog'' were written by B.S. Ingemann, N.F.S. Grundtvig, Oehlenschläger, Chr. Winther and H.C. Andersen.&lt;ref name=Achen108/&gt;
By the 1830s, the military flag had become so popular as unofficial national flag, and its use by private citizens was outlawed in a circular enacted on 7 January 1834. In the national enthusiasm sparked by the [[First Schleswig War]] during 1848&amp;ndash;1850, the flag was still very widely displayed, and the prohibition of private use was again repealed in a regulation of 7 July 1854, for the first time allowing Danish citizens to display the Dannebrog (but not the swallow-tailed ''Splitflag'' variant).&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=58409 Cirkulærer om ophævelse af forbuddet mod flagning i kanceli cirkulære af 7. januar 1834]'' (retsinformation.dk)&lt;/ref&gt;
Special permission to use the ''Splitflag'' was given to individual institutions and private companies, especially after 1870.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
On 10 April 1915, the hoisting of any ''other'' flag on Danish soil was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;''International Law Studies'', Naval War College (U.S.),  1918, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=trmPvyYVRhgC&amp;pg=PA83 p. 83].&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1886, the war ministry introduced a regulation indicating that the flag should be flown from military buildings on thirteen specified days, including royal birthdays, the date of the signing of the Constitution of 5 June 1849 and on days of remembrance for military battles. 
In 1913, the naval ministry issued its own list of flag days. From 1939, the yearbook ''Hvem-Hvad-Hvor'' included a list of flag days.

A tradition recorded in the 16th century traces the origin of the flag to the campaigns of 
[[Valdemar II of Denmark]] (r. 1202&amp;ndash;1241).
The oldest of them is in [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s "''Danske Krønike''", which is a sequel to [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]’s [[Gesta Danorum]], written 1520–23. Here, the flag falls from the sky during a Russian campaign of Valdemar's. Pedersen also states that the very same flag was taken into exile by [[Eric of Pomerania]] in 1440.

The second source is the writing of the Franciscan monk [[Petrus Olai]] (Peder Olsen) of [[Roskilde]] (died c. 1570).  This record describes a battle in 1208 near a place called "''Felin''" during the [[Baltic crusades|Estonia campaign]] of King Valdemar II. The Danes were all but defeated when a lamb-skin banner depicting a white cross fell from the sky and miraculously led to a Danish victory. 
In a third account, also by Petrus Olai{{dubious|date=July 2016}}, in ''Danmarks Tolv Herligheder'' ("Twelve Splendours of Denmark"), in splendour number nine, the same story is re-told almost verbatim, with a paragraph inserted correcting the year to 1219.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--the existence of such a work cannot be substantiated except for mentions in passing in exactly this context (Dannebrog). Also, if it exists, it isn't clear that "Peder Olsen" is the same Peder as the Petrus Olai of Roskild--&gt;
Now, the flag is falling from the sky in the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], also known as the Battle of Valdemar (Danish: ''Volmerslaget''), near [[Lindanise]] (Tallinn) in [[Estonia]], of 15 June 1219.

It is this third account that has been the most influential, and some historians{{Who|date=April 2010}}  have treated it as the primary account taken from a (lost) source dating to the first half of the 15th century.

In Olai's account, the battle was going badly, and defeat seemed imminent. However the Danish Bishop [[Anders Sunesen]] on top of a hill overlooking the battle prayed to God with his arms raised, which meant that the Danes moved closer to victory the more he prayed. When he raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall, the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At a second he was so tired in his arms that he dropped them and the Danes then lost the advantage and were moving closer to defeat. He needed two soldiers to keep his hands up and when the Danes were about to lose, 'Dannebrog' miraculously fell from the sky and the King took it, showed it to the troops and their hearts were filled with courage and the Danes won the battle.

The possible historical nucleus behind this origin legend was extensively discussed by Danish historians in the 19th to 20th centuries.
Jørgensen (1875) argues that [[Theoderich, Bishop of Estonia|Bishop Theoderich]]  was the original instigator of the 1218 inquiry from Bishop [[Albert of Buxhoeveden]] to King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] which led to the Danish participation in the Baltic crusades.
Jørgensen speculates that Bishop Theoderich might have carried the Knight Hospitaller's banner in the 1219 battle and that "the enemy thought this was the King's symbol and mistakenly stormed Bishop Theoderich tent. He claims that the origin of the legend of the falling flag comes from this confusion in the battle."&lt;ref name="Adolf Ditlev Jørgensen 1875"/&gt; 
The Danish church-historian L. P. Fabricius (1934)&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Fabricius ''Sagnet om Dannebrog og de ældste Forbindelser med Estland'' (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;  ascribes the origin to the 1208 Battle of [[Fellin]], not the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]] in 1219, based on the earliest source available about the story.
Fabricius speculated that it might have been Archbishop [[Andreas Sunesøn]]'s personal ecclesiastical banner or perhaps even the flag of Archbishop [[Absalon]], under whose initiative and supervision several smaller crusades had already been conducted in Estonia. The banner would then already be known in Estonia. 
Fabricius repeats Jørgensen's idea about the flag being planted in front of Bishop Theodorik's tent, which the enemy mistakenly attacks believing it to be the tent of the King.
A different theory is briefly discussed by Fabricius and elaborated more by Helge Bruhn (1949).  Bruhn interprets the story in the context of the widespread tradition of the miraculous appearance of crosses in the sky in Christian legend, specifically comparing such an event attributed to a battle of 10 September 1217 near [[Alcácer do Sal|Alcazar]], where it is said that a golden cross on white appeared in the sky, to bring victory to the Christians.&lt;ref name="Bruhn1949"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helge Bruhn|title=Dannebrog: og danske faner gennem tiderne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXUAAAAMAAJ|year=1949|publisher=Jespersen og Pio|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Swedish national historiography of the 18th century, there is a tale paralleling the Danish legend, in which 
a golden cross appears in the blue sky during a Swedish battle in Finland in 1157.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Splitflag and Orlogsflag ===
{{flag image|Image = Flag of Denmark (state).svg|Caption = The ''Splitflag'' – the Danish State Flag. [[File:FIAV 011010.svg|23px]]&lt;br /&gt; Proportions: 56:107&lt;ref name="encyklopædien"&gt;[[Store Danske Encyklopædi]] – entry "Danmark -nationalflag"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--proportions frequently rendered as: horizontally: 3+1+5 5/8 ; vertically: 3+1+3--&gt;}}

[[File:DannebrogUpDSR.ogv|thumb|Splitflag raised at opening of DSR rowing club]]
The ''Splitflag'' and ''Orlogsflag'' have similar shapes but different sizes and shades of red. Legally, they are two different flags. The ''Splitflag'' is a Danish flag ending in a swallow-tail, it is ''Dannebrog red'', and is used on land. The ''Orlogsflag'' is an elongated ''Splitflag'' with a deeper red colour and is only used on sea.

[[File:Naval Ensign of Denmark.svg|thumb|250px|left|The ''Orlogsflag'' – the Danish Naval Flag. [[File:FIAV 000001.svg|23px]] Proportions: 7:17&lt;ref name="encyklopædien" /&gt;&lt;!--proportions frequently rendered as: horizontally: 3+1+13 ; vertically: 3+1+3--&gt;]]
The ''Orlogsflag'' with no markings, may only be used by the [[Royal Danish Navy]]. There are though a few exceptions to this. A few institutions have been allowed to fly the clean ''Orlogsflag''. The same flag with markings has been approved for a few dozen companies and institutions over the years.

Furthermore, the ''Orlogsflag'' is only described as such if it has no additional markings. Any swallow-tail flag, no matter the color, is called a ''Splitflag'' provided it bears additional markings.

=== Royal standards ===
;Monarch
The current version of the [[royal standard]] was introduced on 16 November 1972 when the [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen]] adopted a new version of her personal coat of arms.  The royal standard is the flag of Denmark with a swallow-tail and charged with the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|monarch’s coat of arms]] set in a white square. The centre square is 32 parts in a flag with the ratio 56:107.

=== Regional Flags ===
Some areas in Denmark have unofficial flags, listed below. The regional flags of Bornholm and Ærø are known to be in active use. The flags of Vendsyssel (Vendelbrog) and the Jutlandic flag ("Den jyske fane") are obscure. None of these flags have legal recognition in Denmark, and are officially considered to be "fantasy flags".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harteg.dk/bornholmsflag/?Artikler:Bornholms_omr%E5deflag_afvist] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130412104039/http://www.harteg.dk/bornholmsflag/?Artikler:Bornholms_omr%E5deflag_afvist |date=2013-04-12 }} harteg.dk Bornholms områdeflag afvist&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark reserves official recognition to official flags and regional flags (''områdeflag'') from other jurisdictions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1249">'''Geet-Gawai''' ([[Bhojpuri]]:गीत गवाई) also called '''Geet Gawai''' is a pre-wedding ceremony of [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] speaking people of Indian descent in [[Mauritius]]. In 2016, this ritual was added  to the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Intangible Cultural Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/bhojpuri-folk-songs-in-mauritius-geet-gawai-01178|title = Bhojpuri folk songs in Mauritius, Geet-Gawai  | accessdate = 2017-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pre-wedding ceremony is a combination of certain traditional rituals, prayers to the gods and the goddesses, songs, music and dance. The ceremony may be done at the residence of bride or the groom, and is carried out by female family members and neighbours. This ceremony represents collective cultural memory. By breaking barriers of caste and class, it contributes to building of smooth and cohesive community identity. Presently, Geet-Gawai has come out of the confines of being a family function, and public performances also take place. Now-a-days, apart from women, men are also participating in these events.

&lt;!--NOTE BEFORE EDITING:
In order to uphold [[WP:NPOV]], any ranking of cities of comparison between cities included in this article must be referenced (WP:NOR), by a reliable source (WP:VERIFY), and not simply reflect or advertise individual users' opinions (WP:NOT).
--&gt;
A '''global city''', also called '''world city''' or sometimes '''alpha city''' or '''world center''', is a [[city]] which is a primary [[node (networking)|node]] in the [[world economy|global economic network]]. The concept comes from geography and [[Index of urban studies articles|urban studies]], and the idea that [[globalization]] is created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic [[Location (geography)|geographic locales]] according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of [[finance]] and [[trade]].

The most complex node is the "global city", with links binding it to other cities having a direct and tangible effect on global [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] affairs.&lt;ref name="Sass1"&gt;Sassen, Saskia - ''[http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/503/503%20saskia%20sassen.htm The global city: strategic site/new frontier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018200419/http://www.india-seminar.com/2001/503/503%20saskia%20sassen.htm# |date=18 October 2006 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; The term "global city", rather than "[[megacity]]", was popularized by [[sociologist]] [[Saskia Sassen]] in her 1991 work, ''The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo''.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia - ''[http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6943.html The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316103717/http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6943.html |date=16 March 2015 }}'' (1991) - [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-691-07063-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "World city", meaning a city heavily involved in global trade, appeared in the May 1886 description of [[Liverpool]], by ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/737 |title=UK History |publisher=History.ac.uk |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=9 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623124607/http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/737# |archive-date=23 June 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Geddes]] later used the term "world city" in 1915.&lt;ref name="Doel and Hubbard"&gt;Doel, M. &amp; Hubbard, P., (2002), "Taking World Cities Literally: Marketing the City in a Global Space of flows", ''City'', vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 351–68.

==Criteria==
&lt;!---Only one picture per subsection to prevent image crowding---&gt;

Global city status is considered beneficial and desirable. Competing groups have developed multiple alternative methods to classify and rank ''world cities'' and to distinguish them from ''non-world cities''.&lt;ref name="Doel and Hubbard" /&gt;  Although there is a consensus upon leading world cities,&lt;ref name="GaWC 5"&gt;[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb5.html GaWC Research Bulletin 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/61Co4WPx8?url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb5.html# |date=25 August 2011 }}, GaWC, [[Loughborough University]], 28 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; the chosen criteria affect which other cities are included.&lt;ref name="Doel and Hubbard" /&gt;  Selection criteria may be based on a ''yardstick value'' (e.g., if the producer-service sector is the largest sector then city X is a world city)&lt;ref name="Doel and Hubbard" /&gt; or on an ''imminent determination'' (if the producer-service sector of city X is greater than the combined producer-service sectors of N other cities then city X is a world city.)&lt;ref name="Doel and Hubbard" /&gt;

Cities can fall from ranking, as in the case of cities that have become less [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] and less internationally renowned in the current era.

===Global Power City Index===
The Institute for Urban Strategies at The Mori Memorial Foundation in Tokyo issued a comprehensive study of global cities in 2017. They are ranked based on six categories: economy, research &amp; development, cultural interaction, livability, environment, and accessibility, with 70 individual indicators among them. The top ten world cities are also ranked by subjective categories including manager, researcher, artist, visitor and resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Global Power City Index 2017| publisher=Institute for Urban Strategies at The Mori Memorial Foundation |location=Tokyo, Japan |date=12 October 2017 |url=http://www.mori-m-foundation.or.jp/english/ius2/gpci2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027011346/http://mori-m-foundation.or.jp/english/ius2/gpci2/ |archive-date=27 October 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GaWC study===
{{Main article|Globalization and World Cities Research Network}}
[[File:GaWC World Cities.png|thumb|A map showing the distribution of GaWC-ranked world cities (2010 data)]]

Jon Beaverstock, [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]] and [[Peter J. Taylor]] established the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] (GaWC). A roster of world cities in the ''GaWC Research Bulletin 5'' is ranked by their connectivity through four "advanced producer services": accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, and law.&lt;ref name="GaWC 5"/&gt; The GaWC inventory identifies three levels of global cities and several sub-ranks,&lt;ref name="GaWC Intro"&gt;"[http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/gawcworlds.html The World According to GaWC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130081552/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/gawcworlds.html# |date=30 November 2012 }}". GaWC. Retrieved 21 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; although the authors caution that "concern for city rankings operates against ''the spirit of the GaWC project''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=P.J. |title=Measuring the World City Network: New Results and Developments |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb300.html |accessdate=1 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929065954/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb300.html# |archive-date=29 September 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (emphasis in original).

The 2004 rankings added several new indicators while continuing to rank city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. The 2008 roster, similar to the 1998 version, is sorted into categories of Alpha world cities (with four sub-categories), Beta world cities (three sub-categories), Gamma world cities (three sub-categories) and additional cities with High sufficiency or Sufficiency presence. The cities in the top two classification in the 2018 edition are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World According to GaWC 2018|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|date=13 November 2018|publisher=GaWC|accessdate=29 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503165246/http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2016t.html#|archive-date=3 May 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Cities Index===
In 2008, the American journal ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', in conjunction with the consulting firm [[A.T. Kearney]] and the [[Chicago Council on Global Affairs]], published a ranking of global cities, based on consultation with [[Saskia Sassen]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |title=2012 Global Cities Index and Emerging Cities Outlook |format=PDF |accessdate=9 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020223227/http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/dfedfc4c-8a62-4162-90e5-2a3f14f0da3a |archivedate=20 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Foreign Policy'' noted that "the world’s biggest, most interconnected cities help set global agendas, weather transnational dangers, and serve as the hubs of global integration. They are the engines of growth for their countries and the gateways to the resources of their regions."&lt;ref&gt;The main parameters are "Business activity" (30%), "Human capital" (30%), "Information exchange" (15%), "Cultural experience" (15%) and "Political engagement" (10%).{{cite journal| title = The 2008 Global Cities Index| journal = [[Foreign Policy]]| issue = November/December 2008| date = 21 October 2008| url = https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4509| id = | accessdate = 2008-10-31| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107184223/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4509| archivedate = 7 January 2010| df = dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt; The ranking is based on 27 metrics across five dimensions: business activity, human capital, information exchange, cultural experience, and political engagement and was updated in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015 2016 and 2017. Since 2015 it is published together with a separate index called, the Global Cities Outlook: a projection of a city’s potential based on rate of change in 13 indicators across four dimensions: personal well-being, economics, innovation, and governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.atkearney.com/research-studies/global-cities-index |title=A.T.

===The Wealth Report===
"The Wealth Report" (a global perspective on prime property and wealth) is made by the London-based estate agent [[Knight Frank LLP]] together with the [[Citi Private Bank]]. The report includes a "Global Cities Survey", evaluating which cities are considered the most important to the world’s HNWIs (high-net-worth individuals, having over $25 million of investable assets). For the Global Cities Survey, Citi Private Bank’s wealth advisors, and Knight Frank’s luxury property specialists were asked to name the cities that they felt were the most important to HNWIs, in regard to: "economic activity", "political power", "knowledge and influence" and "quality of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knightfrank.com/wealthreport/2015/global-cities|title=The Wealth Report 2015|publisher=[[Knight Frank LLP]]|access-date=18 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618062302/http://www.knightfrank.com/wealthreport/2015/global-cities#|archive-date=18 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knightfrank.com/resources/wealthreport2015/wealthpdf/04-wealth-report-global-cities-chapter.pdf|title=Global Cities Survey|access-date=18 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150323081951/http://www.knightfrank.com/resources/wealthreport2015/wealthpdf/04-wealth-report-global-cities-chapter.pdf#|archive-date=23 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global City Competitiveness Index===
In 2012, the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] ([[Economist Group|The Economist Group]]), ranked the competitiveness of global cities according to their demonstrated ability to attract capital, businesses, talent and visitors.&lt;ref name="EIU"&gt;{{cite web|title=Benchmarking global city competitiveness |url=http://www.economistinsights.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Hot%20Spots.pdf |website=Economist Intelligence Unit |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709133545/http://www.economistinsights.com/sites/default/files/downloads/Hot%20Spots.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Applying grout.jpg|thumb|right|Smoothing grout between tiles with a rubber grout float.]]
'''Grout''' is a dense fluid which is used to fill gaps or used as reinforcement in existing structures.&lt;ref name=maconline&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.maconline.org/tech/materials/grout.html |title=Not mortar, not concrete&amp;mdash;grout! |publisher=Masonry Advisory Council |date=28 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-09-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907161713/http://www.maconline.org/tech/materials/grout.html |archivedate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grout is generally a mixture of [[water]], [[cement]], and [[sand]] and is employed in [[pressure grouting]], embedding [[rebar]] in [[masonry]] walls, connecting sections of pre-cast [[concrete]], filling voids, and sealing joints such as those between [[tile]]s. Common uses for grout in the household include filling in tiles of shower floors and kitchen tiles. It is often color tinted when it has to be kept visible and sometimes includes fine gravel when being used to fill large spaces (such as the cores of concrete blocks). Unlike other structural pastes such as [[plaster]] or [[joint compound]], correctly mixed and applied grout forms a waterproof seal.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Although both grout and its close relative [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] are applied as a thick emulsion and harden over time, grout is distinguished&lt;ref name=beall1&gt;{{cite book |last=Beall |first=Christine |title=Masonry Design and Detailing for Architects, Engineers and Builders |year=1987 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-004223-3 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; by its low viscosity and lack of lime (added to mortar for pliability); grout is thin so it flows readily into gaps, while mortar is thick enough to support not only its own weight, but also that of masonry placed above it.&lt;ref name=maconline/&gt;

==Varieties==
Grout varieties include [[tile|tiling]] grout, [[flooring]] grout, [[resin]] grout, [[non-shrink grout]], structural grout and [[thixotropy|thixotropic]] grout.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Tiling grout is often used to fill the spaces between tiles or mosaics and to secure tile to its base. Although ungrouted mosaics do exist, most have grout between the [[tesserae]]. Tiling grout is also cement-based, and comes in sanded as well as unsanded varieties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The sanded variety contains finely ground silica sand; unsanded is finer and produces a non-gritty final surface. They are often enhanced with polymers and/or [[latex]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Structural grout is often used in reinforced masonry to fill voids in masonry housing reinforcing steel, securing the steel in place and bonding it to the masonry.&lt;ref name=beall1/&gt; Non-shrink grout is used beneath metal bearing plates to ensure a consistent bearing surface between the plate and its substrate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Portland cement]] is the most common cementing agent in grout, but [[thermoset polymer matrix]] grouts based on [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]s such as [[Polyurethane|urethane]]s and [[epoxy|epoxies]] are also popular.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;DM Harrison, The Grouting Handbook, A Step-by-Step Guide for Foundation Design and Machinery Installation, Elsevier Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-12-416585-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland cement-based grouts come in different varieties depending on the particle size of the ground [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] used to make the cement, with a standard size of around 15 [[micron]]s, microfine at around 6&amp;ndash;10 microns, and ultrafine below 5 microns. Finer particle sizes let the grout penetrate more deeply into a fissure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because these grouts depend on the presence of sand for their basic strength, they are often somewhat gritty when finally cured and hardened. 

From the different types of grout, a suitable one has to be chosen depending on the load. For example, a load of up to 7.5 tons can be expected for a garage access (2-component pavement joint mortar (traffic load)), whereas a cobbled garden path is only designed for a pedestrian load (1-component pavement joint mortar (pedestrian load)). Furthermore, various substructures determine whether the type of grout should be permanently permeable to water or waterproof for example by concrete subfloors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.steinrein.com/dienstleistungen/verfugen/|title=The correct type of grout|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Tools associated with groutwork include:
* '''Grout saw''' or '''grout scraper''', a manual tool for removal of old and discolored grout. The blade is usually composed of [[tungsten carbide]].
* '''Grout float''', a [[trowel]]-like tool for smoothing the surface of a grout line, typically made of rubber or soft plastic
* '''Grout sealer''', a water-based or solvent-based sealant applied over dried grout that resists water, oil, and acid-based contaminants
* '''Grout cleaner''', an acidic or basic solution that is applied on grout lines and removes the surrounding dirt and debris&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[Die grinder]]''', for faster removal of old grout than a standard grout saw
* '''Pointing trowel''', used for applying grout in flagstone and other stone works

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = iPhone Takes on the BlackBerry

| newspaper = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]
| date = 7 March 2008
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Universities Use Social Media to Connect
| first = Peter
| last = Cohen
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedsoc.html?_r=1
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]
| date = 30 March 2010
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003448269_student26.html

| date = 2006-11-26
| first = Chandra M.
| last = Hayslett
| publisher = The Seattle Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| first = Rachel
| last = Abrams
| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

  | first = S. Baron
  | authorlink = Naomi Baron
  | title = Always On
  | publisher = Oxford University Press
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 0-19-531305-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

| title = Texting 'improves language skill'
| accessdate = 2010-11-04
| date = 2009-02-25
| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Globalization and Language Education
| accessdate = 2010-10-19
| date = June 2008
| work = Presentation
| first = Tim
| last = Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news
 |last        = Cook
 |first       = Franklin

 |archivedate = 2010-02-13
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Blogs====

Blogging has brought about new ways of writing diaries and from a linguistic perspective, the language used in blogs is "in its most 'naked' form",&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; published for the world to see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David

These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

====Virtual worlds====
{{see also|virtual worlds}}

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]]. [[Emoticons]] are further examples of how users have adapted different expressions to suit the limitations of cyberspace communication, one of which is the "loss of emotivity".&lt;ref name="On The Linguistic Nature of Cyberspace and Virtual Communities"&gt;{{cite journal

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal
| title = 7 Things You Should Know About Instant Messaging

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| first = Meena
| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

Hawaiian educators have been taking advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs.&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science (HICSS-33)
  | place = Maui, Hawaii
  | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====Challenges====

In areas of language modeling, there are limitations on the applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different.&lt;ref name="biber000"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Using register-diversified corpora for general language studies
 | journal = Computational Linguistics
 | volume = 19
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 219–242
 | last = Biber
 | first = Douglas
 | year = 1993
 | publisher = [[MIT Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare in the same way as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes.&lt;ref name="sekine000"&gt;{{Cite conference
  | last = Sekine
  | first = Satshi
  | title = The domain dependence of parsing
  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing
  | place = Washington, DC
  | pages = 96–102
  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

==AAS prize==
AAS is a scholarly, non-political, non-profit professional association open to all persons interested in Asia.  The association was founded in 1941 as publisher of the ''Far Eastern Quarterly'' (now the ''Journal of Asian Studies''). The organization has gone through a series of reorganizations since those early days; but its continuing function serves to further an exchange of information among scholars to increase understanding about East, South, and Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, [http://www.asian-studies.org/about/index.htm About the AAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208084247/http://www.asian-studies.org/about/index.htm |date=2013-12-08 }}; retrieved 2011-05-31&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19363">The '''knowledge gap hypothesis''' explains that [[knowledge]], like other forms of [[wealth]], is often [[Income inequality|differentially distributed]] throughout a social system.  Specifically, the hypothesis predicts that "as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher  [[socioeconomic status]] tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments, so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease".&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tichenor|first=P.A. |author2=Donohue, G.A. |author3=Olien, C.N.|title=Mass media flow and differential growth in knowledge|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1086/267786|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip J. Tichenor, then Associate Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication, George A. Donohue, Professor of Sociology, and Clarice N. Olien, Instructor in Sociology – three [[University of Minnesota]] researchers – first proposed the knowledge gap hypothesis in 1970.

==Foundations==

Although first formally articulated in 1970, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; note that the knowledge gap hypothesis has been implicit throughout the mass communication literature.

Indeed, research published as early as the 1920s had already begun to examine the influence of individual characteristics on people's media content preferences.  For example, Gray and Munroe&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=W.S.|title=The Reading Interests and Habits of Adults|year=1929|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|author2=Munroe, R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified education – still used today as an operationalization of socioeconomic status in knowledge gap research (see, e.g., Hwang and Jeong, 2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hwang|first=Y|author2=Jeong, S-H. |title=Revisiting the knowledge gap hypothesis: A meta-analysis of thirty-five years of research|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2009|volume=86|issue=3|pages=513–532|doi=10.1177/107769900908600304}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a significant and positive correlate of a person's tendency to prefer "serious" (rather than non-serious) print content.

Popular belief, however, held that such differences in preferences might be diminished by the advent of radio, which required neither the special skill nor the exertion of reading (Lazarsfeld, 1940).&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarsfeld|first=P.F.|title=Radio and the Printed Page|year=1940|publisher=Duell, Sloan, and Pearce|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guglielmo Marconi, inventor of the wireless telegraph, even believed that the radio would "make war impossible, because it will make war ridiculous" (Narodny, 1912, p.&amp;nbsp;145).&lt;ref name="Narodny 1912"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narodny|first=I.|title=Marconi's plans for the world|journal=The Technical World Magazine|year=1912|volume=18|pages=145–150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eqpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=marconi+plans+for+the+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kE1RT_2PBcbFtgfT3PSgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20coming%20of%20the%20wireless%20era%20will%20make%20war%20impossible%2C%20because%20it%20will%20make%20war%20ridiculous%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interested in whether radio had attenuated these individual differences in content preferences, Paul Lazarsfeld, head of the Office of Radio Research at Columbia University, set out to examine whether (1) the total amount of time that people listened to the radio and (2) the type of content they listened to correlated with their socioeconomic status.  Not only did Lazarsfeld's data indicate people of lower socioeconomic status tended to listen to more radio programming, but also they were simultaneously less likely to listen to "serious" radio content.  Contrary to popular belief at the time, then, the widespread adoption of the radio seems to have had little, if any, effect on a person's tendency to prefer specific types of content.

Further evidence supporting the knowledge gap hypothesis came from Star and Hughes (1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Star|first=S.|author2=Hughes, H.M |title=Report of an education campaign: The Cincinnati plan for the United Nations|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=1950|volume=55|pages=389–397|doi=10.1086/220562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  analysis of efforts to inform Cincinnati adults about the United Nations.  Like Gray and Munroe (1929)&lt;ref name="Gray Munroe 1929" /&gt;  and Lazarsfeld (1940)&lt;ref name="Lazarsfeld 1940" /&gt;  before them, Star and Hughes found that while the campaign was successful in reaching better-educated people, those with less education virtually ignored the campaign.  Additionally, after realizing that the highly educated people reached by the campaign also tended to be more interested in the topic, Star and Hughes suggested that knowledge, education, and interest may be interdependent.

==Specification==

Based on observations implicit in mass communication research, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) define the knowledge gap hypothesis as follows:
:"As the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic-status population segments so that the gap in knowledge between the two tends to increase rather than decrease" (Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien 1970, pp. 159-160).&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

Additionally, Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien suggest 5 reasons why the knowledge gap should exist:&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt; 
ailor their conte
# ''Communication skills'': higher status people generally have more education, which improves their reading, comprehension, and memory skills;
# ''Stored information'': higher status people are more likely to already know of topics in the news through previous media exposure or through formal education;
# ''Relevant social contact'': higher status people generally have a broader sphere of activity, greater number of reference groups, and interpersonal contacts and are thus more likely to discuss news topics with others;
# ''Selective exposure'': lower status people may be less interested, and therefore less likely to expose themselves to certain news topics; and
# ''Media target markets'': media outlets cater to the tastes and interests of their audience.

==Formal summary==

Given the preceding information, the knowledge gap hypothesis can be expressed using the following set of related propositions:
# People in a society exhibit great psychological diversity due to their psychological makeup, learned experiences, social relationships, and social category memberships.
# Despite these differences, people with more education tend to have better developed cognitive and communication skills, broader social spheres with more and more diverse social contacts, and a greater amount of stored information than their counterparts with less education.
# People with greater education also tend express interest in, and expose themselves to, a broader range of topics, including serious topics like public affairs, science, and health news.
# Therefore, as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, segments of the population with higher socioeconomic status tend to acquire this information at a faster rate than the lower status segments so that the gap in knowledge between these segments tends to increase rather than decrease.

==Hypothesis operationalization and initial support==
The knowledge gap hypothesis can be operationalized both for cross-sectional and time-series appropriate research.  For cross-sectional research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''at any given time'', there should be a higher correlation between acquisition of knowledge and education for topics highly publicized in the media than for topics less highly publicized.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using an experiment in which participants were asked to read and discuss two news stories of varying publicity.  The results of the experiment support the hypothesis because correlations between education and understanding were significant for high publicity stories but not significant for low publicity stories.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

For time-series research, the knowledge gap hypothesis expects that "''over time'', acquisition of knowledge of a heavily publicized topic will proceed at a faster rate among better educated persons than among those with less education."&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;   Tichenor, Donohue, and Olien (1970) tested this hypothesis using public opinion surveys gathered between 1949 and 1965 measuring whether participants believed humans would reach the Moon in the foreseeable future.  During the 15-year span, belief among grade-school educated people increased only about 25 percentage points while belief among college educated people increased more than 60 percentage points, a trend consistent with the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Tichenor Donohue Olien 1970" /&gt;

==Refining the hypothesis==

Although by the mid-1970s extensive data supported the existence of a knowledge gap among low and high socioeconomic status individuals, Donohue, Tichenor, and Olien (1975)&lt;ref name="Donohue, Tichenor, Olien 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Donohue|first=G.A.|author2=Tichenor, P.J. |author3=Olien, C.N. |title=Mass media and the knowledge gap: A hypothesis revisited|journal=Communication Research|year=1975|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3–23|doi=10.1177/009365027500200101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to refine the hypothesis to determine under what conditions the knowledge gap might be attenuated or even eliminated.  To this end, they examined survey data on national and local issues from probability samples of 16 Minnesota communities gathered between 1969 and 1975.  Donohue and colleagues identified three variables that weakened the knowledge gap:
# ''Level of basic social concern aroused by the issue'' - Local issues that directly implicated the community tended to arouse greater social concern than national issues that did not implicate the community.  Local issues, then, tended to decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of social conflict surrounding the issue'' - Up to the point at which a communication breakdown occurred, issues with more perceived conflict tended to draw more attention and, thus, decrease the magnitude of the knowledge gap.
# ''Level of homogeneity of the community'' - Because smaller, more homogeneous communities tend to exhibit less social differentiation and variety in sources of information than larger, more heterogeneous communities, homogeneous communities tended to exhibit smaller knowledge gaps than heterogeneous communities.

==Narrative review and meta-analytic support==

At least two narrative reviews and one meta-analysis of knowledge gap hypothesis research exist.  Gaziano conducted two narrative reviews, one of 58 articles with relevant data in 1983&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=The knowledge gap: An analytical review of media effects|journal=Communication Research|year=1983|volume=10|issue=4|pages=447–486|doi=10.1177/009365083010004003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the other of 39 additional studies in 1997.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaziano|first=C.|title=Forecast 2000: Widening knowledge gaps|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=1997|volume=74|issue=2|pages=237–264|doi=10.1177/107769909707400202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaziano writes, "the most consistent result is the presence of knowledge differentials, regardless of topic, methodological, or theoretical variations, study excellence, or other variables and conditions" (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;240).  Evidence from several decades, Gaziano concludes, underscores the enduring character of knowledge gaps and indicates that they transcend topics and research settings.

Because narrative reviews examine significance tests rather than effect sizes, Hwang and Jeong (2009)&lt;ref name="Hwang Jeong 2009"/&gt; conducted a meta-analysis of 46 knowledge gap studies.  Consistent with Gaziano's results, however, Hwang and Jeong found constant knowledge gaps across time.

==Closing the knowledge gap hypothesis with Web 2.0==
In 2010 Elizabeth Corley and Dietram Scheufele conducted a study to investigate the widening knowledge gap with the example of nanotechnology. On the whole, public opinion research has shown that respondents with higher socioeconomic status (SES) acquire new information at a higher rate than low SES respondents. Their previous analyses of two large national surveys conducted in 2004 and 2007 found that respondents with at least a college degree displayed an increase in knowledge levels between 2004 and 2007 while respondents with education levels of less than a high school diploma had a significant decrease in nanotechnology knowledge levels. These results stress that the group that is most in need of help, low SES bracket, have not been helped through communication efforts and their nanotechnology knowledge levels have decreased over time.

Corley and Scheufele investigated a wide range of factors that may help to close knowledge gaps, including mass media. The researchers found that the number of days a week that respondents spent online was significantly correlated to knowledge levels about nanotechnology. Therefore, internet use helped those with less formal education to catch up to their counterparts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Corley, E. A., &amp; Scheufele, D. A. (forthcoming). Outreach gone wrong? When we talk nano to the public, we are leaving behind key audiences. The Scientist.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the Internet, and more specifically Web 2.0, may be playing a role in closing the knowledge gap. In fact, Corley and Scheufele explain that "the internet may finally live up to the hype … as a tool for creating a more informed citizenry by serving as a "leveler" of knowledge gaps." (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is widely due to the fact that information on Web 2.0 is written in layman's terms. The content is created by those individuals who have an understanding of the information, but who are also able to tailor the articles towards a more general audience.

Still, the knowledge gap may still exist even with the emergence of Web 2.0. The disenfranchised group, in this situation, the group with lower SES, must still be motivated to get the information to close the gap. Also, information about a given subject must be given. Without the content being provided, Web 2.0 will not be much of a help.  However, if the content is provided, Web 2.0 has allowed the readers to be more interactive and talk with others online, through discussion boards, forums and blogs. The results of the research conducted by Corley and Scheufele are a clear call to action for researchers to investigate non-traditional ways of connecting with lay audiences about emerging technologies.

Overall, studies show the introduction of Web 2.0 may help in closing the knowledge gap because the content that traditionally those with lower SES could not reach, can now be understood because it is written in layman's terms. Web 2.0 has helped because:
# The content on Web 2.0 is created by everyday people, for everyday people
# As a user, you can be interactive to find more information about a given subject (click through other links to find more information, search for theories and ideas you don't know on search engines, or read supplemented articles to get more information)

==Criticism and directions for future research==

# Although the majority of research supports the proposition that the higher the education, the greater the knowledge of various topics, the knowledge gap hypothesis specifies that this relationship should be moderated by the level of media publicity a given issue receives.  Few knowledge gap studies, however, treat media publicity as a variable.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because time-trend analyses indicate knowledge differentials fluctuate over time, most one-shot studies offer a brief and potentially misleading snapshot of knowledge gaps.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# A new, vital area for knowledge gap researchers to understand is the role of the family in socialization patterns related to learning.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;
# Because policy decisions have played a major role in increasing inequality, and knowledge gap research has policy implications, researchers should include more dialogue with policymakers.&lt;ref name="Gaziano 1997" /&gt;

== Competing hypotheses ==

There are now three existing competing hypotheses: 1) Media Malaise hypothesis (that predicts a general negative effect), 2) the Virtuous Circle hypothesis (that predicts a general positive effect), and 3) the Differential Effect hypothesis (that predicts a positive effect from newspapers, and a null or negative effect from television)" (Fraile, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fraile 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fraile|first=M.|title=Widening or reducing the knowledge gap? Testing the media effects on political knowledge in Spain (2004-2006)|journal=[[International Journal of Press/Politics]]|year=2011|volume=16|issue=2|pages=163–184|doi=10.1177/1940161210388413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three types of media outlets have been used to examine the media effects on knowledge gap: 1) Television – knowledge gap between lower and higher education groups are greater among light television users compared to heavy television users (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eveland|first=W.P.|author2=Scheufele, D.A. |title=Connecting news media use with gaps in knowledge and participation.|journal=[[Political Communication (journal)|Political Communication]]|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=215–237|doi=10.1080/105846000414250}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2) Newspaper – the exposure to newspaper can potentially reinforce the knowledge gap in politics for different SES groups since reading newspaper requires literacy ability to effectively understand the information (Jerit ''et al.'', 2006),&lt;ref name="Jerit Jason Toby 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jerit|first=J.|author2=Barabas, J. |author3=Bolsen, T. |title=Citizens, knowledge, and the information environment|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|year=2006|volume=50|issue=2|pages=266–282|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while other studies suggest that exposure to newspaper actually slightly decreases the knowledge gap rather than increasing it (Eveland, 2000),&lt;ref name="Eveland Scheufele 2000" /&gt;  and 3) Internet - internet exposure increases public's general knowledge in health issues (Shim, 2008).&lt;ref name="Shim 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=M.|title=Connecting Internet uses with gaps in cancer knowledge|journal=[[Health Communication]]|year=2008|volume=23|issue=6|pages=448–461|doi=10.1080/10410230802342143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kringle''''' is an American [[children's novel]] by author [[Tony Abbott (author)|Tony Abbott]]. The story chronicles the origins of Kris Kringle, also known as [[Santa Claus]]. The book was released in 2005.

==Summary==
''Summary is coming from the [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] website:''

"Unlike the traditional Santa Claus myth, Kringle is a [[coming-of-age]] story about an [[orphan]] who becomes a force for good in a dark and violent time. It is a tale of fantasy, of [[goblins]], [[elves]], and [[flying reindeer]] — and of a boy from the humblest beginnings who fulfills his destiny. Our tale begins in 500 A.D., when goblins kidnapped human children and set them to work in underground mines. Kringle is one such child.... until he discovers his mission — to free children from enslavement.

''Kringle'' has been called "deft writing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.carthage.edu/childrens-literature/book-reviews/a/kringle/|title="Kringle" by Tony Abbott |author=John Warren Stewig|website=www.carthage.edu |publisher=Carthage College |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "a credible blend of Anglo-Saxon legend and Christian myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 4, 2005|title=New Books for Children and Young People  Abbott, Tony ''Kringle''|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/190908 |journal=Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |volume=59|issue=4 |pages=168,169|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Booklist]] wrote "On first glance, this story of how Kris Kringle came to live at the North Pole, surrounded by toy-making elves, sounds like the premise for a lighthearted cartoon. It is anything but. ... Told in a come-nearer voice, this epic could have used some tightening, but the enticing premise, appealing young hero, and nonstop action will appeal to many fantasy lovers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buffalolib.org/vufind/Record/1638280/Reviews |title=Kringle|author=Ilene Cooper |website=www.buffalolib.org |publisher=Buffalo and Erie County Public Library |accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
In 2007, [[Paramount Pictures]] optioned the [[film rights]]. The idea was pitched by film director [[Mark Dindal]] based on a script written by Dindal and Jason Richman, with [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] producing and Dindal directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=LaPorte|first1=Nicole|title=Paramount gets tough with Santa myth|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/markets-festivals/paramount-gets-tough-with-santa-myth-1117960270/|accessdate=August 19, 2016|work=Variety|date=February 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|September 2017}}, no new updates have been announced regarding the status of the production.

The '''Man of Miracles''' ('''Mother of Existence''' or '''M.O.M.''' for short) is a fictional, ageless, mysterious, gender-less, super-being, featured in the [[Spawn (comics)|''Spawn'']] comic book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=9508|title=End of Daze: Hine Talks "Spawn" - Comic Book Resources|publisher=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=7227|title=New And Improved: David Hine Talks "Spawn" - Comic Book Resources|publisher=Comicbookresources.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
The Mother (under the alias Man of Miracles) has appeared to offer her/his guidance and wisdom to [[Spawn (comics)|The Hellspawn]] so that he might play his part in Armageddon. She/he is an ageless being of practically inconceivable power who has been the architect behind most of the events in the Spawn universe, holding significant knowledge of Al Simmons and his role as Spawn, knowledge that not even [[Mammon (comics)|Mammon]] possesses and possessing powers beyond that of [[God (Image Comics)|God]] or [[Satan (Image comics)|Satan]]. Her/his true form is as the "Mother" of Existence, though she/he is neither female nor male, it is able to cast an illusion to make her/his look male.

It is revealed that Mother/Man of Miracles is in fact the one who walked among mortals as "[[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]", and thus was actually independent of God in the Spawn universe. The [[The Disciple (comics)|twelve heavenly warriors known as the Disciples]], formed from the souls of the [[Twelve Apostles]], actually follow Man of Miracles above God.

Mother gave each of her/his infinite children a world to run as they wish; [[God (Image Comics)|God]] and [[Satan (Image Comics)|Satan]] were both given Earth. God and Satan constantly bickered and fought to the point where they declared war on one another. Mankind, being created by God (from The Mother's energy) but given free will by Satan, became unique and Mother instantly fell in love with them and decided to act on their behalf, rather than let her/his children use them as cannon fodder. Mother stripped both of her/his children of their kingdoms and made them sleep in a forgotten corner of the universe. Mother then came to Earth as [[Jesus Christ]], spreading a message of love and tolerance. This message being corrupted by mankind, Mother saw that [[Armageddon]] was inevitable. Giving mankind a chance to survive, Mother preserved all the souls that had died in the same hour as Al Simmons and placed them inside of Spawn. Spawn represents the potential of mankind and must prove that humanity is worth saving from God and Satan's feud. Mother brought back God and Satan as the human children of Terry and Wanda Fitzgerald in order to give them an appreciation for humanity and change their ways.  This plan failed, as the twins simply became more insane than before and wreaked further chaos on Earth. They have since regained their memories, powers, and kingdoms and are bolstering their armies for the final push that will begin Armageddon.

Mother has also been revealed as being The Keeper of Greenworld, the voice of the Emerald Parliament and the one who originally summoned [[The Heap]].

M.O.M.'s appearance changes depending upon who is perceiving her/him. She/he has appeared as an anime-inspired hero, as [[Miracleman]], as a mysterious woman covered in ivy who was presumably [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Jesus Christ]] and, in her/his true form, as the '''Mother of Creation''': a Caucasian skinned woman. When cloaked in her/his illusion, people see her/his as they want to, and she/he subsequently explains that this is because reality is far more malleable than humanity believes.  In her/his anime guise, M.O.M.'s appearance changes consistently from panel to panel.  The tattoos on her/his face are different each time, the logo on her/his chest appears and reappears and sometimes her/his shirt disappears but her/his logo remains visible on her/his skin.

==Copyright disputes==

Man of Miracles was first introduced in ''Spawn'' #150. This character was very similar to the hero known as [[Miracleman]] (also known as Marvelman), popularized in the [[Eclipse Comics]] series written by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Neil Gaiman]]. In his original appearance he is named Mike Moran, the same human identity of Miracleman, with basically the same costume. [[Todd McFarlane]] bought the rights to Eclipse Comics believing Miracleman was also a part of the deal. However, the rights to the character of Miracleman have been [[Marvelman#Ownership battle|heavily contested]]. In court a judge determined that McFarlane did not hold the rights to Miracleman. After this the two characters of Mother of Existence and Man of Miracles were combined into one where they were supposed to always be the same being.

{{Nihongo|'''''Metal Slug 4'''''|メタルスラッグ4}} is a [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[video game]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] console/arcade platform created by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]]. It was released in [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] for the MVS arcade platform and the AES game console, and is the fourth game in the [[Metal Slug (series)|''Metal Slug'' series]].  Two years later, Playmore published Metal Slug 4. This was also the only ''Metal Slug'' game that was produced during SNK's bankruptcy, until [[Metal Slug 5|its sequel]] released after SNK was "resurrected" as [[SNK|SNK Playmore]].

''Metal Slug 4'' retains the same game-play as previous titles, with the addition of some new enemies, bosses, weapons, several new vehicles and a new bonus combo system. It was later ported to [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (not compatible with Xbox 360) and [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with ''Metal Slug 5'' as a [[compilation (games)|compilation]] in North America and South Korea. [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 4 returns today, so grab your Hevveee Machine-gun|url=https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-4-returns-today-so-grab-your-hevveee-machine-gun-516425.phtml|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=Destructoid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hamster's Neo Geo Hot Streak On The Switch eShop Continues With Six New Confirmed Games|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/07/hamsters_neo_geo_hot_streak_on_the_switch_eshop_continues_with_six_new_confirmed_games|accessdate=14 Aug 2018|publisher=NintendoLife.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
A bonus scoring system was added that allows the player to be rewarded depending on how many enemies are killed in the time allotted. The time allotted is determined from the type of emblem that is picked up. A time meter will appear on the top of the screen, and if the player lives through the end of the level, they will be awarded bonus points for badges that represent feats accomplished. Eri and Tarma were replaced with Nadia and Trevor.

==Plot==
One year after the events of [[Metal Slug 3]] (timeline wise, also after [[Metal Slug 6]], which takes place after 3) the world is trembling under the new threat of a mysterious but deadly cyber virus that threatens to attack and destroy any nation's military computer system. With Tarma and Eri unable to help due to their own assignments in the matter, Marco Rossi and Fiolina Germi are called in to investigate the situation and are joined by two newcomers, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey. In their investigation, the group discovers that a rich terrorist organization known as the Amadeus Syndicate is behind the nefarious plot and has allied with General Morden's Rebel Army. They head into battle against Amadeus' forces, hoping to destroy the cyber virus before it gets the chance to wipe out the entire world's military computer system.

Halfway through the game's story mode, the player is confronted by who they presume to be General Morden, however in the final stage they find an underground facility where android doubles of Morden are being manufactured. Allen O' Neil (who has appeared numerous times throughout the series) fights the player in this stage for the very last time, and is also revealed to be a machine replica. Finally, the player confronts the leader of the syndicate, Dr. Amadeus himself, who attacks with a series of powerful robots, but he is defeated and is trapped in his own devices as the base self-destructs, presumably killing him. If the player safely escapes the base's bonus explosion stage, the credits will show the main cast eating a feast of food, but if the player gets caught in the explosion, the player character(s) will appear in the hospital, bandaged and bed-ridden, being brought get-well gifts of food from Eri Kasamoto and Tarma Roving. After the credits, a single computer monitor is seen transmitting data to an unknown location before shutting down.

==New features==
*Double Heavy Machine Guns [2H]: The stronger version of the Heavy Machine Gun [H] in the previous series. Allow players to carry two submachine guns which cause the damage of 1 per shot and with more rapid firing than Heavy Machine Guns. However, the 2Hs are very rare in the game and only have 200 shots like the Heavy Machine Gun and can only fire in four directions.
*Monkey Transformation: In the underground path of stage 1 and the final stage, there are scientists with rifles. These aren't loaded with bullets but a special chemical shot, that transforms characters into gibbons which are like the monkey Utan in Metal Slug 3.  Although this transformation is new, the sprites used for it are not, they are recycled from Metal Slug 3.  Players gain a much stronger jumping ability and the ability to hang on the bars over their heads, which saves them from most of the attacks from the enemy, although they are unable to shoot upward while on the bars (they can still shoot in horizontal directions and directly downwards). But they can only fire a small gun which is similar to the Heavy Machine Gun, walk very slowly, and takes longer to throw grenades. Players can be transformed back into human form by picking up an antidote dropped by scientists.  This transformation is the only one in the series with an animation for returning to human form, in which the player falls asleep as a monkey then promptly wakes up as a human. Players who are hit by the chemical shot while in the monkey form will die.

===New Slugs===
*Bradley: First appeared in MS2 as an enemy rocket shooting vehicle, it is equipped with powerful rocket shots and a vulcan cannon like the slugs, players can use it after killing the enemy soldier inside it. However, this vehicle has a very short jumping range and crouches much slower than the other vehicles, and will not become temporarily invincible after receiving an attack from the enemy.
*Metal Crow: First appeared in MS1 as the "Melty Honey" under the control of the Rebel soldiers. It will appear with Bradley in stage two if under two players mode. It is equipped with a blade-covered shield that shreds enemies, and also enables it to take five shots before it is destroyed. Also in stage 5.
*Crawler: A mechanical version of the sub-human mutants from Metal Slug 2/X which appears in stage four. Much like the Camel Slug in the previous two games, it provides no protection to the player, but has a slightly better jumping ability and also does not harm the player if it touches a rolling bomb.
*Forklift Truck: It will appear in stage 5 along with the Metal Crow. Like the Drill Slug from MS3, it can "jack up" if the player presses the jump button during the on board in the Forklift Truck. It will stab the enemy with the fork at the front in the player presses the bomb button. Its fork can shred the enemy also. The Forklift Truck does not have a vulcan cannon; rather, the player uses whatever weapon they have. The player is always exposed to enemy attacks.

A '''motive''', in law, especially [[criminal law]], is the cause that moves people to induce a certain action.&lt;ref name="Garner"&gt;{{cite book 
|title= Blacks Law Dictionary, Abridged Eight Edition
|last= Garner
|first= Bryan A.

|publisher=Thomson / West 
|isbn= 0-314-15863-4
|page= 855
|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motive, in itself, is not an [[Element (criminal law)|element]] of any given [[crime]]; however, the legal system typically allows motive to be proven in order to make plausible the accused's reasons for committing a crime, at least when those motives may be obscure or hard to identify with. However, a motive is not required to reach a verdict.&lt;ref name="JRank Articles 2014"&gt;Law Library - American Law and Legal Information - JRank Articles. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Motives are also used in other aspects of a specific case, for instance, when police are initially investigating.&lt;ref name="JRank Articles 2014"/&gt;

The law technically distinguishes between motive and [[intent (law)|intent]].  "Intent" in criminal law is synonymous with ''[[Mens rea]]'', which means the mental state shows liability which is enforced by law as an element of a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mens Rea |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea |website=LII / Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2015-10-15 |first=Sara S. |last=Frug}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Motive" describes instead the reasons in the accused's background and station in life that are supposed to have induced the crime. Motives are often broken down into three categories; biological, social and personal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologydiscussion.net/motive/types-of-motives-biological-social-and-personal-motives-psychology/694 Types of Motives: Biological, Social and Personal Motives]. (n.d.). Retrieved October 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==
There are two objections to motive when considering punishment. The first is volitional objection, which is the argument that the person cannot manage his or her own motives and therefore cannot be punished for them. The second objection is neutrality objection. This is based on the idea that our society has contrasting political opinions and therefore a government’s preference should be limited.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.law.upenn.edu/phr/conversations/status/viewFile.cfm?file=Hessick2_467_1.pdf.|title = Motive's Role in Criminal Punishment|last = Hessick|first = Carrisa|date = 2006|journal = Southern California Law Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pertinence ==
There are four different ways a defendants motive can be pertinent to his or her criminal liability. Motive can be fully inculpatory or exculpatory or only partially inculpatory or exculpatory. When one has acted with a specific motive, lawful behavior becomes illegal, and this is when motive is fully inculpatory. If illegal activity with a particular motive does not hold a defendant responsible then that motive is fully exculpatory. When a motive supplies inadequate defense to a crime, the motive is partially exculpatory. When a motive says the kind of infraction for which the defendant is responsible, the motive is partially inculpatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Naked News''''' is a Canadian news and entertainment program owned by Naked Broadcasting Network. It features naked women reading news bulletins derived from [[news wire]]s.&lt;ref name=Beeb&gt;{{cite news|title=Net news to bare all on TV|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1530995.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=7 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's production studio is located in Toronto, Canada. There are 6 new daily programs a week, that run approximately  22-minute in length.&lt;ref name=Mutz&gt;{{cite book|title=In-Your-Face Politics: The Consequences of Uncivil Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4CSBQAAQBAJ|first=Diana C.|last=Mutz|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781400865871|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female cast members read the news fully nude or disrobe as they present their various segments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axwdBQAAQBAJ|first=Graham|last=Meikle|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=9781137105677|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; including entertainment, sports, movies, food, sex and relationships. ''Naked News TV!'' is an offshoot of the web program and is broadcast on pay TV in various countries around the world.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite press release|title=Naked News TV! to Air New Episodes On Australian T.V.|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Naked+News+TV!+to+Air+New+Episodes+On+Australian+T.V.-a092809680|website=Free Online Library|agency=Business Wire|date=2 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsmart the MBA Clones: The Alternative Guide to Competitive Strategy, Marketing, and Branding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBJ5u3grR4QC|first=Dan|last=Herman|publisher=Paramount Market Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9780978660284|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show often recruits women from around the world, to either appear as guest reporters, or to appear on a regular basis. Their audition feature, where amateur women try out for the program, is one of their most popular segments and generates the most feedback from its viewers.  Another segment that generates a lot of interest is called Naked In The Streets. This is where a reporter will go topless in the street and speak to the general public about various topics.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The female announcers have been featured in almost every medium including television (''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[Sally Jessy Raphaël]]'', and numerous appearances on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[The Insider (TV series)|ET Insider]]''), [[newspapers]] and [[magazines]] (''[[TV Guide]]'', ''[[Playboy]]''), and as guests on multiple [[radio]] shows, including [[Howard Stern]].

[[File:Former Naked News anchor Christine Kerr, in Toronto (Canada), 2008.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Former ''Naked News'' anchor Christine Kerr, in Toronto (Canada), 2008]]
''Naked News'' was conceived by Fernando Pereira and Kirby Stasyna and debuted in December 1999&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; as a web-based news service featuring an all-female cast. It began with only one anchor, Victoria Sinclair, who worked for the program until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tuned Out: Why Americans Under 40 Don't Follow the News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PXtnj5fs9tgC|first=David T. Z.|last=Mindich|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=2005|isbn=9780195161403|pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the show grew the number of female anchors increased. Roxanne West joined Sinclair as a lead anchor, and other cast members included Holly Weston, Lily Kwan, Sandrine Renard, Erin Sherwood, Athena King, Brooke Roberts, [[Michelle Pantoliano]], Erica Stevens,&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; [[Samantha Page]], Christine Kerr and Valentina Taylor, plus guest anchors. The website was popularized entirely by word of mouth,&lt;ref name=Mutz/&gt; and quickly became a popular web destination. During the height of its popularity, the website was receiving over six million unique visitors per month.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beeb/&gt; In the site's early days the entire newscast could be viewed for free online.&lt;ref name=Mutz/&gt; The site was initially supported by advertising but this changed after the collapse of Internet advertising that occurred with the [[dot-com crash]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} By 2002 only one news segment could be viewed freely,&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; and by 2004, no free content remained on the website.&lt;ref name=Mutz/&gt; Beginning in 2005, a nudity-free version of ''Naked News'' was available to non-subscribers. Beginning in June 2008, two news segments could be viewed freely. However, this ended in December 2009.

Following the success of ''[[The Naked Truth (TV)|The Naked Truth]]'', a similar show on Russian television, ''Naked News'' launched ''Naked News TV!'', the first Internet news program to successfully transfer from website to cable television. It was initially broadcast on [[Viewers Choice]] in Canada in 2001,&lt;ref name=Beeb/&gt; and was first broadcast in the United States a few months later by the [[iN DEMAND]] cable TV service on its [[Too Much for TV]] pay-per-view network that also included [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]. In 2002 it was broadcast in Australia on [[The Comedy Channel]] via cable and satellite television platforms [[Foxtel]] and [[Austar]].&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; The British channel [[Sumo TV]] briefly showed episodes of ''Naked News'', while the free-to-view [[Playboy One]] broadcast the show at 9:30pm Mondays-Fridays until its closure in 2008.

''Naked News'' launched a Japanese version of the show in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|website=Today|url=https://www.today.com/popculture/naked-news-makes-debut-japan-wbna10797426|title=Naked News makes debut in Japan|date=11 January 2006|author=Julian Ryall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese broadcasting regulations prohibited the presenters from being fully naked, allowing them only to strip to their underwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada's 'Naked News' to Broadcast in Spanish, Italian, Korean|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/10/canada-naked-news-to-broadcast-in-spanish-italian-korean.html|publisher=Fox News|date=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Japanese government changed broadcasting guidelines to prevent the show receiving a subsidy for the section delivered in sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Naked news defies subsidy strip|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/asia/japan/naked-news-defies-subsidy-strip-1.195886|date=18 August 2007|work=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male version of the show was created in 2001 to parallel the female version, but has ceased production as it did not enjoy the female version's popularity and fame. Although it was originally targeted towards female viewers (at one point said to be 30% of the website's audience), the male show later promoted itself as news from a queer perspective. The male version closed in 2007.&lt;ref name=Sun3&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Laid Bare: outrageous Naked News presenter Carli Bei strips totally nude to visit a swingers party in Jamaica|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4188230/outrageous-naked-news-presenter-carli-bei-strips-totally-nude-to-visit-a-swingers-party-in-jamaica/|author=Amanda Devlin|date=7 August 2017|newspaper=The Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naked News imitators===
* ''[[Comédie+]]'' – In 2001, this French cable TV network ran a series promos featuring males and females casually undressing as they read jokes. In 2006 they copied the ''Naked News'' format in its entirety in a striptease newscast called ''Les Nuz'', except the anchors keep their bottom underwear on.
* Radio Tango – In 2001 this radio station based in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] began featuring stripping female weather readers in their broadcasts and on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radio Tango calls the tune in the nude|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/eish/radio-tango-calls-the-tune-in-the-nude-65730|date=4 May 2001|access-date=4 December 2017|work=IOL News|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In June 2009 plans for ''Naked News Korea'' were announced. It featured a similar format to the Canadian version but with less nudity. This was later revealed to be a scam. After barely a month of operations, ''Naked News Korea'', which featured topless news anchors, abruptly closed down amid allegations that the CEO, John Chau, disappeared with all of the company's money.

'''New Genres''' is an [[artistic movement]] begun in the early 20th century.  The movement is marked by many notable artists who work with a variety of media such as [[video art]], [[body art]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[performance]], and [[sound art]].

==Definition==
New Genres art is commonly identified as [[installation art]], [[Video (disambiguation)|video]], [[film]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[Digital media]], [[internet art]],&lt;ref&gt;Duron, Julian. Dot Forum: New Genre Art. Fecalface.com. http://www.fecalface.com/SF/component/content/article/138-dot-forum/1434-dot-forum-new-genre-art. Retrieved 2015-6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] and [[emerging art forms]]. New Genres is a practice which begins with ideas and then moves to the appropriate form or media for that particular idea, sometimes inventing entirely new sites of [[cultural production]], new methodologies, technologies, or [[genres]] in the process. New Genres gives emphasis to questioning preconceived notions of the role of art in culture and its relationship to a specific form or [[List of artistic media|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;
University of California, Los Angeles. New Genres Homepage. http://www.art.ucla.edu/newgenres/. Retrieved 2015-6-10.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
While no recognized official date marks the beginning of the New Genre period, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} believe that the early 20th-century work of the [[Dadaists]] and [[Futurists]] initiated this movement.  Their work laid a foundation for the experimental practice of New Genres.  Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917) introduced the idea of the [[readymade]] object: a non-art object which becomes viewed as art due to the intention and designation of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492875/ready-made |title= ready-made (style of art) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new use of [[artistic power]] and questioning of the art object opened up the conceptual sphere of New Genres.  These discoveries illuminated the idea that art was possible outside the field of the classical genres like painting and sculpture.

To understand the movement of New Genres, it is important to look at the events occurring simultaneously in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the first half of the century, [[World War I]] broke out and caused devastation to much of Eastern Europe.  In America, the [[Great Depression]] caused a major economic crises that affected many parts of the world.  [[World War II]] quickly followed, splitting the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  This war caused tremendous damage and introduced new tragedies into the world, such as the [[Holocaust]] and the first [[nuclear weapons]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">'''Night Doctors''', also known as Night Riders, Night Witches, Ku Klux Doctors, and Student Doctors are bogeymen of African American folklore, with some factual basis. Emerging from the realities of grave robbing, enforced and punitive medical experimentation, and intimidation rumours spread maliciously by many Southern whites, the Night Doctors purpose was to further prevent slaves, Free Men, and black workers leaving for the North of the United States, in a prescient foreshadowing of the inevitable events during the early to mid 20th century, now known as The Great Migration.

African American folklore told of white doctors who would abduct, kill, and dissect, performing a plethora of experiments, referred to as "Night Doctors".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Y., Gorelick, P.B., Samuels, P., and Bempong, I. (1996). Why African Americans may not be participating in clinical trials. J Natl Med Assoc 88, 630–634.&lt;/ref&gt; These tales are difficult to verify. White slave owners disseminated scare stories of putative tortures performed by "Night Doctors" to prevent freed slaves from moving to the North.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Halperin, E.C. (2007). The poor, the Black, and the marginalised as the source of cadavers in United States anatomical education. Clinical Anatomy 20, 489–495.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to augment rumours, white slave owners dressed in white sheets to represent kidnappers. Wandering the African American communities, perpetuating beliefs slaves would be abducted, taken to medical facilities and killed.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; 
To many African Americans these "Night Doctors" weren't just fictions used as scare tactics; they were real life.&lt;ref name="Skloot 2010 165–68"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skloot|first=Rebecca|title=The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks|year=2010|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4000-5218-9|pages=165–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grave robbers==
In the early 19th century, most states legislated against grave robbery. African Americans were powerless, voiceless, and unable to resist grave robberies to any meaningful extent.&lt;ref name="Hump"&gt;Humphrey, D.C. (1973). Dissection and discrimination: the social origins of cadavers in America, 1760-1915. Bull N Y Acad Med 49, 819–827.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dissection of white cadavers carried far greater risks for doctors. Nevertheless, poor whites were used,  especially when available in abundance  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savitt|first=Todd|title=The Use of Blacks for Medical Experimentation and Demonstration in the Old South|journal=The Journal of Southern History|date=August 1982|volume=48|issue=3|pages=331–348|jstor=2207450|doi=10.2307/2207450}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Body snatching]] increased during the post-Revolutionary period in New York. Reflecting the impact of medical students performing dissections, rather than simply observing professors. Following outraged newspaper reporting, laws were passed attempting to circumvent the rapidly increasing incidence of grave robbery.
For example, Pennsylvania legislature required unclaimed bodies to be given to the state anatomy board, by public officials.&lt;ref name="Hump"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semmes, C.E. (1996). Medical Experimentation. In Racism, Health, and Post-Industrialism: A Theory of African American Health, (Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans were the main source of dissection cadavers to the end of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Bankole, Katherine Kemi. Slavery and medicine: enslavement and medical practices in antebellum Louisiana. New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Newly formed laws were openly flouted by medical schools as demonstrated in an 1824 advertisement for the [[Medical University of South Carolina|Medical College of South Carolina]]:&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences, Volume 8 By John Davidson Godman, Isaac Hays&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some advantages of a peculiar character are connected with this institution, which it may be proper to point out. No place in the United States offers as great opportunities for the acquisition of anatomical knowledge. Subjects being obtained from the colored population in sufficient numbers for every purpose, and proper dissection carried out without offending any individuals in the community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Excavations at the [[Georgia Regents University|Medical College of Georgia]] in 1989 yielded more than 9,000 bones, mainly from working class individuals. Approximately 80% of those were from African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, Edward C. The Poor, the Black, and the Marginalized as Sources of Cadavers in United States Anatomical Education. Clinical Anatomy, 20(5), p 489-495&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the majority of cadavers, many Southern teaching hospitals would only perform new live surgical techniques and demonstrations on African-American patients.&lt;ref&gt;Doty, Leilani. "Renewing Trust in Regular(Allopathic) Medicine and Research" SELAM International Newsletter. 9(1), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Night Rider==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't you know white men taught them all that about ghosts? That was a way of keeping them down, keeping them under control.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, Gladys-Marie. Night Riders in Black Folk History. University of North Carolina Press: Chapel Hill, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a long history of whites using the supernatural to intimidate African Americans. During the slavery era, slave masters dressed as ghosts, rode around black communities on horseback. Later there were patrols called [[patterollers]]. After the Civil War, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] continued the "Night Rider" tradition. It was finally taken up by the Night Doctors.

Between the Civil War and the 1930s, labour agents were sent by Northern employers to recruit African Americans from the South. In addition to restrictive laws, Southern employers used rumour to intimidate the workforce into staying in the South. One of the most popular rumours concerned doctors roaming Northern streets nightly, killing African Americans for dissection purposes. White Southern employers would also maraude around black communities in white gowns, further spreading fear, anxiety and unease throughout neighbourhoods already overburdened with anguish.

==Needle Men and the Black Bottle Men==
New Orleans had an interesting variation on the Night Doctors called the "Needle Men". Thought to be medical students from [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans)|Charity Hospital]] (now the [[Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans]]), the eponymous Needle Men, would poke unsuspecting individuals in the arm, resulting in death. Several explanations have been suggested, such as epilepsy and the 1924 case of a man who would poke women with a [[bayonet]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;I sure don't go out much at this time of year. You takes a chance just walkin' on the streets. Them Needle Mens is everywhere. They always comes 'round in the fall, and they's 'round to about March. You see, them Needle Mens is medical students from the Charity Hospital tryin' to git your body to work on. That's 'cause stiffs is very scarce at this time of the year.&lt;ref name="LyleSaxon"&gt;Lyle Saxon, Edward Dreyer, Robert Tallant, Gumbo Ya-Ya, Houghton-Mifflan: Boston, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Students at Charity Hospital were also referred to as "Black Bottle Men". The black bottle would be a poison given upon entrance to Charity Hospital, and the resulting death would allow dissection. It is now thought that the black bottle referred to cascara ([[Rhamnus purshiana]]) mixed with [[milk of magnesia]], a diuretic commonly given to admitted patients of the era.&lt;ref name="LyleSaxon" /&gt;

Charity Hospital did not have sole responsibility for "Needle Men" or  "Black Bottle Men." [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] was believed to be another source. These legendary figures were thought to kidnap African Americans from the street. A woman from the book ''[[The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks]]'' states that: "You'd be surprised how many people disappeared in East Baltimore when I was a girl. I'm telling you, I lived here in the fifties when they got Henrietta, and we weren't allowed to go anywhere near Hopkins. When it got dark and we were young, we had to be ''on the steps'', or Hopkins might get us."&lt;ref name="Skloot 2010 165–68"/&gt;

==Modern Incarnations==

In 1979, when 25 African-American young men and boys disappeared in Georgia, the Night Doctors were blamed. In this incarnation, the Night Doctor removed internal organs for aphrodisiacs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldandi.com/specialreport/1986/october/Sa11505.htm{{Better source|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2012}}

The discovery of the [[Tuskegee experiment]] in which doctors withheld treatment from 399 African-American men also revived the tale of the night doctors.{{by whom|date=July 2012}}

==Poem==
A poem was created from the fears of the African Americans that applied more realism to the Night Doctor myths:&lt;ref&gt;Savitt, T.L. (1982). The Use of Blacks for Medical Experimentation and Demonstration in the Old South. The Journal of Southern History 48, 331–348.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
THE DISSECTING HALL

Yuh see dat house? Dat great brick house?
Way yonder down de street?
Dey used to take dead folks een dar
Wrapped een a long white sheet.

An' sometimes we'en a nigger' d stop,
A-wondering who was dead,
Dem stujent men would take a club
An' bat 'im on de head.

An' drag dat poor dead nigger chile
Right een dat 'sectin hall
To vestigate 'is liver-lights-
His gizzardan' 'is gall.

Tek off dat nigger's han's an' feet-
His eyes, his head, an' all,
An' w'en dem stujent finish
Dey was nothin' left at all.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{one source|date=June 2013}}
An '''open relationship''' is an [[intimate relationship]] which is consensually [[non-monogamous]]. This term may sometimes refer to [[polyamory]], but it is often used to signify a primary emotional and intimate relationship between two partners who agree to have sexual relationships but not romantic relationships with other people.  The nature of the openness in the relationship, including what outside sexual contact is permissible, varies widely.
Open relationships include any type of romantic relationship (dating, marriage, etc.) that is open.&lt;ref name="Collective2005"/&gt;  The concept of an open relationship has been recognized since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Web MD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doheny|first=Kathleen|title=The Truth About Open Marriage|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/the-truth-about-open-marriage|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of open relationships==
To a large degree, open relationships are a generalization of the concept of a relationship beyond monogamous relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;  A form of open relationship is the [[open marriage]], in which the participants in a marriage have an open relationship.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

There are several different styles of open relationships. Some examples include:

* Multi-partner relationships, between three or more partners where a sexual relationship does not occur between all of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* Hybrid relationships, when one partner is nonmonogamous and the other is [[monogamous]].&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* [[#Swinging|Swinging]], in which singles or partners in a committed relationship engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

The term open relationship is sometimes used interchangeably with the closely related term [[polyamory]], but the two concepts are not identical. 
The main unifying element to open relationship styles is non-exclusivity of romantic or sexual relationships.

==Prevalence==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2012}}
Some believe that open relationships occur more frequently in certain demographics, such as the young rather than the old in America, including, more specifically, the college-educated middle-class, rather than the uneducated working-class, or people of certain ethnic and/or other racial minorities.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; Open relationships may also be more common among females rather than males, especially those in the same categories, such as college-educated, middle-class, white, younger Americans.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; This may be because women have more to gain by stressing this idea of equal rights, and that the women’s rights movement supports the idea of open relationships.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt;

A 1974 study showed that male students who either cohabit or live in a communal group are more likely to become involved in open relationships than females, and are still more interested in the concept than females even if not participating in open relationships.&lt;ref name="Hollander1974" /&gt; A survey taken by gay men's "health and life magazine", ''FS Magazine'', 41% of [[gay men]] interviewed have been in an open relationship and of the men who have been in open relationships, 27% believe that it is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Nick|title=Nearly half of gay men have had an open relationship|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/02/03/nearly-half-of-gay-men-have-had-an-open-relationship/|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=[[PinkNews]]|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haggas|first1=Stuart|title=Open Relationships Uncovered|url=https://www.fsmag.org.uk/fs152-open-relationships-uncovered|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=FS Magazine|issue=152|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many couples within open relationships are dual-career, meaning that both primary partners have a stable job and/or a career. Both men and women in these, especially in closed groups, are also more likely to be in managerial jobs.  Most also are either [[childfree]], or post child-rearing.&lt;ref name="Ramey" /&gt;

==Reward vs. risk==
===Reasons for entering an open relationship===
&lt;!-- unless sourc(s) provided, this is a bunch of OR --&gt;
An open relationship may form for various reasons. These include:{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* liking another person but not wanting to end the old relationship
* being non-monogamous by nature (i.e. born that way)
* a difference emerging between two people in a relationship
* one partner realizing that they are unable to fulfill the other's needs&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* varying [[sex drive]] between partners&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* one or both partners desiring more freedom, companionship, intellectual variety, a variety of sexual partners&lt;ref name="Ramey1975" /&gt;, getting ahead career-wise or maintaining relationships
* a need for challenge: some people feel that their relationship is inadequate unless they are being challenged. Open relationships may create a sense of [[jealousy]], [[attachment theory|attachment]], or possessiveness, all of which are challenges for a relationship to work through.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; These emotions can also lead to greater [[self-awareness]] which may be seen as satisfying to those in open relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* the enjoyment of [[new relationship energy]], the state of heightened emotional and sexual receptivity and excitement experienced during the formation of a new physical relationship&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* being able to meet other couples and individuals with a similar outlook with whom the participants can connect with on an intellectual and emotional level&lt;ref name="Ramey" /&gt;

===Reasons for avoiding an open relationship===
Many couples consider open relationships, but choose not to follow through with the idea.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} If a person attempts to approach their committed monogamous partner about transitioning to an open relationship, the monogamous partner may convince or coerce them to either stay monogamous or pursue a new partner.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; There may also be concern that when beginning an open relationship, a partner may become only concerned in their personal development and pay less attention to their partner.&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt;

Jealousy is often present in monogamous relationships, and adding one or more partners to the relationship may cause it to increase.&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt; Results of some studies have suggested that jealousy remains a problem in open relationships because the actual involvement of a third party is seen as a trigger.&lt;ref name="Buunk1981" /&gt; In Constantine &amp; Constantine (1971), the researchers found that 80% of participants in [[Open marriage jealousy|open marriages]] had experienced jealousy at one point or another.&lt;ref name="Buunk1981" /&gt;

Cultural pressure may also dissuade initiating or switching to an open relationship.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} There is a commonly held societal stereotype that those involved in open relationships are less committed or mature than those who are in monogamous relationships;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and films, media, and self-help books present the message that to desire more than one partner means not having a "true" relationship.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-WWII]] 1950s-1970s, it was traditional to "date around" (with guidelines such not going out with one particular suitor twice in a row) until ready to start "going steady" (the onset of exclusivity and sexual exploration); since then, non-exclusive dating around has lost favour and going directly to steady (now known simply as exclusive dating) has been elevated instead.&lt;ref name="Bailey1989" /&gt; Desiring an open relationship is these days{{which|date=April 2018}} often claimed to be a phase that a person is passing through before being ready to "settle down".&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; The logistics of an open relationship may be difficult to cope with, especially if the partners reside together, split finances, own property, or parent children.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

==== Sexually transmitted infection ====
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}{{See also|safe sex|polyfidelity}}
Any sexual contact outside of a strictly [[monogamy|monogamous]] or [[polyfidelity|polyfidelitous]] relationship increases the possibility that one member of the group will contract a [[sexually transmitted infection]] and pass it into the group.

Neither [[Birth control#Barrier|barrier device]] use (such as [[condom]]s) nor more vigilant [[STI testing]] and vaccination can eliminate such risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatcher|first1=Robert Anthony|last2=M.D|first2=Anita L. Nelson|title=Contraceptive Technology|date=2007|publisher=Ardent Media|isbn=9781597080019|pages=297–311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=txh0LpjjhkoC&amp;pg=PA297|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918185600/https://books.google.com/books?id=txh0LpjjhkoC&amp;pg=PA297|archivedate=2017-09-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can reduce the statistical increase attributable to nonmonogamy.

==Successful open relationships==
One of the most significant factors that aids a relationship in being successful is that it is about making the relationship fit the needs of all parties involved. No two open relationships will be the same, and the relationship will change due to the current circumstances at each specific moment. The style of the open relationship will mirror the parties' involved values, goals, desires, needs and philosophies.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

The most successful relationships have been those that take longer to establish. By taking the time to develop a clear idea of what both partners want out of the openness of a relationship, it allows the parties involved to self-reflect, process their emotions, deal with possible conflicts, and (for those transitioning from monogamy to nonmonogamy) find ways to cope with the change.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

Negotiating the details of the open relationship is important throughout the communication process. Topics that are commonly found in negotiations between couples include honesty, the level of maintenance, trust, boundaries and time management.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

Other tools that couples utilize in the negotiation process include allowing partners to [[veto]] new relationships, prior permission, and interaction between partners. This helps to reassure each partner in the relationship that their opinion is important and matters. However, although ability to veto can be a useful tool in negotiation, a successful negotiation and open relationship can still occur without it. Some reject veto power because they believe it limits their partner from experiencing a new relationship and limits their freedom.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

===Boundaries===
Types of boundaries include physical, which is along the lines of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable to the members of the relationship. They also help people to feel safe and that they are just as important in the open relationship as their partners.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

Examples of boundaries that are set could include:&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;
* Who (geographically and interpersonally, such as in the community, friends, family, et cetera) could be an additional partner;
* What types of physical limits are placed on that relationship (kissing, dating, or other sexual activities);
* Whether sexual relations will take place in a separate bedroom, playroom or premises (eg hotel).

Some couples create a physical relationship contract. These can be useful in not only negotiating, but also clearly articulating the needs, wants, limits, expectations, and commitments that are expected of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

===Time management===
Adequate [[time management]] can contribute to the success of an open relationship. Even though having a serious commitment with one partner is common, negotiating the time spent among all partners is still important. Although the desire to give an unlimited amount of love, energy, and emotion to others is common, the limited amount of time in a day limits the actual time spent with each partner. Some find that if they cannot evenly distribute their time, they forego a partner.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt; Time management can also be related to [[equity theory]], which stresses the importance of fairness in relationships.&lt;ref name="Watson" /&gt;

==Swinging==
{{main|Swinging (sexual practice)}}
Swinging is a form of open relationship in which the partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others at the same time. Swingers may regard the practice as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

Swingers who engage in casual sex maintain that sex among swingers is often more frank and deliberative and therefore more honest than infidelity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship. Swinging can take place in various contexts, including spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping at an informal social gathering of friends, a formal swinger party or partner-swapping party, and a regular gathering in a [[sex club]] (or swinger club) or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polyamory==
{{main|Polyamory}}

Polyamory is the practice, desire, or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and [[consent]] of everyone involved. It is often described as consensual, ethical, or responsible nonmonogamy. The word is sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to sexual or romantic relationships that are not sexually exclusive, though there is disagreement on how broadly it applies; an emphasis on ethics, honesty, and transparency all around is widely regarded as the crucial defining characteristic.

While "open relationship" is sometimes used as a synonym for "polyamory" or "polyamorous relationship", the terms are not synonymous. The "open" in "open relationship" usually refers to the sexual aspect of a nonclosed relationship, whereas "polyamory" refers to the extension of a relationship by allowing bonds to form (which may be sexual or otherwise) as additional long-term relationships.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

The terms "polyamory" and "[[Casual dating|friends with benefits]]" are fairly recent, having come about within the past few decades&lt;ref name="LinssenWik2010" /&gt; though [[non-monogamy]] has existed since [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times.

A subset of polyamory is [[group marriage]] or [[polyfidelity]]. This type of relationship functions as an expanded marriage, where no member is sexually or romantically involved with anyone other than the group's members.&lt;ref name="Taormino2008" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8087">'''Psychic distance''' is a perceived difference or distance between objects. The concept is used in [[aesthetics]], [[international business]] and marketing, and computer science.

Psychic distance is made up of the Greek word "psychikos – ψυχικός", an adjective referring to an individual's mind and [[soul]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson and Weiner 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and "distance" which implies differences between two subjects or objects. Some therefore argue that the concept exists in the mind's eye of the individual and it is their subjective perception that uniquely determines "psychic distance".&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As a result it is often viewed as a humanistic reflection of individual acuity and not a collective, organisational or societal perspective. However, in the international business context, psychic distance is frequently measured in terms of national averages&lt;ref&gt;Haakanson &amp; Ambos, Journal of International Management, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; or in terms of the national-level differences that influence those perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Dow &amp; Karunaratna, Journal of International Business Studies, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, King refers to his preference to use the term "aesthetic distance" rather than psychic distance, as he feels the latter term has misleading connotations in current usage.&lt;ref&gt;[1] Jerry P. King, ''The Art of Mathematics'', New York: Plenum, 1992, p.196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==

In 1912 [[Cambridge University|Cambridge's]] [[Edward Bullough]] wrote of it in a long paper entitled, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'' which appeared in the British Journal of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bullough, ''Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle'', British Journal of Psychology: 5 (1912), p87-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In this he set down in a reasonably complete manner the concept as it applied to the arts.

Evidently, he successfully influenced thinkers 50 years later. Donald Sherburne, for example, says, "Edward Bullough's psychical distance has become "a classic doctrine of aesthetic thinking."&lt;ref name=Sherburne&gt;Donald Sherburne, ''A Whiteheadean Aesthetic'', New York: Yale, 1961, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;  And James L. Jarrett writes of Bullough's ideas, "Perhaps no more influential idea has been introduced into modern aesthetics than that of psychical distance."&lt;ref name=Jarrett&gt;James L. Jarrett, ''The Quest for Beauty'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1957, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical distance construct has been used as an intercultural theme by the arts in the study of creative [[Emotional detachment|detachment]] between East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Odin 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such cameo appearances in other fields, the concept has been essentially "operationalised" by business with the marketing function acting as the chief curator.

==International business and marketing==

In international business (IB) and marketing settings, psychic distance is based on ''perceived'' differences between a home country and a "foreign" country regardless of physical time and space factors which differ across diverse cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Usunier and Lee ''Marketing across Cultures'', Essex, UK: Pearson Education, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subjective type of distance ("perceived differences") unlike the distances forming the CAGE framework, for instance &lt;ref&gt;Ghemawat (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;. This makes psychic distance very difficult to measure, and often times fallacious proxies are used to estimate it (e.g., Kogut &amp; Singh (1988) index using Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions). More accurate approaches rely on asking decision-makers their perceptions towards different host countries (e.g., Hakanson &amp; Ambos, 2010), or using its antecedents to estimate it (psychic distance stimuli: Dow &amp; Karunaratna, 2006). 

The business origins of the "psychic distance" idiom can be traced back to research conducted by Beckerman (1956) and Linnemann (1966). As a fully formed concept Vahlne and Wiedersheim-Paul (1973) as cited by Nordstrom and Vahlne (1992) described psychic distance as "factors preventing or disturbing the flow of information between potential or actual suppliers and customers." These factors are associated with country-based diversities and dissimilarities and can be grouped into four clear areas:

#Linguistic differences and translation difficulty.
#Cultural factors – societal norms, level of individualism or collectivism, values and customs.
#Economic situation – existing trading links, infrastructure, local conditions, competition and investor confidence.
#Political and legal system – government stability and risk of instability, import tariffs, legal protection and taxation levels.

Although the concept was fully formed by the early 1970s, it was the study of [[Norway|Nordic]] [[multinational corporation|multinationals]] by Johanson and Vahlne (1977) which followed on from two earlier studies in 1975 and 1976, that is generally accepted as the concept's real genesis.&lt;ref&gt;Sousa and Bradley 2005b&lt;/ref&gt; The studies concluded that a firm's international activities relate directly to psychic distance and that further international expansion progresses into markets with successively greater psychic distance.

In summary, companies tend to initially export to countries that they understand; then build on their acquired experience to explore opportunities further afield. In other words, firms enter new markets where they are able to identify opportunities with low market uncertainty then enter markets at successively greater psychic distance.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson and Vahlne, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, contemporary literature on the internationalisation process cites psychic distance as a key variable and determinant for expansion into foreign markets.

== Other IB approaches to measuring psychic distance ==

The psychic distance has also on occasion been measured through formative indicators such as strong commercial relations, close political relations, historic ties, geographic ties, social ties, country information stock, level of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Psychic distance and Australian export market selection|last = Brewer|first = Paul|date = 2007|journal = Australian Journal of Management|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These indicators are deeply analyzed for the international market selection. The measurement of these indicators is best accomplished through an index construction. However, the formative indicators are very context dependent. If they were applied to different industries, countries and entry modes, the indicators would have shifted dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Developing a multidimesional instrument to measure psychic distance stimuli|last = Dow &amp; Karunaratna|first = |date = 2006|journal = Journal of International Business Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==

More recently, Gairola and Chong&lt;ref name=gairolachong&gt;Dhruv Gairola and Siang Yew Chong, "An Economics-Inspired Noise Model in Spatial Games with Reputation", Advances in Intelligent Modelling and Simulation: Artificial Intelligence-based Models and Techniques in Scalable Computing, Studies in Computational Intelligence, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg, vol. 422, pp. 271-293 (2012)  [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d6kj4p2348k01148/]&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated psychic distance to simulate more realistic noise models in spatial games, leading to interesting results, including a manifestation of the psychic distance paradox.

[[File:1931 Act ed.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Architects Act 1997]] imposes restrictions on the use of the name, style or title "architect" in connection with a business or a professional practice, and for that purpose requires a statutory [[Register of Architects]] to be maintained. The [[Architects Registration Board]] constituted under the Act is responsible for '''Architects Registration in the United Kingdom''' and is required to publish the current version of the Register annually. Every person who is entitled to be registered under the Act has the right to be entered in the Register. The Act consolidated previous enactments originating with the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 as amended by the Architects Registration Act 1938]]. It applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Section 2 of the Act prescribes that the Board shall appoint and regulate the functions ascribed to the '''Registrar'''. The Act refers to the Registrar by the masculine [[pronoun]] in the singular, but by the usual rules of [[statutory interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; this is not limited to an individual male person.

An [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment]] under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] came into force on 20 June 2008.

The recurring controversy about whether statutory protection of title serves useful purposes has been intensified by the legislative impact of the [[EU Directive]] on [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Unfair Commercial Practices]] implemented in May 2008 by two [[Statutory Instrument]]s under the European Communities Act 1972, namely No 1276 ([[Trade Descriptions Act 1968|Trade Descriptions]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081276_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1276]&lt;/ref&gt; and No 1277 ([[Consumer Protection]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081277_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1277]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006], "regulatory function" is defined in subsection 32(2).

==Use of the title "architect"==

Under subsection 20(1) of the [[Architects Act 1997]], a person in the [[United Kingdom]] may only practise or carry on business under any name, style or title containing the word "[[architect]]" if registered. There is no restriction on its use in any other circumstance. The words in the current Act follow those of the 1938 Architects Registration Act under which it was decided that the use of the suffix "FRIBA" in business notepaper constituted an infringement.

By subsection 20(3) corporate bodies, firms or partnerships can carry on business under a name, style or title containing the word "architect" provided that (in broad terms) the architectural business is run by a registered person. However the statutory registration Board may (by rules made under subsection 20(4) – see General Rules, Rule 25) effectively limit the application of subsection 20(3) to those corporate bodies firms or partnerships who have supplied information necessary for determining whether the architectural business is run by a registered person.

The rule-making power under subsection 20(4) appears to be limited to prescribing particular information to be provided to the Board viz. "such information necessary for statutory registration determining whether [subsection 20(3)] applies". The subsection makes no provision for levying any fee.

==Background to legislation==

===Up to the 1990s===

Opinions had been divided for well over a century about the merits of statutory registration of architects in the United Kingdom. The result was that Parliament, as the legislator and guided by the government of the day, has had to maintain a state of benevolent neutrality among the holders of these contending views, consistent with more general public policies for business competition, employment, professional education and so on. In relation to statutory protection of title, three aspects of the field in which architects practise invite examination. In summary:

* ''The design quality of the built environment'': this is essentially a cultural concern which was and remains one of the principal reasons for the formation and continuance of the Royal Institute of British Architects as a chartered body. It has connotations not only for the United Kingdom but world wide. It is beyond the ambit of statutory protection of title.
* ''The technical sufficiency of buildings'': the public interest is secured in the United Kingdom under Building Regulations and other enactments. This too is beyond the statutory protection of the title "architect".
* ''The business of architectural practice'': contracts of engagement for professional services are always between a business entity (whether individual, firm, partnership, or company) and the client, and are governed by the general law, including consumer protection legislation where applicable. Protection of the title ‘architect’ for business entities is of no practical relevance for securing the performance of architectural services.

In the light of experience since the inception of the Register under the 1931 Act, and more particularly under the Architects Registration Board’s regime from 1997, the recurring question has been whether protection of title serves useful purposes in respect of the three aspects mentioned above. The question of obsolescence has been further intensified by the [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], effective from 2007.

Statutory registration had its origin within the architectural profession in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was then (as now) a matter of controversy. However, by 1905 the [[RIBA]] had established a policy to secure satisfactory training of architects by statutory means.

The basis of the policy (on registration) had always been that the profession was governed by voluntary associations of practising architects and that the profession would retain control of registration. This was reflected in the composition of the registration body (the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] - [[ARCUK]]) established by the 1931 Act. Shortly after, in the book published on occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''The Growth and Work of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' edited by J. A. Gotch PPRIBA [[John Alfred Gotch]]

.&lt;/ref&gt; in the concluding paragraphs of the chapter on statutory registration.,&lt;ref&gt;In this chapter the author includes an informative account of the history of registration quoting extensively an article published in the ''RIBA Journal'' of 8 August 1931 by Charles MacArthur Butler, Secretary of the RIBA Registration Committee and first Registrar to ARCUK.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Barnes FRIBA., Chairman of the Registration Committee, wrote -

:''" ... I do not conceive the purpose of the Registration Act to be that of protecting the Architectural profession. The interests of the Profession are of course legitimate but are best served by the Architectural Associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture are to be found.''

:''"The object of the Registration Act is to ensure to the public that the architects they employ possess capacity and character.''

:''"Under the purview of the [[Board of Architectural Education]] no one will enjoy the title of '[[Registered Architect]]' without giving evidence of his capacity, and under that of the Discipline Committee no one will retain the title whose character has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.''

:''"The [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] can never, therefore, on this view be a rival of any Architectural Association and least of all of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].''

:''"The Architects' Registration Council stands at the gateway of the realm of Architectural practice, but within that realm the affairs of the Architect are best administered by those voluntary Associations to which he has allied himself and over the actions of which he has complete control."''

After more than half a century times have changed and a regime of quite another kind has been installed under the 1997 Act.

===From the 1990s===

By the 1990s it was almost universally accepted that the time had come to bring the statutory Architects' Registration Council as it then was to an end. Opinion within the profession was divided among those who held that statutory registration should be discontinued altogether and those who held that the registration body should be reconstituted.

In the event the body was reconstituted as the Architects Registration Board (1996/1997 Acts). But it was only after the event that many in the profession came to appreciate the effect of the new requirement that the majority of the Board should be non-architects and appointed by the government, as the following quotation shows:

:"''Crucially, professional control of the Register was taken away by the government's decision which was realised in the 1996/97 Act. This had not been generally expected by those of the membership who before then had been in favour of continuing protection of the title '[[architect]]'. The significance and effect of the change is now becoming more widely understood.''" (Report of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Council's Task Group on the [[Architects Registration Board]], September 2004.)

===Statutory Registration – chronology of key events===

'''''1834''''' - The body which was to become the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (originally known as the Institute of British Architects in London) was formed by [[Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey]] and several prominent architects. (After the grant of the charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.)&lt;ref&gt;about the RIBA Charter and Byelaws {{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426122320/http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} |Text of the Charter and Byelaws

'''''1837''''' - It was granted its [[Royal Charter]] under [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

'''''1884''''' - [[Society of Architects]] formed, after a campaign by a group of ARIBA to be allowed to vote on RIBA affairs had been resisted by FRIBA.

'''''1887''''' - Architects and Engineers Registration Act Committee formed as an independent committee to promote a bill for registration of architects, engineers and surveyors. The bill was withdrawn after chief bodies representing engineers petitioned against it.

'''''1889 &amp; 1891''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee put forward bills for registration of architects, which were strongly supported by the [[Society of Architects]] but opposed by an independent group of prominent architects and artists.

'''''1892''''' - Papers published, defining the profession of architecture:
:[[Norman Shaw]] and [[T. G. Jackson|T G Jackson]] (eds.) "Architecture, A Profession or an Art".
:[[William H. White (architect)|William H White]] "''The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art''".

'''''1902''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee amalgamated with the Society of Architects as a joint Registration Committee.

'''''1905''''' - RIBA Education Policy was adopted for statutory powers to secure satisfactory training for architects by way of registration of title, by and through the RIBA.

'''''1908''''' - RIBA Licentiate Class formed, for architects who could show evidence of competence, without exams. On closure in 1913, over 2000 had been accepted.

'''1924-1959''' - RIBA Standing Registration Committee.

'''''1925''''' - Amalgamation of [[RIBA]] and [[Society of Architects]]: most of the [[Society of Architects]] members transferred to Licentiate class, which was reopened.

'''''1927''''' - RIBA Registration Committee has draft bill introduced in Parliament, but opposed by the [[Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors]] and the [[Faculty of Architects and Surveyors]].

'''''1931''''' - Bill recast and enacted as the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, enabling the [[Register of Architects]] to be established under a statutory body called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK). The Council was to be made up of representatives of all architectural bodies in the [[United Kingdom]] in proportion to the numbers of their memberships on the Register, and representatives from government departments and related professional bodies. Under ARCUK, the RIBA system of exams etc. was accepted for registration. (The provisions of the Act constituting the [[Board of Architectural Education]] were repealed when ARCUK was reconstituted as ARB in 1996/7.)

'''''1937''''' - A letter is sent by "the president of the council" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognizing the fact that there was nothing in the Bill which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938) to interfere with the activities of registered architects. The letter is mentioned by
[[Lord Goddard]],Lord Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court in 1957 allowing the appeal of an architect (Hughes) against a professional miscondct decision of the Discipline Committee of ARCUK (later renamed [[Architects Registration Board]]), a case which becomes cited in later cases and in legal text-books as a judicial precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1938''''' - The Architects Registration Act, 1938 changed the protected title from "Registered Architect" to "Architect".

'''''1957''''' - Resulting from the 1938 legislation, an appeal by an architect against ARCUK is allowed by the High Court in a case which becomes a judicial precedent, ''Hughes v. Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom'': "It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful."—Devlin J. ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]])&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1992''''' - Government, in response to a request from ARCUK, commissioned review of the Architects Registration Acts by an independent assessor (John Warne).

'''''1993''''' - [[Warne Report]] published - principal recommendation: abolition of protection of title "architect" and disbanding of ARCUK. RIBA Council initially supported this recommendation, but this was resisted by the RIBA membership. As a result RIBA campaigned for the retention of protection of title with a "stream-lined" registration board.

'''''1996''''' - Part III of [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]], among other things, reconstituted the registration body as the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

'''''1997''''' - Architects Act 1997, a consolidating act, brought together the provisions of Part III of the 1996 Act and previous registration legislation. The Architects Registration Board then established with a majority of appointed lay members and a minority of elected Architect members.

'''''2008''''' - [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==The present legislation==

===Summary of legislative history===

The following analysis of the operative and other parts of the Architects Act 1997 as it was before the [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment of June 2008]] pays attention to details which sometimes go unnoticed.

The Act is fairly short. That is partly due to its conciseness, but this quality makes it all the more necessary to remember that the Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the meaning and effect of its various parts. Care is needed not to read into it what is not there (whatever conventional wisdom may have supposed or desired), and not to fail to notice what actually is there. In particular, like many such Acts, it can be better understood by looking at its beginning (Arrangement of Sections and long title) and its end (derivations), as well as the operative part in between.

Its long title is "An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects". The Table of Derivations printed at the end lists the enactments which it consolidated; and Schedule 3 lists the originating and two amending Acts which it repealed, namely: the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Architects Registration Act 1938 and parts of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.

The unbroken continuity of these enactments is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2:

:''"the Council" means the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''

The changes made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act as amended can be deduced from the Table of Derivations. This also shows that, for the purpose of the consolidation, certain definitions were inserted in the "Interpretation" section. These included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not vice versa). In subsection 14(1) the phrase is expanded as: "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

===The "burdens" and "choices"===

The scheme of the consolidation Act of 1997 is identical with that of the originating Act of 1931, as amended. It is as follows:

:It operates by imposing (under Part IV) one kind of burden, backed by threat of penal sanction, on persons carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]] generally, but at the same time giving to one particular group of persons a statutory right to choose instead to submit to another kind of burden, and to another group of persons the statutory right to choose to submit to a third kind of burden.&lt;ref&gt;For the statutory meaning of "burden" see: s.1(5)(b) of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940040_en_1.htm Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994]; s.2 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010006.htm Regulatory Reform Act 2001], and s.1 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the first is described as the "general burden"; the other two as the "voluntary burdens"; and the freedom to choose the "statutory choices".

The general burden is a prohibition imposed on all persons, firms, partnerships and bodies corporate carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]], including architects and [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architects]]. The prohibition is against practising or carrying on business under the title of "[[architect]]", with two exceptions, viz.:

:*In the case of an individual, s/he has opted for one of the voluntary burdens and is registered or enrolled under the Act.

:*In the case of a business entity (body corporate, firm or partnership) it has opted for the other of the voluntary burdens, in that its business so far as it relates to architecture satisfies the statutory requirement to be under the control, management and supervision of a registered person.

Here, the first of these is described as a "practice volunteer", and the second as a "business volunteer".

The statutory choice is exercisable:

:*In the case of a practice volunteer, by applying for registration in the [[Register of Architects]] and paying the annual retention fee (under sections 4 to 11), or by enrolling in the statutory list of visiting EEA architects (under section 12).

:*In the case of a business volunteer, by complying with the control, management and supervision requirements (of subsection 20(3)).

The voluntary burdens which result from the exercise of the statutory choice are as follows:

:*In the case of a registered person, to submit to the regime imposed on registered persons under sections 4 to 11 of Part II (payment of fees and satisfying requirements about qualifications and competence) and Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a person enrolled in the list of visiting EEA architects, to submit to the regime of section 12 and of Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a business volunteer, to submit to the regime for control, management and supervision imposed by subsection 20(3) and be liable to supply the Board with information showing compliance.

In consequence:

:*any person or business entity is free to supply services of the same kind as a registered person, but may only use the title "[[architect]]" in this connection subject to one of the voluntary burdens; and

:*a [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architect]] may only use this title in the course of professional practice if s/he has opted to submit to one of the voluntary burdens, normally as a registered person.

===Side effects===

A side effect of the Act is the imposition of burdens on third parties under Part II, namely, [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]], but the effect of the changes made by the 1996 Act is that Schools of Architecture have disappeared from the legislation without trace. The result has been a certain amount of wrangling between the Schools, the ARB and the RIBA which is the principal professional body, whose concerns inevitably include architectural education.

Another side effect has been a claim by the ARB to be able to impose on registered persons certain requirements about Professional Indemnity Insurance.

===The Board and its duties===

The membership of the Board is the result of one of the changes made by the 1996 Act to the registration body's previous constitution when its name had been the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The Act abolished the [[Board of Architectural Education]], renamed the Council as the Board, and made this Board consist predominantly of persons appointed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

Subsection 3(4) states "The Board shall publish the current version of the Register annually...". Provisions of Part II of the Act prescribe how the Register shall be kept up to date, and who shall be entitled to be registered; other provisions of Parts II and III prescribe for the Board the circumstances, events or conditions when a person's name shall be removed from the Register; and other provisions prescribe for the Board certain ancillary, or derivative and secondary, duties in connection with the Board's primary responsibility for the maintenance and regular publication of the [[Register of Architects]].

Apart from officers, employees and agents of the Board, the Act creates no duties or obligations towards the Board which fall on any one else at all; and nothing in the Act itself creates any obligation which an architect owes to the Board.

===Not delegated===

Section 20 of the Architects Act 1997 mentions "architecture" (subsection (3)(b)) and the "services" of a person enrolled under the Act (subsection (5)). These are not defined by the Act, and it is quite obvious that [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] has not delegated to the Board the power to define them. In practice, as technology and the building process continue to evolve new specialisms, the concept of architecture can be seen as becoming ever more fluid, extensive and comprehensive, and at the same time becoming narrower while ever more ancillary specialities are identified.

==The Board's Professional Conduct Committee==

Sanctions are available to the Board under Part III of the Act against any person on the register who is found guilty under section 15 of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence, or else has been convicted with a criminal offence which has relevance to fitness to practise.

Although a criminal conviction is an objective criterion, no statutory definition is given that defines the level of professional conduct or incompetence that will attract a sanction, judgment in the matter being given to the Board's Professional Conduct Committee, subject to commonsense, reason and judicial review.

The PCC is constituted under the Act, Schedule 1 Part II, as amended. The Committee includes members of the Board, both elected and appointed, as well as persons appointed by the Board and nominees of the President of the Law Society. A bare quorum of the Committee meets for a disciplinary hearing, comprising a nominee of the President of the Law Society (invariably a [[solicitor]]), a person from the Register and another not on the Register. PCC members are paid for their service.

==Categorisation==
The [[Architects Registration Board]] is admittedly not a professional body or society in the sense explained in Wikipedia article "[[British Professional Bodies]]". The question whether or not it is a "[[regulatory agency]]" was publicly considered in 2003. The June 2003 issue of the ''[[RIBA Journal]]'' included the following:

:''"The words 'regulator' and 'regulation' are not used in the Act and that status is not conferred upon the Board. It could be argued that the Board's assumption of this role is adverse to the public interest... A contrary proposition to the Board's claim is that an essential characteristic of a regulatory body in this context is to have jurisdiction or control over particular functions or activities in the supply of goods or services... whether or not the regulatory method is in conjunction with a system of certificating or licensing (such as applies to solicitors or places of entertainment)... The Board's claim to regulatory status appears to be the result of want of understanding how it can usefully go about fulfilling the services that have been assigned to it by statute for the public benefit..."''&lt;ref&gt;''RIBA Journal'', June 2003, referred to on page 1 of ''The Status of the Architects Registration Board.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003 the [[Architects Registration Board]] published a summary of a barrister's opinion which included the following:

:''"The Board as 'Regulator'. It has been suggested that the Board is not a 'regulator' of the architects’ profession... The precise generic description that any individual chooses to give to the collection of statutory duties imposed upon, and the powers available to, the Board under the 1997 Act is in any event irrelevant for the purposes of the questions asked,"'' [by the Board when obtaining this information for its own use] ''"for they largely involve issues of statutory interpretation which require the legislation to be construed and not given epithets."''&lt;ref&gt;For curbs on regulatory functions, see the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative &amp; Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and its Explanatory Note].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of "Chartered Practice"==

The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], which is a professional body (see Wikipedia category list [[British Professional Bodies]]), operates a voluntary "Chartered Practice" scheme. The use of the title "Chartered Practice" is authorised under Article 4.7 of the RIBA Charter (see reference below). The Institute's website explains that the scheme requires all architectural work of a Chartered Practice to be under the supervision of a Chartered Architect. A directory listing Chartered Practices has been published annually by the Institute from 2007.

==Qualification for registration==

The standard of qualification is not equal for all persons applying to be included in the [[Register of Architects]].

The Registrar is bound, under section 4 of the Architects Act, to register any person who applies for registration if that person has "such qualifications and has gained such practical experience as may be prescribed".

An alternative route to registration is to satisfy the Board that an equivalent standard of competence has been achieved. A matrix can be applied as follows:

{| border="1"
! Qualifications !! Practical experience !! RIBA Part III
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in UK
| ''Required''
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in UK
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|}

The disparity arises from the [[European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Qualifications in Architecture 85/384/EC. (Go to Article 4 of the main text for the required duration of training. The original Directive has been updated.) It is clearly stated in that Directive that "the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time".

As this is a minimum requirement there is nothing to stop a country applying higher standards to those obtaining qualifications and experience within its own jurisdiction. However it is widely held (and expressed in the report of Michael Highton to the RIBA Council) that any challenge to this disparity is likely to succeed on the grounds of irrationality. The report stated:

:''"In our view it is only a matter of time before a UK student, who has been denied registration on the grounds that he or she has not passed the Part 3 examination, yet who has been educated in the UK and achieved two years practical experience in the UK, successfully challenges such a decision on the basis that it is irrational to require a UK based student to possess a higher level of qualification and experience than is required of a non-UK based student or architect."''

If the Architects Registration Board reduced the registration requirement to four years full-time study, there is no reason why the RIBA should lower its entry standard.

==Break in annually produced copies of the Register==
At a time when there had occurred a hiatus in production under the legislation of printed copies of the Register in the annual series from 1933, the [[Architects Registration Board]] made a new departure and in 2012 announced an online version of the Register which registered persons were invited to use for demonstrating their professionalism to members of the public and to non-registered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architects-register.org.uk/ The Register of Architects] and as explained in ARB ebulletin of May 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www2.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120604184515/http%3A//www.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahesh Sharma]] said, "In view of religious tourism, Ramdevera and Tanot would also be linked to a tourism circuit in western Rajasthan."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Small cities to be linked with air services: Sharma |url=http://wap.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/small-cities-to-be-linked-with-air-services-sharma-116021200523_1.html |work=[[Business Standard]] |date=12 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious tourism has been one of the reason of developing India. India is widely known for its wonderful religious places which are nowhere seen in world. Many places like '''Kashi Vishwanath, Omkareshwar, Mahakaleshwar, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath of lord Shiva are most visited places in India. Even people from USA and UK come to India to visit these places.'''

In ''[[Star Trek]]'' a '''replicator''' is a machine capable of creating (and [[recycling]]) objects. Replicators were originally seen used to synthesize meals on demand, but in later series they took on many other uses.

==Origins and limitations==

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 3em;"&gt;[[File:Star Trek Replicator and 3D printer.svg|600px|A Star Trek replicator in comparison with a contemporary [[3D-Printer]]]]&lt;/div&gt;

Although previous sci-fi writers had speculated about the development of "replicating" or "duplicating" technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Confronting a New ‘Era of Duplication’? 3D Printing, Replicating Technology and the Search for Authenticity in George O. Smith’s Venus Equilateral Series |url=https://www.academia.edu/4071685/Confronting_a_new_Era_of_Duplication_3D_Printing_Replicating_Technology_and_the_Search_for_Authenticity_in_George_O._Smiths_Venus_Equilateral_Series |publisher=Durham University |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "replicator" was not itself used until ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In simple terms, it was described as a [[24th century]] advancement from the 23rd century "food synthesizer" seen in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]''.  In Star Trek the original series food was created in various colored cubes. In the animated series (1974), various types of realistic looking food could be requested as in the episode entitled "The Practical Joker". The mechanics of these devices were never clearly explained on that show. The subsequent prequel series, ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', set in the 22nd century, featured a "protein resequencer" that could only "replicate certain foods," so an actual chef served on board who used "a hydroponic greenhouse" where fruits and vegetables were grown. Additionally, that ship had a "bio-matter resequencer" which was used to recycle waste product into usable material.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'': "[[Breaking the Ice (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Breaking the Ice]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an academic thesis: "The so-called 'replicators' can reconstitute matter and produce everything that is needed out of pure energy, no matter whether food, medicaments, or spare parts are required."&lt;ref name="Schüller2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mieke Schüller|title=Star Trek - The Americanization of Space|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBPcY52oMAC&amp;pg=PA5|date=2 October 2005|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-638-42309-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A replicator can create any inanimate [[matter]], as long as the desired [[Molecule|molecular]] structure is on [[Computer file|file]], but it cannot create [[antimatter]], [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles#Fictional elements and materials|dilithium]], latinum, or a living [[organism]] of any kind; in the case of living organisms, non-canon works such as the ''Star Trek: the Next Generation Technical Manual'' state that, though the replicators use a form of transporter technology, it's at such a low resolution that creating living tissue is a physical impossibility.

In its theory it seems to work similarly to a [[Molecular assembler|universal assembler]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Theory==
A replicator works by rearranging [[subatomic particle]]s, which are abundant everywhere in the [[universe]], to form [[molecule]]s and arrange those molecules to form the object. For example, to create a [[pork chop]], the replicator would first form atoms of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc., then arrange them into amino acids, proteins, and cells, and assemble the particles into the form of a pork chop.

This process requires the destructive conversion of bulk matter into energy and its subsequent reformation into a pre-scanned matter pattern. In principle, this is similar to the [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transporter]], but on a smaller scale. However, unlike transporters, which duplicate matter at the quantum level, replicators must be capable of a large number of different materials on demand. If patterns were to be stored at the quantum level, an impossible amount of data storage (or a set of original copies of the materials) would be required. To resolve this, patterns are stored in memory at the molecular level.

The drawback of doing so is that it is impossible to replicate objects with complicated quantum structures, such as living beings, [[List of fictional elements, materials, isotopes and atomic particles#Fictional elements and materials|dilithium]], or latinum. In reality, living beings and/or cited elements are not necessarily more complex on a quantum level; the putative 'extra complexity' is used an in-universe function to head off questions such as 'why can't Starfleet replicate people?' {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the TNG episode "[[Allegiance (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Allegiance]]", aliens used their version of replicators to create a Picard impostor. Additionally, read/write errors cause a number of single-[[bit error]]s to occur in replicated materials. Though usually undetectable to human senses, computer scanning can be used to reveal these discrepancies, and they may explain the frequent complaint (by some [[gourmet]]s and [[connoisseur]]s) that replicated food and beverages suffer from substandard taste. These errors also may cause a nontoxic material to become toxic when replicated, or create strains of deadly viruses and bacteria from previously harmless ones.

==Uses==
One of the most important pieces of [[technology]] in the ''Star Trek'' universe, the replicator is used primarily to provide [[food]] and [[water]] on board [[starship]]s, thus eliminating the need to stock most provisions. (Starships, starbases, and other installations stock some provisions for emergency use, in case of replicator failure or an energy crisis.) On ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', it was established that as long as there is an energy source to power life support, replication is used to provide breathable [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] on ships and [[starbase]]s (and to disassemble the [[carbon dioxide]] exhaled by the [[crew]]), thus providing a seemingly endless supply of [[oxygen]] and eliminating the need to carry [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] tanks.

The technology is also used for producing spare parts, which makes it possible to repair most ship damage without having to return to a starbase.  Other applications include replication of [[Starfleet]] uniforms, as well as everyday objects such as toys and souvenirs. Replication is also used by the [[Holodeck]] [[Computer program|program]] to allow [[food]], [[Clothing|clothes]], and other objects belonging within a [[simulation]] to be used or consumed by the participants.

[[Starfleet]]'s safety protocols prevent unauthorized replication of dangerous objects, such as weapons and poisonous substances.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Death Wish (Star Trek: Voyager)|Death Wish]]". ''[[Star Trek: Voyager|Voyager]]'' Season 2. No. 18. [[UPN]]. February 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicators can also convert matter into energy. Following that principle, the device can dismantle any object into subatomic particles. The ensuing energy can then be stored for future use or immediately applied in a subsequent replication.  This process is referred to as "recycling", and is applied to everything from dirty dishes&lt;ref&gt;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, episode [[Hard Time (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|''Hard Time'']].&lt;/ref&gt; to outgrown children's clothes.

Replicator technology, even if produced on a larger scale, cannot be used to create complex objects such as shuttlecraft or starships (the production staff felt that being able to replicate entire starships "at the push of a button" would severely impact dramatic potential). However, in the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' episode [[For the Cause (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|"For the Cause"]], industrial replicators are used to replicate large components of ships, shuttlecraft, and other pieces of this sort, which are later used in shipyards to construct such vessels. In this manner, as few as 15 industrial replicators are enough to replicate the components needed to build a fleet of starships or to help a civilization recover from a planet-wide natural disaster.

By virtually eliminating material scarcity,  replicator technology plays an important role in the moneyless human economy within the ''Star Trek'' universe.

==''Voyager''==
When the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] was pulled to the [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)|Delta Quadrant]], it became clear that replicator technology was unknown to some of the indigenous peoples of that region.
Throughout the first seasons, the [[Kazon]] and other races tried repeatedly to obtain the technology.

[[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] feared that if this technology were acquired by a civilization before they were ready, disastrous consequences could ensue. For this reason, and because of the [[Prime Directive]], Janeway refused to give away the technology at any price.

Also on ''Voyager'', the ship's energy constraints on the journey back to the [[Galactic quadrant#Alpha Quadrant|Alpha Quadrant]] meant that replicator supplies had to be strictly controlled, leading to "replicator rations" becoming an unofficial ship currency. This is also the reason [[Neelix]] (aside from providing the crew with a morale boost through the preparation of fresh food) became employed as the ship's chef. Some ingredients came from the ship's [[hydroponics]] laboratory.

==In the real world==
In 2014, researchers at [[Nestlé]] were reported as working on technology comparable to the replicator, with the goal of providing food tailored to an individual's nutritional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/27996163|title=Nestle plans to create 'Star Trek-like food replicator'|date=24 June 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a ''Star Trek''-inspired Replicator-Emulator is proposed to robotically grow, print or assemble not only food, but also shelter, energy, transportation and even whole towns. #WPProjects assigned 250 renewable automation projects - one project to every country in the world - and it also laid out the important social programs needed to protect incomes and bolster economies as societies completed their 2-year Renewable Automations projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csq1.org/world-peace-transition-projects-faq/|title=WP Transition Projects create 'Star Trek replicator emulator'|date=25 December 2015|publisher=CSQ Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, [[3D printer]]s, which are now a mainstream technology and have a range of impressive and important capabilities (including shaping prostheses or making organs) are decidedly different, in that they do not create material "ex nihilo" (out of nothing), or perhaps more accurately, out of nuclei or atoms or programmed patterns of information, but instead, like regular printers, must use already pre-existing corporal material.

Also, 3D printers are limited in the materials that they can print. Currently only materials that can be easily fused together via [[extrusion]] or [[sintering]] processes can be used by 3D printer technology — generally plastics, metals, and clays. However [[Applications_of_3D_printing#Food|food]], concrete, and [[3D printing#Specialty materials|a few other materials]] have been successfully printed on a limited scale.

[[Imperial College London]] physicists have discovered how to [[Breit–Wheeler process|create matter from light]] - a feat thought impossible when the idea was first theorised 80 years ago. In just one day in Imperial's Blackett Physics Laboratory, three physicists worked out a relatively simple way to physically prove a theory first devised by scientists Breit and Wheeler in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;http://phys.org/news/2014-05-scientists-year-quest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

BeeHex, an Ohio startup company, received a grant in 2013 from NASA intended for developing long-spaceflight food 3D printing technology. They now build food printing robots for eventual public use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iflscience.com/technology/nasafunded-3d-pizza-printer-now-works-at-tourist-attractions/&lt;/ref&gt;

Cemvita Factory Inc., a biotech startup based in Houston, TX, is also developing a photobioreactor that converts Carbon Dioxide that's captured from air along with Hydrogen from hydrolyzing water to nutrients and pharmaceutics.&lt;ref&gt;http://https://www.cemvitafactory.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZb-AgjtnWM&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellistalton/2018/09/21/space-tech-startups-are-the-key-to-making-life-on-mars-possible/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sealab 2021''''' is an American [[adult animation|adult animated]] [[television series]] created by [[Adam Reed]] and [[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]]. It was shown on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late-night programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. Cartoon Network aired the show's first three episodes in December 2000 before the official inception of the Adult Swim block on September 2, 2001, with the final episode airing on April 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sealab 2021 Episode Guide|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/sealab-2021/episodes/|work=TV.com|accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C&amp;C - Sealab 2021 - "Legacy of Laughter" [4/24]|url=https://www.toonzone.net/forums/threads/c-c-sealab-2021-legacy-of-laughter-4-24.3870531/|work=[[Toon Zone]]|date=April 24, 2005|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sealab 2021'' is one of the four original [[Williams Street]] series that premiered in 2000 before Adult Swim officially launched, the others being ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', ''[[The Brak Show]]'' and ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''.

Much like Adult Swim's ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', the animation used stock footage from a 1970s [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[cartoon]], in this case the short-lived, [[Natural environment|environmentally]]-themed ''[[Sealab 2020]]'', along with original animation. The show was a satirical parody of the original ''Sealab'' series, and the conventions of 1970s animated children's series generally. While there was initial resistance from several of the original series' creators to the reuse of their characters, production moved forward on the series.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;Holman, Curt and Kuldell, Heather. [http://tampa.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?imageIndex=4&amp;oid=oid%3A5217 "Midnight Munchies with &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Adult Swim&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"] (2005-03-09) Access: 2009-12-29. Quote = "Do the original creators of Birdman or Sealab ever come up to you and say, 'What the hell did you do to my character?' Crofford: Actually, yes. Ouweleen: Yes, they're mad about it."&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sealab 2021'' was produced by [[70/30 Productions]], which eventually closed on January 9, 2009.

==Summary==
[[Adam Reed]] and [[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]], the creators and writers of ''Sealab 2021'', came up with the idea for the show in 1995 while they were [[production assistant]]s for Cartoon Network. They stumbled on a tape of the show ''[[Sealab 2020]]'', and wrote new dialogue. Cartoon Network passed on the show because they did not believe it was funny. Five years after quitting Cartoon Network, the two went back to the original tape, this time making the characters do what they wanted. Cartoon Network bought the show, coincidentally around the same time that Adult Swim was created.&lt;ref name="morphizm"&gt;{{cite web | title = Predictability is a Disease: Adam Reed and Matt Thompson, Sealab 2021 | url = http://www.morphizm.com/features/adult_mattandy.html | date = 2003-03-13 | accessdate = 2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original "pitch pilot" is available on the Season 1 DVD as a special feature.

Very few of the episodes of the series share any continuity or ongoing plot. For instance, the entire installation is destroyed at the end of many episodes, and crew members are often killed in horrible ways, only to return in the following episode. There are occasional running gags, such as the "Grizzlebee's" restaurant chain, the character of Sharko, and Prescott, the half-man, half-tentacle monster "from the network."  It contains many references to the pop culture of the 1980s–2000s, and makes use of other cartoons from the 1970s besides that on which it is based, such as 1973's ''[[Butch Cassidy (TV series)|Butch Cassidy]]'' for the on-screen appearances of the Sealab writers, and various one-off appearances of other characters.
 
Paul Di Filippo of the website ''Sci Fi Weekly'', in his review of the Season 3 DVD, felt that general fan opinion of the show declined sharply following the death of [[Harry Goz]] (the voice of Captain Hazel Murphy) during Season 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SCI FI Weekly: Review of Sealab 2021 Season-Three DVD | url = http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1956.html | date = 2005-11-21 | accessdate=2007-03-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126064402/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw1956.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After four seasons, the final episode aired on April 25, 2005.

==Characters==
* '''Captain Hazel "Hank" Murphy''' ([[Harry Goz]]) – is the ostensible leader of the crew, though his qualifications, and even his grasp on reality, are questionable. He is generally found loitering on the bridge neglecting his duties. Murphy spends his time participating in scams and juvenile antics and generally causing problems that the crew have to solve. The only episode which features Murphy acting responsibly throughout is "[[List of Sealab 2021 episodes#7211|7211]]", which is a faithful reenactment of the original ''[[Sealab 2020]]'' show. Captain Murphy is a parody of Captain Mike Murphy from ''Sealab 2020''. Generally, Murphy is incapable to the point of incompetence. On more than one occasion, it has been implied that Murphy has gone insane due to the amount of time he spent underwater. However, the crew either doesn't notice this or doesn't care and usually follow his orders, even when they will directly lead to the crew's deaths. Murphy is a practicing Alvian and has a deep seated fear of [[doppelgänger]]s and especially flashlights, the latter a fear that there is no name for. After the death of Harry Goz, Murphy was written out of the show by having him leave Sealab to fight in the "Great Spice Wars". It is implied that Murphy is the leader of the Rebel forces in this war, though the reasoning behind this is or its effect on the war are never delved into. A recap montage of Murphy's moments were played in the final episode in memory of this voice actor. However, he later appeared in ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', where he was voiced by [[Jon Hamm]] and debuted in the two-part episode "Sea Tunt".

* '''Captain Bellerophon "Tornado" Shanks''' (Michael Goz) – is a retired [[American football|football]] coach and health and hygiene teacher who lost his job for slapping (or throat punching) a student. He answered Sealab's help wanted ad and became the new captain, despite having no experience whatsoever. Shanks is from Texas and is the youngest of several brothers all named after characters in Greek mythology, and all of whom met their death on or around a bridge in Shanks's hometown. Dropping his Southern accent late in the series (citing that some viewers thought he was [[homosexuality|gay]]), Shanks' personality bears a resemblance to Captain Murphy, being voiced by Harry Goz's son. However, Shanks is much more self-aware than Murphy, openly commenting on the odd goings on aboard Sealab and even the fact that he is on a television program. Since Shanks has no experience or idea what he is doing, he goes along with whatever the rest of the crew suggests, usually with disastrous results. Captain Shanks debuted in the season 3 episode "Tornado Shanks".

* '''Jodene Sparks''' ([[Bill Lobley]]) – is the station's radio operator who is always seen sitting and with his headsets on. Sparks is a parody of Lieutenant Sparks from ''Sealab 2020''. Sparks mostly uses the radio for his own personal purposes, even going so far as to disconnect vital transmissions that interrupt him. He generally travels around in his office chair, either because he's crippled, or simply because he's lazy. Sparks is a convict serving time at Sealab while still operating a blackmarket distillery and takes part in a wide variety of other illegal activities. He occasionally serves as a voice of reason to the crew, particularly to Murphy. However, he is just as often the catalyst of problems aboard Sealab, including Sealab's destruction. He's [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] and a Malkin, the show's version of Wiccan. Sparks's quest for money has been in several plots; such as the murdering of the crew to collect on life insurance policies, the creation of Stimutacs to "make an assload of money", and his numerous underhand deals with Paddy O'Reilly and the various Daves. An early episode revealed that he acts as a criminal mastermind called "Overlord" with a hollowed out volcano base and an army of minions. Episode 46 reveals he enjoys hentai with themes of forced submission and humiliation. Rank: Commander

* '''Debbie "White Debbie" DuPree''' ([[Kate Miller]]) – is a marine biologist, and one of only two adult females on the base. Serving as a parody of Gail from ''Sealab 2020'', she is a blonde and is often the object of the sexual interest of the males on Sealab. She has an ongoing sexual relationship with Doctor Quinn, and their relationship and its ups and downs and its effect on the rest of the crew plays out in several stories. When she's on the outs with Quinn, the other males, particularly Stormy, attempt to get on her good side. Debbie's mood swings are a constant issue to the crew, as she changes wildly from the sole voice of reason to a shrieking lunatic. Debbie picked up the "White Debbie" appellation at the behest of Doctor Quinn, who thought it was unfair that Debbie Love went by "Black Debbie" while Debbie Dupree was simply Debbie. Nevertheless, few of the crew actually call her that. Rank: Lieutenant Commander

* '''Derek "Stormy" Waters''' ([[Ellis Henican]]) – is a pretty boy lacking in intelligence or seemingly any qualifications to be working on a government research lab, and a parody of Hal from ''Sealab 2020''. Stormy's job is never clearly defined and he usually walks around Sealab doing whatever he wants, or acts as a henchman or assistant to whomever he is nearest to. Stormy usually works alongside Quinn, who frequently is the victim of Stormy's ignorance, but is ironically the most tolerant of him. Stormy has shown skill in the operation of the submersible Deep Diver, both as a pilot and gunner, as well as operating other technological gadgets, though he is just as irresponsible in those positions as anywhere else. The crew has been shown to dislike or mistreat Stormy on multiple occasions, such as putting a sign outside the mess hall saying "No Stormies" when they held a pizza party or forgetting that he was trapped outside of the closet with Murphy's dogs. Stormy is a proudly practicing Alvian, like Murphy. Of all characters, Stormy is the most different in the episode "[[List of Sealab 2021 episodes#7211|7211]]". In the episode, he directs the rest of the crew effectively in the salvage of the damaged sub. He is allergic to shellfish. Rank: Lieutenant Commander

* '''Dr. Quentin Q. Quinn''' ([[Brett Butler (voice actor)|Brett Butler]]) – is the science officer. Parodying Ed from ''Sealab 2020'', he is an African-American who is extremely intelligent, with an IQ of 260 and Ph.D.s in several scientific disciplines, which he is not shy about reminding the other characters of. Quinn grew up in unbelievably over-the-top poverty and got to where he is through hard work, unlike the majority of the other characters. He is regarded as an uptight killjoy by most of the crew. Quinn is often the only responsible crew member and the sole voice of reason. This has caused the other crew to neglect their duties even further, as they believe "Quinn will handle it". Despite his intelligence, Quinn is extremely vain and prone to outbursts of anger when he is not appreciated. Quinn often attempts to prevent Murphy's questionable plans from being enacted, leading Murphy to distrust Quinn. However, Murphy is aware that he and the station completely depend on Quinn, going so far as to snake his vacation to ensure that he didn't leave the station. Quinn has an ongoing sexual relationship with Debbie Dupree. In the first episode, he revealed that he inhabits a robot body of his own design. Rank: Lieutenant Commander

* '''Marco Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar Gabriel Garcia Marquez''' ([[Erik Estrada]]) – is the station's engineer. Spoofing Dr. Paul Williams from ''Sealab 2020'', he is very strong and muscular, unlike the rest of the crew. He speaks with a Spanish accent and often exclaims random things in Spanish, although not actually speaking the language. Quinn even remarks that his Spanish is terrible. His name comes from both the Spaniard epic 11th-century poem ''[[Cantar del Mio Cid]]'', which featured the character [[El Cid|Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar]], and from the 1982 Literary Nobel Prize winner journalist and novelist [[Gabriel García Márquez]]. Marco's exact heritage is unknown, though he is fiercely not a Spaniard. Marco is prone to violence, both in the defense of the crew and against them. Marco often argues with Murphy about his methods and seems to be the only one Murphy actually listens to. Despite this, Murphy often calls Marco "mailbox head" and included a segment on his radio show where listeners could call in to tell him why they hated Marco. Marco gets along with most of the crew, especially Sparks and Quinn. Marco also interacts with the orphans on Sealab and has been shown to have a soft side. Rank: Lieutenant Commander

* '''Hesh Hepplewhite''' ([[MC Chris]]) – is the station's reactor operator and more often than not their whipping boy. Hesh has a habit of continually referring to himself in the third person. It was revealed that he is [[Jew]]ish. Nasal-voiced, smart-mouthed, and whiny, Hesh is not well liked by most of the crew and thus works in the part of the station farthest away from them. He has no real understanding of how the reactor works and generally has to have guidance from Quinn when there is a problem. Hesh's own interactions with the machinery are generally useless or actively destructive, such as the "hammer game", which involves smashing the computers with a hammer. Hesh generally doesn't participate in the crew's activities unless he interrupts on the radio. Hesh performs the birthday song at Quinn's birthday and acts as Murphy's caddie. Hesh's safety is not a concern to any of the characters, as Murphy sent him into the reactor core to recover a ball. As a result of being isolated in the reactor, Hesh has developed odd tendencies, such as dressing as a woman on multiple occasions. Rank: Lieutenant

* '''Debbie "Black Debbie" Allison Love''' (Angela Gibbs) – is both the only other adult female and the only black female on the station. She teaches school to the Sealab's orphans and is very proud of her race. She has a relationship with Marco at the beginning of the show and briefly dates Sparks and Tornado in the later seasons. In one episode, her name is displayed on a monitor as Debbie Allison; but in another her nameplate is shown as Debbie Love. She is a former [[Heisman trophy]] winner. Rank: Lieutenant
* '''Dr. Ilad Virjay''' ([[Adam Reed]]) – is the station's official doctor and in-house surgeon, noted for his thick Indian accent and relatively normal personality. He graduated third in his class from The Medical College of Mescutabuti. He practices Manduism, the Sealab universe's version of [[Hinduism]]. Dr. Virjay is shown to be jealous of Dr. Quinn as the latter has multiple Ph.Ds and a higher IQ. Dr. Virjay delivers all his lines in a deadpan, whether informing crew members of medical issues or confronting an invisible monster shortly before his death. It is later revealed that he is also janitor for Sealab's restaurant section. Rank: Unknown

* '''Dolphin Boy''' – is a little chubby boy that speaks in [[dolphin]] noises. One of the orphans that inhabit Sealab for some reason, he is a member of Black Debbie's class. Dolphin Boy often wanders around the station and as a result is often embroiled in whatever is going on. When translated, Dolphin Boy generally says inoffensive, naively childish statements, universally resulting in derision and hatred from the rest of the crew. He is the target of endless fat jokes, and is often killed for no reason whatsoever by the Sealab crew members. He is the [[persona non grata]] of Sealab. Rank: Lieutenant Jr. Grade
* '''Sharko''' ([[Matt Thompson (animator)|Matt Thompson]]) – is a half-human, half-shark freak of nature who is the result of Marco having sexual relations with a female [[shark]]. Rank: Shark

'''Sense about Science''' is a UK charity that promotes the [[Public awareness of science|public understanding of science]]. Sense about Science was founded in 2002 by [[Lord Taverne]], [[Bridget Ogilvie]] and others to promote respect for [[scientific evidence]] and [[Scientific method|good science]]. Sense about Science was established as a [[charitable trust]] in 2003, with 14 trustees, an advisory council and a small office staff. Tracey Brown has been the director since 2002.&lt;ref name="Team" /&gt;

Sense about Science aims to work with scientists, journalists and others to ensure that scientific evidence is at the forefront of public discussions about science, and to correct unscientific [[misinformation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/workshops.html Sense About Science 'Voice of Young Science' workshop], "Ellen Raphael talked about Sense about Science, discussing projects and the ways we correct misinformation with examples from the last five years."&lt;/ref&gt; They encourage and assist scientists to engage in public debates about their area of [[expert]]ise, to respond to scientifically inaccurate claims in the media, to help people contact scientists with appropriate expertise, and to prepare briefings about the scientific background to issues of public concern.

== Projects ==

Sense about Science publishes guides to different areas of science in partnership with experts. These include: Making Sense of Uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making Sense of Uncertainty {{!}} The University of Manchester|url = http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=10295|website = www.manchester.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of Allergies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.allergyuk.org/blog/blog/post/200-sense-about-science-making-sense-of-allergies|title = Making Sense of Allergies|date = |accessdate = |website = Allergy UK|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of Drug Safety Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making sense of drug safety science|url = https://www.mrc.ac.uk/news/browse/making-sense-of-drug-safety-science/|website = www.mrc.ac.uk|date = 2014-03-04|accessdate = 2015-11-17|first = Medical Research Council,|last = MRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of Crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making sense of crime after an election full of crime fiction {{!}} The Alliance for Useful Evidence|url = http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/making-sense-of-crime-in-and-election-full-of-crime-fiction/|website = www.alliance4usefulevidence.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of Statistics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making Sense of Statistics {{!}} Straight Statistics|url = http://straightstatistics.fullfact.org/resources/making-sense-statistics|website = straightstatistics.fullfact.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making Sense of Screening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making Sense of Screening - Testing Treatments interactive|url = http://www.testingtreatments.org/making-sense-of-screening/|website = Testing Treatments interactive|accessdate = 2015-11-17|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Making Sense of GM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Making Sense of GM  {{!}} John Innes Centre|url = https://www.jic.ac.uk/news/2009/02/making-sense-of-gm/|website = www.jic.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense about Science maintains database of over 6,000 UK scientists willing to use their expertise to help inform public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About us ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/about-us.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs the ''Voice of Young'' Science programme to help early career scientists engage in public debates. Sense About Science hosts an annual lecture.

Since its founding, Sense about Science has contributed to UK public debates about such subjects as [[alternative medicine]], [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|"detoxification" products]] and [[detox diet]]s, [[genetically modified food]], [[avian influenza]], [[chemicals]] and health, "[[electrosmog]]", [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccination]], weather and [[Climate change|climate]], [[nuclear power]], and the use and utility of [[peer review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/health-and-medicine.html |title=Health &amp; Medicine |publisher=Sense About Science |accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense about Science encourages scientists to explain to the public the value of peer review in determining which reports should be taken seriously. Director Tracey Brown describes such critical thinking as crucial to preventing public [[Alarmism|health scares]] based on unpublished information.&lt;ref name=Butler2004&gt;{{Cite journal |

All Results Reported|url = http://www.alltrials.net/|website = AllTrials|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, the AllTrials petition has been signed by 91,989 people and 737 organisations.&lt;ref name="alltrials.net"/&gt;

=== Ask for Evidence ===
Ask for Evidence was launched by Sense About Science in 2011.

Chris Peters, Scientific Affairs Manager at Sense About Science, has said, 'If you ask people for evidence then they expect to be asked for evidence in the future'.&lt;ref name="ESP20"/&gt;  This can lead to a cultural shift in the organisation; they make sure they have the evidence from the start and are more evidence-based.

=== Keep Libel Laws Out of Science ===
Sense About Science  launched the Keep Libel Laws out of Science campaign in June 2009&lt;ref name="SAScience"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/keep-libel-laws-out-of-science.html Sign up now to keep the libel laws out of science!] ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; in defence of a member of its board of trustees,&lt;ref name="SAS_Board"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/board-of-trustees.html Board of Trustees,] ''Sense About Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; author and journalist [[Simon Singh]], who has been sued for [[libel]] by the [[British Chiropractic Association]].

In December 2009, Sense About Science, [[Index on Censorship]] and [[English PEN]] launched the Libel Reform Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Launch of the Libel Reform Campaign ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/launch-of-the-libel-reform-campaign.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Defamation Act 2013]] received Royal Assent on 25 April 2013 and came into force on 1 January 2014.

The Trust actively campaigns in support of various causes. It has issued a statement signed by over 35 scientists&lt;ref name="Letter to WHO"&gt;[http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/docs/VOYSlettertoWHO.doc Letter to WHO, signed by at least 35 scientists], ''Sense About Science''&lt;/ref&gt; asking the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] to condemn [[homeopathy]] for diseases such as HIV.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;Sample, Ian (1 June 2009).[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/01/world-health-organisation-homeopathy-hiv "British scientists ask WHO to condemn homeopathy for diseases such as HIV"].

&lt;!--(No good references available for this piece)-Sense About Science organised a  climate change conference,&lt;ref name=climate/&gt; which resulted in stories warning against the exaggeration and 'Hollywoodisation' of climate change, and the publication of a report "Making Sense of Climate Change". The authors of this report said they firmly believe global warming is happening and man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are a significant cause. But warned that exaggeration of the problems confused the public and made it easier to argue that the scientists were wrong.

== Funding ==

Sense about Science's principal funding is through grants and donations in respect of its core aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Charity overview|url = http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1146170&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its funding policy it states: "Donations do not entitle any individual or organisation to decision-making authority. External funding will not divert Sense About Science from its agreed aims and values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Our funding policy ·  Sense about Science|url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/our-funding-policy.html|website = www.senseaboutscience.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the trust has been increasing. Some is derived from industrial organizations engaged in scientific dispute, clinical trials and research for which SAS is supportive (e.g. genetically modified crops) as well as major publishing houses. For example, for the fiscal year ending 5 April 2008, the trust received £145,902 in donations. Disclosed corporate donations comprised £88,000 with pharmaceutical company [[Astra Zeneca]] donating £35,000.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements"&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 "Sense About Science Financial Statements"], Charity Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous donations included other [[pharmaceutical lobby|pharmaceutical]] industries such as [[Pfizer]].&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt; This dependency has now been diminished since for the fiscal year ending April 2010, the trust received £183,971 in donations of which £17,500 was derived from the pharmaceutical industry (Unilever and G E Healthcare). In 2011 the amount diminished further to less than 6% funding derived from industry sources (the trust received £268,184 in donations with £15,000 from industry)  with the rest derived from Science Bodies and individuals.&lt;ref name="2008-2010_FiscalStatements" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2010-2011 fiscal statement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Statements 2011|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1101114&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sense about Science discloses the names of its funders and the purpose of each donation received in its annual reports. Its largest donor during 2015-16 was the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]], which donated between £40,001-50,000 to support the [[AllTrials]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Sense about Science, Annual Review 2015/16, http://senseaboutscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Annual-Report-2015-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''smock-frock''' or '''smock''' is an outer [[clothing|garment]] traditionally worn by rural workers, especially [[shepherd]]s and [[wagon|waggoners]], in parts of [[England]] and [[Wales]] from throughout the 18th century. Today, the word smock refers to a loose overgarment worn to protect one's clothing, for instance by a painter.

The traditional smock-frock is made of heavy [[linen]] or [[wool]] and varies from thigh-length to mid-calf length.  Characteristic features of the smock-frock are fullness across the back, breast, and [[sleeve]]s folded into "tubes" (narrow unpressed [[pleat]]s) held in place and decorated by [[smocking]], a type of surface [[embroidery]] in a honeycomb pattern across the pleats that controls the fullness while allowing a degree of stretch.

==Types of smock-frocks==

It is uncertain whether smock-frocks are "frocks made like smocks" or "smocks made like frocks"—that is, whether the garment evolved from the [[chemise|smock]], the shirt or underdress of the medieval period, or from the [[frock]], an overgarment of equally ancient origin.  What is certain is that the fully developed smock-frock resembles a melding of the two older garments.

From the earlier 18th century, the smock-frock was worn by waggoners and carters; by the end of that century, it had become the common outer garment of agricultural labourers of all sorts throughout the Midlands and Southern England.  The spread of the smock-frock matches a general decrease in agricultural wages and living standards in these areas in the second half of the 18th century.  The smocks were cheaper than other forms of outer garments, and were both durable and washable.&lt;ref&gt;Styles, p. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Embroidery styles for smock-frocks varied by region, and a number of motifs became traditional for various occupations: wheel-shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on. Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread, often in the same color as the smock.

By the mid-19th century, wearing of traditional smock-frocks by country laborers was dying out, although [[Gertrude Jekyll]] noticed them in [[Sussex]] during her youth, and smocks were still worn by some people in rural Buckinghamshire into the 1920s. As the authentic tradition was fading away, a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past, as epitomized by the illustrations of [[Kate Greenaway]], led to a fashion for women's and children's [[dress]]es and [[blouse]]s loosely styled after smock-frocks.  These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate smocking embroidery done in cotton [[embroidery floss|floss]] in contrasting colors; smocked garments with pastel-colored embroidery remain popular for babies.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parachutist smocks==
During [[World War II]], military [[parachutist]]s wore wind proof jump smocks primarily to cover equipment that may have caused the parachutist to be stuck in a narrow doorway.  German parachutists wore the [[Knochensack]], British parachutists wore the [[Denison smock]] whilst [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[paramarine]]s wore a jump smock as well. Today the name ''smock'' is still used for military combat jackets, particularly in the UK; in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] army the borrowed English term has been corrupted to '''smoke-vest'''.

Examples include [[DPM Parachute Smock]], that replaced the Denison Smock, the [[Canadian Para Smock]] and [[Smock Windproof DPM]].

'''Swishing''' refers to swapping an item or items of [[clothing]] or [[shoe]]s or an [[fashion accessory|accessory]] with friends or acquaintances. Parties must willingly give an item to participate in the transaction, once they have given an item they are free to choose something of interest from what others have offered. Value does not come into the equation, as swappers do not necessarily get an item of equal value and are free to choose anything that the other person if offering (without having to pay). Swishing is now being more widely practiced throughout the world and has evolved to include other items such as books and furniture. Not only do people hold 'swishing parties' either as a charity event or simply for the enjoyment of it (while recycling and saving money at the same time), but there are several websites where online swishes take place.

==History==
Swishing (deriving from the dictionary definition of 'to rustle, as silk' - which in the eyes of the Swishing team means 'to rustle from friends') began in 2000 when Lucy Shea, founder of green PR firm Futerra and her colleagues  wanted to come up with a way to combine a love of retail shopping without contributing to increased consumption. It has since been imbursed by fashion model [[Twiggy]] in Twiggy's frock exchange, and as a result has become one of the most popular ways of swapping clothes.

==Practice==
A Swishing Party usually has a Swishing Host who lays out guests' items at the venue after the guests have arrived. The Host sends one group of guests to look at the items while other groups wait or do an activity. When an allocated amount of time has passed, the groups rotate. When all guests have seen the items, the Host places everyone's name into a hat or bowl and draws them one at a time; when a guest's name is called, he or she claims an item. The Host waits for only a few seconds before calling out the next name. The remainder of the items are them donated to charity by the Host.

There are several types of variations.  If the Swish is for charity, attendees have their names placed into the bowl along with an extra amount for a donation; Swishes can be focused on specific items like clothes, crockery, shoes, handbags, and accessories; they can be held for family, friends, or workmates; they can be less orderly, as a free-for-all instead of a drawing by name.

'''Technology integration''' is the use of technology tools{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} in general content areas in education in order to allow [[students]] to apply [[computer skills|computer]] and [[technology]] skills to learning and problem-solving. Generally speaking, the [[curriculum]] drives the use of technology and not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.com/articles/14141|title=Teachers of the 21st Century Know the What, Why, and How of Technology Integration|author= Jolene Dockstader|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Do We Need Technology Integration? |work=[[Edutopia]] |url=http://www.edutopia.org/teaching-module-technology-integration-why|date=November 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology integration is defined as the use of technology to enhance and support the educational environment. Technology integration in the classroom can also support classroom instruction by creating opportunities for students to complete assignments on the computer rather than with normal pencil and paper.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"&gt;{{cite web|title=Using technology to increase student participation|url=http://techparticipation.blogspot.in/2009/09/technology-integration-definition.html|ref=article|date=September 1, 2009|work=techparticipation.blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Curriculum integration with the use of technology involves the infusion of technology as a tool to enhance the learning in a content area or multidisciplinary setting... Effective integration of technology is achieved when students are able to select technology tools to help them obtain information in a timely manner, analyze and synthesize the information, and present it professionally to an authentic audience. The technology should become an integral part of how the classroom functions—as accessible as all other classroom tools. The focus in each lesson or unit is the curriculum outcome, not the technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/tech_schools/chapter7.asp|title=Chapter 7: Technology Integration, U.S. Department of Education|date=December 9, 2008|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Integrating technology with standard curriculum can not only give students a sense of power, but also allows for more advanced learning among broad topics. However, these technologies require infrastructure, continual maintenance and repair – one determining element, among many, in how these technologies can be used for curricula purposes and whether or not they will be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Jackson|first1 = Steven|last2 = Pompe|first2 = Alex|last3 = Krieshok| first3 = Gabriel|title = Things Fall Apart: Maintenance, Repair, and Technology for Education Initiatives in Rural Namibia|pages = 283–90|newspaper = Proceedings of the 2011 iConference|location = Seattle, Washington|date = 8–11 September 2011|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-4023-7_24|chapter = The Work to Make a Home Network Work|isbn = 978-1-4020-4022-1|citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.6466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the infrastructure required to operate and support technology integration in schools include at the basic level electricity, Internet service providers, routers, modems, and personnel to maintain the network, beyond the initial cost of the hardware and software.&lt;ref name="Grinter"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Grinter|first1 = Rebecca|title = Ecscw 2005|last2 = Edwards|first2 = W. Keith|pages = 469–488|newspaper = Proceedings of the Ninth European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work|location = Paris, France|date = 18–22 September 2005|doi = 10.1007/1-4020-4023-7_24|isbn = 978-1-4020-4022-1|citeseerx = 10.1.1.459.6466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard education curriculum with an integration of technology can provide tools for advanced learning among a broad range of topics. Integration of [[information and communication technology]] is often closely monitored and evaluated due to the current climate of accountability, outcome based education, and standardization in assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kervin|first1 = Lisa|last2 = Mantei|first2 = Jessica|title = Supporting educators with the inclusion of technology within literacy classrooms: A framework for "action"|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 2|issue = 3|pages = 43–54|date = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology integration can in some instances be problematic. A high ratio of students to technological device has been shown to impede or slow learning and task completion.&lt;ref name="Yu"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Yu|first = Chien|title = The Integration of Technology in the 21st Century Classroom: Teachers' Attitudes and Pedagogical Beliefs Toward Emerging Technologies| journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom|volume = 5|issue = 1|pages = 6|date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some, instances dyadic peer interaction centered on integrated technology has proven to develop a more cooperative sense of social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Mehan|first = Hugh|title = Microcomputers in Classrooms: Educational Technology or Social Practice|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 20|issue = 1|pages = 4–22|date = March 1989|jstor = 3195700|doi=10.1525/aeq.1989.20.1.05x1208l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success or failure of technology integration is largely dependent on factors beyond the technology. The availability of appropriate software for the technology being integrated is also problematic in terms of software accessibility to students and educators.&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; Another issue identified with technology integration is the lack of long-range planning for these tools within the educative districts they are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Anderson|first = L. S.|year = 1996|title = K–12 technology planning at state, district, and local levels|publisher = National Center for Technology Planning, Mississippi State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology contributes to global development and diversity in classrooms while helping to develop upon the fundamental building blocks needed for students to achieve more complex ideas. In order for technology to make an impact within the educational system, teachers and students must access to technology in a contextual matter that is culturally relevant, responsive and meaningful to their educational practice and that promotes quality teaching and active student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Song|first1 = Shin-Cheol|last2 = Owens|first2 = Emiel|title = Rethinking Technology Disparities and Instructional Practices within Urban Schools: Recommendations for School Leadership and Teacher Training|journal = Journal of Technology Integration in the Classroom |volume = 3|issue = 2|pages = 23–36|date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'educational technology' was used during the post World War II era in the United States for the integration of implements such as film strips, slide projectors, language laboratories, audio tapes, and television.&lt;ref name="Coley"&gt;{{Citation|last1 = Coley|first1 = R. DJ.|last2 = Cradler|first2 = J.|last3 = Engel|first3 = P. K.|title= Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools|series = Policy Information Report|pages = 1–67|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presently, the computers, tablets, and mobile devices integrated into classroom settings for educational purposes are most often referred to as 'current' educational technologies. It is important to note that educational technologies continually change, and once referred to slate chalkboards used by students in early schoolhouses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The phrase 'educational technology', a composite meaning of technology + education, is used to refer to the most advanced technologies that are available for both teaching and learning in a particular era.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

In 1994 federal legislation for both the Educate America Act and the Improving America's School's Act (IASA) authorized funds for state and federal educational technology planning.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; One of the principal goals listed in the Educate America Act is to promote the research, consensus building, and systemic changes needed to ensure equitable educational opportunities and high levels of educational achievement for all students (Public Law 103-227).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants= Goals 2000: Educate America Act|vol= House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=103|date=8 February 1994|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr1804/text/ih}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the Telecommunications Act provided a systematic change necessary to ensure equitable educational opportunities of bringing new technology into the education sector.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"&gt;{{cite court|litigants= TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996 – 110 STAT. 56.|vol=House of Representatives 1804 Amendment|reporter=U.S. Congress|opinion=104|date=8 February 1996|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/specialuses/commsites/documents/pl-104-104.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telecomm Act requires affordable access and service to advanced telecom services for public schools and libraries. Many of the computers, tablets, and mobile devices currently used in classrooms operate through Internet connectivity; particularly those that are application based such as tablets. Schools in high-cost areas and disadvantaged schools were to receive higher discounts in telecom services such as Internet, cable, satellite television, and the management component.&lt;ref name="104th Congress"/&gt;

A chart of "Technology Penetration in U.S. Public Schools" report states 98% percent of schools reported having computers in the 1995–1996 school year, with 64% Internet access, and 38% working via networked systems.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; The ratio of students to computers in the United States in 1984 stood at 15 students per 1 computer, it now stands at an average all-time low of 10 students to computer.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt; From the 1980s on into the 2000s, the most substantial issue to examine in educational technology was school access to technologies according to the 1997 Policy Information Report for Computers and Classrooms: The Status of Technology in U.S. Schools. These technologies included computers, multimedia computers, the Internet, networks, cable TV, and satellite technology amongst other technology-based resources.&lt;ref name="Coley"/&gt;

More recently ubiquitous computing devices, such as computers and tablets, are being used as networked collaborative technologies in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Grinter" /&gt; Computers, tablets and mobile devices may be used in educational settings within groups, between people and for collaborative tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Paul|last = Dourish|author-link = Paul Dourish|title = Where the action is|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|edition = 1st|year = 2001|page = 245|isbn = 9780262541787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices provide teachers and students access to the World Wide Web in addition to a variety of software applications.

==Technology education standards==

[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS) served as a roadmap since 1998 for improved teaching and learning by [[educator]]s. As stated above, these standards are used by teachers, students, and administrators to measure competency and set higher goals to be skillful.

The Partnership for 21st Century Skills is a national organization that advocates for 21st century readiness for every student. Their most recent Technology Plan was released in 2010, "Transforming American Education: Learning Powered by Technology".&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-history|title=Technology Integration: A Short History|first=Suzie|last=Boss|date=8 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan outlines a vision "to leverage the learning sciences and modern technology to create engaging, relevant, and personalized learning experiences for all learners that mirror students' daily lives and the reality of their futures. In contrast to traditional classroom instruction, this requires that students be put at the center and encouraged to take control of their own learning by providing flexibility on several dimensions."&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;
Although tools have changed dramatically since the beginnings of educational technology, this vision of using technology for empowered, self-directed learning has remained consistent.&lt;ref name="edutopia.org"/&gt;

==Pedagogy==
The integration of electronic devices into classrooms has been cited as a possible solution to bridge access for students, to close achievement gaps, that are subject to the [[digital divide]], based on social class, economic inequality, or gender where and a potential user does not have enough cultural capital required to have access to information and communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = David | last = Buckingham|title = Beyond technology|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Polity]]|year = 2007|page = 209|isbn = 9780745638812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several motivations or arguments have been cited for integrating high-tech hardware and software into school, such as (1) making schools more efficient and productive than they currently are, (2) if this goal is achieved, teaching and learning will be transformed into an engaging and active process connected to real life, and (3) is to prepare the current generation of young people for the future workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first = Larry|last = Cuban|title = Oversold and underused|place = Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]|year = 2003|page = 256|isbn = 9780674011090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[computer]] has access to [[graphics]] and other functions students can use to express their creativity. Technology integration does not always have to do with the computer. It can be the use of the [[overhead projector]], student response clickers, etc. Enhancing how the student learns is very important in technology integration. Technology will always help students to learn and explore more.&lt;ref name="techparticipation.blogspot.in"/&gt;

=== Paradigms ===

Most research in technology integration has been criticized for being atheoretical and [[ad hoc]] driven more by the affordances of the technology rather than the demands of pedagogy and subject matter. Armstrong (2012) argued that multimedia transmission turns to limit the learning into simple content, because it is difficult to deliver complicated content through multimedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach that attempts to address this concern is a framework aimed at describing the nature of teacher knowledge for successful technology integration. The [[technological pedagogical content knowledge]] or TPACK framework has recently received some positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TPACK.ORG|url = http://www.tpack.org|website = www.tpack.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model that has been used to analyze tech integration is the [http://www.hippasus.com/rrpweblog/archives/2014/06/29/LearningTechnologySAMRModel.pdf SAMR framework], developed by Ruben Puentedura. This model attempts to measure the level of tech integration with 4 the levels that go from Enhancement to Transformation: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ruben R. Puentedura's Blog|url = http://hippasus.com/blog/|website = hippasus.com|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructivism ===

[[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism]] is a crucial component of technology integration.  It is a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|learning theory]] that describes the process of students constructing their own [[knowledge]] through collaboration and [[inquiry-based learning]]. According to this theory, students learn more deeply and retain information longer when they have a say in what and how they will learn. Inquiry-based learning, thus, is researching a question that is personally relevant and purposeful because of its direct correlation to the one investigating the knowledge.
As stated by [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-piage.html |author=Wanda Y. Ginn |title=JEAN PIAGET – INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructivist learning is based on four stages of cognitive development. In these stages, children must take an active role in their own learning and produce meaningful works in order to develop a clear understanding. These works are a reflection of the knowledge that has been achieved through active self-guided learning. Students are active leaders in their learning and the learning is student-led rather than teacher–directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.coe.uga.edu/epltt/index.php?title=Piaget's_Stages |title=Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development |publisher=Department of Educational Psychology and Instructional Technology, University of Georgia |author1=Kay C. Wood |author2=Harlan Smith |author3=Daurice Grossniklaus }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many teachers use a constructivist approach in their classrooms assuming one or more of the following roles: facilitator, collaborator, curriculum developer, team member, community builder, educational leader, or information producer.

===Counter argument to computers in the classroom===

Is technology in the classroom needed, or does it hinder students' social development? We've all seen a table of teenagers on their phones, all texting, not really socializing or talking to each other. How do they develop social and communication skills? Neil Postman (1993) concludes: &lt;blockquote&gt;The role of the school is to help students learn how to ignore and discard information so that they can achieve a sense of coherence in their lives; to help students cultivate a sense of social responsibility; to help students think critically, historically, and humanely; to help students understand the ways in which technology shapes their consciousness; to help students learn that their own needs sometimes are subordinate to the needs of the group. I could go on for another three pages in this vein without any reference to how machinery can give students access to information. Instead, let me summarize in two ways what I mean. First, I'll cite a remark made repeatedly by my friend Alan Kay, who is sometimes called "the father of the personal computer." Alan likes to remind us that any problems the schools cannot solve without machines, they cannot solve with them. Second, and with this I shall come to a close: If a nuclear holocaust should occur some place in the world, it will not happen because of insufficient information; if children are starving in Somalia, it's not because of insufficient information; if crime terrorizes our cities, marriages are breaking up, mental disorders are increasing, and children are being abused, none of this happens because of a lack of information. These things happen because we lack something else. It is the "something else" that is now the business of schools.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (1993). [http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Postman/Articles/TECHNOS_NET.htm Of Luddites, learning, and life]. Technos Quarterly, 2(4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Tools==

===Interactive whiteboards===
[[Interactive whiteboard]]s are used in many schools as replacements for standard whiteboards and provide a way to allow students to interact with material on the computer. In addition, some interactive whiteboards software allow teachers to record their instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neamb.com/professional-resources/benefits-of-interactive-whiteboards.htm|title=Interactive Whiteboards Enhance Classroom Instruction and Learning |agency= NEA Member Benefits |website= www.neamb.com|language=en |access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[virtual environment]]s are also used with interactive whiteboards as a way for students to interact with 3D [[virtual learning environment|virtual learning]] objects employing kinetics and [[haptic technology|haptic]] touch the classroom. An example of the use of this technique is the [[open-source]] project [[Edusim]].
*Research has been carried out{{Citation needed |date= August 2009}} to track the worldwide Interactive Whiteboard market by Decision Tree Consulting (DTC), a worldwide research company. According to the results, interactive Whiteboards continue to be the biggest technology revolution in classrooms, across the world there are over 1.2 million boards installed, over 5 million classrooms are forecast to have Interactive Whiteboards installed by 2011, Americas are the biggest region closely followed by [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], and Mexico's [[Enciclomedia]] project to equip 145,000 classrooms is worth $1.8 billion and is the largest education technology project in the world.
*Interactive whiteboards can accommodate different learning styles, such as visual, tactile, and audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meadonline.com/App/InteractiveWhiteboard/Classroom.pdf |author=Alfred N. Basilicato |title=Interactive Whiteboards: Assistive Technology for Every Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactive Whiteboards are another way that technology is expanding in schools. By assisting the teacher to helping students more kinestically as well as finding different ways to process there information throughout the entire classroom.

===Student response systems===
[[Student response systems]] consist of handheld remote control units, or response pads, which are operated by individual students. An infrared or radio frequency receiver attached to the teacher's computer collects the data submitted by students. The CPS (Classroom Performance System),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einstruction.com/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=News.display&amp;Menu=newsroom&amp;content=FormalPaper&amp;id=209 |title=The Classroom Performance System: The Overwhelming Research Results Supporting This Teacher Tool and Methodology |work=eInstruction |accessdate=20 September 2009 |date=April 30, 2003|first=Darrel W. |last=Ward}}&lt;/ref&gt; once set, allows the  teacher to pose a question to students in several formats. Students then use the response pad to send their answer to the infrared sensor. Data collected from these systems is available to the teacher in real time and can be presented to the students in a graph form on an LCD projector. The teacher can also access a variety of reports to collect and analyze student data. These systems have been used in higher education science courses since the 1970s and have become popular in K-12 classrooms beginning in the early 21st century.

[[Audience response|Audience response systems]] (ARS) can help teachers analyze, and act upon student feedback more efficiently. For example, with polleverywhere.com, students text in answers via mobile devices to warm-up or quiz questions. The class can quickly view collective responses to the multiple-choice questions electronically, allowing the teacher to differentiate instruction and learn where students need help most.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-tools-programs|title=Technology Integration Research Review: Additional Tools and Programs|first=Vanessa|last=Vega|date=5 February 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining ARS with peer learning via collaborative discussions has also been proven to be particularly effective. When students answer an in-class conceptual question individually, then discuss it with their neighbors, and then vote again on the same or a conceptually similar question, the percentage of correct student responses usually increases, even in groups where no student had given the correct answer previously.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Among other tools that have been noted as being effective as a way of technology integration are [[podcasts]], [[digital cameras]], [[smart phones]], [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[digital media]], and [[blogs]].

==Mobile learning==
[[Mobile learning]] is defined as "learning across multiple contexts, through social and content interactions, using personal electronic devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.in/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enIN649IN649&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=mobile%20learning | title = Mobile learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A mobile device is essentially any device that is portable and has internet access and includes tablets, smart phones, cell phones, [[e-book reader]]s, and [[MP3 player]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/mobile-devices-learning-resource-guide?download=yes&amp;key=1364000111&amp;token=5c58fe7e330446f498435d5a11e1f125|title=Mobile Devices for Learning: What You Need to Know|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mobile devices become increasingly common personal devices of K-12 students, some educators seek to utilize downloadable applications and interactive games to help facilitate learning. This practice can be controversial because many parents and educators are concerned that students would be off-task because teachers cannot monitor their activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This is currently being troubleshooted by forms of mobile learning that require a log-in, acting as a way to track engagement of students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Benefits===
According to findings from four meta analyses, blending technology with face-to-face teacher time generally produces better outcomes than face-to-face or online learning alone. Research is currently limited on the specific features of technology integration that improve learning. Meanwhile, the marketplace of learning technologies continues to grow and vary widely in content, quality, implementation, and context of use.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Research shows that adding technology to K-12 environments, alone, does not necessarily improve learning. What matters most to implementing mobile learning is how students and teachers use technology to develop knowledge and skills and that requires training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-research-learning-outcomes|title=Technology Integration Research Review|author=Vega, Vanessa|date=February 5, 2013|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful technology integration for learning goes hand in hand with changes in teacher training, curricula, and assessment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23716387|title=Laptop programs for students|author1=Zucker, A.|author2=Light, D.|journal=Science|volume=323|issue=5910|pages=82–85|year=2009|doi=10.1126/science.1167705|pmid=19119224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of teacher professional development is profiled in Edutopia's Schools That Work series on eMints, a program that offers teachers 200 hours of coaching and training in technology integration over a two-year span.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Markus, David|title=High-Impact Professional Development for Rural Schools|date=July 25, 2012|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/stw-tech-integration-professional-development|work=Edutopia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these workshops teachers are trained in practices such as using interactive whiteboards and the latest web tools to facilitate active learning. In a 2010 publication of Learning Point Associates, statistics showed that students of teachers who had participated in eMints had significantly higher standardized test scores than those attained by their peers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

It can keep students focused for longer periods of time. The use of computers to look up information/ data is a tremendous time saver, especially when used to access a comprehensive resource like the Internet to conduct research. This time-saving aspect can keep students focused on a project much longer than they would with books and paper resources, and it helps them develop better learning through exploration and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huneycutt|first1=Timothy|title=Technology in the Classroom: the Benefits of Blended Learning|url=http://www.nms.org/Blog/TabId/58/PostId/188/technology-in-the-classroom-the-benefits-of-b|website=National Math + Science Initiative|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project-based activities==
Definition: Project Based Learning is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem, or challenge.

Project Based Activities is a method of teaching where the students gain knowledge and skills by involving themselves for the more period of time to research and respond to the engaging and complex questions, problems, or challenges. the students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging.The students will work in groups to solve the problems which are challenging, real, curriculum based and frequently relating to more than one branch of knowledge. Therefore, a well designed project based learning activity is one which addresses different student learning styles and which does not assume that all students can demonstrate their knowledge in a single standard way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Project-Based Learning Activity About Project-Based Learning|url=http://www.sun-associates.com/lynn/pbl/pbl.html|work=resources.sun-associates.com|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The project based learning activities involves four basic elements.
# An extended time frame.
# Collaboration.
# Inquiry, investigation and research.
# The construction of an artifact or performance of a consequential task.

==Examples of activities==

===CyberHunt===
The term "hunt" refers to finding or searching for something. "[[CyberHunt]]" means an online activity which learners use the internet as tool to find answers to the question's based upon the topics which are assigned by someone else. Hence learners also can design the CyberHunt on some specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Cyberhunt?|url=http://www.nmmu.ac.za/cyberhunts/whatisacyberhunt.htm|work=nmmu.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; a CyberHunt, or internet scavenger hunt, is a [[project-based learning|project-based activity]] which helps students gain experience in exploring and browsing the [[internet]]. A CyberHunt may ask students to interact with the site (e.g.: play a game or watch a video), record short answers to teacher questions, as well as read and write about a topic in depth. There are basically two types of CyberHunt: 
*A simple task, in which the teacher develops a series of questions and gives the students a [[hypertext]] link to the URL that will give them the answer.
*A more complex task, intended for increasing and improving student internet search skills. Teachers ask questions for students to answer using a search engine.

===WebQuests===
It is an inquiry oriented activity in which most or all of the information used by the learners which are drawn out by the internet/web. It is designed to use  learner 'time well', to focus on using information rather than on looking for it and to support the learners to think at the level of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. It is the wonderful way of capturing student's imagination and allowing them to explore in a guided, meaningful manner. It allow the students to explore issues and find their own answers.

There are six building blocks of webQuests:
# The introduction – capturing the student's interest.
# The task-describing the activities end product.
#The resources-web sites, students will use to complete the task.
# The evaluation-measuring the result of the activity.
# The conclusion-summing up of the activity.
[[WebQuest]]s are student-centered, web-based curricular units that are interactive and use Internet resources. The purpose of a webQuest is to use [[information]] on the [[World Wide Web|web]] to support the instruction taught in the classroom. A webQuest consists of an introduction, a task (or final project that students complete at the end of the webQuest), processes (or instructional activities), web-based resources, evaluation of learning, reflection about learning, and a conclusion.

=== WISE ===
The [[Web-based Inquiry Science Environment]] (WISE) provides a platform for creating inquiry science projects for middle school and high school students using evidence and resources from the Web. Funded by the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]], WISE has been developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] from 1996 until the present. WISE inquiry projects include diverse elements such as online discussions, data collection, drawing, argument creation, resource sharing, concept mapping and other built-in tools, as well as links to relevant web resources.It is the research-focused, open-source inquiry-based learning management system that includes the student- learning environment project authoring environment, grading tool, and tool and user/ course/ content management tools.

=== Virtual field trip ===
A [[virtual field trip]] is a website that allows the students to experience places, ideas, or objects beyond the constraints of the classroom{{Why|date=August 2009}}.
A virtual field trip is a great way to allow the students to explore and experience new information. This format is especially helpful and beneficial in allowing schools to keep the cost down. Virtual field trips may also be more practical for children in the younger grades, due to the fact that there is not a demand for chaperones and supervision. Although, a virtual field trip does not allow the children to have the hands on experiences and the social interactions that can and do take place on an actual field trip. An educator should incorporate the use of hands on material to further their understanding of the material that is presented and experienced in a virtual field trip.It is a guided exploration through the www that organizes a collection of pre- screened, its thematically based web pages into a structure online  learning experience

=== ePortfolio ===
An [[ePortfolio]] is a collection of student work that exhibits the student's achievements in one or more areas over time. Components in a typical student ePortfolio might contain creative writings, paintings, photography, math explorations, music, and videos. And it is a collection of work developed across varied contexts over time. The portfolio can advance learning by providing students and/or faculty with a way to organize, archive and display pieces of work.

The '''Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library''' is a [[library]] in the [[University of Toronto]], constituting the largest repository of publicly accessible [[rare book]]s and [[manuscript]]s in Canada. The library is also home to the university archives which, in addition to institutional records, also contains the papers of many important Canadian literary figures including [[Margaret Atwood]] and [[Leonard Cohen]].

Richard Landon, the director until his death in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://utlibrarians.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/obituary-for-richard-landon-1942-2011-director-of-thomas-fisher-rarebooks-library-university-of-toronto/|title=Obituary for Richard Landon (1942-2011), Director of Thomas Fisher Rarebooks Library, University of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized two or three exhibitions of rare books and other materials annually.

The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections was founded in November 1955 by the Chief Librarian, Robert H. Blackburn. Blackburn hired Marion E. Brown who was working in the special collections department at Brown University. Brown's first responsibility was to deal with the items that had been accumulating since 1890. Some of these items in the collection included medieval manuscripts, early printed books, and special volumes of later periods that had been presented by Queen Victoria to the University. Between the accumulated items and items found in the stacks of the main library, there was enough to open up the Rare Book Room in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library|title=Brief History of the Department|url=http://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/about-us/brief-history-department|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections and the University Archives didn't have a permanent home until 1973 when the Thomas Fisher Rare Book library was opened. The library is named in honour of [[Thomas Fisher (Upper Canada)|Thomas Fisher]] (1792–1874), who immigrated from [[Yorkshire]], settled along the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] in 1822, and became a successful merchant–miller.  In 1973 his great-grandsons, Sidney and Charles Fisher, donated to the library their own collections of Shakespeare, various twentieth-century authors, and etchings of Wenceslaus Hollar. Since the opening of the library, it has grown to approximately 740,000 volumes and 4,000 meters of manuscript holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library|website=fisher.library.utoronto.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fisher building was designed by Mathers and Haldenby, Toronto with design consultant Warner, Burns, Toan and Lunde, New York. It forms part of a complex with the [[Robarts Library|John P. Robarts Research Library for the Humanities and Social Sciences]], and the Claude Bissel Building which houses the Faculty of Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library|title=Brief History of the Department|url=http://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/about-us/brief-history-department|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Among the collection's items are the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493), [[Shakespeare]]'s [[First Folio]] (1623), and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' (1687). Contrary to widespread internet claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.wikicollecting.org/thomas-fisher-rare-book-library-toronto |title=Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library |publisher=[[Wikicollecting]] |accessdate=2014-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410183919/http://en.wikicollecting.org/thomas-fisher-rare-book-library-toronto |archivedate=2011-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allancho.com/2014/02/thomas-fisher-rare-book-library.html | title=Allan's Library: An Academic Viewpoint | accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
the library does not have [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s proof copy with annotations of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859); the library does however have annotated proof sheets of: ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?198264 | title=The power of movement in plants [proof sheets] / University of Toronto Libraries | publisher=University of Toronto | accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''

The Robert S. Kenny Collection resides in the library. This immense collection of books, documents, and other materials pertaining to the radical and labour movements, particularly in [[Canada]], contains approximately 25,000 items collected by [[Robert S. Kenny]], who was a member of the [[Communist Party of Canada]]. The Canadian section, which has 382 books and 768 pamphlets, was acquired by the library from Kenny in 1977. The international section of the collection was donated by Kenny in 1993.

In addition, there is an outstanding collection of etchings by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] (1607–1677) from the collection of Sidney Thomson Fisher. The collection has been digitized and is a remarkable historical resource.

In April 2018, it was announced that the library had acquired the oldest English-language book in Canada, and its 15 millionth item, known as the ''[[Caxton Cicero]]'', which was printed in 1481 by the Englishman [[William Caxton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://alumni.utoronto.ca/news-and-stories/news-and-articles/u-t-library-acquires-oldest-english-language-book-Canada|title=U of T library acquires the oldest English-language book in Canada|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|date=23 April 2018|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tukoio''' is the name of a legendary or mythological chief in Māori mythology.

In a story from the [[Māori mythology|Māori tradition]] of the [[Whanganui]] area, Tukoio, a mortal man, came across a [[Maero]] or [[Mohoao]], a wild person or monster much feared in Maori legend. The creature instantly attacked him, fighting fiercely until Tukoio cut off its limbs and head, which he took as a trophy back to his village. However, when the severed head cried out for help from its clan, Tukoio instantly dropped the head and ran, fearing retaliation. When he and some of his villagers returned, they found the Mohoao gone, having reassembled itself and returned to the forest.

Multiple artists have used the '''Vitralism''' art movement in the last 10 years, see [https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Flickr group].

Vitralism is 21st-century [[art movement]] that uses broken color (similar to [[Impressionism]]) and line extension to achieve a "[[stained glass]]" look and effect. Light and dark colors are painted in many layers with round sponges (the kind used for a [[stencil]]) giving the broken color a transparent quality that simulates the light through a stained glass window. 
[http://www.meleflorez.com/attachments/contentmanagers/51/Woodpecker_full.jpg see example painting]. The background is done entirely with sponges. The subject may or may not be painted with sponges; brushes are used to paint the subject to create texture contrast.

Line extensions contribute to integrate the painted subject with its background. Acrylic paints are the preferred medium for its fast-drying quality, which prevents the mixing of colors on the canvas and keeps the colors almost pure and separated.

[https://www.flickr.com/groups/vitralism/pool/ Here are several photos of paintings created using this method]

The name Vitralism comes from the Spanish word [[:es:Vitral|"Vitral"]] which means stained-glass.  The word vitral comes from the [[Latin]] root [[:la:Vitrum|Vitrum]], which means [[glass]].

==Characteristics==
Some of the characteristics of Vitralism painting include: 
* Round-like strokes on the background and possibly on the subject
* Brush-applied strokes on the subject
* Dark extension lines
* Single subject
* Unity of color – each "piece" of the painting contains part of the color of its adjacent neighbor piece, particularly on the background
* Subjects from nature

==Beginnings==
While experimenting with acrylic colors for the first time, artist Mele Flórez Avellán started testing the paints on a masonite board. With a base of semi-gloss house paint, she started to apply color to her subject. To her discontent, the brush-applied strokes didn’t stick on the support the way she expected. It was not an opaque covering but semi-transparent. Since Mele already took the time to design her painting, she decided to look around her work area to see what could be used to make this a successful painting. Being a crafty person throughout her whole life, her work area was filled with all sorts of gadgets. She took a stencil sponge, dipped it in paint and lightly touched the support with the sponge. She liked what she saw. The addition of white, silver and gold paints gave the painting more light. The line extensions were then darkened to create a strong contrast.

==Techniques==
* Color is applied on the support with tapping movements, lightly touching the support, without dragging the sponges.
* Extension lines are painted with the edge of the round sponges in the same fashion.
* Light mixing of colors occur on the support to make the transition between colors.
* Varnish (gloss or semi-gloss) is applied to the painting when it is fully dry.

==Subjects==
Vitralism uses mainly subjects from nature, like birds, leaves and butterflies.

'''Vote trading''' is the practice of [[voting]] in the manner another person wishes on a [[legislative bill|bill]], position on a more general issue, or favored candidate in exchange for the other person's vote in the manner one wishes on another position, proposal, or candidate.  Nearly all voting systems do not make vote trading a formal process, so vote trading is very often informal and thus not binding.
One form of vote trading that is formal is one that involves the trading of proxy voting rights - party A gets Party B's voting right formally,  eg as a filled in proxy form with signature, perhaps authenticated by secretariats, and in this case party A may use B's vote on issue 1, and B uses A's vote on issue 2... votes traded.

==In legislatures==

Vote trading frequently occurs between and among members of legislative bodies. For example, Congressman A might vote for a dam in Congressman B's district in exchange for Congressman B's vote for farm subsidies in Congressman A's district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7241-2004Oct4.html|title=Vote-Trading Ethics|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2004-10-05|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first examples of vote trading to occur in the United States was the [[Compromise of 1790]], in which [[Thomas Jefferson]] made a deal with [[James Madison]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] to move the capital from New York to a site along the Potomac (after a lengthy stay in Philadelphia) in exchange for federal assumption of debts incurred by the states in the Revolutionary War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Vote Trading in the First Federal Congress?: James Madison and the Compromise of 1790|author=Kiewiet, D. Roderick|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindrances to vote trading in the U.S. Congress include its bicameral structure and the geographic representation basis of its members. Vote trading is encouraged, however, by Congress's relatively loose [[party discipline]] which facilitates policy cross-overs by individual congressmen, in sharp contrast to European countries. In any case, vote trading is effectively a binding contract in the house, as both participants can actually see each other at the time of voting. If one party breaks their promise the other might change their vote on the issues involved in the trade, and be rather unfriendly with the other party in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Economy of Rent-seeking|author1=Rowley, Charles Kershaw|author2=Tollison, Robert D.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among citizens==
{{Main article|Vote pairing in the United States presidential election, 2016}}

===United States presidential elections===

Vote trading occasionally occurs between United States citizens [[domicile (law)|domicile]]d in different states (and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|therefore citizens of those respective states]]) to demonstrate support for third-party candidates while minimizing the risk that their more favored (or less disfavored) major-party candidate will lose [[electoral vote]]s in the nationwide election (''i.e.'', the "[[spoiler effect]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votepair.org/howitworks.php|title=How It Works|publisher=VotePair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example:
*A Republican-leaning libertarian whose preference order is {Libertarian, Republican, Democrat/[[Green Party (United States)|Green]], Green/Democrat} and who lives in a "[[swing state]]" might trade votes with a Republican who has libertarian sympathies, lives in a state considered "safe Republican" or "safe Democrat", and has preference order {Republican, Libertarian, Democrat/Green, Green/Democrat}.
*A Democratic-leaning [[Progressivism|progressivist]] or socialist whose preference order is {[[Green Party (United States)|Green]], Democrat, Libertarian/Republican, Republican/Libertarian} and who lives in a swing state might trade votes with a Democrat whose preference order is {Democrat, Green, Republican/Libertarian, Libertarian/Republican} and who lives in a state safe for one major party or another.
In either case, both candidates and both voters receive a net benefit at minimal (if any) cost:
* The third-party candidate improves his/her showing as a percentage of the nationwide [[Direct election|popular vote]], increasing his/her party's visibility and prompting the voting public (including major-party sympathizers with the third party's platform) to take the third party more seriously.  Most notably, organizations hosting presidential-candidate debates may require that a party clear a certain popular-vote threshold in one election in order for its candidate in the next election to qualify for the debates held in advance of that election, and vote trading helps the candidate reach that threshold.  Because the third-party supporter in the swing state would likely vote for the more favored or less disfavored major-party candidate in the absence of a vote trade, the third-party candidate has little to lose from the vote trade's guarantee that the swing-state vote will be cast for the major party.
* The major-party candidate gains a potentially significant vote in a swing state while losing only a much less valuable vote in a state in which the candidate has little if anything to gain (if the other state is safe for that candidate) or to lose (if the other state is safe for the opponent) by keeping that vote.
* The voter supporting the third party is able to vote for his or her second choice with a clearer conscience given that the vote trade represents a choice in favor of the greater good as well as the lesser evil (mitigating [[Deontology|deontological]] concerns such as Gandhi's maxim "If you choose the lesser of two evils, you are still choosing evil.").
* A major-party supporter who considers vote trading permissible to begin with, and who thus subscribes to at least some [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] moral principles, will have few if any qualms about voting for a second-choice candidate in situations in which doing so provides a benefit much larger than the negligible cost of a vote that is futile (in a state safe for the opposing major party) or redundant (in a state safe for that voter's party).
Vote trading thereby improves the outcome as measured by both candidates' preference orders and according to both "maximax" and "[[maximin (decision theory)|maximin]]" evaluation standards, at least given the constraints on the set of possible outcomes imposed by the "bottleneck" effect of the winner-take-all electoral-vote allocation procedure.

Presidential vote trading between citizens has increased in popularity since the development of the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]] facilitated interstate communications between individuals not personally known to each other but identifiable by [[User ID|user account names]].

==In non-governmental contexts==

Corporate vote trading has been proposed as a way of improving corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/waslbp/9904.html|title=Corporate Vote-Trading as an Instrument of Corporate Governance|author1=Neeman, Z.  |author2=Orosel, G.O. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, vote trading refers to borrowing shares of a stock in time to be the shareholder of record on the day of an important vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B3E0BF08B-F814-4A15-AAF5-6558FB7286E8%7D&amp;siteid=google|title=Vote early, vote often|author=Hulbert, Mark|date=2006-03-31|publisher=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

A variant called [[vote pairing]] refers to voters on opposite sides in a single vote agreeing to abstain from voting or otherwise changing their vote.  This technique is often used by legislators who do not wish to take time to come to the floor for a vote.  A legislator will find a member on the opposite side of the issue who also desires to save time, and they will both agree to skip the vote, maintaining the balance of votes on each side.

==Ethical considerations==
''The Limits of Public Choice: A Sociological Critique of the Economic Theory'' notes that vote trading is often considered immoral, since votes should be determined on the basis of the merits of the question. It is viewed as being less serious an offense than bribery, although in some countries it is still unlawful. However, vote-trading can also be viewed as beneficial to democracy in that it makes it possible for minorities to exert some influence and thus alleviate the [[tyranny of the majority]]. In this way, vote-trading is similar to coalition-building, which also involves an exchange of policies and bargaining over cabinet positions in order to gain the parliamentary majority needed for approval of the entire program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Limits of Public Choice: A Sociological Critique of the Economic Theory|author=Udhen, Lars|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been academic proposals to streamline the legislative vote trading process by creating a market brokered by party leaders in which members buy and sell votes at prices set by supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w40x621203xkl223/|title=Centralized vote-trading|author=Kenneth J. Koford|publisher=Springer Netherlands|doi=10.1007/BF00162117|volume=39|journal=Public Choice|pages=245–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1592">The '''World Bodypainting Association''' ('''WBA''') is an association for [[Body painting|body painters]]. It represents and looks after [[artists]] (whether professional or hobbyists) mediates [[Model (person)|models]], [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] and [[workshops]] under the WB Academy. It organizes under the WB Production: the [[World Bodypainting Festival]] (WBF) in [[Pörtschach]], [[Austria]], the European Bodypainting Festival (EBF) in [[Lisse]], [[Netherlands]] and global side events. The WB Production also partners to bring such events as the Asia Tour and Living Art America.

==Association Overview==
The association was put in place as a result of the festivals success with the focus of creating a network of artists and a platform for companies and individuals interested in the bodypainting community, industry and art. 

The World Bodypainting Association is dedicated -
* To promoting the art of bodypainting
* To supporting artists around the world
* Encouraging fair trade between artists and companies

==History==
'''Alex Barendregt''' founded the association on October 12, 2001 in Austria as the European Bodypainting Association (EBPA). In 2004 due to the increased participation of international artists and supporting companies it was renamed the World Bodypainting Association also known as the WBA.  In 2015 the association reached 600 members and continues to move strong.
