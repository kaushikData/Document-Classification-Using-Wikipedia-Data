From March to May 1998, a terror plot against the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in France was uncovered by European law enforcement.&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=European Police Raids Target World Cup Terrorist Threat|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/27/sports/sp-53951|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=27 May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Europe Overview|journal=Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1998|url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_98/europe.htm|publisher=[[Bureau of Counterterrorism|Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism]] (United States Department of State)|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 people were arrested in seven countries as a result of the plot.&lt;ref name="ESPN"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|authorlink=Simon Kuper|title=Is football facing a new age of stadium terrorism after Paris attacks?|url=http://www.espnfc.com/european-championship/74/blog/post/2715900/paris-attacks-and-a-new-age-of-stadium-terrorism|work=ESPN FC|date=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by the Algerian [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) and backed by [[al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]], the plot is thought to have targeted the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Group G#England vs Tunisia|England–Tunisia match]] on 15 June 1998, and involved infiltrating the [[Stade Vélodrome]] in [[Marseille]] in order to attack players and spectators during the game, attack the hotel in [[Paris]] hosting the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]], and finally hijacking an aircraft and crashing it into the [[Civaux Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Poitiers]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

==Raids and arrests==
The original suspect of the plot was French-Algerian [[Farid Melouk]], who had previously been sentenced ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' to seven years in prison in France for his connection to the [[1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=World News Briefs; Belgians Arrest Suspect In Paris Bombings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/world/world-news-briefs-belgians-arrest-suspect-in-paris-bombings.html|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bruxelles : échec au réseau du GIA|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/1998/03/06/186734-bruxelles-echec-au-reseau-du-gia.html|work=La Dépêche du Midi|date=6 March 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anschläge bei Fußball-WM?|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-7838193.html|work=Der Spiegel|date=16 March 1998|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Silhouette|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Archives/1998-11-10/Silhouette-_NP_-1998-11-10-462539|work=La Croix|date=10 November 1998|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Le repaire belge du terrorisme|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/international/le-repaire-belge-du-terrorisme-51b874c6e4b0de6db9a638e6|work=La Libre Belgique|date=14 September 2001|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk had reportedly been tracked by intelligence services following his entry into [[Belgium]], where he was found to be in contact with [[Ahmed Zaoui]] and a GIA-linked [[Brussels]] mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March, after two weeks of surveillance, fifty police officers stormed a house where Melouk was staying with others involved in the plot.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Ten people including Swedish and Danish nationals were arrested in the 12-hour siege, amid a series of anti-terrorism raids in Belgium.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Depeche"/&gt; Large amounts of liquid explosives were found during the raid, as well as detonators, a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov rifle]], several handguns and thousands worth of [[United States dollar|US dollars]] in cash.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Brynjar|last1=Lia|authorlink1=Brynjar Lia|first2=Åshild|last2=Kjøk|date=8 August 2001|title=Islamist Insurgencies, Diasporic Support Networks, and their Host States: The Case of the Algerian GIA in Europe 1993–2000|url=https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/01-03789.pdf|publisher=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]] (FFI)|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a large number of documents, brochures and maps relating to the World Cup were retrieved.&lt;ref name="Robinson173"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; More explosives were uncovered in a follow-up raid of another house.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

The March raid was part of a joint security operation between Belgium, France, Sweden, Italy and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt; Despite initial Belgian claims denying links to any plot against the World Cup, the plot was later confirmed by the French counter-intelligence chief.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chronology: The Plots|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/front/special/cron.html|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|date=25 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melouk was sentenced to 9 years in prison for charges including attempted murder.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In early May, eight suspected militants linked to the plot were arrested in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 26 May, nearly 100 people were detained in coordinated operations across France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; In France, 53 men including Algerian, French and Tunisian nationals suspected of links to ex-GIA commander [[Hassan Hattab]] were detained across 43 locations, including in Marseilles, Paris, [[Lyon]] and [[Corsica]]; around 25 were arrested and charged or deported.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Five Algerians were arrested in Germany after raids across several cities, ten in Belgium, two in Switzerland, six in Italy, and many more detained.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 2002, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; French Interior Minister [[Jean-Pierre Chevènement]] said on French television after the arrests that investigators had found evidence of plots to attack the World Cup.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt; Islamist paraphernalia and $150,000 in cash were found during the raids, but no explosives or arms.&lt;ref name="LAT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; Some police sources have said that a goal of the May raids was to crush GIA support networks.&lt;ref name="FFI"/&gt; According to counter-terrorism magistrate [[Jean-Louis Bruguière]], the May raids were a preventive measure to protect the tournament.&lt;ref name="GlobalTerrorism1998"/&gt;

==Plot and aftermath==
The plot involved terrorists infiltrating the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille as stadium crew, in order to attack English players and spectators during the England-Tunisia match on 15 June.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; Terrorists had reportedly planned to blow up the England substitute bench (targeting youngsters [[David Beckham]] and [[Michael Owen]]), shoot English players and throw grenades into the stands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Harris|title=England terrorist plot revealed|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/683732/england-football-team-escaped-terrorist-attack-at-1998-world-cup|work=ESPN FC|date=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Laurent|last=Dubois|year=2010|title=Soccer Empire: The World Cup and the Future of France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tyBmBcbZIMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PT181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=University of California Press|page=181|isbn=9780520259287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other terrorists were then to storm the United States national team's hotel in Paris and attack American players watching the game there.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; The attacks would be followed by another group of terrorists who would hijack an aircraft and crash it into the Civaux Nuclear Power Plant near Poitiers, causing a [[nuclear meltdown]].&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;

The details or even existence of the plot was kept secret from managers, players and the media, but was known to security including [[The Football Association|FA]] staff.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; In 2009, England manager in 1998 [[Glenn Hoddle]] revealed that he had only been informed of the plot "years later", while FA Director of Communications during 1998 [[David Davies (football administrator)|David Davies]] said that he had been informed of the plot before the match by FA Head of Security Brian Hayes.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt; The match was otherwise marred by supporter riots in Marseilles, with British vehicles being bricked while bottles were thrown across the streets, causing police to use tear gas as large numbers of supporters were injured and arrested.&lt;ref name="ESPN2"/&gt;

Although organised by GIA operatives, the plot reportedly had the backing and support of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor-first1=Nicholas John|editor-last1=Cull|editor-first2=David Holbrook|editor-last2=Culbert|editor-first3=David|editor-last3=Welch|first=Nicholas J.|last=Cull|year=2003|title=Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present|chapter=Osama bin Laden|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Byzv7rf6gL8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=no&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=9781576078204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to bin Laden biographer [[Yossef Bodansky]], the World Cup plot being foiled was one of the reasons for "dormant terrorist networks" responsible for the August [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] being "reactivated". The attacks killed over 200 and wounded more than 4,000.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Simon|last=Kuper|title=The World's Game Is Not Just A Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/26/magazine/the-world-s-game-is-not-just-a-game.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=26 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A terror plot against the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] was discovered after Dutch intelligence intercepted calls made between GIA operatives from inside French prisons.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Gun guard on French soccer stars|url=http://www.espnfc.com.au/euro2000/news/20000620frathreat.html|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=20 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three men were detained in French prisons as a result of the plot, and three were subsequently arrested in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt; One of the French prisoners detained for the plot was Adel Mechat, who served 6 years after having been arrested in Germany and extradited to France as part of the 1998 World Cup raids.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ESPN2000"/&gt;

The night before the first ever football match between France and Algeria in October 2001, police seized explosives and arrested four Islamist militants suspected of having targeted the game after a phone call had been intercepted with warnings to stay away from the [[Stade de France]]. Other items retrieved included bulletproof vests and explosives manuals.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|title=International Football: Seventeen held as Algerian fans invade pitch|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/3014255/International-Football-Seventeen-held-as-Algerian-fans-invade-pitch.html|work=The Telegraph|date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match itself became marred with controversy, and was eventually stopped with 15 minutes left playing after Algerian fans stormed the field.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">In [[mathematics]], the '''Almgren–Pitts min-max theory''' (named after [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] and his student [[Jon T. Pitts]]) is an analogue of [[Morse theory]] for [[hypersurface]]s.

The theory started with the efforts for generalizing [[George David Birkhoff]]'s method for the construction of simple closed [[geodesic]]s on the sphere, to allow the construction of [[embedding|embedded]] [[minimal surface]]s in arbitrary [[3-manifold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Colding]] and [[Camillo De Lellis]]: "[https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0303305v2.pdf The min-max construction of minimal surfaces]", Surveys in Differential Geometry&lt;/ref&gt;

It has played roles in the solutions to a number of [[conjecture]]s in [[geometry]] and [[topology]] found by Almgren and Pitts themselves and also by other mathematicians, such as [[Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov|Mikhail Gromov]], [[Richard Schoen]], [[Shing-Tung Yau]], [[Fernando Codá Marques]], [[André Neves]], [[Ian Agol]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://numdam.mathdoc.fr/numdam-bin/item?id=ASNSP_2006_5_5_4_483_0 |author1=Giaquinta, Mariano |author2=Mucci, Domenico |title=The BV-energy of maps into a manifold : relaxation and density results |publisher=Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa – Classe di Scienze, Sér. 5, 5|number=4 |date=2006 |pages=483–548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helge Holden, Ragni Piene – The Abel Prize 2008-2012, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Osserman]] – A Survey of Minimal Surfaces, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intlpress.com/site/pub/pages/journals/items/cdm/content/vols/2013/0001/a001/index.html |title=Content Online - CDM 2013 Article 1 |publisher=Intlpress.com |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~aneves/papers/CDM-harvard3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Applications of Almgren-Pitts Min-max theory |author1=Fernando C.

The theory allows the construction of [[Embedding|embedded]] minimal hypersurfaces though variational methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhou Xin | year = 2015 | title = Min-max minimal hypersurface  in &lt;math&gt;(M^{n+1}, g)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;Ric \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \leq n \leq 6&lt;/math&gt; | url = http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.jdg/1427202766 | journal = J.

'''Araucaria''' is an [[argument mapping]] software tool developed in 2001 by Chris Reed and Glenn Rowe, in the Argumentation Research Group at the School of Computing in the [[University of Dundee]], [[Scotland]]. It is designed to visually represent arguments through diagrams that can be used for analysis and stored in Argument [[Markup Language]] (AML), based on [[XML]]. As a [[free software]], it is available under the [[GNU General Public License]] and may be downloaded for free on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://araucaria.computing.dundee.ac.uk/doku.php?id=version_3.1 |title=version_3.1 [Araucaria@ARG:dundee&amp;#93; |publisher=Araucaria.computing.dundee.ac.uk |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071309/http://araucaria.computing.dundee.ac.uk/doku.php?id=version_3.1| archivedate= 24 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==

The user interface is composed of a main window (diagramming), a schemes editor and the AraucariaDB online interface.

When a text file is loaded into the program, the text is displayed in the left-hand panel of the main window. Highlighting portions of text before clicking on the right (larger) panel creates corresponding nodes at the bottom of that panel. Nodes can then be paired together by dragging one (which will be the premise) to the other (the conclusion). 
To each node may be attached a value such as the ownership of the proposition, or an evaluation specifying the degree of confidence placed in premise. Similarly, symbols can be added to the arrows to state the strength of the inference. In addition, the user may link arguments, supply missing premises (argument reconstruction) and use refutations. 
The diagram will always take the form of a tree structure in Araucaria. The user has the choice of translating the argument into standard diagram, [[Toulmin model|Toulmin]] diagram or [[Wigmore chart|Wigmore]] diagram, Araucaria 3.1 being the first software to integrate the latter [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] and to address the translation issues between the different diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Besnard, 2008, p357&lt;/ref&gt;

While Araucaria helps identify the structure of an argument, it provides freedom of analysis resources. The scheme editor allows the user to create argumentation schemes, group them together and save them into a scheme set file. The scheme set is then applied to the diagram, entirely or in part. As an illustration, an argument scheme relying on symptoms could be applied to the following assertion: "The light has gone off. Therefore, the bulb must be broken", with critical questions intended to determine if the result could stem from another reason (such as "have all the lights in the flat gone off?").

The AraucariaDB Online Repository can be browsed to retrieve specific arguments to fit a diagram. Alternatively, an argument diagram, along with annotations, can be saved into the database.

== Technical details ==

Araucaria was developed in Java in order to be supported on most platforms.&lt;ref&gt;"As part of the commitment to supporting diversity", Reed, 2004, p5&lt;/ref&gt; It is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] and complies with [[free software]] standards.
Argument Markup Language (AML) was created to maintain the evolving relationship between text and diagram. To this end, tags are added to the text and specify the connection between each component. AML is designed to be an application of [[argumentation theory]] in [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed 2004, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is based on [[XML]], a standard widely used by developers, AML content can be accessed through other software that support XML. Likewise, AML data is easily available online after using style sheets to create [[HTML]] web pages.

Araucaria itself is conceived to be compatible with other tools. One example of integration is the argumentation software library Argkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.argkit.org/araucaria/description |title=Araucaria - ArgKit |publisher=Argkit.org |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2010-09-08}} and Besnard 2008, p366&lt;/ref&gt; The online corpus provision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/projects/araucariadb/search.php |title=AraucariaDB Home |publisher=Arg.dundee.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071059/http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/projects/araucariadb/search.php| archivedate= 24 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/AIFdb |title=AIFdb |publisher=Arg.dundee.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is an extension of the Araucaria project. Further integration is planned with other applications currently under development.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 2004, p1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The software is aimed at providing both a pedagogical tool (enhancing the teaching of [[critical thinking]] skills thanks to diagramming) and a support for research within the fields of [[argumentation theory]] and [[informal logic]]. In addition, it fits professional purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 2007, p36&lt;/ref&gt; as it reduces the time needed to process data.

Among the choices of diagram available to the user, [[Wigmore chart]]s were intended to be used for [[legal]] case analysis. Argument mapping tools are particularly suited to professionals and scholars in the legal field who have a considerable amount of arguments required to be processed in a consistent manner. Araucaria has been used by magistrates in Ontario Courts to help with a large volume of relatively simple cases.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 2007, p37 and Prakken, 2008, p453&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of using Araucaria in both learning and teaching philosophy was considered by the program's authors, along with other scholars, in a paper published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Macagno, Reed, Walton, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized how much easier it is to explain and summarize philosophers' theories when arguments are visualized in a diagram. A qualitative survey was carried out among students revealing positive results.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Macagno, Reed, Walton, 2006, p122&lt;/ref&gt;

Araucaria is similar to other pre-existing software in some of its applications. However, the authors' intention was to "fill a gap" in providing a tool able to "support both teaching and research in argumentation theory".&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 2001, p4&lt;/ref&gt;

As of mid-2009, Araucaria is deemed to have approximately 10,000 users,&lt;ref&gt;Rahwan, 2009, p398&lt;/ref&gt; even though that is hard to assess with precision when it comes to software available for free on the internet. [[IP address]] logs show that the user base is very wide both on a geographical level (more than 40 countries) and on a sectoral level (range of domains including doctors, statisticians, lawyers and engineers).&lt;ref&gt;Okada, 2008, p177&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future developments ==

While Araucaria is arguably one of the most sophisticated diagramming software packages and enjoys an important user base, its interface and features may be viewed as outdated. According to Chris Reed, "a large-scale rewrite is underway, which provides [[Argument map#Argument Interchange Format|AIF]] support".&lt;ref&gt;Rahwan 2009, p398&lt;/ref&gt;
It is unknown if this rewrite will be the occasion to turn Araucaria into an online and/or collaborative program. An online tool supporting AIF, albeit with less comprehensive features, was recently developed by Reed's research group (ARG:dundee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/?page_id=143 |title=Online Visualisation of Argument - ARG:dundee |publisher=Arg.dundee.ac.uk |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100816065722/http://www.arg.dundee.ac.uk/?page_id=143| archivedate= 16 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[alpha version]] of this Online Visualisation of Argument (OVA) is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ova.computing.dundee.ac.uk/ |title=OVA from ARG@Dundee - arg.dundee.ac.uk |publisher=Ova.computing.dundee.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100823164202/http://ova.computing.dundee.ac.uk/| archivedate= 23 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, one of Reed's long-time projects had been to tackle the limitations of computer diagramming induced by natural language interpretation, and to add a dialogic argumentation structure to the software. From October 2009 to March 2013, a research program called "Dialectical Argumentation Machines"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G060347/1 |title=Dialectical Argumentation Machines |publisher=Gow.epsrc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is attempted to make a first step towards this objective.

'''''Bandha''''' (also ''karma-bandha'') in Jainism, is the mutual intermingling of the [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] and ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' (fine matter).{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}} ''Bandha'' (Bondage) comes immediately after the ''[[asrava]]'' (influx of ''karmas'').{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=215}}

== Overview ==
According to the Jain text [[Tattvartha sutra]], the activities that causes the bondage (or ''bandha'') are:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=113}}
*Wrong belief
*Non-abstinence
*Negligence
*Passions

According to the Jain text ''[[Samayasāra]]'', a right believer is free from the ''karma-bandha'' i.e. bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jain|first=Vijay K.|title=Acharya Kundkund's Samayasara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwPT79iyRHMC|year=2012|publisher=Vikalp Printers|isbn=978-81-903639-3-8|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Champat Rai Jain]], an influential Jain writer of the 20th century in his book ''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=622–626}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The next thing to understand in this connection is the effect of the action of matter on the soul. We have said that the fusion of spirit and matter results in the bondage of the soul. This is literally true; for the union of substances always tends to limit their natural functions, though new properties and faculties arise in consequence of it. As hydrogen and oxygen, which are gaseous by nature, are robbed of their natural ‘freedom’, i.e., of their gaseous nature, by combining with each other in the form of water, so does the soul become crippled in respect of its natural functions in consequence of its union with matter. This is the bondage, meaning, as it does, the suspension and vitiation of the natural functions and properties of the soul-substance, which are held in check for the time being...}}

== Classification ==
The bondage is of four kinds:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=114}}
# according to the nature or species of karma
# depending upon the duration of karma
# Fruition of karma, and
# The quantity of space-points of karma

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10037">The '''Bliss bibliographic classification''' ('''BC''') is a [[library classification]] system that was created by [[Henry E. Bliss]] (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the [[United States]], it was more commonly adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] libraries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;List of libraries using Bliss Classification. http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bclink.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.

==Origins of the system==
Henry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the [[City College of New York|City College of New York Library]] as Assistant Librarian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was a critic of [[Melvil Dewey]]'s work with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broughton|first=Vanda|date=2008|title=Henry Evelyn Bliss – the other immortal, or a prophet without honour?|url=|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|doi=10.1177/0961000607086620|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of "alternative location," in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.

Bliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, "A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Henry E.|date=August 1910|title=A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives|url=|journal=Library Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, ''Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences'' was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bchist.shtml|title=Bliss Classification Association : BC2 : History &amp; description|website=www.blissclassification.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four broad underlying policies of the BC system are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* alternative location 
* brief, concise notation 
* organizing knowledge according to academic expertise 
* subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.
Bliss deliberately avoided the use of the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric [[typewriter]].

==Adoption and change to BC2==
In 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of [[faceted classification]]. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the [[Library of Congress]] system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.

The case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers’ colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries. It has also found success in libraries outside of the United States of America, as many of these libraries do not have a history of using either the Dewey Decimal, or the Library of Congress classification system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Love sidebar|types}}
'''Broken heart''' (also known as a '''heartbreak''' or '''heartache''') is a [[metaphor]] for the intense emotional—and sometimes physical—stress or pain one feels at experiencing great [[Longing (emotion)|longing]]. The concept is cross-cultural, often cited with reference to a desired or lost lover, and dates back at least 3,000 years.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=R. Skip|title=A Broken Heart can Really Hurt You |publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]] |url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/broken-heart-can-hurt-you |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
The intense pain of a broken heart is believed to be part of the survival instinct. The "[[Attachment in adults|social-attachment system]]" uses the "[[Suffering|pain system]]" to encourage humans to maintain their close social relationships by causing pain when those relationships are lost.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Psychologists Geoff MacDonald of the [[University of Queensland]] and Mark Leary of [[Wake Forest University]] proposed in 2005 the evolution of common mechanisms for both physical and emotional pain responses and argue that such expressions are "more than just a metaphor".&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Geoff|last2=Leary|first2=Mark R.|title=Why Does Social Exclusion Hurt? The Relationship Between Social and Physical Pain |publisher=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |url=http://web.psych.utoronto.ca/gmacdonald/macdonald%20&amp;%20leary,%202005a.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}} The concept is believed to be universal, with many cultures using the same words to describe both physical pain and the feelings associated with relationship loss.&lt;ref name=MacDonald/&gt;{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}

The neurological process involved in the perception of heartache is not known, but is thought to involve the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] of the brain, which during stress may overstimulate the [[vagus nerve]] causing pain, nausea or muscle tightness in the chest.{{sfn|Scientific American Mind 2015}} Research by [[Naomi Eisenberger]] and [[Matthew Lieberman]] of the [[University of California]] from 2008 showed that rejection is associated with activation of the dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and right-ventral [[pre-frontal cortex]], areas established as being involved in processing of pain, including empathizing with pain experienced by others.{{sfn|Scientific American Mind 2015}} The same researchers mention effect of social stressors on the heart, and personality on perception of pain.{{sfn|Eisenberger|Lieberman|2004|pp=294-300}}

A 2011 study showed that the same regions of the brain that become active in response to painful sensory experiences are activated during intense social rejection or social loss in general.{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences 2011}} Social psychologist Ethan Kross from [[University of Michigan]], who was heavily involved in the study, said, "These results give new meaning to the idea that social rejection hurts".{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}} The research implicates the [[secondary somatosensory cortex]] and the dorsal posterior [[insular cortex|insula]].{{sfn|University of Michigan News Service 2011}}

==Psychology==

=== Uncomplicated grief ===
For most bereaved individuals, the journey through grief will ultimately culminate in an acceptable level of adjustment to a life without their loved one.&lt;ref name="Zisook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zisook|first1=Sidney|last2=Shear|first2=Katherine|title=Grief and bereavement: what psychiatrists need to know|journal=World Psychiatry|date=June 1, 2009|volume=8|issue=2|pages=67–74|pmc=2691160|doi=10.1002/j.2051-5545.2009.tb00217.x|pmid=2691160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kübler-Ross model]] postulates that there are five stages of grief after the loss of a loved-one: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while it is recognized that mourners go through initial period of numbness leading to depression and finally to reorganization and recovery, most modern grief specialists recognize the variations and fluidity of grief experiences differ considerably in intensity and length among cultural groups, individually from person to person&lt;ref name="Zisook"/&gt; as well as depending on the amount of investment put into the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Getting Over A Breakup Is A Chance|url=https://www.coaching-online.org/blog/relationship/getting-over-a-breakup/#redefine|publisher=Coaching Online|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruminating, or having intrusive thoughts that are continuous, uncontrollable, and distressing,{{sfn|Carll|2007|p=111}} is often a component of grieving. [[John Bowlby]]'s concept of '''searching for the lost object''' is about the anxiety and mounting frustration as the mourner remains lost, frequently sifting through memories of the departed, and perhaps fleeting perceptions of spectral visitations by the lost individual. When the loss involves 'being left' or 'unrequited love',&lt;ref&gt;Tennov, Dorothy. Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love, Scarborugh House (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the above, this mental searching is accompanied by obsessive thoughts about factors leading to the breakup, and possibilities for reuniting with the lost individual.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, John, Loss: Sadness and Depression; Attachment and Loss, III, Basic Books, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; When rejection is involved, [[shame]] may also be involved – the painful feeling of being inherently unacceptable, disposable, unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helen Block. Shame and Guilt in Neurosis. Madison: International Universities Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical signs of grieving include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Bereavement And Grief|url=http://www.homelifecountry.com/bereavement-and-grief/|publisher=HomeLifeCountry|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Exhaustion, muscle tightness or weakness, body pains, fidgety restlessness, lack of energy
# Insomnia, sleeping too much, disturbing dreams
# Loss of appetite, overeating, nausea, "hollow stomach", indigestion, intestinal disorders like diarrhea, excessive weight gain or loss
# Headaches, short of breath, chest pressure, tightness or heaviness in the throat

=== Depression ===
A broken heart is a major stressor and has been found to precipitate episodes of major [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In one study (death of a spouse), 24% of mourners were depressed at two months, 23% at seven months, 16% at 13 months and 14% at 25 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zisook|first1=S|last2=Shuchter|first2=SR|title=Depression through the first year after the death of a spouse|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=October 1991|volume=148|issue=10|pages=1346–52|doi=10.1176/ajp.148.10.1346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are overlapping symptoms, uncomplicated grief can be distinguished from a full depressive episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Auster|first1=T|last2=Moutier|first2=C|last3=Lanouette|first3=N|title=Bereavement and depression: implications for diagnosis and treatment|journal=Psychiatric Annals|date=October 1, 2008|volume=38|pages=655–661|doi=10.3928/00485713-20081001-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major depression tends to be more pervasive and is characterized by significant difficulty in experiencing self-validating and positive feelings. Major depression is composed of a recognizable and stable cluster of debilitating symptoms, accompanied by a protracted, enduring low mood. It tends to be persistent and associated with poor work and social functioning, pathological immunological function, and other neurobiological changes, unless treated.&lt;ref name="Zisook"/&gt;

In relationship breakups, mourners may turn their anger about the rejection toward themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colin|first1=Virginia A.|title=Human Attachment|date=1996|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can deepen the depression&lt;ref&gt;Schore, Allan. Affect Regulation and Origin of Self: The Neurobiology of Emotional Development. Mahwah: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1994, pp. 416-422&lt;/ref&gt; and cause narcissistic wounding.&lt;ref&gt;Kohut, H. The Restoration of the Self Madison: International Universities Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of self-attack can range from mild self-doubt to scathing self recrimination which leaves a lasting imprint on individuals' self-worth, and causes them to doubt their lovability, personality-efficacy, and attachment worthiness going forward.&lt;ref&gt;Robertiello, Richard. Hold Them Very Close, Then Let Them Go. New York: Dial, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological trauma ===
In severe cases, the depression of a broken heart can create a sustained type of stress that constitutes an [[Psychological trauma|emotional trauma]] which can be severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk"&gt;{{cite book |last= van der Kolk |first= Bessel A |author-link= Bessel van der Kolk |last2= McFarlane |first2= Alexander C |last3= Weisæth |first3= Lars |author-link3= Lars Weisæth |date= 1996 |title= Traumatic Stress: The Effects of Overwhelming Experience on Mind, Body, and Society |location= New York |publisher= Guilford Press |isbn= 978-1-5723-0088-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' can trigger primal separation fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one's vital needs.

Mourners may also experience the intense stress of helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Helplessness: On Depression, Development and Death. San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; If they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they will feel helpless and inadequate to the task. Feeling one's 'limited capacity' can produce a fault line in the psyche which renders the person prone to heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.&lt;ref name="Balint "&gt;Balint, Michael. The Basic Fault: Therapeutic Aspects of Regression. Evanston: North Western University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor contributing to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing someone with whom the mourner has come to rely in ways they did not realize.&lt;ref&gt;Winnecott, Donald W. "The Capacity to be Alone." In The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development. Madison: International Universities Press, 1965 ; {{cite journal | author = Robertiello Richard, Gagnier Terril T | year = 1993 | title = Sado-masochism as a Defense Against Merging: Six Case Studies | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 183–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in time, couples can become external regulators for one another, attuned on many levels: pupils dilated in synchrony, echoing one another's speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany Field, "Attachment as Psychobiological Attunement: Being on the Same Wavelength," in The Psychobiology of Attachment and Separation, pp. 445-448.&lt;/ref&gt;  Couples can function like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other's bio rhythms, responding to one another's pheromones,&lt;ref&gt;L. Monti-Bloch, and B. I. Grosser, "Effect of Putative Pheromones on the Electrical Activity of the Human Vomeronasal Organ and Alfactory Epithilium," Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 1001.&lt;/ref&gt; and be addictive due to the steady trickle of endogenous opiates induced by the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Pert, Candace B. Molecules of Emotion. New York: Scribner, 1997' and {{cite journal | author = Panksepp Jaak, Nelson Eric, Bekkedal Marni | year = 1997 | title = Brain Systems for the Mediation of Separation Distress and Social Reward | url = | journal = Annals NY Academy of Sciences | volume = 807 | issue = | pages = 78–100 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb51914.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Posttraumatic stress disorder ===
Research has shown that in extreme cases, some who experience a broken heart go on to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="goleman"&gt;Goleman, Daniel. The Emotional Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights. North Hampton, Mass, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various predisposing psycho-biological and environmental factors that go into determining whether one's earlier emotional trauma might lead to the development of a true clinical picture of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk"/&gt;  This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence more prone to becoming posttraumatic.

Another factor is that insecure attachments in childhood have shown to predispose the individuals to difficulties in forming secure attachments in adulthood and to having heightened responses to rejection and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, Mary D. S. "Attachments and Other Affectional Bonds Across the Life Cycle." In Attachments Across the Life Cycle. New York: Routledge, 1991; Horney, Karen Horney, K. The neurotic personality of our time. New York: W. W. Norton and Company (1937).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also variation in individuals' neurochemical systems that govern the stress regulation. Depending on the severity of the stress response induced in an individual by an event (i.e. a romantic breakup), certain concentrations of stress hormones including CRF, ACTH, and cortisol work to intensify the imprinting of an emotional memory of the event, indelibly inscribing its fears and other sensations in the amygdala (to serve as a warning for future events),&lt;ref&gt;LeDoux, Joseph. "Emotion, Memory and the Brain." Scientific American (June 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; while the same stress hormones can act to impede.&lt;ref name="goleman"/&gt;

==Medical complications ==

===Broken heart syndrome===
{{main|Takotsubo cardiomyopathy}}
In many legends and fictional tales, characters die after suffering a devastating loss; however, even in reality people die from what appears to be a broken heart. ''[[Broken heart syndrome]]'' is commonly described as a physical pain in the heart or chest area, which is due to the emotional stress caused by a traumatic breakup or the death of a loved one.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}}

Broken heart syndrome mimics symptoms of a heart attack, but it is clinically different from a heart attack because the patients have few risk factors for heart disease and were previously healthy prior to the heart muscles weakening.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}} Some [[echocardiogram]]s expressed how the left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], of people with the broken heart syndrome, was contracting normally but the middle and upper sides of the heart muscle had weaker contractions due to inverted [[T wave]]s and longer Q-T intervals that are associated with [[stress (psychological)|stress]].{{sfn|Lumb|2014|p=51}} Magnetic resonance images suggested that the recovery rates for those suffering from broken heart syndrome are faster than those who had heart attacks and complete recovery to the heart is achieved within two months.{{sfn|Mayo Clinic 2015}}

===Endocrine and immune dysfunction===
Physiological and biochemical changes that contribute to higher physical illnesses and heart diseases have been found in individuals that have high levels of anxiety and depression. Some individuals who have divorced have compromised immune systems because of inflammatory cytokines followed by a state of depression.{{sfn|Field|2011|pp=382-387}}

==Cultural references==
Biblical references to the pain of a broken heart date back to 1015&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Psalm%2069%3A20 "Why is Bible engagement down in the digital age? Bible Gateway's Rachel Barach shares some insight"]. [[Biblegateway]]. Retrieved 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Insults have broken my heart and left me weak, I looked for sympathy but there was none; I found no one to comfort me ([[Psalms|Psalm]] 69:20)

[[Rudaki]], regarded as the first great genius of Persian poetry, used broken heart imagery in his writing.
:Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man
:Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.

[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' features a character, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32&amp;nbsp;BC)#Character in Shakespeare|Enobarbus]], who dies of a broken heart after betraying a friend. [[Lady Montague]] dies of a broken heart after the banishment of her son in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespeare-literature.com/Romeo_and_Juliet/26.html "Romeo and Juliet, Act V Scene III"]. Shakespeare Literature. Retrieved 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frida Kahlo]]'s 1937 painting ''[[Memory, the Heart]]'' portrays the artist's heartbreak during and after an affair between [[Diego Rivera|her husband]] and [[Cristina Kahlo|her sister]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">The term '''Caledonian Antisyzygy''' refers to the "idea of dueling polarities within one entity",&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Maureen M. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HZYPW17S34C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gnwUTK7pGdKbOIaxoK4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false Maureen M. ''The Mighty Scot'', p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt; thought of as typical for the Scottish psyche and literature. It was first coined by [[George Gregory Smith|G. Gregory Smith]] in his 1919 book ''Scottish Literature: Character and Influence''&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Gerard. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHUQTMtwRFkC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BnYUTK2JHp-UOMSuyLMM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false ''Scottish Literature'', p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote:

&lt;!--Quote needs to be either paraphrased or summarised.--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the literature [of Scotland] is the literature of a small country... it runs a shorter course than others... in this shortness and cohesion the most favourable conditions seem to be offered for a making of a general estimate. But on the other hand, we find at closer scanning that the cohesion at least in formal expression and in choice of material is only apparent, that the literature is remarkably varied, and that it becomes, under the stress of foreign influence, almost a zigzag of contradictions. The antithesis need not, however, disconcert us. Perhaps in the very combination of opposites—what either of the two Thomases, [[Thomas Browne|of Norwich]] and [[Thomas Urquhart|Cromarty]], might have been willing to call "'''the Caledonian antisyzygy'''"—we have a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered. If therefore, Scottish history and life are, as an old northern writer said of something else, 'varied with a clean contrair spirit', we need not be surprised to find that in his literature the Scot presents two aspects which appear contradictory. Oxymoron was ever the bravest figure, and we must not forget that disorderly order is order after all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] elaborated on the concept in his essay, ''The Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Gaelic Idea'', published in two parts in ''The Modern Scot'' 1931–1932. The notion is most frequently cited in reference to the seemingly morally contradictory quality of the works of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (''Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'') and [[James Hogg]] (''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''), but is also applied to contrasts between the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], Protestantism and Catholicism, Britishness and Scottishness, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Dobson and [[Glenn Hook|Glenn D. Hook]]. (1993).

Brown (2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9015">On March 15, 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] presented a speech to the United States Congress in which he extolled four basic consumer rights, later called the '''Consumer Bill of Rights'''. The United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] expanded these into eight rights, and thereafter [[Consumers International]] adopted these rights as a charter and started recognizing March 15 as World Consumer Rights Day.

==Background==
Before the mid-twentieth century, consumers had limited rights with regard to their interaction with products and commercial producers. Consumers had limited ground on which to defend themselves against faulty or defective products, or against misleading or deceptive advertising methods.

The [[consumer movement]] began to gather a following, pushing for increased rights and legal protection against malicious business practices. By the end of the 1950s, legal [[product liability]] had been established in which an aggrieved party need only prove injury by use of a product, rather than bearing the burden of proof of corporate negligence.

[[Helen Ewing Nelson]] was a drafter of the Consumer Bill of Rights and sought an outlet for distributing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-04/features/1995247035_1_helen-nelson-consumer-movement-consumer-rights |title=Pioneer fights on for consumer safety - Baltimore Sun |first=Rebecca |last=Smith |work=articles.baltimoresun.com |date=4 September 1995 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"&gt;{{Citation |last=Shearer |first=Julie |year=1977–1979 |title=Pat Brown - Friends and Campaigners |publisher=[[Regional Oral History Office]] |publication-place=[[Berkeley, California]] |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/patbrownfriends00rfryrich/patbrownfriends00rfryrich_djvu.txt |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.consumer-action.org/press/articles/helen_nelson_1913_2005 |title=Helen Nelson (1913-2005) will be greatly missed by the consumer movement |first= |last= |publisher=[[Consumer Action]] |work=consumer-action.org |date=23 March 2005 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Kennedy's election campaign he made a promise to support consumers.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; After his election, [[Fred Dutton]], a colleague of Nelson's and a government officer who advised the president, asked for Nelson's suggestions on how the president could support consumers, and she sent him the Consumer Bill of Rights.&lt;ref name="Nelsoninterview"/&gt; Kennedy presented those rights in a speech to Congress on March 15, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=9108 |title=John F. Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest. |first=John F. |last=Kennedy |authorlink=John F. Kennedy |work=presidency.ucsb.edu |date=March 15, 1962 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that speech he named four basic rights of consumers.

== Some of the Rights ==

===The right to safety===
The assertion of this right is aimed at the defense of consumers against injuries caused by products other than automobile vehicles, and implies that products should cause no harm to their users if such use is executed as prescribed. The right was further formalized in 1972 by the US federal government through the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] (CPSC). This organization has jurisdiction over thousands of commercial products, and powers that allow it to establish performance standards and require product testing and warning labels.

===The right to be informed===
This right states that businesses should always provide consumers with enough appropriate information to make intelligent and informed product choices. Product information provided by a business should always be complete and truthful. Aiming to achieve protection against misleading information in the areas of financing, advertising, labeling, and packaging, the right to be informed is protected by several pieces of legislation passed between 1960 and 1980.

Some of the legislation which was made because of the assertion of this right include the following:
*[[Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (US)]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of business and finance|year=2007|publisher=Thomson/Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0028660615|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-1552100067.html |edition=2.|last1=Lush |first1=Mary |last2=Hinton |first2=Val |editor=Burton S. Kalisk |chapter=Consumer Bill of Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wholesome Meat Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Truth in Lending Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;
*[[Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act]]&lt;ref name="MaryLush"/&gt;

===The right to choose===
The right to free choice among product offerings states that consumers should have a variety of options provided by different companies from which to choose. The federal government has taken many steps to ensure the availability of a healthy environment open to competition through legislation including limits on concept ownership through [[Patent Law|patent law]], prevention of monopolistic business practices through [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust legislation]], and the outlaw of price cutting and [[Price gouging|gouging]].

===The right to be heard===
This right has the ability of consumers to voice complaints and concerns about a product in order to have the issue handled efficiently and responsively. While no federal agency is tasked with the specific duty of providing a forum for this interaction between consumer and producer, certain outlets exist to aid consumers if difficulty occurs in communication with an aggrieving party. State and federal [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] are equipped to aid their constituents in dealing with parties who have provided a product or service in a manner unsatisfactory to the consumer in violation of an applicable law. Also, the [[Better Business Bureau]] is a national [[non-governmental]] organization whose sole agenda is to provide political lobbies and action on behalf of aggrieved consumers.

==Expansion to eight rights==
In 1985, the concept of consumer rights was endorsed by the United Nations through the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]], which expands them to include eight basic rights.

===The right to satisfaction of basic needs===
This right demands that people have access to basic, essential goods and services: adequate food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, public utilities, water, and sanitation

===The right to redress===
The right to redress provides for consumers to receive a fair settlement of just claims, including compensation for misrepresentation, shoddy goods, or unsatisfactory services. For example, a consumer should be able to go to consumer court against mobile phone companies that put hidden charges on the bill that were not previously explained, or activate ringtones without the consumer's permission.

===The right to consumer education===
The right to consumer education states that consumers should be able to acquire knowledge and skills needed to make informed, confident choices about goods and services, while being aware of basic consumer rights and responsibilities and how to act on them.

===The right to a healthy environment===
This is the right to live and work in a work space or home that is non-threatening to the well-being of present and future generations.

==World Consumer Rights Day==
The [[NGO]] [[Consumers International]] adopted the eight rights and restated them as a charter.&lt;ref name="consumersinternational"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersinternational.org/who-we-are/consumer-rights|title=Consumers International - Who we are - consumer rights|publisher=consumersinternational.org|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the organization began recognizing the date of Kennedy's speech, March 15, as World Consumer Rights Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-guest/jfk-consumer-rights_b_1347471.html |title=Jim Guest: Fighting for Consumer Rights, Fifty Years After Kennedy's Call |first=Jim |last=Guest |authorlink=James A. Guest |work=huffingtonpost.com |date=15 March 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom provisions==
As of May 2014, the UK Government has introduced proposed legislation before Parliament. The bill is the "Consumer Rights Bill", and it will consolidate and develop Unfair Contract Terms provisions and Consumer Protection provisions.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/areas/consumer_rights.htm|title=Consumer Rights - Law Commission|publisher=lawcommission.justice.gov.uk|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">In the theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], '''demand''' ({{lang-fr|demande}}) represents the way instinctive needs are inevitably alienated through the effects of language on the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of demand was developed by Lacan in parallel to those of need and desire to account for the role of speech on human aspirations.&lt;ref name = enotes&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo, "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt; Demand forms part of Lacan's battle against the approach to [[language acquisition]] favored by [[ego psychology]], and makes use of [[Kojeve]]'s theory of desire.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Demand is not a [[Freud]]ian concept.&lt;ref name = enotes/&gt;

==Language acquisition==

For Lacan, demand is the result of language acquisition on physical needs - the individual's wants are automatically filtered through the alien system of external signifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Lacan, ''Four'' p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Where traditionally [[psychoanalysis]] had recognised that learning to speak was a major step in the ego's acquisition of power over the world,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control,&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 133-4 and p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language.

He argued that "demand constitutes the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs", and that indeed the child's biological needs are themselves altered by "the condition that is imposed on him by the existence of the discourse, to make his need pass through the defiles of the signifier".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 286 and p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Thus even in speaking one's demands, the latter are altered; and even when they are met, the child finds that it no longer wants what it thought it wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Schneiderman, ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire==

In Lacanian thought, a demand results when a [[lack (manque)|lack]] in [[the Real]] is transformed into [[the Symbolic]] medium of [[language]]. Demands faithfully express [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] signifying formations, but always leave behind
a residue or kernel of [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]], representing a lost surplus of [[jouissance]] for the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], (because the Real is never totally symbolizable).

As a result, for Lacan, "desire is situated in dependence on demand - which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a [[Metonymy|metonymic]] remainder which runs under it".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The frustration inherent in demand -  whatever is actually asked for is 'not it' - is what gives rise to desire.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Other's demands==

The demands of human society are initially mediated via the Mother;&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; with the discourse of whom the infant comes to identify, subsuming its own non-verbal self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The result in the neurotic may be a dominance of parental demand, and of the social objects valued by such demands - jobs, degrees, marriage, success, money and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 189 and p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered indeed that for the neurotic "the demand of the Other assumes the function of an object in his phantasy...this prevalence given by the neurotic to demand".&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"/&gt;

==Transference==

Lacan considered that the [[transference]] appears in the forms of demands from the patient&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  - demands which he stressed the analyst must resist.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Through such demands, he states, "the whole past opens up right down to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, and...[[regression (psychology)|regression]] shows nothing other than a return to the present of signifiers used in demands".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 254-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Roustang]] however has challenged the Lacanian view, arguing that the patient's demand, rather than undermining the analysis, may be a positive attempt to get the analyst to shift their therapeutic stance.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Campbell, ''Psychoanalysis and the Time of Life'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Globalize||[[United States]]|date=November 2017}}
[[File:The Royal Feast of Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings (1884).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political cartoon from October 1884, showing wealthy [[Plutocracy|plutocrats]] feasting at a table while a poor family begs beneath]]

In [[political theory|political]] and [[sociology|sociological]] theory, the '''elite''' (French ''élite'', from [[Latin]] ''eligere'') are a small group of powerful people who hold a [[economic inequality|disproportionate amount of wealth]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], [[political power]], or skill in a society. Defined by the Cambridge Dictionary, the "elite" are "those people or organizations that are considered the best or most powerful compared to others of a similar type." &lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/type&lt;/ref&gt;
==Identity and social structure==
American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] wrote of the "elite" in his 1957 book ''[[The Power Elite]]'' as "those political, economic, and military circles, which as an intricate set of overlapping small but dominant groups share decisions having at least national consequences. Insofar as national events are decided, the power elite are those who decide them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills states that the power elite members recognize other members' mutual exalted position in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=2013|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As a rule, 'they accept one another, understand one another, marry one another, tend to work, and to think, if not together at least alike'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is a well-regulated existence where education plays a critical role. Youthful upper-class members attend prominent preparatory schools, which not only open doors to such elite universities as [[Harvard]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Yale]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], but also to the universities' highly exclusive clubs. These memberships in turn pave the way to the prominent social clubs located in all major cities and serving as sites for important business contacts".&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, new Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|year=1956|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elitist privilege==
According to Mills, men receive the education necessary for [[elitism|elitist]] privilege to obtain their background and contacts, allowing them to enter three branches of the power elite, which are;
*The Political Leadership: Mills contended that since the end of [[World War II]], corporate leaders had become more prominent in the political process, with a decline in central decision-making for professional politicians. 
*The Military Circle: In Mills' time a heightened concern about warfare existed, making top military leaders and such issues as defense funding and personnel recruitment very important. Most prominent corporate leaders and politicians were strong proponents of military spending. 
*The Corporate Elite: According to Mills, in the 1950s when the military emphasis was pronounced, it was corporate leaders working with prominent military officers who dominated the development of policies. These two groups tended to be mutually supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Charles W.|title=The Power Elite|year=1956|pages=274–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mills, the governing elite in the United States primarily draws its members from political leaders, including the president, and a handful of key cabinet members, as well as close advisers, major corporate owners and directors, and high-ranking military officers.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Power elite|editor=Ritzer, George |editor2=Ryan, J. Michael|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Sociology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|page=466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA466|author1=Powell, Jason L.  |author2=Chamberlain, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups overlap and elites tend to circulate from one sector to another, consolidating power in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Jason L. (2007) "power elite" in George Ritzer (ed.) ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology'',  Blackwell Publishing, 2007, pp. 3602-3603&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[ruling class]], a social formation based on heritage and social ties, the power elite is characterized by the organizational structures through which its wealth is acquired. According to Mills, the power elite rose from "the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into the more or less unified stratum of the corporate rich".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Domhoff further clarified the differences in the two terms: "The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of organizations and institutions...Leaders within the upper class join with high-level employees in the organizations they control to make up what will be called the power elite".&lt;ref&gt;[[G. William Domhoff|Domhoff, William G]], ''Who Rules America Now?'' (1997), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marxist]] theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] anticipated the [[elite theory]] in his 1929 work, ''Imperialism and World Economy'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin|first1=Carson|title=Kevin Carson Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Carson}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=December 2017}} "present-day state power is nothing but an entrepreneurs' company of tremendous power, headed even by the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking and syndicate offices".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin, Nikolai]]. ''Imperialism and World Economy'' (1929)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power elite ==
The ''power elite'' is a term used by American sociologist [[C. Wright Mills]] to describe a relatively small, loosely connected group of individuals who dominate American policy making. This group includes bureaucratic, corporate, intellectual, military, [[media mogul|media]], and government elites who control the principal institutions in the United States and whose opinions and actions influence the decisions of the policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;power elite. (n.d.). The American Heritage® New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy, Third Edition. Retrieved January 18, 2015, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/power%20elite&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for membership of a power elite is institutional power, namely an influential position within a prominent private or public organization.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38" /&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has shown that social class continues to hold sway in determining who joins this elite group, with those from the upper-middle class tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0170840613509919|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study (published in 2002) of power elites in the United States under President [[George W. Bush]] (in office 2001-2009) identified 7,314 institutional positions of power encompassing 5,778 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dye|first=Thomas
|title= Who's Running America? The Bush Restoration, 7th edition
| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-ntAAAAMAAJ
| year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later study of U.S. society noted demographic characteristics of this elite group as follows:

; '''Age''' : Corporate leaders aged about 60; heads of [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundations]], law, education, and civic organizations aged around 62; government employees aged about 56.
; '''Gender''' : Men contribute roughly 80% in the political realm whereas women contribute roughly only 20% in the political realm. In the economic denomination, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, only 32 (6.4%) of the fortune 500 CEOs are women.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fortune 500 list|url=http://beta.fortune.com/fortune500/list|website=Fortune|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; '''Ethnicity''' : [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|White Anglo-Saxons]] dominate in the power elite, with [[Protestants]] representing about 80% of the top business leaders, and about 73% of members of Congress. {{as of|October 2017}}, only 4 of the fortune 500 CEOs are African American.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt; In similarly low proportions, {{as of|October 2017|lc=on}}, 10 of the fortune 500 CEOs are [[Latino]], and 2% are Asian.&lt;ref name="Fortune 500" /&gt;
; '''Education''' : Nearly all the leaders have a college education, with almost half graduating with advanced degrees. About 54% of the big-business leaders, and 42% of the government elite graduated from just 12 prestigious [[universities]] with large [[Endowment fund|endowments]].
; '''Social clubs''' : Most holders of top positions in the power elite possess exclusive membership to one or more [[social clubs]]. About a third belong to a small number of especially prestigious clubs in major cities like [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Impacts on economy==

In the 1970s an organized set of policies promoted reduced [[tax]]es, especially for the wealthy, and a steady erosion of the welfare safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins and Eckert 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with legislation in the 1980s, the wealthy banking community successfully lobbied for reduced regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Francis 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide range of financial and social capital accessible to the power elite gives their members heavy influence in economic and political decision making, allowing them to move toward attaining desired outcomes. Sociologist Christopher Doob gives a hypothetical alternative, stating that these elite individuals would consider themselves the overseers of the national economy. Also appreciating that it is not only a moral, but a practical necessity to focus beyond their group interests. Doing so would hopefully alleviate various destructive conditions affecting large numbers of less affluent citizens.&lt;ref name="Doob 2013 38"/&gt;

==Global politics and hegemony==
Mills determined that there is an "inner core" of the power elite involving individuals that are able to move from one seat of institutional power to another. They therefore, have a wide range of knowledge and interests in many influential organizations, and are, as Mills describes, "professional go-betweens of economic, political, and military affairs".&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Wright Mills|Mills, Charles W]]. ''The Power Elite'', p 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Relentless expansion of [[capitalism]] and the globalizing of economic and military power, binds leaders of the power elite into complex relationships with [[nation states]] that generate global-scale class divisions. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] writes in ''[[The Rise of the Network Society]]'' that contemporary globalization does not mean that "everything in the global economy is global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a global economy becomes characterized by fundamental social inequalities with respect to the "level of integration, competitive potential and share of the benefits from economic growth".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Castells|first=Manuel|title=The Rise of the Network Society|year=1996|publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1557866172|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells cites a kind of "double movement"  where on one hand, "valuable segments of territories and people" become "linked in the global networks of value making and wealth appropriation", while, on the other, "everything and everyone" that is not valued by established networks gets "switched off...and ultimately discarded".&lt;ref name="CastellsManuel" /&gt; The wide-ranging effects of [[global capitalism]] ultimately affect everyone on the planet, as economies around the world come to depend on the functioning of global financial markets, technologies, trade and labor.

The '''European dark bee''' ('''''Apis mellifera mellifera''''') is a subspecies of the [[western honey bee]], whose original range stretched from west-central Russia through Northern Europe and probably down to the Iberian Peninsula. They belong to the 'M' lineage of ''Apis mellifera''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2007/02/m6083.pdf Gene flow within the M evolutionary lineage of Apis mellifera: role of the Pyrenees, isolation by distance and post-glacial re-colonization routes in western Europe]. Apidologie 38 (2007) 141–155. 2 August 2006. p141&lt;/ref&gt;. They are large for honey bees though they have unusually short tongues (5.7-6.4mm) and traditionally were called the German Dark Bee, a name still used today&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Characteristics of Races of Honeybees |url=http://three-peaks.net/PDF/Races%20of%20Honey%20Bees%2001.pdf |website=three-peaks.net |publisher=Three Peaks |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ironically they are now considered an Endangered Breed in Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rote Liste der bedrohten Nutztierrassen in Deutschland |url=http://www.g-e-h.de/die-geh1/rote-liste |website=g-e-h.de |publisher=Gesellschaft zur Erhaltung alter und gefährdeter Haustierrassen e. V. (GEH) |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their common name is derived from their brown-black color, with only a few lighter yellow spots on the abdomen&lt;ref name="Winston1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark L. Winston|title=The Biology of the Honey Bee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5iobWHLtAQC&amp;pg=PA10|year=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07409-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However today they are more likely to be called after the geographic / political region in which they live such as the British Black Bee, the Native Irish Honey Bee, the Cornish Black Bee and the Nordic Brown Bee, even though they are all the same subspecie, with the word ''native'' often being added by local beekeepers, even if the bee was introduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colonsay Dark Native Bees (Photo at bottom)) |title=Colonsay Black Bee Reserve |url=http://www.snhbs.scot/colonsay/ |website=snhbs.scot |publisher=SNHBS |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The A. m. mellifera can be distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration.

==Character==
The ''A. m. mellifera'' is descended from the M lineage of ''[[Apis mellifera]]'', of which all bees to a greater or lesser degree have a strongly defensive instinct (from the point of view of the bee) or strong aggression (from the point of view of the beekeeper), especially when compared to the C lineage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=J.D. |last2=Yates |first2=B.D. |title=Beekeeping Study Notes for the BBKA Examinations Vol.1 |date=1996 |publisher=Northern Bee Books |isbn=978-0905652818 |pages=28-29 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
''A. m. mellifera'' hybrids have an even greater reputation of aggression amongst beekeepers, which can increase in subsequent generations, if left unchecked&lt;ref name="gdeb.eu"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bruder |first1=Adam |title=Die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung der Kombinationszucht (seitennummer 7-8) |url=https://wp.gdeb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Vortrag-Koeln.pdf |website=Gemeinschaft der europäischen Buckfastimker e.V. |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although this characteristic can be overcome with continual selective breeding over some generations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waring |first1=Claire |last2=Waring |first2=Adrian |title=The Bee Manual |date=2014 |publisher=J H Haynes &amp; Co Ltd |isbn=0857338099 |pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are nervous and aggressive to the extent that routine inspections will take longer, decreasing the enjoyment of managing their colonies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Celia F. |title=The Honey Bee around &amp; about |date=2014 |publisher=Bee Craft Ltd. |isbn=978-0-900147-15-9 |pages=10 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This characteristic is one that has been traditionally associated with ''A. m. mellifera'' going back to the old British Black bee before the early 1900's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winston |first1=Mark L. |title=The Biology of the Honey Bee |date=1991 |publisher=First Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-07409-2 |pages=10 |edition=paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yates |first1=J.D. |last2=Yates |first2=B.D. |title=Beekeeping Study Notes for the BBKA Examinations Vol.1 |date=1996 |publisher=Northern Bee Books |isbn=978-0905652818 |pages=29 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;: To quote [[Brother Adam]] who had first hand experience, "The native (British Black) bee had undoubtedly many extremely valuable characteristics, but equally so a great many serious defects and drawbacks. She was very bad tempered and very susceptible to brood diseases and would in any case not have been able to produce the crops (of honey) we have secured since her demise"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brother Adam O.B.E. |title=Beekeeping at Buckfast Abbey |date=1975 |publisher=British Bee Publications |pages=12 |edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Significance==
''Apis mellifera mellifera'' is no longer a significant commercial subspecies of the [[Western honey bee]], but there are a number of dedicated hobbyist beekeepers that keep these bees in northern and central Europe. Immigrants brought these subspecies into the Americas. Prior to their arrival, the American continent did not have any honey bees{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.
[[File:British Black Bee, Lost Gardens of Heligan Sep 2017 1920 x 1080.png|thumb|Apis mellifera mellifera]]

In north western Europe, ''A. m. mellifera'' were the original honey bee stock until creation of the ''[[Buckfast bee]]'' a breed of bee whose progeny originally included the remnants of the old British black bee (''A. m. mellifera''), which became extinct due to the ''[[Acarapis woodi]]'' (acarine mite).

In the United States, research based on DNA sequencing analysis found DNA from the 'M' lineage of honey bees in the feral population of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Missouri, believed in part to be the DNA from imported bees of over 100 years ago (DNA from the other bee lineages was also found in these feral populations, suggesting that they likely came from escaped swarms from apiaries at unknown times in the past)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honey Bee &amp; Bumble Bee Genetics Research |url=http://comp.uark.edu/~aszalan/Site/Apis/Honey_Bee_Research.html |website=Insects Genetics Lab |publisher=University of Arkansas |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527202036/http://comp.uark.edu/~aszalan/Site/Apis/Honey_Bee_Research.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the documentary [[More than Honey]] the bee kept and bred by Swiss (German) beekeeper Herr. Fred Jaggi was the ''A. m. mellifera'', referred to as the "local black breed", in which he strives to maintain "racially pure" bees, lamenting when he discovers yellow coloration in the colony of one of his queens, meaning that she has bred with a drone from a different subspecie and produced "little half-breeds", she is subsequently killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=More than Honey |url=http://www.morethanhoneyfilm.com/protagonists.html |website=morethanhoneyfilm.com |publisher=Marcus Imhoof |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; we see in the documentary his pure bees succumbing to a brood disease and having to be gassed then burned: Herr. Jaggi abandons the local black bees and the goal of racial purity, choosing ''A. m. carnica'' bees instead, with an apiary that includes hybrids to enhance genetic diversity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Origins of the Documentary 'More Than Honey' |url=https://beelebanon.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/8-the-origins-of-the-documentary-more-than-honey-l.pdf |website=beelebanon.files.wordpress.com |publisher=Marcus Imhoof |accessdate=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16164">In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''evolutionary algorithm''' ('''EA''') is a [[subset]] of [[evolutionary computation]],&lt;ref name="EVOALG"&gt;{{cite article|last=Vikhar|first=P. A.|title=Evolutionary algorithms: A critical review and its future prospects|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7955308&amp;isnumber=7955253|journal=Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication (ICGTSPICC)|publisher= Jalgaon, 2016, pp. 261-265|isbn=978-1-5090-0467-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a generic population-based [[metaheuristic]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] [[algorithm]]. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]], such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], and [[natural selection|selection]]. [[Candidate solution]]s to the [[optimization problem]] play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[fitness function]] determines the quality of the solutions (see also [[loss function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying [[fitness landscape]]. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of [[microevolution|microevolutionary processes]] and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity is a prohibiting factor.&lt;ref name="VLSI"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohoon|first=J et al.|title=Evolutionary algorithms for the physical design of VLSI circuits|url= https://www.ifte.de/mitarbeiter/lienig/cohoon.pdf|journal=Advances in Evolutionary Computing: Theory and Applications|publisher= Springer, pp. 683-712, 2003|isbn=978-3-540-43330-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, this computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. [[Fitness approximation]] is one of the solutions to overcome this difficulty. However, seemingly simple EA can solve often complex problems{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}; therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexity.

==Implementation==

Step One: Generate the initial [[population]] of [[individual]]s randomly. (First generation)

Step Two: Evaluate the [[Fitness function|fitness]] of each individual in that population (time limit, sufficient fitness achieved, etc.)

Step Three: Repeat the following regenerational steps until termination:
#Select the best-fit individuals for [[reproduce|reproduction]]. (Parents)
# [[Breed]] new individuals through [[crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] and [[mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] operations to give birth to [[offspring]].
# Evaluate the individual fitness of new individuals.
# Replace least-fit population with new individuals.

==Types==
Similar techniques differ in [[genetic representation]] and other implementation details, and the nature of the particular applied problem.
*[[Genetic algorithm]] – This is the most popular type of EA. One seeks the solution of a problem in the form of strings of numbers (traditionally binary, although the best representations are usually those that reflect something about the problem being solved),&lt;ref name=VLSI/&gt; by applying operators such as recombination and mutation (sometimes one, sometimes both).  This type of EA is often used in [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems. Another name for it is ''fetura'', from the Latin for breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Roland, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MPW3Y10 ''Wayward World'']. Novel that uses fetura to select candidates for public office.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Genetic programming]] – Here the solutions are in the form of computer programs, and their fitness is determined by their ability to solve a computational problem.
*[[Evolutionary programming]] – Similar to genetic programming, but the structure of the program is fixed and its numerical parameters are allowed to evolve.
*[[Gene expression programming]] – Like genetic programming, GEP also evolves computer programs but it explores a genotype-phenotype system, where computer programs of different sizes are encoded in linear chromosomes of fixed length.
*[[Evolution strategy]] – Works with vectors of real numbers as representations of solutions, and typically uses self-adaptive mutation rates.
*[[Differential evolution]] – Based on vector differences and is therefore primarily suited for [[numerical optimization]] problems.
*[[Neuroevolution]] – Similar to genetic programming but the genomes represent artificial neural networks by describing structure and connection weights. The genome encoding can be direct or indirect.
*[[Learning classifier system]] – Here the solution is a set of classifiers (rules or conditions). A Michigan-LCS evolves at the level of individual classifiers whereas a Pittsburgh-LCS uses populations of classifier-sets. Initially, classifiers were only binary, but now include real, neural net, or [[S-expression]] types. Fitness is typically determined with either a strength or accuracy based [[reinforcement learning]] or [[supervised learning]] approach.

==Comparison to biological processes==

A possible limitation{{According to whom|date=May 2013}} of many evolutionary algorithms is their lack of a clear [[genotype-phenotype distinction]]. In nature, the fertilized egg cell undergoes a complex process known as [[embryogenesis]] to become a mature [[phenotype]]. This indirect [[encoding]] is believed to make the genetic search more robust (i.e. reduce the probability of fatal mutations), and also may improve the [[evolvability]] of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;G.S. Hornby and J.B. Pollack. "Creating high-level components with a generative representation for body-brain evolution". ''[[Artificial Life (journal)|Artificial Life]]'', 8(3):223–246, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Clune, Benjamin Beckmann, Charles Ofria, and Robert Pennock.

''Proceedings of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computing Special Section on Evolutionary Robotics'', 2009. Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; Such indirect (a.k.a. generative or developmental) encodings also enable evolution to exploit the regularity in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;J. Clune, C. Ofria, and R. T. Pennock, [http://jeffclune.com/publications/Clune-HyperNEATandRegularity.pdf "How a generative encoding fares as problem-regularity decreases"], in ''PPSN'' (G. Rudolph, T. Jansen, S. M. Lucas, C. Poloni, and N. Beume, eds.), vol. 5199 of ''Lecture Notes in Computer Science'', pp. 358–367, Springer, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the field of [[artificial development|artificial embryogeny]], or artificial developmental systems, seeks to address these concerns. And [[gene expression programming]] successfully explores a genotype-phenotype system, where the genotype consists of linear multigenic chromosomes of fixed length and the phenotype consists of multiple expression trees or computer programs of different sizes and shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira, C., 2001.

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

In [[mathematics]], a [[Hausdorff space]] ''X'' is called a '''fixed-point space''' if every [[continuous function]]  &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].

For example, any closed interval [a,b] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed point space, and it can be proved from the intermediate value property of real continuous function. The [[open interval]] (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), however, is not a fixed point space. To see it, consider the function 
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a + \frac{1}{b-a}\cdot(x-a)^2&lt;/math&gt;, for example. 

Any [[linearly ordered]] space that is connected and has a top and a bottom element is a fixed point space. 

Note that, in the definition, we could easily have disposed of the condition that the space is Hausdorff.

A '''functional flow block diagram''' ('''FFBD''') is a multi-tier, time-sequenced, step-by-step flow diagram of a [[system]]’s functional flow.&lt;ref&gt;The first version of this article is completely based on the [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/operations/sysengsaf/seman/SEM3.1/Section%204.4.pdf NAS SYSTEM ENGINEERING MANUAL SECTION] 4.4 VERSION 3.1 06/06/06.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "functional" in this context is different from its use in [[functional programming]] or in mathematics, where pairing "functional" with "flow" would be ambiguous. Here, "functional flow" pertains to the sequencing of operations, with "flow" arrows expressing  dependence on the success of prior operations. FFBDs may also express input and output data dependencies between functional blocks, as shown in figures below, but FFBDs primarily focus on sequencing.

The FFBD notation was developed in the 1950s, and is widely used in classical [[systems engineering]]. FFBDs are one of the classic [[business process modeling]] methodologies, along with [[flow chart]]s, [[data flow diagram]]s, [[control flow diagram]]s, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT]] diagrams, and [[IDEF]].&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt;Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=December 20, 2006 }}. INFS 770 Methods for Information Systems Engineering:  Knowledge Management and E-Business. Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

FFBDs are also referred to as ''Functional Flow Diagrams'', ''functional block diagrams'', and ''functional flows''.&lt;ref name="FAA08"/&gt;

== History ==
The first structured method for documenting process flow, the [[flow process chart]], was introduced by [[Frank Gilbreth]] to members of [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”.&lt;ref name="BBG02"&gt;Ben B. Graham (2004). [http://www.detail-process-charting.com/chapter1.htm "Detail Process Charting: Speaking the Language of Process".] p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbreth's tools quickly found their way into [[industrial engineering]] curricula.

In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began training business people in the use of some of the tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to [[Procter and Gamble]] where he developed their Deliberate Methods Change Program.  Another 1944 graduate, [[Benjamin S. Graham|Ben S. Graham]], Director of Formcraft Engineering at [[Standard Register Industrial]], adapted the flow process chart to information processing with his development of the multi-flow process chart to display multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set as the ASME Standard for Operation and Flow Process Charts, derived from Gilbreth's original work.&lt;ref name="BBG02"/&gt;

The modern Functional Flow Block Diagram was developed by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Incorporated, a defense-related business, in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weilkiens (2008). ''Systems Engineering with SysML/UML: Modeling, Analysis, Design''. Page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was exploited by [[NASA]] to visualize the time sequence of events in space systems and flight missions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Chestnut]] (1967). ''Systems Engineering Methods''. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; FFBDs became widely used in classical [[systems engineering]] to show the order of execution of system functions.&lt;ref name="TD03"/&gt;

== Development of functional flow block diagrams ==
[[Image:Development of Functional Flow Block Diagrams.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Figure 2: Development of Functional Flow Block Diagrams&lt;ref name="NASA07"&gt;NASA (2007). ''[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf NASA Systems Engineering Handbook]'' December 2007. p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
FFBDs can be developed in a series of levels. FFBDs show the same tasks identified through functional decomposition and display them in their logical, sequential relationship. For example, the entire [[flight mission]] of a [[spacecraft]] can be defined in a top level FFBD, as shown in Figure 2. Each block in the first level diagram can then be expanded to a series of functions, as shown in the second level diagram for "perform mission operations." Note that the diagram shows both input (transfer to operational orbit) and output (transfer to space transportation system orbit), thus initiating the interface identification and control process. Each block in the second level diagram can be progressively developed into a series of functions, as shown in the third level diagram on Figure 2.&lt;ref name="NASA07"/&gt;

These diagrams are used both to develop requirements and to identify profitable trade studies. For example, does the spacecraft antenna acquire the tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) only when the payload data are to be transmitted, or does it track TDRS continually to allow for the reception of emergency commands or transmission of emergency data? The FFBD also incorporates alternate and contingency operations, which improve the probability of mission success. The flow diagram provides an understanding of total operation of the system, serves as a basis for development of operational and contingency procedures, and pinpoints areas where changes in operational procedures could simplify the overall system operation.  In certain cases, alternate FFBDs may be used to represent various means of satisfying a particular function until data are acquired, which permits selection among the alternatives.&lt;ref name="NASA07"/&gt;

== Building blocks ==

=== Key attributes ===
An overview of the key FFBD attributes:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt; 
[[Image:Function block.jpg|thumb|320px|Graphical explanation of a "function block" used in these diagrams.  Flow is from left to right.&lt;ref name="FAA08"&gt;[http://www.hf.faa.gov/webtraining/Usability/u17_tools2.htm Task Analysis Tools Used Throughout Development]. FAA 2008. Retrieved 25 Sept 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
* ''Function block'': Each function on an FFBD should be separate and be represented by single box (solid line). Each function needs to stand for definite, finite, discrete action to be accomplished by system elements.
* ''Function numbering'': Each level should have a consistent number scheme and provide information concerning function origin. These numbers establish identification and relationships that will carry through all Functional Analysis and Allocation activities and facilitate traceability from lower to top levels.
* ''Functional reference'': Each diagram should contain a reference to other functional diagrams by using a functional reference (box in brackets).
* ''Flow connection'': Lines connecting functions should only indicate function flow and not a lapse in time or intermediate activity. 
* ''Flow direction'': Diagrams should be laid out so that the flow direction is generally from left to right. Arrows are often used to indicate functional flows. 
* ''Summing gates'': A circle is used to denote a summing gate and is used when AND/OR is present. AND is used to indicate parallel functions and all conditions must be satisfied to proceed. OR is used to indicate that alternative paths can be satisfied to proceed.
* ''GO and NO-GO paths'': “G” and “bar G” are used to denote “go” and “no-go” conditions. These symbols are placed adjacent to lines leaving a particular function to indicate alternative paths.

=== Function symbolism ===
A function shall be represented by a rectangle containing the title of the function (an action verb followed by a noun phrase) and its unique decimal delimited number. A horizontal line shall separate this number and the title, as shown in see Figure 3 above.

A '''Grotrian diagram''', or '''term diagram''', shows the allowed [[electronic transition]]s between the [[energy level]]s of atoms.  They can be used for one-electron and multi-electron atoms.  They take into account the specific [[selection rules]] related to changes in [[Angular momentum (quantum mechanics)|angular momentum]] of the electron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5034">In [[physics]], the '''gyration tensor''' is a [[tensor]] that describes the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of position of a collection of [[Elementary particle|particle]]s

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{mn} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_{m}^{(i)} r_{n}^{(i)}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r_{m}^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{m^{th}}&lt;/math&gt; 
[[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinate]] of the position [[vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; of the 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{i^{th}}&lt;/math&gt; particle.  The [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the [[coordinate system]] has been chosen such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}^{(i)} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. in the system of the [[center of mass]] &lt;math&gt;r_{CM}&lt;/math&gt;. Where

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{CM}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbf{r}^{(i)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another definition, which is mathematically identical but gives an alternative calculation method, is:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{mn} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} (r_{m}^{(i)} - r_{m}^{(j)}) (r_{n}^{(i)} - r_{n}^{(j)})
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the x-y component of the gyration tensor for particles in Cartesian coordinates would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{xy} = \frac{1}{2N^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} (x_{i} - x_{j}) (y_{i} - y_{j})
&lt;/math&gt;

In the continuum limit,

:&lt;math&gt;
S_{mn} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \dfrac{\int d\mathbf{r} \ \rho(\mathbf{r}) \ r_{m} r_{n}}{\int d\mathbf{r} \ \rho(\mathbf{r})}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; represents the number density of particles at position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although they have different units, the gyration tensor is related to the 
[[moments of inertia|moment of inertia tensor]].  The key difference is that the particle positions are weighted by [[mass]] in the inertia tensor, whereas the gyration tensor depends only on the particle positions; mass plays no role in defining the gyration tensor.

==Diagonalization==

Since the gyration tensor is a symmetric 3x3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] can be found in which it is diagonal

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_{x}^{2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \lambda_{y}^{2} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_{z}^{2}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the axes are chosen such that the diagonal elements are ordered &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{x}^{2} \leq \lambda_{y}^{2} \leq \lambda_{z}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  
These diagonal elements are called the '''principal moments''' of the gyration tensor.

==Shape descriptors==

The principal moments can be combined to give several parameters that describe the distribution of particles.  The squared [[radius of gyration]] is the sum of the principal moments

:&lt;math&gt;
R_{g}^{2} = \lambda_{x}^{2} + \lambda_{y}^{2} + \lambda_{z}^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[asphericity]] &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
b \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \lambda_{z}^{2} - \frac{1}{2} \left( \lambda_{x}^{2} + \lambda_{y}^{2} \right) = \frac{3}{2} \lambda_{z}^{2} - \frac{R_{g}^{2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is always non-negative and zero only when the three principal moments are equal, λ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;.  This zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is spherically symmetric (hence the name ''asphericity'') but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the three coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a [[cube]], [[tetrahedron]] or other [[Platonic solid]].

Similarly, the [[acylindricity]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
c \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \lambda_{y}^{2} - \lambda_{x}^{2} 
&lt;/math&gt;

which is always non-negative and zero only when the two principal moments are equal, λ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.
This zero condition is met when the distribution of particles is cylindrically symmetric (hence the name, ''acylindricity''), but also whenever the particle distribution is symmetric with respect to the two coordinate axes, e.g., when the particles are distributed uniformly on a [[prism (geometry)|regular prism]].

Finally, the [[relative shape anisotropy]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is defined

:&lt;math&gt;
\kappa^{2} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{b^{2} + (3/4) c^{2}}{R_{g}^{4}} = \frac{3}{2} \frac{\lambda_{x}^{4}+\lambda_{y}^{4}+\lambda_{z}^{4}}{(\lambda_{x}^{2}+\lambda_{y}^{2}+\lambda_{z}^{2})^{2}} - \frac{1}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is bounded between zero and one. &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{2}&lt;/math&gt; = 0 only occurs if all points are spherically symmetric, and &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{2}&lt;/math&gt; = 1 only occurs if all points lie on a line.

{{for|the Max Frisch novel|Homo Faber (novel)}}
{{merge|Artificiality|date=April 2018}}
'''''Homo faber''''' ([[Latin]] for "[[Human being|Man]] the Maker") is the concept that human beings are able to control their fate and their environment as a result of the use of tools.

== Original phrase ==

In Latin literature, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] uses this term in his ''Sententiæ'', referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: ''Homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' (Every man is the artifex of his destiny).

In older [[anthropology]] theories, ''Homo faber'', as the "working man", is confronted with ''[[Homo ludens]]'', the "playing man", who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure.

== Modern usage ==

The classic ''homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' was "rediscovered" by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] in 14th century and was central in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In the 20th century, [[Max Scheler]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]  made the philosophical concept central again.

[[Henri Bergson]] also referred to the concept in ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907), defining [[intelligence]], in its original sense, as the "faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings."

''[[Homo Faber (novel)|Homo Faber]]'' is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author [[Max Frisch]], published in 1957.

== Other contemporary era mentions ==

''Homo faber'' can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to ''[[Demiurge|deus faber]]'' ("God the Creator"), an archetype of which are the various [[Vulcan (mythology)|gods of the forge]].

''Homo faber'' is used by [[Pierre Schaeffer]] in the [[Traité des objects Musicaux]] as the man creator of music, which uses its brute experience, an instinctive practice in music creation; Concluding that the ''homo faber''  aways precedes the [[Homo sapiens]] in the process of creation.

Frisch' book was made into the film ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'', starring [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Julie Delpy]].

''Homo Faber'' was one of the five [[IB Middle Years Programme|IBMYP]] areas of interaction, before it was replaced with "Human Ingenuity".

The concept of ''homo faber'' is referenced in [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Open Work": he refutes its negative connotation and instead argues that ''homo faber'' is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature. Use of ''homo faber'' in this negative light is argued by Eco to represent the alienation from and objectification of nature.

"Homo Faber" is also the title of a short poem by [[Frank Bidart]] that is included in his collection ''Desire'' (1997).

''Homo faber'' is often placed in juxtaposition to ''homo adorans'', the worshiping man.  In other words, under traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] philosophy, the ultimate purpose of humankind is to worship God, whereas, under (for example) [[Marxist]] or [[Capitalist]] ideology, the purpose of humankind was embedded in what he or she can make or produce.

Uthayakumar|P.Uthayakumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|title=ANNOUNCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS PARTY (HRP), MALAYSIA.|publisher=Human Rights Party Malaysia|date=2009-07-17|accessdate=2009-07-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511213120/http://www.humanrightspartymalaysia.com/2009/07/17/announcement-of-human-rights-party-hrp-malaysia/|archivedate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Uthayakumar is the Secretary General (pro tem) of HRP with the support of Uthayakumar's brother and Leader of [[HINDRAF]] [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P.Waythamoorthy]].

Human Rights Party Malaysia was formed as a multiracial party which promises that it would carry on with the [[HINDRAF|Hindraf Makkal Sakthi’s]] initial 18-point demands dated August 2007 to the government of Malaysia and in particular Article 8 (Equality before the law) Article 12 (1) (b) (no discrimination) and Article 153(1) (legitimate interests of other communities) of the Federal Constitution. The main thrust of this party is to be the focus group in putting the Malaysian Indians back onto the national mainstream development of Malaysia after 52 years of having been left out.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The party also focus on all other communities that are suffering from the worst forms of violations of human rights in Malaysia, in particular the Malaysian Indians who instead get the least attention not only from the ruling [[UMNO]] regime but also from the opposition parties [[People's Justice Party, Malaysia|PKR]], [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]], [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|PAS]], NGOs, civil society and the print and electronic media generally, albeit to a lesser extent. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The main struggle of HRP is against all forms of racism and racial discrimination by the current ruling government in Malaysia, namely UMNO.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[File:Chimpanzee seated at typewriter.jpg|thumb|Given an [[infinity|infinite]] length of time, a [[chimpanzee]] punching at random on a typewriter would [[almost surely]] type out all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays.]]

The '''infinite monkey theorem''' states that a monkey hitting keys at [[randomness|random]] on a typewriter keyboard for an [[infinity|infinite]] amount of time will [[almost surely]] type a given text, such as the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]]. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the [[probability]] that monkeys filling the [[observable universe]] would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]] is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the [[age of the universe]] is ''extremely'' low (but technically not zero).

In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the "monkey" is not an actual monkey, but a [[metaphor]] for an abstract device that produces an endless [[random sequence]] of letters and symbols. One of the earliest instances of the use of the "monkey metaphor" is that of French mathematician [[Émile Borel]] in 1913,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the first instance may have been even earlier.

Variants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the history of this idea from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' and [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De natura deorum]]'' (On the Nature of the Gods), through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]], up to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Borel and [[Arthur Eddington]] used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]].

==Solution==

===Direct proof===
There is a straightforward proof of this theorem. As an introduction, recall that if two events are [[statistically independent]], then the probability of both happening equals the product of the probabilities of each one happening independently. For example, if the chance of rain in [[Moscow]] on a particular day in the future is 0.4 and the chance of an [[earthquake]] in [[San Francisco]] on any particular day is 0.00003, then the chance of both happening on the same day is {{nowrap|1=0.4 × 0.00003 = 0.000012}}, assuming that they are indeed independent.

Suppose the typewriter has 50 keys, and the word to be typed is ''banana''. If the keys are pressed randomly and independently, it means that each key has an equal chance of being pressed. Then, the chance that the first letter typed is 'b' is 1/50, and the chance that the second letter typed is ''a'' is also 1/50, and so on. Therefore, the chance of the first six letters spelling ''banana'' is
:(1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) × (1/50) = (1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 1/15&amp;nbsp;625&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;,
less than one in 15 billion, but not zero, hence a possible outcome.

From the above, the chance of ''not'' typing ''banana'' in a given block of 6 letters is 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Because each block is typed independently, the chance ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of not typing ''banana'' in any of the first ''n'' blocks of 6 letters is

:&lt;math&gt;X_n=\left(1-\frac{1}{50^6}\right)^n.&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' grows, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; gets smaller. For an ''n'' of a million, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.9999, but for an ''n'' of 10 billion ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly 0.53 and for an ''n'' of 100 billion it is roughly 0.0017. As ''n'' approaches infinity, the probability ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; [[limit of a function|approaches]] zero; that is, by making ''n'' large enough, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be made as small as is desired,&lt;ref name="Isaac1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Isaac |first=Richard E. |title=The Pleasures of Probability |year=1995 |publisher=Springer | isbn = 0-387-94415-X |pages=48–50}} Isaac generalizes this argument immediately to variable text and alphabet size; the common main conclusion is on p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This shows that the probability of typing "banana" in one of the predefined non-overlapping blocks of six letters tends to 1. In addition the word may appear across two blocks, so the estimate given is conservative.&lt;/ref&gt; and the chance of typing ''banana'' approaches 100%.

The same argument shows why at least one of infinitely many monkeys will produce a text as quickly as it would be produced by a perfectly accurate human typist copying it from the original. In this case ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;(1/50)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; represents the probability that none of the first ''n'' monkeys types ''banana'' correctly on their first try. When we consider 100 billion monkeys, the probability falls to 0.17%, and as the number of monkeys ''n'' increases, the value of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; – the probability of the monkeys failing to reproduce the given text – approaches zero arbitrarily closely. The limit, for ''n'' going to infinity, is zero.  So the probability of the word ''banana'' appearing at some point in an infinite sequence of keystrokes is equal to one.

====Infinite strings====
This can be stated more generally and compactly in terms of [[string (computer science)|strings]], which are sequences of characters chosen from some finite alphabet:
* Given an infinite string where each character is chosen [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]], any given finite string almost surely occurs as a [[substring]] at some position.
* Given an infinite sequence of infinite strings, where each character of each string is chosen uniformly at random, any given finite string almost surely occurs as a prefix of one of these strings.

Both follow easily from the second [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]. For the second theorem, let ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; be the [[event (probability theory)|event]] that the ''k''th string begins with the given text. Because this has some fixed nonzero probability ''p'' of occurring, the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent, and the below sum diverges,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^\infty P(E_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty p = \infty,&lt;/math&gt;
the probability that infinitely many of the ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; occur is 1. The first theorem is shown similarly; one can divide the random string into nonoverlapping blocks matching the size of the desired text, and make ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; the event where the ''k''th block equals the desired string.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The first theorem is proven by a similar if more indirect route in {{cite book |last=Gut |first=Allan |title=Probability: A Graduate Course |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-22833-0 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probabilities===
However, for physically meaningful numbers of monkeys typing for physically meaningful lengths of time the results are reversed. If there were as many monkeys as there are atoms in the observable universe typing extremely fast for trillions of times the life of the universe, the probability of the monkeys replicating even a ''single page'' of Shakespeare is unfathomably small.

Ignoring punctuation, spacing, and capitalization, a monkey typing letters uniformly at random has a chance of one in 26 of correctly typing the first letter of ''[[Hamlet]].'' It has a chance of one in 676 (26&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;26) of typing the first two letters. Because the probability shrinks [[exponential growth|exponentially]], at 20 letters it already has only a chance of one in 26&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; = 19,928,148,895,209,409,152,340,197,376 (almost 2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;). In the case of the entire text of ''Hamlet'', the probabilities are so vanishingly small as to be inconceivable. The text of Hamlet contains approximately 130,000 letters.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Using the Hamlet text [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext99/1ws2611.txt from gutenberg], there are 132680 alphabetical letters and 199749 characters overall&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a probability of one in 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; to get the text right at the first trial. The average number of letters that needs to be typed until the text appears is also 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

For any required string of 130,000 letters from the set a-z, the average number of letters that needs to be typed until the string appears is (rounded) 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;, except in the case that all letters of the required string are equal, in which case the value is about 4% more, 3.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt;. In that case failure to have the correct string starting from a particular position reduces with about 4% the probability of a correct string starting from the next position (i.e., for overlapping positions the events of having the correct string are not independent; in this case there is a positive correlation between the two successes, so the chance of success after a failure is smaller than the chance of success in general). The figure 3.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183,946&lt;/sup&gt; is derived from ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;26&lt;sup&gt;130000&lt;/sup&gt; by taking the logarithm of both sides: log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = 1300000×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(26) =&amp;nbsp;183946.5352, therefore ''n'' =&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;0.5352&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;3.429&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;183946&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; or including punctuation, 4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;26 letters ×2 for capitalisation, 12 for punctuation characters = 64, 199749×log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64) =&amp;nbsp;4.4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt; (this is generous as it assumes capital letters are separate keys, as opposed to a key combination, which makes the problem vastly harder).&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if every proton in the observable universe were a monkey with a typewriter, typing from the [[Big Bang]] until the [[end of the universe]] (when protons [[Proton decay|might no longer exist]]), they would still need a still far greater amount of time – more than three hundred and sixty thousand ''orders of magnitude'' longer – to have even a 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;500&lt;/sup&gt; chance of success. To put it another way, for a one in a trillion chance of success, there would need to be 10&lt;sup&gt;360,641&lt;/sup&gt; universes made of atomic monkeys.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;

There are ~10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; protons in the observable universe. Assume the monkeys write for 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years is when [[Future of an expanding universe#Stellar remnants escape galaxies or fall into black holes|all stellar remnants will have either been ejected from their galaxies or fallen into black holes]], 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; years is when all but 0.1% of [[Future of an expanding universe#All nucleons decay|protons have decayed]]). Assuming the monkeys type non-stop at a ridiculous 400 [[words per minute]] (the world record is 216wpm for a single minute), that's about 2000 characters per minute (Shakespeare's average word length is a bit under 5 letters). There are about half a million minutes in a year, this means each monkey types half a billion characters per year. This gives a total of 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt; letters typed – which is still zero in comparison to 10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;. For a one in a trillion chance, multiply the letters typed by a trillion: 10&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;. 10&lt;sup&gt;360,783&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;360,641&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Charles Kittel|Kittel]] and [[Herbert Kroemer|Kroemer]] put it in their textbook on [[thermodynamics]], the field whose statistical foundations motivated the first known expositions of typing monkeys,&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Charles Kittel|Kittel, Charles]] and [[Herbert Kroemer]] | title=Thermal Physics (2nd ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman Company | year=1980 | isbn=0-7167-1088-9 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The probability of ''Hamlet'' is therefore zero in any operational sense of an event...", and the statement that the monkeys must eventually succeed "gives a misleading conclusion about very, very large numbers."

In fact there is less than a one in a trillion chance of success that such a universe made of monkeys could type any particular document a mere 79 characters long.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As explained at {{cite web |url=http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016011846/http://www.nutters.org/docs/more-monkeys |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}, the problem can be approximated further. 10&lt;sup&gt;145&lt;/sup&gt;/log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(64)=78.9 characters.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Almost surely===
{{Main|Almost surely}}

The probability that an infinite randomly generated string of text will contain a particular finite substring is&amp;nbsp;1. However, this does not mean the substring's absence is "impossible", despite the absence having a prior probability of 0. For example, the immortal monkey ''could'' randomly type G as its first letter, G as its second, and G as every single letter thereafter, producing an infinite string of Gs; at no point must the monkey be "compelled" to type anything else. (To assume otherwise implies the [[gambler's fallacy]].) However long a randomly generated finite string is, there is a small but nonzero chance that it will turn out to consist of the same character repeated throughout; this chance approaches zero as the string's length approaches infinity. There is nothing special about such a monotonous sequence except that it is easy to describe; the same fact applies to any nameable specific sequence, such as "RGRGRG" repeated forever, or "a-b-aa-bb-aaa-bbb-...", or "Three, Six, Nine, Twelve…".

If the hypothetical monkey has a typewriter with 90 equally likely keys that include numerals and punctuation, then the first typed keys might be "3.14" (the first three [[digits of pi]]) with a probability of (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 1/65,610,000. Equally probable is any other string of four characters allowed by the typewriter, such as "GGGG", "mATh", or "q%8e". The probability that 100 randomly typed keys will consist of the first 99 digits of pi (including the separator key), or any other ''particular'' sequence of that length, is much lower: (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;. If the monkey's allotted length of text is infinite, the chance of typing only the digits of pi is 0, which is just as ''possible'' (mathematically probable) as typing nothing but Gs (also probability 0).

The same applies to the event of typing a particular version of ''Hamlet'' followed by endless copies of itself; or ''Hamlet'' immediately followed by all the digits of pi; these specific strings are [[infinite set|equally infinite]] in length, they are not prohibited by the terms of the thought problem, and they each have a prior probability of 0. In fact, ''any'' particular infinite sequence the immortal monkey types will have ''had'' a prior probability of 0, even though the monkey must type something.

This is an extension of the principle that a finite string of random text has a lower and lower probability of ''being'' a particular string the longer it is (though all specific strings are equally unlikely). This probability approaches 0 as the string approaches infinity. Thus, the probability of the monkey typing an endlessly long string, such as all of the digits of pi in order, on a 90-key keyboard is (1/90)&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; which equals (1/∞) which is essentially 0. At the same time, the probability that the sequence ''contains'' a particular subsequence (such as the word MONKEY, or the 12th through 999th digits of pi, or a version of the King James Bible) increases as the total string increases. This probability approaches 1 as the total string approaches infinity, and thus the original theorem is correct.

===Correspondence between strings and numbers===
In a simplification of the thought experiment, the monkey could have a typewriter with just two keys: 1 and 0. The infinitely long string thusly produced would correspond to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] digits of a particular [[real number]] between 0 and 1. A countably infinite set of possible strings end in infinite repetitions, which means the corresponding real number is [[rational number|rational]]. Examples include the strings corresponding to one-third (010101…), five-sixths (11010101…) and five-eighths (1010000…).  Only a subset of such real number strings (albeit a countably infinite subset) contains the entirety of ''Hamlet'' (assuming that the text is subjected to a numerical encoding, such as [[ASCII]]).

Meanwhile, there is an ''[[uncountably]]'' infinite set of strings which do not end in such repetition; these correspond to the [[irrational numbers]]. These can be sorted into two uncountably infinite subsets: those which contain ''Hamlet'' and those which do not. However, the "largest" subset of all the real numbers are those which not only contain ''Hamlet'', but which contain every other possible string of any length, and with equal distribution of such strings. These irrational numbers are called [[normal number|normal]]. Because almost all numbers are normal, almost all possible strings contain all possible finite substrings. Hence, the probability of the monkey typing a normal number is 1. The same principles apply regardless of the number of keys from which the monkey can choose; a 90-key keyboard can be seen as a generator of numbers written in base 90.

==History==

===Statistical mechanics===
In one of the forms in which probabilists now know this theorem, with its "dactylographic" [i.e., typewriting] monkeys ({{lang-fr|singes dactylographes}}; the French word ''singe'' covers both the monkeys and the apes), appeared in [[Émile Borel]]'s 1913 article "''Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité''" (''[[Statistical mechanics]] and irreversibility''),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Émile Borel | title=Mécanique Statistique et Irréversibilité | journal=J. Phys. (Paris) |series=Series 5 | volume=3 | year=1913 | pages=189–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in his book "Le Hasard" in 1914. His "monkeys" are not actual monkeys; rather, they are a metaphor for an imaginary way to produce a large, random sequence of letters. Borel said that if a million monkeys typed ten hours a day, it was extremely unlikely that their output would exactly equal all the books of the richest libraries of the world; and yet, in comparison, it was even more unlikely that the laws of statistical mechanics would ever be violated, even briefly.

The physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] drew on Borel's image further in ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928), writing:

{{quote|If I let my fingers wander idly over the keys of a typewriter it might happen that my screed made an intelligible sentence. If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters they might write all the books in the British Museum.

These images invite the reader to consider the incredible improbability of a large but finite number of monkeys working for a large but finite amount of time producing a significant work, and compare this with the even greater improbability of certain physical events. Any physical process that is even less likely than such monkeys' success is effectively impossible, and it may safely be said that such a process will never happen.&lt;ref name="KK" /&gt;  It is clear from the context that Eddington is not suggesting that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term ''improbable'' is functionally equivalent to ''impossible''.

===Origins and "The Total Library"===
In a 1939 essay entitled "The Total Library", Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] traced the infinite-monkey concept back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics.'' Explaining the views of [[Leucippus]], who held that the world arose through the random combination of atoms, Aristotle notes that the atoms themselves are homogeneous and their possible arrangements only differ in shape, position and ordering. In ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', the Greek philosopher compares this to the way that a tragedy and a comedy consist of the same "atoms", ''i.e.'', alphabetic characters.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Περὶ γενέσεως καὶ φθορᾶς'' (''On Generation and Corruption''), 315b14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three centuries later, [[Cicero]]'s ''De natura deorum'' (''On the Nature of the Gods'') argued against the atomist worldview:

{{quote|He who believes this may as well believe that if a great quantity of the one-and-twenty letters, composed either of gold or any other matter, were thrown upon the ground, they would fall into such order as legibly to form the ''Annals'' of Ennius. I doubt whether fortune could make a single verse of them.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Tullius Cicero, ''De natura deorum'', 2.37. Translation from ''Cicero's Tusculan Disputations; Also, Treatises On The Nature Of The Gods, And On The Commonwealth'', C. D. Yonge, principal translator, New York, Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, Franklin Square. (1877). [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988 Downloadable text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges follows the history of this argument through [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Jonathan Swift]],&lt;ref&gt;The English translation of "The Total Library" lists the title of Swift's essay as "Trivial Essay on the Faculties of the Soul."  The appropriate reference is, instead: Swift, Jonathan, Temple Scott et al. "A Tritical Essay upon the Faculties of the Mind." The Prose Works of Jonathan Swift, Volume 1. London: G. Bell, 1897, pp. 291-296. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FctEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Prose+Works+of+Jonathan+Swift&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JdyDTb-yM8u3tweNmcy8BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; then observes that in his own time, the vocabulary had changed. By 1939, the idiom was "that a half-dozen monkeys provided with typewriters would, in a few eternities, produce all the books in the British Museum." (To which Borges adds, "Strictly speaking, one immortal monkey would suffice.") Borges then imagines the contents of the Total Library which this enterprise would produce if carried to its fullest extreme:

{{quote|Everything would be in its blind volumes. Everything: the detailed history of the future, [[Aeschylus]]' ''The Egyptians'', the exact number of times that the waters of the Ganges have reflected the flight of a falcon, the secret and true nature of Rome, the encyclopedia Novalis would have constructed, my dreams and half-dreams at dawn on August 14, 1934, the proof of [[Pierre Fermat]]'s [[Fermat's last theorem|theorem]], the unwritten chapters of ''[[Edwin Drood]]'', those same chapters translated into the language spoken by the [[Garamantes]], the paradoxes Berkeley invented concerning Time but didn't publish, Urizen's books of iron, the premature epiphanies of [[Stephen Dedalus]], which would be meaningless before a cycle of a thousand years, the Gnostic [[Gospel of Basilides]], the song the sirens sang, the complete catalog of the Library, the proof of the inaccuracy of that catalog. Everything: but for every sensible line or accurate fact there would be millions of meaningless cacophonies, verbal farragoes, and babblings. Everything: but all the generations of mankind could pass before the dizzying shelves—shelves that obliterate the day and on which chaos lies—ever reward them with a tolerable page.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges, Jorge Luis]]. "''La biblioteca total''" (The Total Library), ''Sur'' No. 59, August 1939. Trans. by [[Eliot Weinberger]]. In ''Selected Non-Fictions'' (Penguin: 1999), {{isbn|0-670-84947-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Borges' total library concept was the main theme of his widely read 1941 short story "[[The Library of Babel]]", which describes an unimaginably vast library consisting of interlocking hexagonal chambers, together containing every possible volume that could be composed from the letters of the alphabet and some punctuation characters.

==Real monkeys==
In 2003, lecturers and students from the [[University of Plymouth]] MediaLab Arts course used a £2,000 grant from the [[Arts Council]] to study the literary output of real monkeys. They left a computer keyboard in the enclosure of six [[Celebes crested macaque]]s in [[Paignton Zoo]] in [[Devon]] in [[England]] for a month, with a radio link to broadcast the results on a website.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news | title= No words to describe monkeys' play | date= 2003-05-09 | publisher= BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3013959.stm | accessdate = 2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only did the monkeys produce nothing but five total pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare | url= http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = vivaria.net | year= 2002 | accessdate = 2014-07-11 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130120215600/http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/publication/NOTES_EN.pdf | archivedate = 2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely consisting of the letter S, the lead male began bashing the keyboard with a stone, and the monkeys followed by soiling it. [http://i-dat.org/mike-phillips/ Mike Phillips], director of the university's Institute of Digital Arts and Technology (i-DAT), said that the artist-funded project was primarily performance art, and they had learned "an awful lot" from it. He concluded that monkeys "are not random generators. They're more complex than that. ... They were quite interested in the screen, and they saw that when they typed a letter, something happened. There was a level of intention there."&lt;ref name="BBC News" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Associated2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,58790,00.html |title=Monkeys Don't Write Shakespeare |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Wired News |date=2003-05-09 |accessdate=2007-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201230858/http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0%2C1284%2C58790%2C00.html |archivedate=2004-02-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications and criticisms==

===Evolution===
[[Image:Thomas Henry Huxley - Project Gutenberg eText 16935.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Huxley]] is sometimes misattributed with proposing a variant of the theory in his debates with [[Samuel Wilberforce]].]]
In his 1931 book ''The Mysterious Universe'', Eddington's rival [[James Hopwood Jeans|James Jeans]] attributed the monkey parable to a "Huxley", presumably meaning [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. This attribution is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Padmanabhan2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thanu |last=Padmanabhan |title=The dark side of astronomy |journal=Nature |volume=435 |pages=20–21 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/435020a |issue=7038|bibcode=2005Natur.435...20P }} {{cite book |author=Platt, Suzy; Library of Congress Congressional Research Service |title=Respectfully quoted: a dictionary of quotations |year=1993 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn=0-88029-768-9|pages=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is sometimes further reported that Huxley applied the example in a [[1860 Oxford evolution debate|now-legendary debate]] over [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' with the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, held at a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] at Oxford on 30 June 1860. This story suffers not only from a lack of evidence, but the fact that in 1860 the typewriter itself had yet to emerge.&lt;ref name="Rescher2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicholas |last=Rescher |title=Studies in the Philosophy of Science |year=2006 |publisher=ontos verlag |isbn=3-938793-20-1 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the original mix-up, monkey-and-typewriter arguments are now common in arguments over evolution. For example, Doug Powell argues as a [[Christian apologist]] that even if a monkey accidentally types the letters of ''Hamlet'', it has failed to produce ''Hamlet'' because it lacked the intention to communicate. His parallel implication is that natural laws could not produce the information content in [[DNA]].&lt;ref name="Powell2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Doug |title=Holman Quicksource Guide to Christian Apologetics |year=2006 |publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman | isbn = 0-8054-9460-X |pages=60, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more common argument is represented by Reverend [[John F. MacArthur]], who claims that the genetic mutations necessary to produce a tapeworm from an amoeba are as unlikely as a monkey typing Hamlet's soliloquy, and hence the odds against the evolution of all life are impossible to overcome.&lt;ref name="MacArthur2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=MacArthur |title=Think Biblically!: Recovering a Christian Worldview |year=2003 |publisher=Crossway Books |isbn=1-58134-412-0 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] employs the typing monkey concept in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to demonstrate the ability of [[natural selection]] to produce biological [[complexity]] out of random [[mutation]]s. In a simulation experiment Dawkins has his [[weasel program]] produce the Hamlet phrase ''METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL'', starting from a randomly typed parent, by "breeding" subsequent generations and always choosing the closest match from progeny that are copies of the parent, with random mutations. The chance of the target phrase appearing in a single step is extremely small, yet Dawkins showed that it could be produced rapidly (in about 40 generations) using cumulative selection of phrases.  The random choices furnish raw material, while cumulative selection imparts information.  As Dawkins acknowledges, however, the weasel program is an imperfect analogy for evolution, as "offspring" phrases were selected "according to the criterion of resemblance to a ''distant ideal'' target."  In contrast, Dawkins affirms, evolution has no long-term plans and does not progress toward some distant goal (such as humans).  The weasel program is instead meant to illustrate the difference between [[non-random]] cumulative selection, and [[random]] single-step selection.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |year=1996 |title=The Blind Watchmaker |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=0-393-31570-3  |pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of the typing monkey analogy, this means that ''Romeo and Juliet'' could be produced relatively quickly if placed under the constraints of a nonrandom, Darwinian-type selection because the [[fitness function]] will tend to preserve in place any letters that happen to match the target text, improving each successive generation of typing monkeys.

A different avenue for exploring the analogy between evolution and an unconstrained monkey lies in the problem that the monkey types only one letter at a time, independently of the other letters. Hugh Petrie argues that a more sophisticated setup is required, in his case not for biological evolution but the evolution of ideas:

{{quote|In order to get the proper analogy, we would have to equip the monkey with a more complex typewriter. It would have to include whole Elizabethan sentences and thoughts. It would have to include Elizabethan beliefs about human action patterns and the causes, Elizabethan morality and science, and linguistic patterns for expressing these. It would probably even have to include an account of the sorts of experiences which shaped Shakespeare's belief structure as a particular example of an Elizabethan. Then, perhaps, we might allow the monkey to play with such a typewriter and produce variants, but the impossibility of obtaining a Shakespearean play is no longer obvious. What is varied really does encapsulate a great deal of already-achieved knowledge.&lt;ref name="Blachowicz1998"&gt;As quoted in {{cite book |first=James |last=Blachowicz |title=Of Two Minds: Nature of Inquiry |year=1998 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-3641-1 |page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James W. Valentine]], while admitting that the classic monkey's task is impossible, finds that there is a worthwhile analogy between written English and the [[metazoa]]n genome in this other sense: both have "combinatorial, hierarchical structures" that greatly constrain the immense number of combinations at the alphabet level.&lt;ref name="Valentine2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Valentine |title=On the Origin of Phyla |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-84548-6 |pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary theory===
[[R. G. Collingwood]] argued in 1938 that art cannot be produced by accident, and wrote as a sarcastic aside to his critics,

{{quote|...some ... have denied this proposition, pointing out that if a monkey played with a typewriter ... he would produce ... the complete text of Shakespeare. Any reader who has nothing to do can amuse himself by calculating how long it would take for the probability to be worth betting on. But the interest of the suggestion lies in the revelation of the mental state of a person who can identify the 'works' of Shakespeare with the series of letters printed on the pages of a book...&lt;ref name="Sclafani1975"&gt;p.126 of ''The Principles of Art'', as summarized and quoted by {{cite journal |first=Richard J. |last=Sclafani |title=The logical primitiveness of the concept of a work of art |journal=British Journal of Aesthetics |year=1975 |volume=15 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/bjaesthetics/15.1.14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Nelson Goodman]] took the contrary position, illustrating his point along with Catherine Elgin by the example of Borges' "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]",

{{quote|What Menard wrote is simply another inscription of the text. Any of us can do the same, as can printing presses and photocopiers. Indeed, we are told, if infinitely many monkeys ... one would eventually produce a replica of the text. That replica, we maintain, would be as much an instance of the work, ''Don Quixote'', as Cervantes' manuscript, Menard's manuscript, and each copy of the book that ever has been or will be printed.&lt;ref name="John2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=John, Eileen and Dominic Lopes, editors |title=The Philosophy of Literature: Contemporary and Classic Readings: An Anthology |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-1208-5 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In another writing, Goodman elaborates, "That the monkey may be supposed to have produced his copy randomly makes no difference. It is the same text, and it is open to all the same interpretations...." [[Gérard Genette]] dismisses Goodman's argument as [[begging the question]].&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gérard |last= Genette |title=The Work of Art: Immanence and Transcendence |year=1997 |publisher=Cornell UP |isbn=0-8014-8272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jorge J. E. Gracia]], the question of the identity of texts leads to a different question, that of author. If a monkey is capable of typing ''Hamlet'', despite having no intention of meaning and therefore disqualifying itself as an author, then it appears that texts do not require authors. Possible solutions include saying that whoever finds the text and identifies it as ''Hamlet'' is the author; or that Shakespeare is the author, the monkey his agent, and the finder merely a user of the text. These solutions have their own difficulties, in that the text appears to have a meaning separate from the other agents: what if the monkey operates before Shakespeare is born, or if Shakespeare is never born, or if no one ever finds the monkey's typescript?&lt;ref name="Gracia1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gracia |first=Jorge |title=Texts: Ontological Status, Identity, Author, Audience |year=1996 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=0-7914-2901-6 |pages=1–2, 122–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random document generation===
The theorem concerns a [[thought experiment]] which cannot be fully carried out in practice, since it is predicted to require prohibitive amounts of time and resources. Nonetheless, it has inspired efforts in finite random text generation.

One computer program run by Dan Oliver of Scottsdale, Arizona, according to an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', came up with a result on August 4, 2004: After the group had worked for 42,162,500,000 billion billion monkey-years, one of the "monkeys" typed, "&lt;tt&gt;VALENTINE. Cease toIdor:eFLP0FRjWK78aXzVOwm)-‘;8.t&lt;/tt&gt;" The first 19 letters of this sequence can be found in "The Two Gentlemen of Verona". Other teams have reproduced 18 characters from "Timon of Athens", 17 from "Troilus and Cressida", and 16 from "Richard II".&lt;ref name="ja"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/09/070409crbo_books_acocella?currentPage=all Newyorker.com] Acocella, Joan "The Typing Life: How writers used to write" ''[[The New Yorker]]'' April 9, 2007, a review of ''The Iron Whim: A Fragmented History of Typewriting'' (Cornell) 2007, by Darren Wershler-Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

A website entitled ''The Monkey Shakespeare Simulator'', launched on July 1, 2003, contained a [[Java applet]] that simulated a large population of monkeys typing randomly, with the stated intention of seeing how long it takes the virtual monkeys to produce a complete Shakespearean play from beginning to end. For example, it produced this partial line from ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', reporting that it took "2,737,850 million billion billion billion monkey-years" to reach 24 matching characters:
:&lt;tt&gt;RUMOUR. Open your ears; 9r"5j5&amp;?OWTY Z0d&lt;/tt&gt;...''

Due to processing power limitations, the program used a probabilistic model (by using a [[random number generator]] or RNG) instead of actually generating random text and comparing it to Shakespeare. When the simulator "detected a match" (that is, the RNG generated a certain value or a value within a certain range), the simulator simulated the match by generating matched text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5809583/the-story-of-the-monkey-shakespeare-simulator-project |title=The story of the Monkey Shakespeare Simulator Project |last1=Inglis-Arkell |first1=Esther |date=June 9, 2011 |website=io9 |publisher=gizmodo |access-date=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated methods are used in practice for [[natural language generation]]. If instead of simply generating random characters one restricts the generator to a meaningful vocabulary and conservatively following grammar rules, like using a [[context-free grammar]], then a random document generated this way can even fool some humans (at least on a cursory reading) as shown in the experiments with [[SCIgen]], [[snarXiv]], and the [[Postmodernism Generator]].

===Testing of random-number generators===
{{main|Diehard tests}}
Questions about the statistics describing how often an ideal monkey is [[expected value|expected]] to type certain strings translate into [[Randomness tests|practical tests for random-number generators]]; these range from the simple to the "quite sophisticated". Computer-science professors [[George Marsaglia]] and [[Arif Zaman]] report that they used to call one such category of tests "overlapping m-[[tuple]] tests" in lectures, since they concern overlapping m-tuples of successive elements in a random sequence. But they found that calling them "monkey tests" helped to motivate the idea with students. They published a report on the class of tests and their results for various RNGs in 1993.&lt;ref name="Marsaglia1993"&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Infinite monkey theorem in popular culture}}
The infinite monkey theorem and its associated imagery is considered a popular and proverbial illustration of the mathematics of probability, widely known to the general public because of its transmission through popular culture rather than through formal education.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Examples of the theorem being referred to as proverbial include: Why Creativity Is Not like the Proverbial Typing Monkey. Jonathan W. Schooler, Sonya Dougal, ''Psychological Inquiry'', Vol. 10, No. 4 (1999); and ''The Case of the Midwife Toad'' ([[Arthur Koestler]], New York, 1972, page 30): ''"Neo-Darwinism does indeed carry the nineteenth-century brand of materialism to its extreme limits—to the proverbial monkey at the typewriter, hitting by pure chance on the proper keys to produce a Shakespeare sonnet."'' The latter is sourced from [http://www.angelfire.com/in/hypnosonic/Parable_of_the_Monkeys.html Parable of the Monkeys], a collection of historical references to the theorem in various formats.&lt;/ref&gt; This is helped by the innate humor stemming from the image of literal monkeys rattling away on a set of typewriters, and is a popular visual gag.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Last Exit to Springfield]]", [[Mr. Burns]] shows [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] "a room with a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters. Soon they will have written the greatest novel known to man!" Burns then chastises one monkey for typing, "[[It was the best of times, it was the worst of times|It was the best of times, it was the ''blurst'' of times]]!".

In his 1978 radio play, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', [[Douglas Adams]] invoked the theorem to illustrate the power of the 'Infinite Improbability Drive' that powered a spaceship. From Episode 2: "[[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford]], there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for [[Hamlet (play)|Hamlet]] they've worked out."

A quotation attributed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Wilensky, speech at a 1996 conference |url=http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27695.html |title=Quote Details: Robert Wilensky: We've heard that a... |publisher=The Quotations Page |date= |accessdate=2012-01-18}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a 1996 speech by Robert Wilensky stated, "We've heard that a million monkeys at a million keyboards could produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true."

The enduring, widespread popularity of the theorem was noted in the introduction to a 2001 paper, "Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks: The Internet in the Light of the Theory of Accidental Excellence".&lt;ref&gt;[http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513012236/http://skylla.wz-berlin.de/pdf/2002/ii02-101.pdf |date=2008-05-13 }}, Ute Hoffmann &amp; Jeanette Hofmann, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung gGmbH (WZB), 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Plenty of people have had fun with the famous notion that an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters and an infinite amount of time could eventually write the works of Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Ringle, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28521-2002Oct27?language=printer "Hello? This is Bob"], ''Washington Post'', 28 October 2002, page C01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the previously mentioned [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] funded experiment involving real monkeys and a computer keyboard received widespread press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivaria.net/experiments/notes/documentation/press/ Notes Towards the Complete Works of Shakespeare] – some press clippings.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the theorem was listed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in a list of eight classic [[thought experiment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Greta Lorge, [https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/15-06/st_best "The Best Thought Experiments: Schrödinger's Cat, Borel's Monkeys"], ''Wired'' Issue 15.06, May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information cascades can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their [[personalized search|tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests]]. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.

An information cascade is generally accepted as a two-step process. For a cascade to begin an individual must encounter a scenario with a decision, typically a binary one. Second, outside factors can influence this decision (typically, through the observation of actions and their outcomes of other individuals in similar scenarios). Due to this influence, researchers have drawn comparisons between information cascades and [[herd behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duan|first=Wenjing|last2=Gu|first2=Bin|last3=Whinston|first3=Andrew B.|date=2008-03-01|title=Informational Cascades and Software Adoption on the Internet: An Empirical Investigation|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1103165|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-step process of an informational cascade can be broken down into five basic components:

1. There is a [[Decision making|decision to be made]] – for example; whether to adopt a new technology, wear a new style of clothing, eat in a new restaurant, or support a particular             political position

2. A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)

3. People make the decision sequentially, and each person can observe the choices made by those who acted earlier

4. Each person has some information aside from their own that helps guide their decision

5. A person can't directly observe the outside information that other people know, but he or she can make inferences about this information from what they do

Social perspectives of cascades, which suggest that agents may act irrationally (e.g., against what they think is optimal) when social pressures are great, exist as complements to the concept of information cascades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schiller | first1 = R.J. | year = 1995 | title = Conversation, Information and Herd Behavior | url = | journal = Rhetoric and Economic Behavior | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 181–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More often the problem is that the concept of an information cascade is confused with ideas that do not match the two key conditions of the process, such as [[social proof]], information diffusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gruhl | first1 = Daniel | last2 = Guha | first2 = R. | last3 = Liben-Nowell | first3 = D. | last4 = Tomkins | first4 = A. | year = 2004 | title = Information diffusion through blogspace | url = | journal = WWW | volume = | issue = | pages = 491–501 | doi = 10.1145/988672.988739 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[social influence]]. Indeed, the term information cascade has even been used to refer to such processes.&lt;ref&gt;Sadikov, E.; Medina, M.; Leskovec, J.; Garcia-Molina, H. (2011).

== Basic model ==

=== Qualitative example ===

Information cascades occur when  external information obtained from previous participants in an event overrides one's own private signal, irrespective of the correctness of the former over the latter.  The experiment conducted in&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=L.R.|author2=Holt, C.A.|title=Information Cascades in the Laboratory|journal=The American Economic Review|year=1997|volume=87|issue=5|pages=847–862}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a useful example of this process.  The experiment consisted of two urns labeled A and B. Urn A contains two balls labeled "a" and one labeled "b". Urn B contains one ball labeled "a" and two labeled "b". The urn from which a ball must be drawn during each run is determined randomly and with equal probabilities (from the throw of a die). The contents of the chosen urn are emptied into a neutral container. The participants are then asked in random order to draw a marble from this container. This entire process may be termed a "run", and a number of such runs are performed.

Each time a participant picks up a marble, he is to decide which urn it belongs to. His decision is then announced for the benefit of the remaining participants in the room. Thus, the (n+1)th participant has information about the decisions made by all the n participants preceding him, and also his private signal which is the label on the ball that he draws during his turn. The experimenters observed that an information cascade was observed in 41 of 56 such runs. This means, in the runs where the cascade occurred, at least one participant gave precedence to earlier decisions over his own private signal. It is possible for such an occurrence to produce the wrong result. This phenomenon is known as "Reverse Cascade".

=== Quantitative description ===

A person's signal telling them to accept is denoted as {{mvar|H}} (a high signal, where high signifies he should accept), and a signal telling them not to accept is {{mvar|L}} (a low signal).  The model assumes that when the correct decision is to accept, individuals will be more likely to see an {{mvar|H}}, and conversely, when the correct decision is to reject, individuals are more likely to see an {{mvar|L}} signal.  This is essentially a [[conditional probability]] – the probability of {{mvar|H}}  when the correct action is to accept, or &lt;math&gt;P[H|A]&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly &lt;math&gt;P[L|R]&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that an agent gets an {{mvar|L}} signal when the correct action is reject.   If these likelihoods are represented by ''q'', then ''q'' &gt; 0.5.  This is summarized in the table below.&lt;ref name="Easley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/|title=Networks, Crowds and Markets: Reasoning about a Highly Connected Workld|last=Easley|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|pages=483–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|-
|  ''H''       || 1-''q''                || ''q''
|}
 
The first agent determines whether or not to accept solely based on his own signal.  As the model assumes that all agents act rationally, the action (accept or reject) the agent feels is more likely is the action he will choose to take.  This decision can be explained using [[Bayes rule]]:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P\left(A|H\right) &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(H\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right)}{P\left(A\right) P\left(H|A\right) + P\left(R\right) P\left(H|R\right)} \\
                    &amp;= \frac{pq}{pq + \left(1 - p\right)\left(1 - q\right)} \\
                    &amp;&gt; p
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the agent receives an {{mvar|H}} signal, then the likelihood of accepting is obtained by calculating &lt;math&gt;P[A|H]&lt;/math&gt;.  The equation says that, by virtue of the fact that ''q'' &gt; 0.5, the first agent, acting only on his private signal, will always increase his estimate of ''p'' with an {{mvar|H}} signal.  Similarly, it can be shown that an agent will always decrease his expectation of ''p'' when he receives a low signal.  Recalling that, if the value, {{mvar|V}}, of accepting is equal to the value of rejecting, then an agent will accept if he believes ''p'' &gt; 0.5, and reject otherwise.  Because this agent started out with the assumption that both accepting and rejecting are equally viable options (''p'' = 0.5), the observation of an {{mvar|H}} signal will allow him to conclude that accepting is the rational choice.

The second agent then considers both the first agent's decision and his own signal, again in a rational fashion.  In general, the ''n''th agent considers the decisions of the previous ''n''-1 agents, and his own signal.  He makes a decision based on Bayesian reasoning to determine the most rational choice.
 
&lt;math&gt;P (A | \text{Previous}, \text{Personal signal}) = \frac{pq^a (1 - q)^b}{p q^a (1 - q)^b + (1 - p)(1 - q)^a q^b}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where {{mvar|a}} is the number of accepts in the previous set plus the agent's own signal, and {{mvar|b}} is the number of rejects.  Thus, {{tmath|1=a + b = n}}.  The decision is based on how the value on the right hand side of the equation compares with ''p''.&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt;

===Explicit model assumptions===

The original model makes several assumptions about human behavior and the world in which humans act,&lt;ref name="Bik"&gt;Bikhchandani, S., [[David Hirshleifer|Hirshleifer, D]]., and [[Ivo Welch|Welch, I]]. (1992), "A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades," ''Journal of Political Economy'', Volume 100, Issue 5, pp. [http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/atheoryoffads.pdf pp. 992-1026.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713060849/http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/atheoryoffads.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }} '''+''' button to enlarge.&lt;/ref&gt; some of which are relaxed in later versions&lt;ref name="Easley"/&gt; or in alternate definitions of similar problems, such as the [[diffusion of innovations]]. 
 
#Boundedly Rational Agents: The original Independent Cascade model assumes humans are boundedly rational&lt;ref name=newellsimon&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=A.|title=Human problem solving|year=1972|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, they will always make rational decisions based on the information they can observe, but the information they observe may not be complete or correct.  In other words, agents do not have complete knowledge of the world around them (which would allow them to make the correct decision in any and all situations).  In this way, there is a point at which, even if a person has correct knowledge of the idea or action cascading, they can be convinced via social pressures to adopt some alternate, incorrect view of the world.
#Incomplete Knowledge of Others: The original information cascade model assumes that agents have incomplete knowledge of the agents which precede them in the specified order.  As opposed to definitions where agents have some knowledge of the "private information" held by previous agents, the current agent makes a decision based only on the observable action (whether or not to imitate) of those preceding him.  It is important to note that the original creators argue this is a reason why information cascades can be caused by small shocks.
#Behavior of all previous agents is known

=== Resulting conditions ===

#'''Cascades will always occur''' – as discussed, in the simple mode, the likelihood of a cascade occurring increases towards 1 as the number of people making decisions increases towards infinity.
#'''Cascades can be incorrect''' – because agents make decisions with both bounded rationality and probabilistic knowledge of the initial truth (e.g. whether accepting or rejecting is the correct decision), the incorrect behavior may cascade through the system.
#'''Cascades can be based on little information''' – mathematically, a cascade of an infinite length can occur based only on the decision of two people.  More generally, a small set of people who strongly promote an idea as being rational can rapidly influence a much larger subset of the general population
#'''Cascades are fragile''' – because agents receive no extra information after the difference between a and b increases beyond 2, and because such differences can occur at small numbers of agents, agents considering opinions from those agents who are making decisions based on actual information can be dissuaded from a choice rather easily.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; thus suggests that cascades are susceptible to the release of public information.&lt;ref name="Bik"/&gt; also discusses this result in the context of the underlying value p changing over time, in which case a cascade can rapidly change course.

== Responding ==

A literature exists that examines how individuals or firms might respond to the existence of informational cascades when they have products to sell but where buyers are unsure of the quality of those products. Curtis Taylor (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=C.|title=Time-on-the-Market as a Sign of Quality.|journal=Review of Economic Studies|year=1999|volume=66|pages=555–578|doi=10.1111/1467-937x.00098}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when selling a house the seller might wish to start with high prices, as failure to sell with low prices is indicative of low quality and might start a cascade on not buying, while failure to sell with high prices could be construed as meaning the house is just over-priced, and prices can then be reduced to get a sale. Daniel Sgroi (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sgroi|first=D.|date=|year=2002|title=Optimizing Information in the Herd: Guinea Pigs, Profits, and Welfare|url=|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=39|pages=137–166|doi=10.1006/game.2001.0881|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that firms might use "guinea pigs" who are given the opportunity to buy early to kick-start an informational cascade through their early and public purchasing decisions, and work by David Gill and Daniel Sgroi (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=D.|author2=D. Sgroi|title=Sequential Decisions with Tests.|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|year=2008|volume=63|pages=663–678|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2006.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that early public tests might have a similar effect (and in particular that passing a "tough test" which is biased against the seller can instigate a cascade all by itself). Bose ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bose|first=S.|author2=G. Orosel |author3=M. Ottaviani |author4=L. Vesterlund |title=Dynamic Monopoly Pricing and Herding.|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|year=2006|volume=37|pages=910–928 |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2006.tb00063.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; have examined how prices set by a monopolist might evolve in the presence of potential cascade behavior where the monopolist and consumers are unsure of a products quality.

==Examples and fields of application==
Information cascades occur in situations where seeing many people make the same choice provides evidence that outweighs one's own judgment.  That is, one thinks:  "It's more likely that I'm wrong than that all those other people are wrong.  Therefore, I will do as they do."

In what has been termed a [[reputational cascade]], late responders sometimes go along with the decisions of early responders, not just because the late responders think the early responders are right, but also because they perceive their reputation will be damaged if they dissent from the early responders.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lemieux (2003), "Following the Herd", ''[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]'', [[Cato Institute]], 21. {{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv26n4/v26n4-2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616042143/http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv26n4/v26n4-2.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-16 |df= }}.  Retrieved 14 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market cascades ===
Information cascades have become one of the topics of [[behavioral economics]], as they are often seen in financial markets where they can feed speculation and create cumulative and excessive [[market price|price moves]], either for the whole market ([[bubble (economics)|market bubble]]...) or a specific asset, like a stock that becomes overly popular among investors.

Marketers also use the idea of cascades to attempt to get a buying cascade started for a new product. If they can induce an initial set of people to adopt the new product, then those who make purchasing decisions later on may also adopt the product even if it is no better than, or perhaps even worse than, competing products. This is most effective if these later consumers are able to observe the adoption decisions, but not how satisfied the early customers actually were with the choice. This is consistent with the idea that cascades arise naturally when people can see what others do but not what they know.&lt;ref&gt;http://research.ivo-welch.info/palgrave.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information cascades are usually considered by economists:
* as products of [[rational expectations]] at their start,
* as irrational [[herd behavior]] if they persist for too long, which signals that collective emotions come also into play to feed the cascade.

=== Social network analysis ===
Dotey et al.&lt;ref&gt;Dotey, A., Rom, H. and Vaca C., Information Diffusion in Social Media. 2011, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; state that information flows in the form of cascades on the social network. According to the authors, analysis of virality of information cascades on a social network may lead to many useful applications like determining the most influential individuals within a network. This information can be used for ''maximizing market effectiveness'' or ''influencing public opinion''. Various structural and temporal features of a network affect cascade virality.

In contrast to work on information cascades in social networks, the Social Influence Model of belief spread argues that people have some notion of the private beliefs of those in their network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedkin|first=N.E. and Johnsen, E.C.|title=Social Influence Network Theory: A Sociological Examination of Small Group Dynamics|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social influence model, then, relaxes the assumption of information cascades that people are acting only on observable actions taken by others.  In addition, the social influence model focuses on embedding people within a social network, as opposed to a queue.  Finally, the social influence model relaxes the assumption of the information cascade model that people will either complete an action or not by allowing for a continuous scale of the "strength" of an agents belief that an action should be completed.

=== Historical examples ===
* Small protests began in [[Leipzig]], Germany in 1989 with just a handful of activists challenging the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=shirky&gt;{{cite book

* The adoption rate of drought-resistant hybrid seed corn during the [[Great Depression]] and [[Dust Bowl]] was slow despite its significant improvement over the previously available seed corn.

=== Empirical Studies ===
In addition to the examples above, Information Cascades have been shown to exist in several empirical studies.  Perhaps the best example, given above, is.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Participants stood in a line behind an urn which had balls of different colors.  Sequentially, participants would pick a ball out of the urn, looks at it, and then places it back into the urn.  The agent then voices their opinion of which color of balls (red or blue) there is a majority of in the urn for the rest of the participants to hear.  Participants get a monetary reward if they guess correctly, forcing the concept of rationality.

Other examples include
* De Vany and Walls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Vany|first=A.|author2=D. Walls|title=Uncertainty in the movie industry: does star power reduce the terror of the box office?|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|year=1999|volume=23|pages=285–318|doi=10.1023/a:1007608125988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  create a statistical model of information cascades where an action is required.  They apply this model to the actions people take to go see a movie that has come out at the theatre.  De Vany and Walls validate their model on this data, finding a similar [[Pareto distribution]] of revenue for different movies.
* Walden and Browne also adopt the original Information Cascade model, here into an operational model more practical for real world studies, which allows for analysis based on observed variables.  Walden and Browne test their model on data about adoption of new technologies by businesses, finding support for their hypothesis that information cascades play a role in this adoption&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walden|first=Eric|author2=Glenn Browne|title=Information Cascades in the Adoption of New Technology|journal=ICIS Proceedings|year=2002|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2002/40/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
The negative effects of informational cascades sometimes become a legal concern and laws have been enacted to neutralize them. [[Ward Farnsworth]], a law professor, analyzed the legal aspects of informational cascades and gave several examples in his book ''The Legal Analyst'': in many [[military court]]s, the officers voting to decide a case vote in reverse rank order (the officer of the lowest rank votes first), and he suggested it may be done so the lower-ranked officers would not be tempted by the cascade to vote with the more senior officers, who are believed to have more accurate judgement; another example is that countries such as [[Israel]] and [[France]] have laws that prohibit polling days or weeks before [[election]]s to prevent the effect of informational cascade that may influence the election results.&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, Ward (2007). ''The Legal Analyst: A Toolkit for Thinking about the Law''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-23835-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization ==
As previously stated, informational cascades are logical processes describing how an individual’s decision process changes based upon outside information. Cascades have never been a household name; at best, they exist hypothetically. Over the past few decades, cascades saw an increase in popularity through various fields of study. Specifically, they have been quite useful in comparing thought processes between Greek and German organic farmers. The aforementioned study suggests discrepancies between Greek and German thought processes based upon their cultural and socioeconomic differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzimichael|first=Konstantinos|last2=Genius|first2=Margarita|last3=Tzouvelekas|first3=Vangelis|date=2013-07-03|title=Informational cascades and technology adoption: Evidence from Greek and German organic growers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919214001274|journal=Journal of Food Policy|volume=49|pages=186–195|via=ELSEVIER|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2014.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even further, cascades have been extrapolated to ideas such as financial volatility and monetary policy. In 2004 Helmut Wagner and Wolfram Berger suggested cascades as an analytical vehicle to examine changes to the financial market as it became more globalized. Wagner and Berger noticed structural changes to the framework of understanding financial markets due to globalization; giving rise to volatility in capital flow and spawning uncertainty which affected central banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Helmut|last2=Berger|first2=Wolfram|date=2004-06-01|title=Globalization, Financial Volatility and Monetary Policy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10633-004-0915-4|journal=Empirica|language=en|volume=31|issue=2–3|pages=163–184|doi=10.1007/s10633-004-0915-4|issn=0340-8744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, information cascades are useful in understanding the origins of terrorist tactics. When the attack by Black September occurred in 1972 it was hard not to see the similarities between their tactics and the Baader-Meinhof group (also known as the Red Army Faction [RAF]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904285976|title=Ulrike Meinhof and the Red Army Faction : performing terrorism|last=1981-|first=Passmore, Leith,|isbn=9780230370777|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=904285976}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these examples portray how the process of cascades were put into use. Moreover, it is important to understand the framework of cascades to move forward in a more globalized society. Establishing a foundation to understanding the passage of information through transnational and multinational organizations, and even more, is critical to the arising modern society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamlett|first=Patrick W.|last2=Cobb|first2=Michael D.|date=2006-11-01|title=Potential Solutions to Public Deliberation Problems: Structured Deliberations and Polarization Cascades|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00195.x/abstract|journal=Policy Studies Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=4|pages=629–648|doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2006.00195.x|issn=1541-0072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Summing up all of these points, cascades, as a general term, encompass a spectrum of different concepts. Information cascades have been the underlying thread in how information is transferred, overwritten, and understood through various cultures spanning from a multitude of different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drezner|first=Daniel W.|date=2010|title=Weighing the Scales: The Internet's Effect On State-Society Relations|journal=The Brown Journal of World Affairs|volume=16|issue=2|pages=31–44|doi=10.2307/24590907|jstor=24590907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kermit Alan Washington''' (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] during an on-court fight in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Liz. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A12FD3E5F0C738FDDA80894DD404482&amp;pagewanted=2 Inside the N.B.A.; Three Decades Later, Washington Still Feels Effects of His Punch], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 30, 2005, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;br&gt;*Zirin, Dave. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/dave_zirin/09/08/punch/ Kermit Washington reaches out to Oregon RB LeGarrette Blount], sportsillustrated.com, September 8, 2009, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His punch nearly killed Tomjanovich, and resulted in severe medical problems that ultimately ended Tomjanovich's playing career. 

Washington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school and barely got into college on an athletic scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once at [[American University]], and became one of only seven players in [[NCAA]] history to average 20 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.

A big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) seasons and played in the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] once. Washington was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] with the fifth overall pick in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach [[Pete Newell]] before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, [[Boston Celtics]], [[San Diego Clippers]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]].

==Early life==
Kermit Washington's mother Barbara&lt;ref name="Fn110"&gt;Feinstein pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into [[Howard University]]), where she was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an [[Radiologic technologist|X-ray technician]].&lt;ref name="Fn110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halb"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had a rough childhood.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked his uncle with an iron.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who came and took them back.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;

The effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth.&lt;ref name="halb2"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt; After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, [[Chris Washington|Chris]].&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood.&lt;ref name="halb3"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 258&lt;/ref&gt; He had to retake many of his classes in [[summer school]] to raise his grades.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt; When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt;

As a senior in high school, Washington stood {{height|ft=6|in=4}} but weighed a mere 150&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt; After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects.&lt;ref name="halb4"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 259&lt;/ref&gt; When Thomas became his [[home room]] teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;

His basketball performance in high school was unimpressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench to average four [[points per game]] (ppg).&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; Chris had been able to leave home on a [[athletic scholarship|football scholarship]] and would later play in the [[National Football League]], but Washington himself had nowhere to go.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a [[streetball|playground game]] featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 116–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Young (basketball coach)|Tom Young]], who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at [[American University]], saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==College years==
During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches.&lt;ref name="halb261"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 261&lt;/ref&gt; He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; He has frequently described his college years as "the happiest time in my life."&lt;ref name="Fn150"/&gt; He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="halb262"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams.&lt;ref name="halb262"/&gt; He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American.&lt;ref name="bref"&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/washike01.html Kermit Washington], basketball-reference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.&lt;ref name="halb263"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

He averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He still played a somewhat unaggressive or "soft" brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team.&lt;ref name="halb264"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the [[University of Nebraska]] who was studying as an [[undergrad]] at American.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be "cool" on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders|NCAA-leading]] 19.8 rebounds in his junior season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2010/D1.pdf 2009–10 NCAA Men's Basketball Records], ncaa.org, accessed November 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted after his junior season by the [[New York Nets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 [[United States men's national basketball team|Olympic basketball team]] after the season, but did not make the squad.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 147–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He marveled at newspaper reports in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that mentioned "coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop ''Kermit Washington''."&lt;ref name="halb265"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season.&lt;ref name="NCAA"/&gt; He was a [[1973 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|second team All-American]], and helped American into the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep.&lt;ref name="Fn150"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a 3.37 [[Grade (education)|GPA]] and a degree in [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="paroxy"&gt;Moore, Matt. [http://www.hardwoodparoxysm.com/2010/07/28/words-on-pages-the-punch-by-john-feinstein/ Words on Pages: "The Punch" by John Feinstein], hardwoodparoxysm.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt;

==Professional years==
Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed in high school and college due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt; Washington also had played in a primarily [[zone defense]] system in college and was not versed in [[man-to-man defense]], which is more common in the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 170–1&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived on a team which had legend [[Jerry West]], who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolves.nba.com/history/players/west_bio.html Jerry West bio], nba.com, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Though healthy,&lt;ref name="halb266"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be "labeled soft."&lt;ref name="Fn181"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The injury would bother him the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Fn181"/&gt; He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach [[Bill Sharman]], was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;

[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. "He was my hero", Washington later said. "It was a dream come true."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar would later play an important role in the fight that changed Washington's life.]]
Entering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt; Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]], he got into an awkward collision with [[Rick Barry]], upon which Barry remarked: "Listen, you better learn how to play this game."&lt;ref name="halb267"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted [[Pete Newell]] at the recommendation of an agent.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 27–8&lt;/ref&gt; Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers,&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day.&lt;ref name="halb268"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball.&lt;ref name="gf"&gt;Bucher, Ric. [http://sports.espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no19bigmancamp.html The Godfather], espn.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://collegehoops.scout.com/2/558707.html Pete Newell Still The Footwork Master] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716021133/http://collegehoops.scout.com/2/558707.html |date=2011-07-16 }}, scout.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Jorge L. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/12/28/SP190250.DTL Another legacy at Newell Many coaches with links to Heathcote], December 28, 2001, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chin. pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbaum. pg. 329&lt;/ref&gt; In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt;

Newell had Washington watch tapes of [[Paul Silas]], who was a rebounding forward for the [[Boston Celtics]], and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game.&lt;ref name="halb269"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; He reworked Washington's game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly "Big Man Camp" in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.&lt;ref&gt;Bucher, Ric. [http://sports.espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no19bigmancamp.html The Godfather], espn.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles had acquired [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and Washington's style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player.&lt;ref name="halb269"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 38–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds;&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; however, he struggled with [[tendinitis]] in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 269-70&lt;/ref&gt; Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 270-71&lt;/ref&gt; "I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.&lt;ref name="halb271"&gt;Halberstam pg. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Newell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting.&lt;ref name="halbNe"&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 271-72&lt;/ref&gt; His leg had [[atrophy|atrophied]] from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder.&lt;ref name="halbNe"/&gt; Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8).&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills.&lt;ref name="BS89"&gt;Simmons. pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates."&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, John. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092961/index.htm 'nobody, But Nobody, Is Going To Hurt My Teammates'], ''Sports Illustrated'', October 31, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infamous punch===
On December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the [[Houston Rockets]], a scuffle broke out between several players at midcourt.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

The events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. Bucks center [[Kent Benson]] elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt; Washington got into a brawl with several [[Buffalo Braves]] players a few games later.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; In the December game, at the beginning of the game's second half, Lakers guard [[Norm Nixon]] missed a shot. Houston's [[Kevin Kunnert]] and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate [[John Lucas II|John Lucas]]. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]] insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a "scuffle" between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 78, 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt; Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

Abdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OpAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HeEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,5148642&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington Down and Out], ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', December 10, 1977, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;

Washington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8&amp;nbsp;mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete.&lt;ref name="halb273"&gt;Halberstam. pg 273&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093182/index.htm A Roundup Of The Week Dec. 5-11], ''Sports Illustrated'', December 17, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was "the loudest silence you have ever heard."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David Leon. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ccovtue.htm New start from old wounds], November 26, 2002, usatoday.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor [[press box]], and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs 53–4&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it," and likened the surgery to [[Scotch Tape|Scotch-taping]] together a badly shattered eggshell.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Worsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked,&lt;ref name="BS90"&gt;Simmons. pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member [[Garrett Morris]] comically defend the punch.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 90, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 91–2&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the subject of a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial and investigated on [[CBS News]] by [[Walter Cronkite]].&lt;ref name="SIpunch"&gt;Kirkpatrick, Patrick. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093209/index.htm Shattered and Shaken], ''Sports Illustrated'', January 2, 1978, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was fined $10,000,&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[[United Press International]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19771213&amp;id=gxIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BscEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3185,2769930 Kermit Washington Draws Stiff Penalty], ''Times Daily'', December 13, 1977, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/title/The+Punch%253A+Kermit+Washington+vs.+Rudy+Tomjanovich The Punch: Kermit Washington vs. Rudy Tomjanovich], everything2.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed the rest of the season and they felt Washington should at least have done likewise.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;

On-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including [[bench-clearing brawl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied.&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]], then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other."&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Mike.

Washington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 82, 92&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent torrents of [[hate mail]] filled with racial epithets.&lt;ref name="cady"&gt;Cady, Steve.

Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 90–1&lt;/ref&gt; and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act.&lt;ref name="halb275"/&gt; The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell's home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.&lt;ref name="halb275"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 275&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Ryan.JPG|thumb|Bob Ryan wrote a column on Washington in 1978. Ryan later said, "You couldn't not like the guy when you sat down and talked with him...He never wanted to hurt Rudy the way he did...I felt bad for him."&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The article endeared Washington to Celtics fans.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The relationship was short-lived, however; he was traded after playing just 32 games for the team.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;]]

On December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; [[Red Auerbach]], Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington's.&lt;ref name="halb276"&gt;Halberstam pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, [[Jerry West]], who was the Lakers coach at the time, told [[John Feinstein]] he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager [[Bill Sharman]] said he was "on the fence."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke, however, decided to move on.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 100–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington started alongside Hall of Fame center [[Dave Cowens]], who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, "It's great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he's rebounding."&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Auerbach said, "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Washington won Boston fans over immediately.&lt;ref name="BS90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His acceptance was aided by a glowing article [[Bob Ryan]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 225–6&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the [[Denver Nuggets]].&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 229–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Kunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 247–8&lt;/ref&gt; There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,1342232&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington in Awkward Position], ''[[Star-News]]'', September 7, 1978, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Kunnert became involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner [[Irv Levin]] wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in [[California]] but also wanted continue to own an NBA team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/history/Recap_1970s.html 1970s Boston Celtics history], nba.com/celtics, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this problem, he and [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], owner of the [[Buffalo Braves]] NBA team, exchanged franchises.&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SDC/1979.html San Diego Clippers], basketballreference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the [[San Diego Clippers]].

In November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game, the Clippers coach, [[Gene Shue]], had suggested to the Rockets coach, [[Tom Nissalke]], that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center [[Bill Walton]] even though Walton had missed the entire [[1978–79 NBA season|1978–79 season]] due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and [[Randy Smith (basketball)|Randy Smith]] to Portland in exchange for Walton.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade. 

Portland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager [[Stu Inman]], was a close friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets' civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 261&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Ramsay]], Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center [[Swen Nater]] when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 260–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with [[Maurice Lucas]] at first, but after Lucas' trade to the [[New Jersey Nets]], he became the full-time starter.&lt;ref name="Fn262"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], after some of the top players sat out due to injury.&lt;ref name="Fn269"/&gt; During that All-Star weekend, which was held in [[Landover, Maryland]], nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season.&lt;ref name="Fn269"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the [[1980–81 NBA season|1980–81 season]]. The pain became unbearable during the [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82 season]], and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;

==Retirement==
Since retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of [[charitable organization]]s. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area with former Blazer teammate [[Kevin Duckworth]], called "Le Slam." The restaurant closed in 2001.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Joe Freeman, [http://www.oregonlive.com/nba/index.ssf/2011/03/kermit_washington.html "Ex-NBA Tough Guy Follows Call to Africa,"] ''The Oregonian'', March 23, 2011, pp. D1, D4.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served in a coaching role with [[Stanford University]], and worked at [[Pete Newell]]'s fabled "Big Man Camp" for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa.&lt;ref name="Syken"&gt;Syken, Bill. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1032489/index.htm#ixzz11t8zrYXC Kermit Washington A onetime NBA pariah delivers medical supplies to an impoverished nation], sportsillustrated.com, July 12, 2004, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to [[Goma]], [[Zaire]], working in a [[refugee camp]] helping victims of the bloody [[Rwandan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; The stench of death and human waste extended for miles. "It was a sad, sad sight", Washington later recalled, "a sight I'll never forget."&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

After his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich.&lt;ref name="flak"&gt;Wittmershaus, Eric. [http://www.flakmag.com/books/punch.html The Punch], flakmag.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told ''The New York Times'' that he has been refused work as a coach time and again.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 335–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Tom Davis]] hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.&lt;ref name="Fn336"/&gt;

Washington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, this appears to be a misrepresentation of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant."&lt;ref name="Fn336"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 336&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Feinstein]] and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight.&lt;ref name="paroxy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was very hard for him to show affection. Sometimes I would ask him directly if he really cared about me, and he would say something like, "I think you're really nice." It was hard for him to be more open than that. He had never really been nurtured, never really been loved. I came to believe if I nurtured him enough, if I loved him enough, he would get past all that. But I don't believe he ever really did.}}

Washington used the charity to [[Money laundering|launder money]] he received as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Washington, as a regional representative for the [[National Basketball Players Association]], referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments.

'''Lantian Man''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|蓝田|人}}|t={{linktext|藍田|人}}|p={{linktext|Lántián| rén}}}}), formerly ''Sinanthropus lantianensis'' (currently ''Homo erectus lantianensis'') is a subspecies of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Its discovery in 1963 was first described by J. K. Woo the following year. The cranial capacity is estimated to be {{convert|780|cm3|cuin}}, somewhat similar to that of its contemporary, [[Java Man]].

Remnants of Lantian Man were found in [[Lantian County]], in China's [[Shaanxi]] province, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Xi'an]]. Shortly after the discovery of the [[Human mandible|mandible]] (jaw bone) of the first Lantian Man at [[Chenjiawo]] (陈家窝), also in Lantian, a [[Human cranium|cranium]] (skull) with nasal bones, right maxilla, and three teeth of another specimen of Lantian Man were found at [[Gongwangling]] (公王岭), another site in Lantian. 

== Dating ==
A skull found at Gongwangling is the oldest fossil of a ''[[Homo erectus]]'' ever found in northern Asia. When first published in 1964, it was dated to 1.15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="zimmer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/science/hominins-tools-china.html|title=Archaeologists in China Discover the Oldest Stone Tools Outside Africa|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|date=2018-07-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2001, Zhu Zhaoyu ({{lang|zh-Hans|朱照宇}}), a geologist at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], and other scientists began a fresh research of the site.&lt;ref name="zimmer"/&gt; Their new analysis was published in 2015, which has determined that the strata containing the cranium from Gongwangling dates to approximately 1.63 million years ago, much older than the previous estimate of 1.15 million years. This new confirmed date makes the cranium the second oldest site outside of Africa, [[Dmanisi Man|Dmanisi]], Georgia being the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Zhao-Yu|date=2015-01-01|title=New dating of the Homo erectus cranium from Lantian (Gongwangling), China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248414002309|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|language=en|volume=78|pages=144–157|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2014.10.001|pmid=25456822|issn=0047-2484}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is older than the [[Peking Man]], but slightly younger than the [[Yuanmou Man]].&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pope|first1=Geoffrey G.|title=Evidence on the age of the Asian Hominidae|date=1983|journal=PNAS|volume=80|issue=16|pages=4988–4992|doi=10.1073/pnas.80.16.4988|pmid=6410399|pmc=384173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhu's further survey of the region led to the discovery of the [[Shangchen]] site in Lantian, which was published in 2018.&lt;ref name="zimmer"/&gt; Stone tools (but no hominin fossils) found at Shangchen are dated to more than 2.1 million years ago, the earliest known evidence of [[hominins]] outside Africa, surpassing Dmanisi by 300,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhu|first=Zhaoyu |last2=Dennell |first2=Robin |authorlink2= Robin Dennell |last3=Huang|first3=Weiwen|last4=Wu|first4=Yi|last5=Qiu|first5=Shifan|last6=Yang|first6=Shixia|last7=Rao|first7=Zhiguo|last8=Hou|first8=Yamei|last9=Xie|first9=Jiubing|date=2018-07-11|title=Hominin occupation of the Chinese Loess Plateau since about 2.1 million years ago|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0299-4|journal=Nature|volume=559|issue=7715 |pages=608-612|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0299-4|pmid=29995848 |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barras|first=Colin|date=2018-07-11|title=Tools from China are oldest hint of human lineage outside Africa|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05696-8|journal=Nature|language=EN|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05696-8|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tool Complex ==
Until the 1980s it had been commonly accepted that comparisons between European and Asian [[Paleolithic]] cultures were not possible. The common thinking was that there was too great a difference between their tool technologies. In the 1940s a researcher, H.L. Movius, proposed that the Paleolithic West was made up of "hand axe cultures", while the East had "chopper-chopping tool cultures". Numerous research into technological traditions followed the model proposed by Movius in support of the East/West technology divide.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Twenty-six lithic artifacts were uncovered in the same loess sedimentary deposit as the cranium from the Gongwangling site in Lantian County, China. The artifacts consisted of cores, flakes, choppers, hand-axes, spheroids, and scrapers. Lab analysis suggested that the "early hominins chose quartzite, quartz, greywacke and igneous rock pebbles/cobbles on the riverbank for stone knapping, whereas the fine sandstone, siliceous limestone and chert were used only occasionally." Studying the assemblage from Gongwangling along with a series of other sites in the Lantian region leads researchers to believe that the tools utilized by the hominids are more similar to the [[Acheulean]] tools utilized in the West than previously thought. This means that the tool technology is not different, and still consists of more large hand tools e.g. hand-axes than previous researchers thought and represents a continuum of technology from the West rather than two separately occurring technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chronological and typo-technological perspectives on the Palaeolithic archaeology in Lantian, central China|last = Wang|first = Shejiang|date = July 2014|journal = Quaternary International|volume = 347|pages = 183–192|doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2014.07.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for the targetting of NGO ships===
In May 2017, Southern took part in an attempt organized by the identitarian group ''[[Les Identitaires#G.C3.A9n.C3.A9ration Identitaire|Génération identitare]]'' to block the passage of an [[NGO]] ship, the [[Aquarius (NGO ship)|''Aquarius'']] (co-owned by SOS Mediterranée and by [[Médecins Sans Frontières|Doctors without Borders]]), which was leaving Sicily to start a search-and-rescue mission for ship-wrecked migrants off the shores of Northern Africa. Claiming that the goal of the activists "was to stop an empty boat from going down to Libya and filling up with illegal migrants", Southern was briefly detained by the [[Italian Coast Guard]]. NGO ships often rescue migrants and refugees, who disembark from Libyan shores on unsafe makeshift rafts, and bring them to Sicily.&lt;ref name="abbynews"&gt;Matthew Claxton: ''[http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy  Former Langley Libertarian candidate detained in Italy] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170517213951/http://www.abbynews.com/news/former-langley-libertarian-candidate-detained-in-italy|date= 17 May 2017}}.''

Southern supported similar actions by identitarian group [[Defend Europe]], which chartered a vessel in order to track and stop what it called collusion between NGOs and human traffickers. The group has been accused{{by whom|date= March 2018}} of intending to obstruct the rescue of migrants and refugees in distress at sea. In July 2017, Southern revealed that [[Patreon]] had deleted her account out of concerns about her "raising funds in order to take part in activities that are likely to cause loss of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|title= PATREON BANNED MY ACCOUNT??|last= Lauren Southern|date= 21 July 2017|publisher= YouTube|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170723023740/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtImwK5TI4g|archivedate= 23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern denied these allegations, stating that Defend Europe's actions were likely to save lives and that none of her funding went towards the group.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news

The subsequent booking of a private venue was revoked by its owners, one of whom said "The minute I heard who it was I cancelled".&lt;ref name="The_minute_I_heard_who_it_was_I_cancelled"/&gt; In retaliation, their venue was vandalised.&lt;ref name=vandalised/&gt;

The failure to find a venue was celebrated by around 1,000 protestors, who said the planned event had nothing to do with freedom of speech. The [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] said Southern's views "are not those that are shared by this country".&lt;ref name="NZ_Hostile_to_Southern"/&gt;

====Auckland Council venue cancellation====
Southern and Canadian [[podcast]]er and [[List of YouTubers|YouTuber]] [[Stefan Molyneux]] were scheduled to speak in [[Auckland]] on 3 August 2018, at an [[Auckland Council]]-owned theatre. However, Auckland Live, the Council agency responsible for the theatre, cancelled the venue booking on the grounds of concerns around "the health and safety of the presenters, staff and patrons". The [[Mayor of Auckland]] [[Phil Goff]] then tweeted that Council venues should not be used to "stir up ethnic or religious tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Controversial Canadian speaker denied visa as Auckland agency cancels booking |first=Todd |last=Niall |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105302179/controversial-canadian-speaker-denied-visa-as-auckland-agency-cancels-booking |newspaper=Stuff |date=6 July 2018 |accessdate=29 September 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; He later said "we've got no obligation at all" to provide a venue for "hate speech".&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; In response, Southern denied assertions that her views were "hate speech" and warned about the danger of "progressivism".&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mayor bans controversial Canadian pair from talking in Auckland Council venues|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12084381|accessdate=9 July 2018|publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]''|date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] and Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Winston Peters]] and National Party leader [[Simon Bridges]] said they would have supported her right to speak, while [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] co-leader [[Marama Davidson]] said she supported the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Government divided over far right speakers |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2018/07/government-divided-over-far-right-speakers.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=McCulloch |first1=Craig |title=Winston Peters would've let far-right activists speak |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/361448/winston-peters-would-ve-let-far-right-activists-speak |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For saying so, Davidson's family was sent degrading messages of a sexual nature and death threats by supporters of Lauren Southern.&lt;ref name="Degrading_Messages_of_a_Sexual_Nature_from_Lauren_Southern_fans"/&gt; Human rights lawyer Craig Tuck criticized Mayor Goff's decision as a violation of free speech, while the cancellation of Southern and Molyneux's tour was welcomed by the [[Auckland Peace Action]] activist group and the [[Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand]] (FIANZ).&lt;ref name=radionz/&gt; By contrast, ''[[The Spinoff]]'' contributor Ali Shakir said that while he disagreed with many of Southern's views, he thought she and Molyneux should be welcomed to New Zealand and said that barring them damaged the country's commitment to [[freedom of expression]] and raised "serious concerns about the process."

====Visa granted====
On 20 July, [[Immigration New Zealand]] granted visas for Southern and Molyneux to visit New Zealand. While describing their views as "repugnant" and "counter to the kind and tolerant values of the vast majority of New Zealanders", [[Minister of Immigration (New Zealand)|Immigration Minister]] [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] cleared their entry on the grounds that the duo had met immigration character requirements including not having prior criminal convictions. He added that they were never banned from Australia or the United Kingdom as previously reported.&lt;ref name="Satherley"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Satherley |first1=Dan |title=Protests outside Lauren Southern speaking gig in Melbourne |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/protests-outside-lauren-southern-speaking-gig-in-melbourne.html |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southern welcomed the news and tweeted that she hoped that she and Molyneux could be "unbarred" from their venue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Lucy |title=Alt right speakers Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux granted entry to NZ |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12092243 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fonseka |first1=Dileepa |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux have 'visas in hand' and will come to NZ, organiser says |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/105625016/Lauren-Southern-and-Stefan-Molyneux-have-visas-in-hand-and-will-come-to-NZ-organiser-says |accessdate=20 July 2018 |agency=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |publisher=Auckland Now |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alistair McCylmont, a leading immigration lawyer, later said there were "plenty" of grounds to stop the two coming into the country. He cited the visa cancellation of a rapper in 2014 using a law usually reserved for white supremacists, and suggested the grounds of a risk to order or the public interest. "Considering the amount of information out there in the public forum about the views held by the different people and what they've been talking, they would be plenty of grounds that could have been applied to declining visas." However, the minister took the view that denying entry would not be justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern, Stefan Molyneux could still have visas cancelled |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/controversial-speakers-lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-could-still-be-banned-from-nz/ |accessdate=5 August 2018 |publisher=''[[Newstalk ZB]]'' |date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Nama Japam''' or '''Nama Sankeertanam''' is the ''[[japa]]'' (repetition) or ''[[Sankirtana]]'' of ''nama'' (name) of the Almighty.  The devotee chooses ''[[Ishta-deva]]'' or ''[[Ishta devata]]'' (Sanskrit ''{{IAST|iṣṭa-deva(tā)}}'', literally "cherished [[Deva (Hinduism)|divinity]]" from ''iṣṭa'' "desired, liked, cherished" and ''[[devatā]]'' "godhead, divinity," or ''[[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' "deity") and picks up a name of the Ishta deva to repeatedly [[chant]] the name vocally or in the mind any time, anywhere.  Devotees can form a group and do sankeertanam or singing together of name of the Almighty.

[[Bhishma]] considered chanting of the ''[[Vishnu sahasranama]]'' the best and easiest of all dharmas, or the means to attain relief from all bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephen-knapp.com/thousand_names_of_the_supreme.htm "Thousand Names of the Supreme"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Sankaracharya]], the [[Advaita]] enlightened master, in verse 27 of his hymn, [[Bhaja Govindam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamakoti.org/shlokas/kshlok19.htm Bhaja Govindam: kamakoti.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; said that the [[Gita]] and Vishnu sahasranama should be chanted and the form of the Lord of [[Lakshmi]]-Narayana should always be meditated on. He also said that the Sahasranama bestowed all noble virtues on those who chanted it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/12/16/stories/2005121603040200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=On the Buddha in verse | date=December 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Krishna has mentioned in Srimad [[Bhagavad Gita]], that He resides in the hearts of those who chant and sing His namas.

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In the context of [[United States]] [[constitutional interpretation]], '''original meaning''' is the dominant form of the [[law|legal theory]] of [[originalism]] today. It was made popular by Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] and contends that the terms of the [[United States Constitution]] should be interpreted as meaning what they meant when they were ratified, which is to say, it asks the question: "What would a [[reasonable person]] living at the time of ratification have understood these words to mean?"

The theory stands in equal opposition to [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivist]] theories such as [[original intent]], and [[Legal realism|legal realist]] theories such as that of the [[living Constitution]].

==Theory==
Original meaning is a [[legal formalism|formalist]] theory, and a logical extension of [[textualism]]. Textualists believe that a statute means whatever the [[Plain meaning rule|plain meaning]] of its words is, as opposed to other potential meanings, such as what those who drafted the law or voted for it ''intended'' it to say. Formalists would point out that it is unnecessary for any member of the legislature to share the intentions of any other member of the legislature, or even to ''have'' a particular intent; what counts is their vote, just as if a voter enters a polling station while [[inebriated]], and indicates a preference for the wrong candidate, their vote will count as a vote for the person they indicated on the ballot paper, not for the candidate for whom they intended to vote before they started drinking. Likewise, even if not a single member of the legislature has read and comprehended the effect of a given bill (a scenario some [[USA Patriot Act#Controversy|critics of the USA PATRIOT Act]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] allege to have actually occurred during the enactment of these statutes), once it becomes law, it is a law no less or more valid than an identically worded law passed when every member of the legislature is of the same mind and understanding regarding its meaning and effect. This being the case, it is the text of the law which governs.

==Practice==
An originalist inquiry into the original ''meaning'' of the Constitution is able to cast a much broader net than an inquiry into the original ''intent''.

Originalists of all stripes cite ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''. It is fairly tenuous to suggest that this represents a good source for the original ''intent'': after all, [[Alexander Hamilton]], who wrote the majority of those essays, was absent for the greater part of the [[Philadelphia Convention]], and [[John Jay]] did not attend it at all. However, [[James Madison]], the principal framer of the Constitution also wrote a substantial amount of ''The Federalist Papers''. Also, to suggest Hamilton and Jay's absence from the convention implies their ignorance as to the Constitution's original meaning is demeaning to those two men and inaccurate. The collected anti-Federalist papers, of course, will be no use at all to a person searching for the original ''intent'' of the framers. However, as evidence of how a reasonable person at the time would have understood the words of the Constitution, ''The Federalist Papers'' and the anti-Federalist essays are evidence of direct relevance.

Likewise, neither [[John Adams]] nor [[Thomas Jefferson]] attended the Convention, and thus two of the most prolific writers of the founding era are necessarily excluded (or, at best, abstracted) from an original-intent inquiry. Because they were reasonable contemporaries of the Framers, their writings are informative to discussions of the text's original meaning.

One of the primary virtues of original meaning over original intent is that the original meaning is a fairly discernible thing, while the original intent is nebulous and uncertain. This is well-illustrated by the use of dictionaries. Contemporaneous dictionaries are of dubious value to an original ''intent'' inquiry, but of high value to an original ''meaning'' inquiry: we can establish what the words the Framers chose ''meant'', but that is not ''necessarily'' conclusive as to what they ''intended'' to say (consider for example, the [[unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]]).

==Origins==
The theory was arguably pioneered and popularized by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]; whether Scalia could take credit for inventing it, he remained one of its most forceful and high-profile proponents, although he was also accused of deviating from the method (he himself admitted that "in a crunch I may prove a faint-hearted originalist") (Scalia, ''Originalism: The Lesser Evil'', [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/lesserevil.asp#864 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849 at 864]).

A '''pejorative''' (also called a '''derogatory term''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/derogatory|title=Definition of derogatory|publisher=''[[Merriam Webster]]''|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a '''slur''', a '''term of abuse''', or a '''term of disparagement''') is a word or grammatical form expressing a negative connotation or a low opinion of someone or something, showing a lack of [[respect]] for someone or something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pejorative |title=Pejorative &amp;#124; Define Pejorative at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to express [[criticism]], [[hostility]], or [[wikt:disregard|disregard]]. A term can be regarded as pejorative in some social or cultural groups but not in others. Sometimes, a term may begin as a pejorative and eventually be adopted in a non-pejorative sense (or vice versa) in some or all contexts.

'''Name slurs''' can also involve an insulting or disparaging [[innuendo]],&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slur |title=Slur - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than being a direct pejorative. In some cases, a person's name can be redefined with an unpleasant or insulting meaning, or be applied to a group of people considered by anyone to be inferior or lower in social class, as a group label with a disparaging meaning.

==Etymology==
According to the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the word pejorative is derived from a [[Late Latin]] past participle stem of ''peiorare'', meaning "to make worse", from ''peior'' "worse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pejorative (adj.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pejorative|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melioration==

When a term begins as pejorative and eventually is adopted in a non-pejorative sense, this is called "melioration" in [[historical linguistics]]. It may also be called ''amelioration'', [[reclaiming]], or [[semantic change]].&lt;ref name=croom&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VD2-51PBJ21-1&amp;_user=489256&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2011&amp;_rdoc=2&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_origin=browse&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235970%232011%23999669996%233020754%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5970&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=11&amp;_acct=C000022721&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=489256&amp;md5=f94b3fbfef3504c7d540c69149e5bf56&amp;searchtype=a |last=Croom |first=Adam M. |title=Slurs |journal=Language Sciences |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 2011 |pages=343–358 |doi=10.1016/j.langsci.2010.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of melioration are "[[punk subculture|punk]]", "[[dude]]" and "[[nerd]]".

In [[theoretical physics]], a '''Penrose diagram''' (named after mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]) is a [[two-dimensional]] diagram capturing the [[causal relation]]s between different points in [[spacetime]]. It is an extension of a [[Minkowski diagram]] where the vertical dimension represents time, and the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimension represents space, and slanted lines at an angle of 45° correspond to light rays. The biggest difference is that locally, the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on a Penrose diagram is [[conformal equivalence|conformally equivalent]] to the actual metric in spacetime. The conformal factor is chosen such that the entire infinite spacetime is transformed into a Penrose diagram of finite size. For [[spherically symmetric spacetime]]s, every point in the diagram corresponds to a 2-dimensional sphere.

==Basic properties==
While Penrose diagrams share the same basic [[coordinate vector]] system of other space-time diagrams for local [[asymptotically flat spacetime]], it introduces a system of representing distant spacetime by shrinking or "crunching" distances that are further away. Straight lines of constant time and straight lines of constant space coordinates therefore become [[hyperbola]]s, which appear to converge at [[Point (geometry)|point]]s in the corners of the diagram. These points represent '''"conformal infinity"''' for space and time.

Penrose diagrams are more properly (but less frequently) called '''Penrose–Carter diagrams''' (or '''Carter–Penrose diagrams'''), acknowledging both [[Brandon Carter]] and Roger Penrose, who were the first researchers to employ them. They are also called conformal diagrams, or simply spacetime diagrams.

[[File:Penrose diagram.svg|right|thumb|Penrose diagram of an infinite [[Minkowski]] universe, horizontal axis ''u'', vertical axis ''v'']]

Two lines drawn at 45° angles should intersect in the diagram only if the corresponding two light rays intersect in the actual spacetime.
So, a Penrose diagram can be used as a concise illustration of spacetime regions that are accessible to observation. The [[diagonal]] boundary lines of a Penrose diagram correspond to the "infinity" or to singularities where light rays must end. Thus, Penrose diagrams are also useful in the study of asymptotic properties of spacetimes and singularities. An infinite static [[Minkowski space|Minkowski universe]], coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; is related to Penrose coordinates &lt;math&gt;(u, v)&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(u \pm v) = x \pm t&lt;/math&gt;
The corners of the Penrose diamond, which represent the spacelike and timelike conformal infinities, are &lt;math&gt;\pi /2&lt;/math&gt; from the origin.

==Black holes==
Penrose diagrams are frequently used to illustrate the causal structure of spacetimes containing [[black holes]].  Singularities are denoted by a spacelike boundary, unlike the timelike boundary found on conventional space-time diagrams. This is due to the interchanging of timelike and spacelike coordinates within the horizon of a black hole (since space is uni-directional within the horizon, just as time is uni-directional outside the horizon).
The singularity is represented by a spacelike boundary to make it clear that once an object has passed the horizon it will inevitably hit the singularity even if it attempts to take evasive action.

Penrose diagrams are often used to illustrate the hypothetical [[Einstein-Rosen bridge]] connecting two separate universes in the maximally extended [[Schwarzschild solution|Schwarzschild black hole solution]]. The precursors to the Penrose diagrams were [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates|Kruskal&amp;ndash;Szekeres diagrams]]. (The Penrose diagram adds to Kruskal and Szekeres' diagram the conformal crunching of the regions of flat space-time far from the hole.) These introduced the method of aligning the [[event horizon]] into past and future horizons oriented at 45° angles (since one would need to travel [[faster than light]] to cross from the [[Schwarzschild radius]] back into flat spacetime); and splitting the [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] into past and future horizontally-oriented lines (since the singularity "cuts off" all paths into the future once one enters the hole).

The Einstein-Rosen bridge closes off (forming "future" singularities) so rapidly that passage between the two asymptotically flat exterior regions would require faster-than-light velocity, and is therefore impossible. In addition, highly [[blue-shift]]ed light rays (called a '''"blue sheet"''') would make it impossible for anyone to pass through.
[[File:Penrose_Diagrams_of_various_black_hole_solutions.svg|right|upright=1.5|thumb|Penrose Diagrams of various black hole solutions]]

The maximally extended solution does not describe a typical black hole created from the collapse of a star, as the surface of the collapsed star replaces the sector of the solution containing the past-oriented "[[white hole]]" geometry and other universe.

While the basic [[space-like]] passage of a static black hole cannot be traversed, the Penrose diagrams for solutions representing [[Kerr metric|rotating]] and/or [[Reissner–Nordström metric|electrically charged]] black holes illustrate these solutions' inner event horizons (lying in the future) and vertically oriented singularities, which open up what is known as a [[time-like]] "wormhole" allowing passage into future universes. In the case of the rotating hole, there is also a "negative" universe entered through a ring-shaped singularity (still portrayed as a line in the diagram) that can be passed through if entering the hole close to its [[Coordinate axis|axis]] of rotation. These features of the solutions are, however, not stable and not believed to be a realistic description of the interior regions of such black holes; the true character of their interiors is still an open question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">In the '''platonia dilemma''' introduced in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=Dilemmas for Superrational Thinkers, Leading Up to a Luring Lottery |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=248 |number=6 |date=June 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=737–755 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an eccentric trillionaire gathers 20 people together, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends him a telegram (reverse charges) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If he receives more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the [[superrationality|superrational]] thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.

==Luring Lottery==
A similar game, referred to as a "Luring Lottery", was actually played by the editors of ''[[Scientific American]]'' in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |year= |title=Irrationality Is the Square Root of All Evil |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=249 |number=3 |date=September 1983 }} – reprinted in: {{Cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |title=[[Metamagical Themas]] |pages=756–766 |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number "1" written on it.  They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit.  The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry.  Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased his or her chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize.  It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one's average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others.  Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.

According to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated [[dice|die]] with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send "1" if you roll "1".  If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a "1", and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard.  Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.

Although the magazine had previously discussed the concept of [[superrationality]] from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a [[googolplex]]).  Some took this game further by filling their postcards with mathematical expressions designed to evaluate to the largest possible number in the limited space allowed.  The magazine was unable to tell who won, and the monetary value of the prize would have been a minuscule fraction of a cent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11648">'''Primary Deviance''' is the initial stage in defining [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. Prominent Sociologist [[Edwin Lemert]] &lt;ref&gt;Lemert, Edwin. 1967. ''Human Deviance, Social Problems and Social Control''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; conceptualized primary deviance as engaging in the initial act of deviance. This is very common throughout society, as everyone takes part in [[Norm (social)|basic]] form violation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Grady, William. 2011. ''Crime in Canadian Context''. Ontario: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Primary deviance does not result in a person internalizing a deviant identity, so one does not alter their self-concept to include this deviant identity. It is not until the act becomes labeled or tagged, that secondary deviation may materialize. According to Edwin Lemert, Primary Deviance is the acts that are carried out by the individual that allows them to carry the deviant label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Sociology|last=Giddens, et al|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=New York, New York|pages=168|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences on Primary Deviant Behavior ==

=== Family and home life ===
Parental support and the influence that Parents have on their children is one of the highest contributors to the behavior in adolescents. This is the primary stage in which behaviors, morals and values are learned and adopted. The guidance from parents is intended to mold and shape the behaviors that will qualify them to properly function in society. Praises, love, affection, encouragement and many other aspects of positive enforcement is one of the largest components of parental support. However, this is not all it takes to prevent deviant behaviors from forming and occurring.Parents must enforce "effective discipline, monitoring, and problem-solving techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Amber|title=How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior among Adolescents: An Analysis of Family Life, their Community, and their Peers|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Children who come from homes where parents do not enforce positive behaviors and do not punish deviant behaviors appropriately, are children who are likely to engage in deviant behaviors. This type of bond is considered weak and cause the child to act out become deviant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crosswhite|first1=Jennifer M.|last2=Kerpelman|first2=Jennifer L.|title=Coercion Theory, Self-Control, and Social Information Processing: Understanding Potential Mediators for How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior|date=2009|pages=611–646}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

=== Peers ===
Strong bonds with Parents is essential to the social group that the child will choose to associate with. When there is little to no control in the home, no positive enforcement from Parents, and the child does not have positive feelings towards schooling and education; they are more likely to associate with deviant peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=Amber|title=How Parents Influence Deviant Behavior among Adolescents: An Analysis of Family Life, their Community, and their Peers|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; When associating with deviant peers, they are more accepting of deviant behaviors than if the child chose another social group. This is why it is vital the Parent-Child bond is strong because it will have an ultimate influence on the peers they choose and will have an influence on if they choose to engage in primary deviant behaviors as a juvenile.

== Sociological contributors ==

=== Frank Tannenbaum ===
[[File:Frank Tannenbaum 1915.jpg|thumb|'''&lt;u&gt;Frank Tannenbaum&lt;/u&gt;'''
]]
[[Frank Tannenbaum]], theorized that Primary Deviant behaviors may be innocent or fun for those committing the act, but can become a nuisance and viewed as some form of delinquency to their parents, educators and even those in law enforcement. Tannenbaum distinguished two different types of deviancy. The first one being the initial act which the child considers to be of innocence but are labeled as deviant by the adult, this label is called Primary Deviancy. The second is after they've been initially labeled that they graduate to [[Secondary deviance]] in which both the adult and child agree that they are a deviant. Tannenbaum stated that the "over dramatization" of these deviant acts can cause one to be labeled and accept the label of being a deviant. Due to them accepting this label, they will eventually graduate from being a primary deviant to a secondary deviant thus committing greater crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, et al|first1=Alex|title=Deviant Behavior|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|page=37|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==

=== Labeling Theory ===
[[File:George Herbert Mead.jpg|thumb|249x249px|'''&lt;u&gt;George Herbert Mead&lt;/u&gt;''']]
The most prevalent theory as it relates to Primary Deviance was developed in the early 1960s by a group of sociologists and was titled [[Labeling theory]]. The Labeling theory is a variant of Symbolic interactionism. [[Symbolic interactionism]] is "a theoretical approach in sociology developed by the famous [[George Herbert Mead]]. It emphasizes the roles of symbols and language as core elements of human interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Sociology|last=Giddens et al|first=Anthony|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92223-3|location=New York, New York|pages=A12|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labeling theory according to Labeling Theorists; is applied by those put in place to keep law and order, such as Police Officers, Judges; etc. Those are the people who typically label the people who have violated some law or another. The label 'Deviant' does not come from the person who has committed the act,but someone who is more powerful than the person being labeled. This theory has been tremendously criticized for not being able to explain what causes deviance early on. However, The Labeling Theory's main focus is to explain how Labeling relates and can cause [[Secondary deviance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, Taylor, Schwartz|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|pages=38–39|edition=11th|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anomie Theory ===
[[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]] developed the ''Anomie Theory'' which was dedicated specifically to the causes of deviance. The word [[Anomie]] was derived from the 'Godfather of Sociology' [[Emile Durkheim]]. Anomie is "the breakdown of social norms that results from society's urging people to be ambitious but failing to provide them with legitimate opportunities to succeed" ''&lt;ref name="Thio"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio, Taylor, Schwartz|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-20516-5|pages=17–18|edition=11th|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. Merton theorized that society places substantial emphasis on the importance of achieving success. However, this goal is not attainable for people of all social classes.Due to the absence of resources for people of lower social classes to achieve a great level of success, Merton theorized that people are forced to commit deviant acts. Merton has labeled the deviants behavior's as ''Innovation''&lt;ref name="Thio" /&gt;

=== Social Learning Theory ===
The Social Learning theory theorizes that deviant behavior is learned through Social Interactions with other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio|first1=Alex|last2=Taylor|first2=Jim|last3=Schwartz|first3=Martin|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=23–24|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Sutherland]] developed an explanation for this theory which explains how one learns deviant behavior. This explanation is called [[differential association]].

===Differential Association===
[[Differential Association]] theorizes that "If an individual associates with people who hold deviant ideas more than with people who embrace conventional ideas, the individual is likely to become deviant.&lt;ref name="Deviant Behavior"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thio|first1=Alex|last2=Taylor|first2=Jim|last3=Schwartz|first3=Martin|title=Deviant Behavior|publisher=Pearson Education|pages=24|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;" The person that is presenting the deviant act isn't always necessarily the deviant.  The emphasis of [[differential association]] is that if someone is presented with the opportunity they will likely commit the act.Although some one may associate with both deviants and those who hold conventional ideas, if the deviant contacts outweigh the conventional contacts then deviancy is likely to occur. [[Differential Association]]'s main key point refers particularly to the [[Association (psychology)|association]] aspect. [[Differential Association]] is theorized to be "the cause of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].&lt;ref name="Deviant Behavior"/&gt;

== Example of Primary Deviance ==

=== Charles Manson ===
[[File:CharlesManson2014.jpg|thumb|'''Charles Miles Manson''']]
A person who was labeled as deviant was the infamous murderer [[Charles Manson]]. Manson was born to a 16 year old [[Kathleen Maddox]] on November 12, 1934 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Manson's Father, Colonel Scott left Manson's mother to raise him alone. When Charles was seven years old, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle in [[McMechen, West Virginia]] after his mother was sentenced to 5 years in prison for  armed robbery. Living with his aunt and uncle, Manson was given a more stable life that could allow him to be a positive contributor to society. However, the absence of his mother and the yearning he had for that motherly love and affection caused Manson to indulge in primary deviant behavior at a young age, which ultimately manifested into secondary deviance as he became older.&lt;ref name="Sawyer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4qZB2ytq10|title=Charles Manson: Diane Sawyer Documentary|website=www.YouTube.com|last1=Manson|first1=Charles|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the counsel of another uncle, a "mountain man" who lived in the mountains of Kentucky, Manson labeled himself a rebel. Manson's first act of deviancy began at the age of 9 years old when he set his school on fire and was sent to reform school. Throughout his adolescent, Manson was sent to several reform schools in hopes of rehabilitating him. Between 1942 and 1947 after her release from prison, Manson's mother was unable to properly care for him and was unsuccessful in finding him a foster home. She turned him over to the courts and allowed them to place him in an all boys school called [[Gibault School for Boys]]. Ten months later, Manson ran away from the [[Gibault School for Boys]] in hopes of rekindling a relationship he had longed for with his mother. After she rejected him Manson turned to a life of deviancy. Manson thrived off of high-consensus deviant acts such as burglary and theft. Manson was then sent to [[Father Flanagan's Boys' Home]] in 1949. After 4 days at Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, Manson ran away and pursued other deviant acts; such as auto theft, burglary, and armed robbery. Manson ran away 18 times from the [[National Training School for Boys]] where he alleged he was molested and beaten. This behavior in Manson's early years, caused this label of deviant to shadow him through his adult life, where he eventually graduated to [[Secondary deviance]] and eventually led the dangerous cult The Manson Family.&lt;ref name="Sawyer" /&gt;

'''Property''', in the [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]], is what belongs to or with something, whether as an attribute or as a component of said thing. In the context of this article, it is one or more components (rather than attributes), whether [[Tangible property|physical]] or [[Intangible property|incorporeal]], of a person's [[Estate (law)|estate]]; or so belonging to, as in being [[Ownership|owned]] by, a person or jointly a group of people or a legal entity like a [[corporation]] or even a [[society]]. Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property has the right to [[Consumable|consume]], alter, [[Easement|share, redefine]], [[Renting|rent]], [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], [[Collateral (finance)|pawn]], [[Sales|sell]], [[Barter|exchange]], [[Transfer payment|transfer]], [[Gift|give away]] or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things,&lt;ref name="businessdict"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/property.html |title=property definition |work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanheritagedict"&gt;{{citation |title=American Heritage Dictionary |contribution=property |url=http://www.bartleby.com/cgi-bin/texis/webinator/sitesearch?FILTER=col61&amp;query=property&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{citation |title=WordNet |contribution=property |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=property&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to perhaps [[Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property|abandon]] it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a [[Durable good|durable]], [[Fixed investment|mean or factor]], or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it.

In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: [[private property]], [[public property]], and [[collective property]] (also called [[cooperative]] property).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century |year=2003 |last=Gregory |first=Paul R. |last2=Stuart |first2=Robert C. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0618261818 |pages=27 |quote=There are three broad forms of property ownership-private, public, and collective (cooperative).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally. However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent. The parties might expect their wills to be [[Unanimity|unanimous]], or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute.

The [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing. This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irma.ac.in/pdf/randp/1175_17402.pdf Pellissery, Sony and Dey Biswas, Sattwick (2012) Emerging Property Regimes In India: What It Holds For the Future of Socio-Economic Rights? IRMA Working Paper 234]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object. The distinction between "collective property" and "private property" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeber]], New York: Palgrave (2001) Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams. {{ISBN|978-0312240448}}  "... one might argue that property is a social relation as well, reified in exactly the same way: when one buys a car one is not really purchasing the right to use it so much as the right to prevent others from using it-or, to be even more precise, one is purchasing their recognition that one has the right to do so. But since it is so diffuse a social relation- a contract, in effect, between the owner and everyone else in the entire world-it is easy to think of it as a thing..." (p. 9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, Property in Anthropology, {{cite web |url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/en/research/d2/completed/property/moreinfo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116101316/http://www.eth.mpg.de/cms/en/research/d2/completed/property/moreinfo/ |archivedate=2015-01-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important widely recognized types of property include [[realty|real property]] (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), [[personal property]] (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and [[intellectual property]] (exclusive rights over artistic [[Gene theft#Property and Commercialization of Body Tissue|creations, inventions]], etc.), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-copyright]] advocates and other [[Criticism of intellectual property|critics of intellectual property]] dispute the concept of intellectual property.[http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts. A [[title (property)|title]], or a [[right]] of [[ownership]], establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Overview==

Often property is defined by the code of the local [[sovereignty]], and protected wholly or more usually partially by such entity, the owner being responsible for any remainder of protection. The [[Standard of proof|standards of proof]] concerning proofs of ownerships are also addressed by the code of the local sovereignty, and such entity plays a role accordingly, typically [[Recorder of deeds|somewhat managerial]]. Some philosophers{{who|date=April 2012}} assert that property [[rights]] arise from [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], while others find justifications for them in [[morality]] or in [[natural law]].

Various scholarly disciplines (such as [[law]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]] or [[sociology]]) may treat the concept more systematically, but definitions vary, most particularly when involving [[contract]]s. [[Positive law]] defines such rights, and the [[judiciary]] can adjudicate and enforce property rights.

According to [[Adam Smith]], the expectation of profit from "improving one's stock of capital" rests on private property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=Adam+Smith,+the+expectation+of+profit+from+%22improving+one%27s+stock+of+capital%22+rests+on+private+property+rights#v=onepage&amp;q=Adam%20Smith%2C%20the%20expectation%20of%20profit%20from%20%22improving%20one's%20stock%20of%20capital%22%20rests%20on%20private%20property%20rights&amp;f=false |title=Understanding the Global Economy, Howard Richards (p. 355) |publisher=Peace Education Books|isbn=978-0974896106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capitalism]] has as a central assumption that property rights encourage their holders to develop the property, generate [[wealth]], and efficiently allocate [[factors of production|resources]] based on the operation of markets.  From this has evolved the modern conception of property as a right enforced by positive law, in the expectation that this will produce more wealth and better standards of living. However, Smith also expressed a very critical view on the effects of property laws on inequality:

:: "Wherever there is great property, there is great inequality … Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |accessdate=2011-12-15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jH5bTCHDYTgC |title=An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations (p. 177) |publisher=Hackett Publishing Company|isbn=0872202046 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Adam Smith]], ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'')

In his text ''The Common Law'', [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] describes property as having two fundamental aspects. The first,  possession, can be defined as control over a resource based on the practical inability of another to contradict the ends of the possessor. The second, title, is the expectation that others will recognize rights to control resource, even when it is not in possession. He elaborates the differences between these two concepts, and proposes a history of how they came to be attached to persons, as opposed to families or to entities such as the church.
* [[Classical liberalism]] subscribes to the [[labor theory of property]]. They hold that individuals each own their own life, it follows that one must own the products of that life, and that those products can be traded in free exchange with others.

:: "Every man has a property in his own person. This nobody has a right to, but himself." ([[John Locke]], ''[[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'')

:: "The reason why men enter into society is the preservation of their property." ([[John Locke]], ''Second Treatise on Civil Government'')

:: "Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place." ([[Frédéric Bastiat]], ''[[The Law (1849 book)|The Law]]'')
* [[Conservatism]] subscribes to the concept that freedom and property are closely linked. That the more widespread the possession of private property, the more stable and productive is a state or nation.  Economic leveling of property, conservatives maintain, especially of the forced kind, is not economic progress.

:: "Separate property from private possession, and Leviathan becomes master of all... Upon the foundation of private property, great civilizations are built... The conservative acknowledges that the possession of property fixes certain duties upon the possessor; he accepts those moral and legal obligations cheerfully." ([[Russell Kirk]], ''The Politics of Prudence'')
* [[Socialism]]'s fundamental principles center on a critique of this concept, stating (among other things) that the cost of defending property exceeds the returns from private property ownership, and that, even when property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth, they do so only for their own benefit, which may not coincide with benefit to other people or to society at large.
* [[Libertarian socialism]] generally accepts property rights, but with a short abandonment period. In other words, a person must make (more-or-less) continuous use of the item or else lose ownership rights. This is usually referred to as "possession property" or "[[usufruct]]". Thus, in this usufruct system, absentee ownership is illegitimate and workers own the machines or other equipment that they work with.
* [[Communism]] argues that only collective ownership of the [[means of production]] through a [[Body politic|polity]] (though not necessarily a [[State (polity)|state]]) will assure the minimization of unequal or unjust outcomes and the maximization of benefits, and that therefore humans should abolish private ownership of [[capital (economics)|capital]] (as opposed to property).

Both communism and some kinds of socialism have also upheld the notion that private ownership of capital is inherently illegitimate. This argument centers mainly on the idea that private ownership of capital always benefits one [[Social class|class]] over another, giving rise to domination through the use of this privately owned capital. Communists do not oppose personal property that is "hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned" (as the [[Communist Manifesto]] puts it) by members of the [[proletariat]]. Both socialism and communism distinguish carefully between private ownership of capital (land, factories, resources, etc.) and private property (homes, material objects and so forth).

=== Types of property ===
Most [[legal system]]s distinguish between different types of property, especially between land ([[immovable property]], [[estate in land]], [[real estate]], [[real property]]) and all other forms of property—goods and [[Personal property|chattels]], [[movable property]] or [[personal property]], including the [[Face value|value of legal tender]] if not the [[Legal tender|legal tender itself]], as the [[Currency#Control and production|manufacturer]] rather than the possessor might be the owner. They often distinguish [[tangible property|tangible]] and [[intangible property]]. One categorization scheme specifies three species of property: land, improvements (immovable man-made things), and personal property (movable man-made things).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In [[common law]], [[real property]] ([[immovable property]]) is the combination of [[Rights|interests]] in land and improvements thereto, and [[personal property]] is interest in movable property. Real property rights are rights relating to the land.  These rights include ownership and usage. Owners can grant rights to persons and entities in the form of [[lease]]s, [[license]]s and [[easement]]s.

Throughout the last centuries of the [[2nd millennium|second millennium]], with the development of more complex theories of property, the concept of personal property had become divided{{By whom|date=May 2013}} into tangible property (such as [[Automobile|cars]] and [[clothing]]) and intangible property (such as [[financial instrument]]s, including [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]; [[intellectual property]], including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s; [[digital file]]s; [[communication channel]]s; and certain forms of [[identifier]], including [[domain name|Internet domain names]], some forms of [[network address]], some forms of [[Call sign|handle]] and again trademarks).

Treatment of intangible property is such that an article of property is, by law or otherwise by traditional conceptualization, subject to expiration even when [[Inheritance|inheritable]], which is a key distinction from tangible property. Upon expiration, the property, if of the intellectual category, becomes a part of [[public domain]], to be used by but not owned by anybody, and possibly used by more than one party simultaneously due the inapplicability of [[scarcity]] to intellectual property. Whereas things such as communications channels and pairs of electromagnetic spectrum band and signal transmission power can only be used by a single party at a time, or a single party in a divisible context, if owned or used at all. Thus far or usually those are not considered property, or at least not private property, even though the party bearing right of exclusive use may transfer that right to another.

==Issues in property theory==

=== What can be property? ===
The two major justifications given for original property, or the [[homestead principle]], are '''effort''' and '''scarcity'''. [[John Locke]] emphasized effort, "mixing your labor"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.htm |title=John Locke: Second Treatise of Civil Government: Chapter 5 |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an object, or clearing and cultivating virgin land. [[Benjamin Tucker]] preferred to look at the [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] of property, i.e. What is the purpose of property?  His answer: to solve the scarcity problem.  Only when items are relatively scarce with respect to people's desires do they become property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/ch6intpr.html |title=News – WendyMcElroy.com |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706115752/http://www.zetetics.com/mac/libdebates/ch6intpr.html |archivedate=6 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, hunter-gatherers did not consider land to be property, since there was no shortage of land.  Agrarian societies later made arable land property, as it was scarce.  For something to be economically scarce it must necessarily have the ''exclusivity property''—that use by one person excludes others from using it.  These two justifications lead to different conclusions on what can be property. [[Intellectual property]]—incorporeal things like ideas, plans, orderings and arrangements (musical compositions, novels, computer programs)—are generally considered valid property to those who support an effort justification, but invalid to those who support a scarcity justification, since the things don't have the exclusivity property (however, those who support a scarcity justification may still support other "intellectual property" laws such as [[Copyright]], as long as these are a subject of [[contract]] instead of government arbitration). Thus even ardent [[propertarian]]s may disagree about IP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://praxeology.net/anticopyright.htm |title=Molinari Institute – Anti-Copyright Resources |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By either standard, one's body is one's property.

From some [[anarchism|anarchist]] points of view, the validity of property depends on whether the "property right" requires enforcement by the state.  Different forms of "property" require different amounts of enforcement: [[intellectual property]] requires a great deal of state intervention to enforce, ownership of distant physical property requires quite a lot, ownership of carried objects requires very little, while ownership of one's own body requires absolutely no state intervention. Some [[anarchism|anarchists]] don't believe in property at all.

Many things have existed that did not have an [[owner]], sometimes called the [[commons]].  The term "commons," however, is also often used to mean something quite different: "general collective ownership"—i.e. [[common ownership]]. Also, the same term is sometimes used by [[Statism|statists]] to mean government-owned property that the general public is allowed to access ([[public property]]).  Law in all societies has tended to develop towards reducing the number of things not having clear owners. Supporters of property rights argue that this enables better protection of scarce resources, due to the [[tragedy of the commons]], while critics argue that it leads to the 'exploitation' of those resources for personal gain and that it hinders taking advantage of potential [[network effects]].  These arguments have differing validity for different types of "property"—things that are not scarce are, for instance, not subject to the [[tragedy of the commons]].  Some apparent critics advocate general collective ownership rather than ownerlessness.

Things that do not have owners include: [[idea]]s (except for [[intellectual property]]), [[seawater]] (which is, however, protected by anti-pollution laws), parts of the [[seafloor]] (see the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] for restrictions), gases in [[Earth's atmosphere]], animals in the wild (although in most nations, animals are tied to the land.  In the United States and Canada wildlife are generally defined in statute as property of the state.  This public ownership of wildlife is referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is based on The Public Trust Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?id=171&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |title=The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and Public Trust Doctrine |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2012-08-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119010211/http://joomla.wildlife.org/index.php?id=171&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), celestial bodies and outer space, and land in [[Antarctica]].

The nature of children under the [[age of majority]] is another contested issue here.  In ancient societies children were generally considered the property of their parents.  Children in most modern societies theoretically own their own bodies but are not considered competent to exercise their rights, and their parents or [[legal guardian|guardians]] are given most of the actual rights of control over them.

Questions regarding the nature of ownership of the body also come up in the issue of [[abortion]], [[drugs]] and [[euthanasia]].

In many ancient legal systems (e.g. early [[Roman law]]), religious sites (e.g. [[temple]]s) were considered property of the [[God]] or gods they were devoted to. However, [[religious pluralism]] makes it more convenient to have religious sites owned by the [[religious body]] that runs them.

[[Intellectual property]] and air ([[airspace]], [[no-fly zone]], pollution laws, which can include tradable [[emissions trading|emissions rights]]) can be property in some senses of the word.

Ownership of land can be held separately from the ownership of rights over that land, including sporting rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basc.org.uk/media/2001_definition_of_sporting_rights.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227003852/http://www.basc.org.uk/media/2001_definition_of_sporting_rights.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mineral rights]], development rights, [[air rights]], and such other rights as may be worth segregating from simple land ownership.

=== Who can be an owner? ===
{{Main article|Ownership}}
Ownership laws may vary widely among countries depending on the nature of the property of interest (e.g. firearms, real property, personal property, animals). Persons can own property directly. In most societies [[Juristic person|legal entities]], such as [[corporations]], [[Trust law|trusts]] and nations (or governments) own property.

In many countries women have limited access to property following restrictive inheritance and family laws, under which only men have actual or formal rights to own property.

In the Inca empire, the dead emperors, who were considered gods, still controlled property after death.&lt;ref&gt;Mckay, John P. , 2004, "A History of World Societes". Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whether and to what extent the state may interfere with property===
Under [[United States]] law the principal limitations on whether and the extent to which the State may interfere with property rights are set by the Constitution. The "Takings" clause requires that the government (whether state or federal—for the 14th Amendment's due process clause imposes the 5th Amendment's takings clause on state governments) may take private property only for a public purpose, after exercising due process of law, and upon making "just compensation." If an interest is not deemed a "property" right or the conduct is merely an intentional tort, these limitations do not apply and the doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]] precludes relief.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]'' (not a property right because force of law not behind it); ''[[Schillinger v. United States]]'', 155 U.S. 163 (1894) (patent infringement is tort, not taking of property); ''Zoltek Corp. v. United States'', 442 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the interference does not almost completely make the property valueless, the interference will not be deemed a taking but instead a mere regulation of use.&lt;ref&gt;''Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York'', 438 U.S. 104 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some governmental regulations of property use have been deemed so severe that they have been considered "[[regulatory taking]]s."&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes'', 474 U.S. 121 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, conduct sometimes deemed only a nuisance or other tort has been held a taking of property where the conduct was sufficiently persistent and severe.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Causby'', 328 U.S. 256 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==

There exist many theories of property. One is the relatively rare [[first possession theory of property]], where ownership of something is seen as justified simply by someone seizing something before someone else does.&lt;ref&gt;"Property". Graham Oppy. ''The shorter Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy''. Editor [[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Edward Craig]]. Routledge, 2005, p. 858&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the most popular is the [[natural rights]] definition of property rights as advanced by [[John Locke]]. Locke advanced the theory that God granted dominion over nature to man through Adam in the book of Genesis.  Therefore, he theorized that when one mixes one’s labor with nature, one gains a relationship with that part of nature with which the labor is mixed, subject to the limitation that there should be "enough, and as good, left in common for others." (see [[Lockean proviso]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Second Treatise of Civil Government |year=1690 |first=John |last=Locke |url=http://www.constitution.org/jl/2ndtr05.txt |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the RERUM NOVARUM, [[Pope Leo XIII]] wrote "It is surely undeniable that, when a man engages in remunerative labor, the impelling reason and motive of his work is to obtain property, and thereafter to hold it as his very own."

Anthropology studies the diverse systems of ownership, rights of use and transfer, and possession&lt;ref&gt;Hann, Chris ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=14 A new double movement? Anthropological perspectives on property in the age of neoliberalism]'' Socio-Economic Review, Volume 5, Number 2, April 2007, pp. 287–318(32)&lt;/ref&gt; under the term "theories of property." Western legal theory is based, as mentioned, on the owner of property being a legal person. However, not all property systems are founded on this basis.

In every culture studied ownership and possession are the subject of custom and regulation, and "law" where the term can meaningfully be applied. Many tribal cultures balance individual ownership with the laws of collective groups: tribes, families, associations and nations. For example, the 1839 Cherokee Constitution frames the issue in these terms:

{{quote|Sec. 2.  The lands of the Cherokee Nation shall remain common property; but the improvements made thereon, and in the possession of the citizens respectively who made, or may rightfully be in possession of them:  Provided, that the citizens of the Nation possessing exclusive and indefeasible right to their improvements, as expressed in this article, shall possess no right or power to dispose of their improvements, in any manner whatever, to the United States, individual States, or to individual citizens thereof; and that, whenever any citizen shall remove with his effects out of the limits of this Nation, and become a citizen of any other government, all his rights and privileges as a citizen of this Nation shall cease:  Provided, nevertheless, That the National Council shall have power to re-admit, by law, to all the rights of citizenship, any such person or persons who may, at any time, desire to return to the Nation, on memorializing the National Council for such readmission.}}

Communal property systems describe ownership as belonging to the entire social and political unit. Such arrangements can under certain conditions erode open access resources. This development has been critiqued by the [[tragedy of the commons]].

Corporate systems describe ownership as being attached to an identifiable group with an identifiable responsible individual. The Roman property law was based on such a corporate system.  In a well-known paper that contributed to the creation of the field of [[law and economics]] in the late 1960s, the American scholar [[Harold Demsetz]] described how the concept of property rights makes social interactions easier:

{{Quote
|text=In the world of [[Robinson Crusoe]] property rights play no role.  Property rights are an instrument of society and derive their significance from the fact that they help a man form those expectations which he can reasonably hold in his dealings with others.  These expectations find expression in the laws, customs, and mores of a society.  An owner of property rights possesses the consent of fellowmen to allow him to act in particular ways.  An owner expects the community to prevent others from interfering with his actions, provided that these actions are not prohibited in the specifications of his rights.
|author=Harold Demsetz (1967)

}}

Different societies may have different theories of property for differing types of ownership. [[Pauline Peters]] argued that property systems are not isolable from the social fabric, and notions of property may not be stated as such, but instead may be framed in negative terms: for example the taboo system among Polynesian peoples.

== Property in philosophy ==
In [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]] the term "property" essentially referred to land. After much rethinking, land has come to be regarded as only a special case of the property genus. This rethinking was inspired by at least three broad features of early modern Europe: the surge of commerce, the breakdown of efforts to prohibit [[interest]] (then called "[[usury]]"), and the development of centralized national [[monarchy|monarchies]].

=== Ancient philosophy ===
[[Urukagina]], the king of the [[Sumer]]ian city-state [[Lagash]], established the first laws that forbade compelling the sale of property.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Noah Kramer]]. ''From the Tablets of Sumer: Twenty-Five Firsts in Man's Recorded History.'' Indian Hills: The Falcon's Wing Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ten Commandments]] shown in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 stated that the [[Israelites]] were not to steal, but the connection between Bronze Age concepts of theft and modern concepts of property is suspect.

[[Aristotle]], in ''Politics,'' advocates "private property." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/pipes-property.html|title=Property and Freedom|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He argues that self-interest leads to neglect of the commons. "[T]hat which is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Every one thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all of the common interest; and only when he is himself concerned as an individual."{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;This bears some similarities to the over-use argument of Garrett Hardin's "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition he says that when property is common, there are natural problems that arise due to differences in labor: "If they do not share equally enjoyments and toils, those who labor much and get little will necessarily complain of those who labor little and receive or consume much. But indeed there is always a difficulty in men living together and having all human relations in common, but especially in their having common property." ([http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH19C/tutorial10.html ''Politics, 1261b34''])

[[Cicero]] held that there is no private property under [[natural law]] but only under [[human law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=121 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/122/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}  citing Cicero, [[De officiis]], i. 7, "Sunt autem privata nulla natura".&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] viewed property as only becoming necessary when men become avarice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=122 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/122/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}} citing Seneca, Epistles, xiv, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[St. Ambrose]] latter adopted this view and [[St. Augustine]] even derided heretics for complaining the Emperor could not confiscate property they had labored for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=125 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/125/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval philosophy ===

==== Thomas Aquinas (13th century) ====
The canon law ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' maintained that mere human law creates property, repeating the phrases used by St. Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=127 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/127/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}  citing Decretum, D. viii. Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] agreed with regard to the private consumption of property but modified patristic theory in finding that the private possession of property is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carlyle |first1=A.J. |title=Property: Its Duties and Rights |date=1913 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=128 |url=https://archive.org/stream/propertyitsdutie00gorerich#page/128/mode/1up |accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas Aquinas concludes that, given certain detailed provisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3066.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Theft and robbery (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 66) |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* it is natural for man to possess external things
* it is lawful for a man to possess a thing as his own
* the essence of theft consists in taking another's thing secretly
* theft and robbery are sins of different species, and robbery is a more grievous sin than theft
* theft is a sin; it is also a [[mortal sin]]
* it is, however, lawful to steal through stress of need: ''"in cases of need all things are common property."''

===Modern philosophy===

==== Thomas Hobbes (17th century) ====
The principal writings of [[Thomas Hobbes]] appeared between 1640 and 1651—during and immediately following [[First English Civil War|the war between forces]] loyal to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and those loyal to [[Parliament]]. In his own words, Hobbes' reflection began with the idea of "giving to every man his own," a phrase he drew from the writings of [[Cicero]]. But he wondered: How can anybody call anything his own? He concluded: My own can only truly be mine if there is one unambiguously strongest power in the realm, and that power treats it as mine, protecting its status as such.&lt;ref&gt;"The Origin of Property". Anti Essays. 27 May 2012, &lt;http://www.antiessays.com/free-essays/226947.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== James Harrington (17th century) ====

A contemporary of Hobbes, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], reacted to the same tumult in a different way: he considered property natural but not inevitable. The author of ''[[Oceana (book)|Oceana]]'', he may have been the first political theorist to postulate that political power is a consequence, not the cause, of the distribution of property. He said that the worst possible situation is one in which the commoners have half a nation's property, with crown and nobility holding the other half—a circumstance fraught with instability and violence. A much better situation (a stable republic) will exist once the commoners own most property, he suggested.

In later years, the ranks of Harrington's admirers included American revolutionary and founder [[John Adams]].

==== Robert Filmer (17th century) ====

Another member of the Hobbes/Harrington generation, Sir [[Robert Filmer]], reached conclusions much like Hobbes', but through [[Biblical]] [[exegesis]]. Filmer said that the institution of kingship is analogous to that of fatherhood, that subjects are but children, whether obedient or unruly, and that property rights are akin to the household goods that a father may dole out among his children—his to take back and dispose of according to his pleasure.

==== John Locke (17th century) ====

In the following generation, [[John Locke]] sought to answer Filmer, creating a rationale for a balanced [[constitution]] in which the monarch had a part to play, but not an overwhelming part. Since Filmer's views essentially require that the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] family be uniquely descended from the [[patriarchs]] of the [[Bible]], and since even in the late 17th century that was a difficult view to uphold, Locke attacked Filmer's views in his [[Two Treatises of Government#First Treatise|First Treatise on Government]], freeing him to set out his own views in the [[Second Treatise on Civil Government]]. Therein, Locke imagined a pre-social world, each of the unhappy residents of which are willing to create a [[social contract]] because otherwise "the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure," and therefore the "great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. IX, §§&amp;nbsp;123–124.&lt;/ref&gt; They would, he allowed, create a [[monarchy]], but its task would be to execute the will of an elected legislature. "To this end" (to achieve the previously specified goal), he wrote, "it is that men give up all their natural power to the society they enter into, and the community put the [[legislative power]] into such hands as they think fit, with this trust, that they shall be governed by declared laws, or else their peace, quiet, and property will still be at the same uncertainty as it was in the [[state of nature]]."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. XI, §&amp;nbsp;136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when it keeps to proper legislative form, though, Locke held that there are limits to what a government established by such a contract might rightly do.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases..."&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''The Second Treatise of Civil Government'' (1690), Chap. XI, §&amp;nbsp;137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that both "persons ''and'' estates" are to be protected from the arbitrary power of any magistrate, inclusive of the "power and will of a legislator." In Lockean terms, depredations against an estate are just as plausible a justification for resistance and revolution as are those against persons. In neither case are subjects required to allow themselves to become prey.

To explain the ownership of property Locke advanced a [[labor theory of property]].

==== David Hume (18th century) ====

In contrast to the figures discussed in this section thus far [[David Hume]] lived a relatively quiet life that had settled down to a relatively stable social and political structure. He lived the life of a solitary writer until 1763 when, at 52 years of age, he went off to [[Paris]] to work at the British embassy.

In contrast, one might think, to his polemical works on [[religion]] and his [[empiricism]]-driven [[philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] [[epistemology]], Hume's views on law and property were quite conservative.

He did not believe in hypothetical contracts, or in the love of mankind in general, and sought to ground politics upon actual human beings as one knows them. "In general," he wrote, "it may be affirmed that there is no such passion in human mind, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, or services, or of relation to ourselves." Existing customs should not lightly be disregarded, because they have come to be what they are as a result of human nature. With this endorsement of custom comes an endorsement of existing governments, because he conceived of the two as complementary: "A regard for [[liberty]], though a laudable passion, ought commonly to be subordinate to a reverence for established [[government]]."

Therefore, Hume's view was that there are property rights because of and to the extent that the existing law, supported by social customs, secure them.&lt;ref&gt;This view is reflected in the opinion of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Willow River Power Co.]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered some practical home-spun advice on the general subject, though, as when he referred to [[avarice]] as "the spur of [[industry]]," and expressed concern about excessive levels of taxation, which "destroy industry, by engendering despair."

====Adam Smith====
{{quote|"Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is, in reality, instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor, or of those who have property against those who have none at all."| [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', 1776&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', by [[Adam Smith]], Cooke &amp; Hale, 1818, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"The property which every man has in his own labour, as it is the original foundation of all other property, so it is the most sacred and inviolable. The patrimony of a poor man lies in the strength and dexterity of his hands; and to hinder him from employing this strength and dexterity in what manner he thinks proper without injury to his neighbour, is a plain violation of this most sacred property. It is a manifest encroachment upon the just liberty both of the workman, and of those who might be disposed to employ him. As it hinders the one from working at what he thinks proper, so it hinders the others from employing whom they think proper. To judge whether he is fit to be employed, may surely be trusted to the discretion of the employers whose interest it so much concerns. The affected anxiety of the law-giver lest they should employ an improper person, is evidently as impertinent as it is oppressive."
— (Source: [[Adam Smith]], ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', 1776, Book I, Chapter X, Part II.)

By the mid 19th century, the industrial revolution had transformed England and the United States, and had begun in France. The established conception of what constitutes property expanded beyond land to encompass scarce goods in general. In France, the revolution of the 1790s had led to large-scale confiscation of land formerly owned by church and king. The restoration of the monarchy led to claims by those dispossessed to have their former lands returned.

====Karl Marx====

Section VIII, "[[Primitive accumulation of capital|Primitive Accumulation]]" of Capital involves a critique of Liberal Theories of property rights. Marx notes that under Feudal Law, peasants were legally as entitled to their land as the aristocracy was to its manors. Marx cites several historical events in which large numbers of the peasantry were removed from their lands, which were then seized by the aristocracy. This seized land was then used for commercial ventures (sheep heading). Marx sees this "Primitive Accumulation as integral to the creation of English Capitalism. This event created a large unlanded class which had to work for wages in order to survive. Marx asserts that Liberal theories of property are "idyllic" fairy tales that hide a violent historical process.

==== Charles Comte – legitimate origin of property ====

[[Charles Comte]], in ''Traité de la propriété'' (1834), attempted to justify the legitimacy of private property in response to the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Bourbon Restoration]]. According to David Hart, Comte had three main points: "firstly, that interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity; secondly, that property is legitimate when it emerges in such a way as not to harm anyone; and thirdly, that historically some, but by no means all, property which has evolved has done so legitimately, with the implication that the present distribution of property is a complex mixture of legitimately and illegitimately held titles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/ComteDunoyer/Ch6.html#RTFToC4 ''The Radical Liberalism of Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130070015/http://homepage.mac.com/dmhart/ComteDunoyer/Ch6.html |date=2006-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte, as Proudhon later did, rejected [[Roman law|Roman legal tradition]] with its toleration of slavery. He posited a communal "national" property consisting of non-scarce goods, such as land in ancient hunter-gatherer societies. Since agriculture was so much more efficient than hunting and gathering, private property appropriated by someone for farming left remaining hunter-gatherers with more land per person, and hence did not harm them. Thus this type of land appropriation did not violate the [[Lockean proviso]] – there was "still enough, and as good left." Comte's analysis would be used by later theorists in response to the socialist critique on property.

==== Pierre Proudhon – property is theft ====
{{Main article|What is Property?|Property is theft!}}

In his 1840 treatise ''[[What is Property?]]'', [[Pierre Proudhon]] answers with "[[Property is theft!]]" In natural resources, he sees two types of property, ''de jure'' property (legal title) and ''de facto'' property (physical possession), and argues that the former is illegitimate.  Proudhon's conclusion is that "property, to be just and possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition."

His analysis of the product of labor upon natural resources as property (usufruct) is more nuanced. He asserts that land itself cannot be property, yet it should be held by individual possessors as stewards of mankind with the product of labor being the property of the producer. Proudhon reasoned that any wealth gained without labor was stolen from those who labored to create that wealth. Even a voluntary contract to surrender the product of labor to an employer was theft, according to Proudhon, since the controller of natural resources had no moral right to charge others for the use of that which he did not labor to create and therefore did not own.

Proudhon's theory of property greatly influenced the budding socialist movement, inspiring anarchist theorists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who modified Proudhon's ideas, as well as antagonizing theorists like [[Karl Marx]].

==== Frédéric Bastiat – property is value ====

[[Frédéric Bastiat]]'s main treatise on property can be found in chapter 8 of his book ''Economic Harmonies'' (1850).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bastiat: Economic Harmonies |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a radical departure from traditional property theory, he defines property not as a physical object, but rather as a relationship between people with respect to an object. Thus, saying one owns a glass of water is merely verbal shorthand for ''I may justly gift or trade this water to another person''. In essence, what one owns is not the object but the value of the object.  By "value," Bastiat apparently means ''market value''; he emphasizes that this is quite different from utility. ''"In our relations with one another, we are not owners of the utility of things, but of their value, and value is the appraisal made of reciprocal services."''

Bastiat theorized that, as a result of technological progress and the division of labor, the stock of communal wealth increases over time; that the hours of work an unskilled laborer expends to buy e.g. 100 liters of wheat decreases over time, thus amounting to "gratis" satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php?title=79&amp;chapter=35530&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=Economic Harmonies (Boyers trans.) – Online Library of Liberty |publisher= |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, private property continually destroys itself, becoming transformed into communal wealth. The increasing proportion of communal wealth to private property results in a tendency toward equality of mankind. ''"Since the human race started from the point of greatest poverty, that is, from the point where there were the most obstacles to be overcome, it is clear that all that has been gained from one era to the next has been due to the spirit of property."''

This transformation of private property into the communal domain, Bastiat points out, does not imply that private property will ever totally disappear. This is because man, as he progresses, continually invents new and more sophisticated needs and desires.

==== Andrew J. Galambos – a precise definition of property ====

[[Andrew Joseph Galambos|Andrew J. Galambos]] (1924–1997) was an astrophysicist and philosopher who innovated a social structure that seeks to maximize human peace and freedom. Galambos’ concept of property was basic to his philosophy. He defined property as a man’s life and all non-procreative derivatives of his life. (Because the English language is deficient in omitting the feminine from “man” when referring to humankind, it is implicit and obligatory that the feminine is included in the term “man”.)

Galambos taught that property is essential to a non-coercive social structure. That is why he defined freedom as follows: “Freedom is the societal condition that exists when every individual has full (100%) control over his own property.”&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 868–869. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Galambos defines property as having the following elements:
* '''Primordial property''', which is an individual’s life
* '''Primary property''', which includes ideas, thoughts, and actions
* '''Secondary property''', which includes all tangible and intangible possessions which are derivatives of the individual's primary property.

Property includes all non-procreative derivatives of an individual’s life; this means children are not the property of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. p. 23. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and "primary property" (a person's own ideas).&lt;ref&gt;Galambos, Andrew (1999). Sic Itur Ad Astra. San Diego, California: The Universal Scientific Publications Company, Inc. pp. 39, 52, 84, 92–93, 153, 201, 326. {{ISBN|0880780045}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galambos emphasized repeatedly that true government exists to protect property and that the state attacks property.
For example, the state requires payment for its services in the form of taxes whether or not people desire such services. Since an individual’s money is his property, the confiscation of money in the form of taxes is an attack on property. Military conscription is likewise an attack on a person’s primordial property.

===Contemporary views===

Contemporary political thinkers who believe that natural persons enjoy rights to own property and to enter into contracts espouse two views about John Locke. On the one hand, some admire Locke, such as [[William Harold Hutt|W.H. Hutt]] (1956), who praised Locke for laying down the "quintessence of individualism". On the other hand, those such as [[Richard Pipes]] regard Locke's arguments as weak, and think that undue reliance thereon has weakened the cause of individualism in recent times. Pipes has written that Locke's work "marked a regression because it rested on the concept of [[Natural Law]]" rather than upon Harrington's sociological framework.

[[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] has argued that an important characteristic of capitalist market economy is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal [[property system]] which clearly records ownership and transactions. These property rights and the whole formal system of property make possible:
* Greater independence for individuals from local community arrangements to protect their assets
* Clear, provable, and protectable ownership
* The standardization and integration of property rules and property information in a country as a whole
* Increased trust arising from a greater certainty of punishment for cheating in economic transactions
* More formal and complex written statements of ownership that permit the easier assumption of shared risk and ownership in companies, and insurance against risk
* Greater availability of [https://indianmoney.com/loan-against-property loans] for new projects, since more things can serve as collateral for the loans
* Easier access to and more reliable information regarding such things as credit history and the worth of assets
* Increased [[fungibility]], standardization and transferability of statements documenting the ownership of property, which paves the way for structures such as national markets for companies and the easy transportation of property through complex networks of individuals and other entities
* Greater protection of biodiversity due to minimizing of [[shifting agriculture]] practices

All of the above, according to de Soto, enhance [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/03/desoto.htm |title=Finance &amp; Development, March 2001 – The Mystery of Capital |work=Finance and Development – F&amp;D |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandra Laing''' (born 1955) is a [[South Africa]]n woman who was classified as [[coloureds|coloured]] by authorities during the [[apartheid]] era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although she was the child of at least three generations of ancestors who had been regarded as [[White_South_African|white]]. At the age of 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her appearance disrupted her family and adult life.

Laing was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', directed by Anthony Fabian, which won numerous awards.&lt;ref name="Skin movie official website"&gt;[http://www.skinthemovie.net ''Skin'' movie official website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;Greview&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/multimedia/2010-01-21-iskini-movie-review ''Skin'' film review], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 21 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she is the subject of the documentaries ''In Search of Sandra Laing'' (1977), directed by [[Antony Thomas|Anthony Thomas]] for the [[BBC]], which was banned by the apartheid government of the time,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2944922.stm "Black Afrikaner" story to become film], BBC News, 29 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey'' (2000), and ''Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing'' (2009).

==Early life==
Sandra Laing was born in 1955 to Sannie and Abraham Laing, [[Afrikaner]]s in [[Piet Retief, Mpumalanga|Piet Retief]], a small conservative town in South Africa during the [[apartheid]] era, when laws governed officially established social castes of racial classification. She had darker skin than other members of her family, which seemed to become more obvious as she grew older. Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all white, but Sandra displayed the physiognomy of African ancestors of earlier generations, perhaps from the 18th century or more recent.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; Her family treated her as white, the same as their sons Adriaan and Leon, and together they all attended the Dutch Reformed Church.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

When Laing was 10 years old and at an all-white boarding school, the school authorities expelled her&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; because of complaints from the parents of other students, based on her appearance: primarily her skin colour and the texture of her hair. They believed she was "coloured", a term for mixed-race people.&lt;ref name=under&gt;{{cite news|title=Apartheid got under her skin|author=Kim Hawkey|date=10 January 2010|work=Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was expelled and escorted home by two police officers.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Sandra's parents fought several legal battles to have her classified as white, based on her documented ancestry through them. Her father underwent a blood-typing test for [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]] in the 1960s, as [[DNA tests]] were not yet available. The results were compatible with his being her biological father, though such tests are extremely imprecise due to the small number of blood types that most people have.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/mar/17/features11.g2|title=The black woman - with white parents|author=[[Rory Carroll]]|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=17 March 2003|location=London|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093674/The-tragic-story-white-girl-born-black-tore-family-apart.html|title=The Tragic Story of How a White Girl Being Born Black Tore a Family Apart|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=16 August 2011|location=London|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After the publicity, Laing found herself shunned by the white community, although she was re-classified as white again in 1966 when the law was changed to allow a person to be classified as white if both parents are classified as white. She attended a coloured boarding school away from her family and became immersed in the non-white world. Her only friends were the children of black employees. At the age of 16, Laing eloped to [[Swaziland]] with Petrus Zwane, a black South African who spoke Zulu. She was jailed for three months for illegal border-crossing. Her father threatened to kill her for the marriage and broke off contact with her. They never met again.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Although she and her husband had two children, who were classified as "coloured", she was threatened with losing them unless she also was classified as "coloured", as a white parent could not raise coloured children. At the age of 26, she arranged for the change in race classification officially, although her father had refused permission earlier. Except for secret trips to see her mother when her father was out of the house, Laing was estranged from her family and struggled to survive economically.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; When her parents moved away from Piet Retief, the clandestine visits were no longer possible. Laing lost contact with her family completely. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Laing and her husband separated due to the pressures they were under, and she put their children into government care for a period. Years later she married again, to Johannes Motloung, a Sotho-speaking man. They had three children together and she was able to reclaim her first two; all are now grown and with families of their own. Trying to reconcile with her family in the 1980s, Laing learned that her father had died and her mother Sannie refused to see her.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

In 2000 the ''[[Johannesburg Times]]'' tracked down Laing to learn about her years since the end of apartheid. The newspaper helped her find her mother, and they were able to reconcile. Sannie was then in a nursing home. Sannie and the two shared time together before her mother's death in 2001.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

The publicity helped Laing, her husband and family gain new housing; they now live in Leachville, new estates east of Johannesburg. In 2009, it was reported that Laing's brothers still refused to see her.&lt;ref name="little"/&gt; She has said in interviews with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''Little White Lies'' that she continued to hope they would some day have a change of heart.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="little"&gt;[http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/sandra-laing-6079 Sophie Ivan, "Sandra Laing: profile and photo"], ''Little White Lies'', 24 July 2009, accessed 6 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scope neglect''' or '''scope insensitivity''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when the valuation of a problem is not valued with a multiplicative relationship to its size. Scope neglect is a specific form of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Choices, Values and Frames|year=2000|pages=708|authorlink=Daniel Kahneman|editor=Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Eds.)|chapter=Evaluation by moments, past and future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, respondents were asked how much they were willing to pay to prevent migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds by covering the oil ponds with protective nets. Subjects were told that either 2,000, or 20,000, or 200,000 migrating birds were affected annually, for which subjects reported they were willing to pay $80, $78 and $88 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rti.org/pubs/bk-0001-1009_web.pdf |doi=10.3768/rtipress.2009.bk.0001.1009 |last1=Desvouges|first1=William F.|first2=Reed|last2=Johnson|first3=Richard|last3=Dunford|first4=Kevin|last4=Boyle|first5=Sarah|last5=Hudson|first6=K. Nicole|last6=Wilson|title=Measuring Non-Use Damages Using Contingent Valuation: An Experimental Evaluation of Accuracy|journal=Research Triangle Institute Monograph|year=1992|volume=92-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of willingness-to-pay to prevent harm have found a [[logarithm]]ic relationship or no relationship to scope size.&lt;ref name="ksr"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~deutsch/geog111_211a/papers/Kahneman%20on%20attitude%20and%20affection.pdf | last1=Kahneman|first1=Daniel|last2=Ritov|first2=Ilana|last3=Schkade|first3=Daniel|title=Economic Preferences or Attitude Expressions?: An Analysis of Dollar Responses to Public Issues|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|year=1999|volume=19|pages=203–235|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-1406-8_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Kahneman]] explains scope neglect in terms of [[judgment by prototype]], a refinement of the [[representativeness heuristic]]. "The story [...] probably evokes for many readers a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape,"&lt;ref name="krs"&gt;p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; and subjects based their willingness-to-pay mostly on that mental image.

[[File:Agent William's Car.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An FBI agent's bullet-riddled car after the [[1975 Pine Ridge shootout]].]]

A '''shootout''', also called a '''firefight''' or '''gunfight''', is a [[gun]] battle between armed groups. A shootout often, but not necessarily, pits [[law enforcement]] against [[criminal]] elements; it could also involve two groups outside of law enforcement, such as rival gangs. A shootout in a [[war]]-like context (i.e. regularly constituted [[armed forces]] or even [[guerrilla]] or [[insurgent]] forces) would usually be considered a '''[[battle]]''' (depending on size), rather than a ''shootout''. Shootouts are often portrayed in [[action film]]s and [[Western (genre)|Western films]].

==Famous shootouts in the United States and territories==

===The Greatest Shootout in the West===
On December 19, 1854, while trekking on a miner's trail along the North Fork of the [[American River]], Dr. Bolivar Sparks, James McDonald and [[Jonathan R. Davis|Captain Jonathan Davis]] were bushwhacked by an international band of bandits.  The bandits, who included a Frenchman, two Americans, two Englishmen, four Mexicans and four Australians, had recently robbed and killed four American miners on December 18, 1854, and six Chinese miners on December 17, 1854.  McDonald was killed instantly, and Dr. Sparks was fatally wounded, however Captain Davis, an Army veteran, pulled out both of his pistols and killed seven of the bandits in quick order. Out of bullets, Captain Davis, an expert fencer, pulled out his Bowie knife and killed four more of his attackers.  The surviving bandits fled for their lives. The shootout was witnessed by a group of miners, who buried the bodies of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Kulczyk, David. (2008). California Justice: Shootouts, Lynching and Assassinations in the Golden State.

June 17, 1933. [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

'''Date:''' 2 September 1984&lt;br /&gt;
'''Location:''' Milperra, New South Wales&lt;br /&gt;
'''Result:''' 6 dead gang members, 1 dead bystander, 28 injured

===Mumbai Massacre===

On November 26, 2008, 10 members of the Pakastani militant group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] carried out shooting sprees at several different locations throughout the Indian city of [[Mumbai]].  The terrorists, heavily armed with automatic weapons and explosives, overwhelmed the initial response from lightly armed and minimally trained police and held out for nearly three days, inflicting almost 500 casualties, with 157 deaths (including 17 police officers and soldiers).  9 of the 10 attackers were killed, while the 10th was arrested and later executed for the crime.

'''Date:''' 26–29 November 2008
'''Location:''' Mumbai, India
'''Results''' 166 deaths (including 9 of 10 attackers), 293 injuries, 1 terrorist arrested (later hanged after being sentenced to death).

Further information:  [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]

===[[Manila hostage crisis]]===
Former police officer Rolando Mendoza boarded a bus with Hong Kong tourists taking the occupants hostage. After freeing 4 children, senior citizens and a disabled woman, the shootout began after the on-board TV broadcast showing the arrest of his younger brother. Enraged, Mendoza took the tour guide and shot him in the head at the door. It took the SWAT team almost 2 hours to kill Mendoza with a sniper. The assault killed 8 hostages (the youngest being 14), and wounded 7 hostages, 1 journalist and 1 bystander.

'''Date:''' 23 August 2010
'''Location:''' Rizal Park, Manila, Philippines
'''Result:''' Shooter: 1 dead, hostages: 8. 9 others wounded.

===January 2015 Île-de-France attacks===
Three [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|AQAP]] terrorists, brothers [[Chérif and Saïd Kouachi]] and [[Amedy Coulibaly]], committed [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|a series of five attacks]] that resulted in the deaths in 20 people, including themselves. The Kouachis killed two police officers during the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' shooting]] on 7 January before fleeing. Coulibaly shot and killed a policewoman the next day. Finally on 9 January, the Kouachis and Coulibaly held separate sieges which resulted in shootouts with police and all three being killed.

'''Date:''' 7&amp;ndash;9 January 2015&lt;br/&gt;
'''Location:''' [[Ile-de-France]], France &lt;br/&gt;
'''Deaths''': Terrorists: 3, Police: 3, Civilians: 14 &lt;br/&gt;
'''Injuries''': 22

===[[Saint-Denis raid]]===
5 days after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], French police raided an apartment that thought to be housing the mastermind behind the attacks, [[Abdelhamid Abaaoud]]. Following a seven-hour shootout in which police fired over 5,000 rounds of ammunition, Abaaoud, his cousin Hasna Aït Boulahcen, and fellow Paris attacker Chakib Akrouh were killed and 5 terrorists were arrested.

'''Date:''' 18 November 2015&lt;br/&gt;
'''Location:''' [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis]], [[France]]&lt;br/&gt;
'''Deaths''': [[ISIL]]: 3, Police: 1 dog&lt;br/&gt;
'''Injuries''': Police: 5, Civilians:1

===[[Beer Hall Putsch]]===
On November 9, 1923, [[Adolf Hitler]] and at least 2,000 members of the [[Nazi Party]], which Hitler belonged to, attempted to launch a coup in [[Munich]]. The resulting shootout between Bavarian police and Nazi supporters left twenty people dead and many injured.

'''Date:''' 9 November 1923&lt;br/&gt;
'''Location:''' [[Munich, Germany]]&lt;br/&gt;
'''Deaths''': [[Nazi Party]]: 15, Bavarian police: 4, Civilians: 1

A "'''soft target'''" is "a person or thing that is relatively unprotected or vulnerable, especially to military or [[terrorist attack]]."{{Sfn|Oxford Dictionaries Online||}}
==Etymology==
The terms "soft target" and "hard target" are flexible in nature and the distinction between the two is not always clear.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=38}} However, typical "soft targets" are civilian sites where unarmed people congregate in large numbers; examples include [[national monument]]s, hospitals, schools, sporting arenas, hotels, cultural centers,  movie theaters, [[café]]s and restaurants, [[places of worship]], nightclubs, shopping centers, transportation sites (such as [[railway station]]s, buses, rail systems, and ferries), and farmers' cooperatives.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}{{Sfn|Preston|1987|}} Soft targets are contrasted with hard targets, which typically restrict access to the public and are well-protected.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} Examples of hard targets include airports, government buildings, military installations, [[diplomatic missions]], and [[power station]]s.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=37}}{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}}

==History==
Terrorist groups almost exclusively choose to strike soft targets.{{Sfn|McGovern|2012|p=371}}{{Sfn|Forest|2006|p=40}} Of terrorist attacks worldwide from 1968 to 2005, 72% (8,111) struck soft targets and 27% (4,248) struck hard targets.{{Sfn|Forest|2006|pp=39-40}} The intent of attacks on soft targets is to instil fear as well as inflict casualties.{{Sfn|Bennett|2007|p=62}} [[Clark Kent Ervin]] notes that attacks on soft targets inflict psychological damage.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=158}} In 2011, while preparations were being made for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the deputy commissioner of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] noted that if the primary targets were secure, terrorists might substitute targets that are nearby but not as well protected.{{Sfn|Ervin|2006|p=103}}

Military and paramilitary groups may adopt a strategy of attacking soft targets in order to avoid direct confrontation with a stronger opponent. For example, U.S. military general [[John Galvin (general)|John Galvin]] noted in 1987 that [[Contras|Contra rebels]] switched to civilian targets rather than continuing the direct fighting against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]].{{Sfn|Kaplan|1987|}}

[[Image:Constantine arch datation en.svg|thumb|Dating of the reliefs on the Arch of Constantine.]]
[[Image:THES-Heptapyrgion spolia 3.jpg|thumb|Fragments of Greek inscriptions in the masonry of the Ottoman [[Heptapyrgion (Thessaloniki)|Heptapyrgion]] (Yedikule) fortress (1431), [[Thessaloniki]].]]

'''''Spolia''''' ([[Latin]], 'spoils'), repurposed building stone for new construction, or decorative sculpture reused in new monuments, is the result of an ancient and widespread practice whereby stone that has been quarried, cut, and used in a built structure, is carried away to be used elsewhere.  The practice is of particular interest to historians, archaeologists and architectural historians since the gravestones, monuments and architectural fragments of antiquity are frequently found embedded in structures built centuries or millennia later.

Archaeologist [[Philip A. Barker]] gives the example of a late Roman period (probably 1st century) tombstone from [[Wroxeter]] that could be seen to have been cut down and undergone weathering while in use as part of an exterior wall, then, possibly as late as the 5th century, reinscribed for reuse as a tombstone.&lt;ref name=Barker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=A. Philip|title=Techniques of Archaeological Excavation|date=1977 |publisher=Routledge|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was common in [[late antiquity]].  Entire obsolete structures, including underground foundations, are known to have been demolished to enable the construction of new structures.  According to Baxter, two churches in Worcester  (one 7th century and one 10th,) are thought to have been deconstructed so that  their building stone could be repurposed by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|St. Wulstan]] to construct a cathedral in 1084.&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;  And the parish churches of [[Atcham]], [[Wroxeter]], and [[Upton Magna]] are largely built of stone taken from the buildings of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum]].&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;

Roman examples include the [[Arch of Janus]], the earlier imperial reliefs reused on the [[Arch of Constantine]], the colonnade of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]; examples in Byzantine territories include the exterior sculpture on the [[Panagia Gorgoepikoos]] church in [[Athens]]); in the medieval West Roman tiles were reused in [[St Albans Cathedral]], in much of the medieval architecture of [[Colchester]], porphyry columns in the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], and the colonnade of the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]]. Spolia in the medieval Islamic world include the columns in the [[hypostyle]] mosques of [[Kairouan]], [[Great Mosque of Gaza|Gaza]] and [[Mezquita|Cordoba]].
[[Image:Trastevere 1.jpg|thumb|left|Re-used reliefs as decoration in Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome]]
Although the modern literature on spolia is primarily concerned with these and other medieval examples, the practice is common and there is probably no period of art history in which evidence for "spoliation" could not be found.

Interpretations of spolia generally alternate between the "ideological" and the "pragmatic." Ideological readings might describe the re-use of art and architectural elements from former empires or dynasties as triumphant (that is, literally as the display of "spoils" or "booty" of the conquered) or as revivalist (proclaiming the renovation of past imperial glories). Pragmatic readings emphasize the utility of re-used materials: if there is a good supply of old marble columns available, for example, there is no need to produce new ones. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there is certainly no one approach that can account for all instances of spoliation, as each instance must be evaluated within its particular historical context.

Spolia had [[apotropaic]] spiritual value. Clive Foss has noted&lt;ref&gt;Foss, "Late Antique and Byzantine Ankara" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''31''' (1977:65).&lt;/ref&gt; that in the fifth century crosses were inscribed on the stones of pagan buildings, as at [[Ankara#Roman history|Ankara]], where crosses were inscribed on the walls of the temple of [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]] and [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Religion and Imperium under Augustus|Augustus]]. Clive Foss suggests that the purpose of this was to ward off the ''[[daimon]]es'' that lurked in stones that had been consecrated to pagan usage.

Liz James extends Foss's observation&lt;ref&gt;James, "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12–20) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in noting that statues, laid on their sides and facing outwards, were carefully incorporated in Ankara's city walls in the Seventh century, at a time when spolia were also being built into city walls in [[Miletus]], [[Sardis]], [[Ephesus]] and [[Pergamum]]: "laying a statue on its side places it and the power it represents under control. It is a way of acquiring the power of rival gods for one's own benefit," Liz James observes. "Inscribing a cross works similarly, sealing the object for Christian purposes".&lt;ref&gt;James 1996, noting O. Hjort, "Augustus Christianus—Livia Christiana: ''Sphragis'' and Roman portrait sculpture", in L. Ryden and J.O. Rosenqvist, ''Aspects of Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium'' (Transactions of the Swedish Institute in Istanbul, IV) 1993:93–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}
In [[differential geometry]], [[representation theory]] and [[harmonic analysis]], a '''symmetric space''' is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] whose group of symmetries contains an inversion symmetry about every point. This can be made more precise, in either the language of [[Riemannian geometry]] or of [[Lie theory]]. The Riemannian definition is more geometric, and plays a deep role in the theory of [[holonomy]]. 
The Lie-theoretic definition is more algebraic.

In [[Riemannian geometry]], a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold is a symmetric space if and only if its curvature tensor is invariant under parallel transport. More generally, a Riemannian manifold (''M'', ''g'') is said to be symmetric if and only if, for each point ''p'' of ''M'', there exists an isometry of ''M'' fixing ''p'' and acting on the tangent space &lt;math&gt;T_pM&lt;/math&gt; of ''M'' at ''p'' by minus the identity. 
Any symmetric space is complete, and has a finite cover which is a simply connected symmetric space; thus these two characterizations in fact coincide up to finite covers. Both descriptions can also naturally be extended to the setting of [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.

From the point of view of [[Lie theory]], a symmetric space is the quotient ''G''/''H'' of Lie group ''G'' by a Lie subgroup ''H'', where the [[Lie algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' is also required to be the +1-eigenspace of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G''. 
As stated, this characterization includes pseudo-Riemannian spaces as well as a Riemannian ones; extra algebraic conditions are needed to restrict to the Riemannian case.

Riemannian symmetric spaces arise in a wide variety of situations in both mathematics and physics. They were first classified by [[Élie Cartan]]. Their central role in the theory of [[holonomy]] was discovered by [[Marcel Berger]]. They are important objects of study in representation theory and harmonic analysis as well as in differential geometry.

==Definition using geodesic symmetries==
Let ''M'' be a connected Riemannian manifold and ''p'' a point of ''M''. An automorphism ''f'' of a neighborhood of ''p'' is said to be a '''geodesic symmetry''' if it fixes the point ''p'' and reverses geodesics through that point, i.e. if ''γ'' is a geodesic and &lt;math&gt; \gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma(t))=\gamma(-t).&lt;/math&gt; It follows that the derivative of the map at ''p'' is minus the identity map on the  [[tangent space]] of ''p''. On a general Riemannian manifold, ''f'' need not be isometric, nor can it be extended, in general, from a neighbourhood of ''p'' to all of ''M''.

''M'' is said to be '''locally Riemannian symmetric''' if its geodesic symmetries are in fact isometric. This is equivalent to the vanishing of the covariant derivative of the curvature tensor. 
A locally symmetric space is said to be a '''(globally)  symmetric space''' if, in addition, its geodesic symmetries are defined on all of ''M''.

===Basic properties===
The [[Cartan&amp;ndash;Ambrose&amp;ndash;Hicks theorem]] implies that ''M'' is locally Riemannian symmetric [[if and only if]] its curvature tensor is [[covariant derivative|covariantly constant]], and furthermore that any [[simply connected]], [[complete space|complete]] locally Riemannian symmetric space is actually Riemannian symmetric.

Any Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is complete and Riemannian [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] (meaning that the isometry group of ''M'' acts transitively on ''M''). In fact, already the identity component of the isometry group acts transitively on ''M'' (because ''M'' is connected).
 
Locally Riemannian symmetric spaces that are not Riemannian symmetric may be constructed as quotients of Riemannian symmetric spaces by discrete groups of isometries with no fixed points, and as open subsets of (locally) Riemannian symmetric spaces.

===Examples===
Basic examples of Riemannian symmetric spaces are [[Euclidean space]], [[sphere]]s, [[projective space]]s, and [[hyperbolic space]]s, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. More examples are provided by compact, semi-simple [[Lie groups]] equipped with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric. An example of a non-Riemannian symmetric space is [[anti-de Sitter space]].

Any compact Riemann surface of genus greater than 1 (with its usual metric of constant curvature &amp;minus;1) is a locally symmetric space but not a symmetric space.

==General definition==
Let ''G'' be a connected [[Lie group]]. Then a '''symmetric space''' for ''G'' is a homogeneous space ''G''/''H'' where the stabilizer ''H'' of a typical point is an open subgroup of the fixed point set of an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''σ'' in ''Aut(G)''. Thus ''σ'' is an automorphism of ''G'' with ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = id&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H'' is an open subgroup of the set
: &lt;math&gt; G^\sigma=\{ g\in G: \sigma(g) = g\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Because ''H'' is open, it is a union of components of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt; (including, of course, the identity component).

As an automorphism of ''G'', ''σ'' fixes the identity element, and hence, by differentiating at the identity, it induces an automorphism of the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'', also denoted by ''σ'', whose square is the identity. It follows that the eigenvalues of ''σ'' are ±1. The +1 eigenspace is the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; of ''H'' (since this is the Lie algebra of ''G''&lt;sup&gt;''σ''&lt;/sup&gt;), and the −1 eigenspace will be denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''σ'' is an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;, this gives a [[direct sum of Lie algebras|direct sum]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak g = \mathfrak h\oplus\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt; [\mathfrak h,\mathfrak h]\subset \mathfrak h,\; [\mathfrak h,\mathfrak m]\subset \mathfrak m,\; [\mathfrak m,\mathfrak m]\subset \mathfrak h.&lt;/math&gt;
The first condition is automatic for any homogeneous space: it just says the infinitesimal stabilizer &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie subalgebra of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. The second condition means that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;-invariant complement to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. Thus any symmetric space is a [[reductive homogeneous space]], but there are many reductive homogeneous spaces which are not symmetric spaces. The key feature of symmetric spaces is the third condition that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; brackets into &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, given any Lie algebra &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; with a direct sum decomposition satisfying these three conditions, the linear map ''σ'', equal to the identity on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; and minus the identity on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;, is an involutive automorphism.

==Riemannian symmetric spaces satisfy  the Lie-theoretic characterization==
If ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space, the identity component ''G'' of the isometry group of ''M'' is a [[Lie group]] acting transitively on ''M'' (''M'' is Riemannian homogeneous). Therefore, if we fix some point ''p'' of ''M'', ''M'' is diffeomorphic to the quotient ''G/K'', where ''K'' denotes the [[isotropy group]] of the action of ''G'' on ''M'' at ''p''. By differentiating the action at ''p'' we obtain an isometric action of ''K'' on T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. This action is faithful (e.g., by a theorem of Kostant, any isometry in the identity component is determined by its [[jet bundle|1-jet]] at any point) and so ''K'' is a subgroup of the orthogonal group of T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M'', hence compact. Moreover, if we denote by ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;: M → M the geodesic symmetry of ''M'' at ''p'', the map
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma: G \to G, h \mapsto s_p \circ h \circ s_p&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] Lie group [[automorphism]] such that the isotropy group ''K'' is contained between the fixed point group of ''σ'' and its identity component (hence an open subgroup).

To summarize, ''M'' is a symmetric space ''G''/''K'' with a compact isotropy group ''K''. Conversely, symmetric spaces with compact isotropy group are Riemannian symmetric spaces, although not necessarily in a unique way. To obtain a Riemannian symmetric space structure we need to fix a ''K''-invariant inner product on the tangent space to ''G''/''K'' at the identity coset ''eK'': such an inner product always exists by averaging, since ''K'' is compact, and by acting with ''G'', we obtain a ''G''-invariant Riemannian metric ''g'' on ''G''/''K''.

To show that ''G''/''K'' is Riemannian symmetric, consider any point ''p'' = ''hK'' (a coset of ''K'', where ''h'' ∈ ''G'') and define
:&lt;math&gt;s_p: M \to M, h'K \mapsto h \sigma(h^{-1}h')K&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' is the involution of ''G'' fixing ''K''. Then one can check that ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is an isometry with (clearly) ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = ''p'' and (by differentiating) d''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;  equal to minus the identity on T&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;''M''. Thus ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is a geodesic symmetry and, since ''p'' was arbitrary, ''M'' is a Riemannian symmetric space.

If one starts with a Riemannian symmetric space ''M'', and then performs these two constructions in sequence, then the Riemannian symmetric space yielded is isometric to the original one. This shows that the "algebraic data" (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') completely describe the structure of ''M''.

==Classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces==
{{main|List of simple Lie groups}}

The algebraic description of Riemannian symmetric spaces enabled [[Élie Cartan]] to obtain a complete classification of them in 1926.

For a given Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' let (''G'',''K'',''σ'',''g'') be the algebraic data associated to it. To classify the possible isometry classes of ''M'', first note that the [[universal cover]] of a Riemannian symmetric space is again Riemannian symmetric, and the covering map is described by dividing the connected isometry group ''G'' of the covering by a subgroup of its center. Therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that ''M'' is simply connected. (This implies ''K'' is connected by the [[long exact sequence of a fibration]], because ''G'' is connected by assumption.)

===Classification scheme===
A simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is said to be '''irreducible''' if it is not the product of two or more Riemannian symmetric spaces. It can then be shown that any simply connected Riemannian symmetric space is a Riemannian product of irreducible ones. Therefore, we may further restrict ourselves to classifying the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces.

The next step is to show that any irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric space ''M'' is of one of the following three types:

1. '''Euclidean type''': ''M'' has vanishing curvature, and is therefore isometric to a [[Euclidean space]].

2. '''Compact type''': ''M'' has nonnegative (but not identically zero) [[sectional curvature]].

3. '''Non-compact type''': ''M'' has nonpositive (but not identically zero) sectional curvature.

A more refined invariant is the '''rank''', which is the maximum dimension of a subspace of the tangent space (to any point) on which the curvature is identically zero. The rank is always at least one, with equality if the sectional curvature is positive or negative.  If the curvature is positive, the space is of compact type, and if negative, it is of  noncompact type.  The spaces of Euclidean type have rank equal to their dimension and are isometric to a Euclidean space of that dimension. Therefore, it remains to classify the irreducible, simply connected Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact and non-compact type. In both cases there are two classes.

A. ''G'' is a (real) simple Lie group;

B. ''G'' is either the product of a compact simple Lie group with itself (compact type), or a complexification of such a Lie group (non-compact type).

The examples in class B are completely described by the classification of [[simple Lie group]]s. For compact type, ''M'' is a compact simply connected simple Lie group, ''G'' is ''M''&amp;times;''M'' and ''K'' is the diagonal subgroup. For non-compact type, ''G'' is a simply connected complex simple Lie group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. In both cases, the rank is the [[rank of a Lie group|rank of ''G'']].

The compact simply connected Lie groups are the universal covers of the classical Lie groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n)&lt;/math&gt; and the five [[Exceptional Lie group#Exceptional algebras|exceptional Lie groups]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The examples of class A are completely described by the classification of noncompact simply connected real simple Lie groups. For non-compact type, ''G'' is such a group and ''K'' is its maximal compact subgroup. Each such example has a corresponding example of compact type, by considering a maximal compact subgroup of the complexification of ''G'' which contains ''K''. More directly, the examples of compact type are classified by involutive automorphisms of compact simply connected simple Lie groups ''G'' (up to conjugation). Such involutions extend to involutions of the complexification of ''G'', and these in turn classify non-compact real forms of ''G''.

In both class A and class B there is thus a correspondence between symmetric spaces of compact type and non-compact type. This is known as duality for Riemannian symmetric spaces.

===Classification result===
Specializing to the Riemannian symmetric spaces of class A and compact type, Cartan found that there are the following seven infinite series and twelve exceptional Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K''. They are here given in terms of ''G'' and ''K'', together with a geometric interpretation, if readily available. The labelling of these spaces is the one given by Cartan.

===As Grassmannians===
A more modern classification {{Harv|Huang|Leung|2011}} uniformly classifies the Riemannian symmetric spaces, both compact and non-compact, via a [[Freudenthal magic square]] construction. The irreducible compact Riemannian symmetric spaces are, up to finite covers, either a compact simple Lie group, a Grassmannian, a [[Lagrangian Grassmannian]], or a [[double Lagrangian Grassmannian]] of subspaces of &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf A \otimes \mathbf B)^n,&lt;/math&gt; for normed division algebras '''A''' and '''B'''. A similar construction produces the irreducible non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces.

==Symmetric spaces in general==

An important class of symmetric spaces generalizing the Riemannian symmetric spaces are '''pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces''', in which the Riemannian metric is replaced by a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]] (nondegenerate instead of positive definite on each tangent space). In particular, '''Lorentzian symmetric spaces''', i.e., ''n'' dimensional pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces of signature (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1,1), are important in [[general relativity]], the most notable examples being [[Minkowski space]], [[De Sitter space]] and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (with zero, positive and negative curvature respectively). De Sitter space of dimension ''n'' may be identified with the 1-sheeted hyperboloid in a Minkowski space of dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

Symmetric and locally symmetric spaces in general can be regarded as affine symmetric spaces. If ''M'' = ''G''/''H'' is a symmetric space, then Nomizu showed that there is a ''G''-invariant torsion-free [[affine connection]] (i.e. an affine connection whose [[torsion tensor]] vanishes) on ''M'' whose [[curvature of a connection|curvature]] is [[parallel transport|parallel]]. Conversely a manifold with such a connection is locally symmetric (i.e., its [[universal cover]] is a symmetric space). Such manifolds can also be described as those affine manifolds whose geodesic symmetries are all globally defined affine diffeomorphisms, generalizing the Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian case.

===Classification results===
The classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces does not extend readily to the general case for the simple reason that there is no general splitting of a symmetric space into a product of irreducibles. Here a symmetric space ''G''/''H'' with Lie algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g = \mathfrak h\oplus \mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be irreducible if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m&lt;/math&gt; is an [[irreducible representation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt;. Since  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h&lt;/math&gt; is not semisimple (or even reductive) in general, it can have [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] representations which are not irreducible.

However, the irreducible symmetric spaces can be classified. As shown by [[Katsumi Nomizu]], there is a dichotomy: an irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''H'' is either flat (i.e., an affine space) or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple. This is the analogue of the Riemannian dichotomy between Euclidean spaces and those of compact or noncompact type, and it motivated M. Berger to classify semisimple symmetric spaces (i.e., those with  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;  semisimple) and determine which of these are irreducible. The latter question is more subtle than in the Riemannian case: even if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is simple, ''G''/''H'' might not be irreducible.

As in the Riemannian case there are semisimple symmetric spaces with ''G'' = ''H'' &amp;times; ''H''. Any semisimple symmetric space is a product of symmetric spaces of this form with symmetric spaces such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is simple. It remains to describe the latter case. For this, one needs to classify involutions ''σ'' of a (real) simple Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; is not simple, then &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is a complex simple Lie algebra, and the corresponding symmetric spaces have the form ''G''/''H'', where ''H'' is a real form of ''G'': these are the analogues of the Riemannian symmetric spaces ''G''/''K'' with ''G'' a complex simple Lie group, and ''K'' a maximal compact subgroup.

Thus we may assume &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; is simple. The real subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed as the fixed point set of a complex [[antilinear]] involution ''τ'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt;, while ''σ'' extends to a complex antilinear involution of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt; commuting with ''τ'' and hence also a complex linear involution ''σ''∘''τ''.

The classification therefore reduces to the classification of commuting pairs of antilinear involutions of a complex Lie algebra. The composite ''σ''∘''τ'' determines a complex symmetric space, while ''τ'' determines a real form. From this it is easy to construct tables of symmetric spaces for any given &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g^c&lt;/math&gt;, and furthermore, there is an obvious duality given by exchanging ''σ'' and ''τ''. This extends the compact/non-compact duality from the Riemannian case, where either ''σ'' or ''τ'' is a [[Cartan involution]], i.e., its fixed point set is a maximal compact subalgebra.

===Tables===
The following table indexes the real symmetric spaces by complex symmetric spaces and real forms, for each classical and exceptional complex simple Lie group.

==Weakly symmetric Riemannian spaces==
{{main|Weakly symmetric space}}
In the 1950s [[Atle Selberg]] extended Cartan's definition of symmetric space to that of '''weakly symmetric Riemannian space''', or in current terminology '''weakly symmetric space'''. These are defined as Riemannian manifolds ''M''  with a transitive connected Lie group of isometries ''G'' and an isometry σ normalising ''G'' such that given ''x'', ''y'' in ''M'' there is an isometry ''s'' in ''G'' such that ''sx'' =   σ''y'' and ''sy'' = σ''x''. (Selberg's assumption that σ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should be an element of ''G'' was later shown to be unnecessary by [[Ernest Vinberg]].) Selberg proved that weakly symmetric spaces give rise to [[Gelfand pair]]s, so that in particular the [[unitary representation]] of ''G'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') is multiplicity free.

Selberg's definition can also be phrased equivalently in terms of a generalization of geodesic symmetry. It is required that for every point ''x'' in ''M'' and tangent vector ''X'' at ''x'', there is an isometry ''s'' of ''M'', depending on ''x'' and ''X'', such that

*''s'' fixes ''x'';
*the derivative of ''s'' at ''x'' sends ''X'' to –''X''.

When ''s'' is independent of ''X'', ''M'' is a symmetric space. 
 
An account of weakly symmetric spaces and their classification by Akhiezer and Vinberg, based on the classification of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, is given in {{harvtxt|Wolf|2007}}.

==Applications and special cases==

===Symmetric spaces and holonomy===
{{main|Holonomy group}}

If the identity component of the [[holonomy group#Riemannian holonomy|holonomy group]] of a Riemannian manifold at a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space, then either the manifold is a locally Riemannian symmetric space, or it is in one of [[holonomy group#The Berger classification|7 families]].

===Hermitian symmetric spaces===
{{main|Hermitian symmetric space}}

A Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel complex structure compatible with the Riemannian metric is called a [[Hermitian symmetric space]]. Some examples are complex vector spaces and complex projective spaces, both with their usual Riemannian metric, and the complex unit balls with suitable metrics so that they become complete and Riemannian symmetric.

An irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is Hermitian if and only if ''K'' contains a central circle. A quarter turn by this circle acts as multiplication by ''i'' on the tangent space at the identity coset. Thus the Hermitian symmetric spaces are easily read off of the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there are four infinite series, namely AIII, BDI with ''p=2'', DIII and CI, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded symmetric domains in complex vector spaces.

===Quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces===
{{main|Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space}}

A Riemannian symmetric space which is additionally equipped with a parallel subbundle of End(T''M'') isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions at each point, and compatible with the Riemannian metric, is called [[Quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]].

An irreducible symmetric space ''G''/''K'' is quaternion-Kähler if and only if isotropy representation of ''K'' contains an Sp(1) summand acting like the [[unit quaternion]]s on a [[quaternionic vector space]]. Thus the quaternion-Kähler symmetric spaces are easily read off from the classification. In both the compact and the non-compact cases it turns out that there is exactly one for each complex simple Lie group, namely AI with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 (these are isomorphic),  BDI with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, CII with ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, EII, EVI, EIX, FI and&amp;nbsp;G.

===Bott periodicity theorem===
{{main|Bott periodicity theorem}}

In the [[Bott periodicity theorem]], the [[loop spaces]] of the stable [[orthogonal group]] can be interpreted as reductive symmetric spaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">'''Terministic screen''' is a term in the theory and criticism of [[rhetoric]]. It involves the acknowledgment of a language system that determines an individual's perception and symbolic action in the world.

==Overview==
[[Kenneth Burke]] develops the terministic screen in his book of essays called ''[[Language as Symbolic Action]]'' in 1966. He defines the concept as "a screen composed of terms through which humans perceive the world, and that direct attention away from some interpretations and toward others".&lt;ref&gt;Stob, Paul. " 'Terministic Screens', Social Constructionism, and the Language of Experience: Kenneth Burke's Utilization of William James". Philosophy and Rhetoric 42, no. 2 (May 1, 2008): 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Burke offers the metaphor to explain why people interpret messages differently, based on the construction of symbols, meanings, and, therefore, reality.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "Terministic Screens". In Language as Symbolic Action, 45. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Words convey a particular meaning, conjuring images and ideas that induce support toward beliefs or opinions. Receivers interpret the intended message through a metaphorical screen of their own vocabulary and perspective to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blakesley, David, ed. The Terministic Screen: Rhetorical Perspectives on Film. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain terms may grab attention and lead to a particular conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Palczewski, Catherine Helen, Richard Ice, and John Fritch. "Terministic Screen." In Rhetoric in Civic Life, 39. State College, PA: Strata Publishing, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; "Language reflects, selects, and deflects as a way of shaping the symbol systems that allow us to cope with the world".{{sfn|Stob|p=139}} Every word chosen says something about the society we live in. The language we choose to use will be a representation of our reality, our world, our culture, and our beliefs, even without intention.

== Scientistic versus dramatistic ==
Burke describes two different types of terministic screens: scientistic and dramatistic. Scientistic begins with a definition of a term; it describes the term as what it is or what it is not, putting the term in black and white. When defining, the essential function is either attitudinal or hortatory. In other words, the focus is on expressions or commands. When terms are treated as hortatory, they are developed. Burke comments on why he uses developed rather than another word. "I say 'developed'; I do not say 'originating'. The ultimate origins of language seem to me as mysterious as the origins of the universe itself. One must view it, I feel, simply as the 'given' ". {{sfn|Burke|p=44}} The dramatistic approach concerns action: thou shalt or thou shalt not.{{sfn|Burke|p=45}} This screen directs the audience toward action based on interpretation of a term. Via terministic screens, the audience will be able to associate with the term or dissociate from it.{{sfn|Burke|p=49}}

== Social constructionism ==
"[[Social constructionism]] is a metaphor that attempts to capture the way Burke viewed the nature of the world and the function of language therein." Symbols, terms, and language build our view of life. Social constructionism allows us to look at Burke's theory in terms we recognize and are comfortable with. {{sfn|Stob|p=131}}

== Examples ==
When a person says gender, most people, based on their individual beliefs, normally think of male or female. However, some could think of intersex individuals. If someone says they think of male, female, and intersex, more would be reflected about the person based on their terminology. Still others would recognize gender as different from biological sex, and say they think of man, woman, and other genders. Another example occurs within the abortion controversy. A pro-choice advocate would most likely use the word "fetus" but pro-life advocates would use the word "baby", because the term stirs more realistic and relatable images and has a bearing on the legal status. Using the word "baby" versus "fetus" defines reality differently (scientistic) and guides people to act in a certain way (dramatistic) solely based on term selection that may be unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Ian. " 'The Human Barnyard' and Kenneth Burke's Philosophy of Technology". KB Journal 5, no. 2 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==
Words are absolute for thought and action.{{sfn|Palczewski, Ice, and Fritch|p=39}} According to Burke, individuals create terministic screens consciously and unconsciously, as they perceive the world and share perspectives.  Burke contends these screens set up a network of beliefs through which all ideas will be interpreted. Communication scholar Paul Stob contends that the language we use is thus not just a direct reflection of our intelligence, but also of perception and culture.  David Blakesley posits that the terministic screen enables the further understanding of rhetorical perspectives. In each of these ways, the terministic screen allows for concepts to be interpreted in different ways by different people and contribute to the complexity of meaning.

'''''The Big Mo: Why Momentum Rules Our World''''' is a book by [[Mark Roeder]], first published by [[HarperCollins]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780730494485/the-big-mo-why-momentum-now-rules-our-world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-big-mo/9780753539378&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the phenomenon of large-scale momentum and how it impacts society.

==Overview==

The book suggests that the rapid integration of digital technologies, communications and markets, has accelerated the velocity at which events unfold – and generates momentum on a massive scale ([[Big Mo]]). Roeder warns, 'As our world becomes more efficient and automated, there is less ‘friction’ to slow the momentum, which can lead to catastrophic results.’ The book examines the impact of [[Big Mo]] on finance, media, politics, wars, religion and science. Roeder, an ex-executive at [[UBS]], bank, argues that momentum played an instrumental role in the [[Global Financial Crisis]], and that it distorted decision-making in the lead up to the [[second Iraq War]]. He suggests that momentum ‘has become the zeitgeist of our time’

==Key concepts==

:*The momentum effect has recently become more powerful and pervasive, driven by rapid advances in technology and the integration of global systems.

:*When momentum increases to a critical level, it creates a Big Mo effect that is self perpetuating and difficult to slow down or stop.

:*Paradoxically, organisations and networks that are highly integrated and efficient are most susceptible to [[Big Mo]]. This is because momentum feeds on internal efficiency to accelerate and magnify its impact – there is little ‘friction’ to slow it down. Hence, the global financial system – which is now highly integrated and driven by automated computer-based trading systems (algorithms) – is particularly vulnerable to the momentum effect.

:*The momentum-driven environment causes people and organisations to become ‘swept up in the flow’. It also encourages people to behave opportunistically, with less regard for the longer-term consequences of their actions. As Roeder explains, ‘They become ‘momentum surfers’ who are willing to ride the wave rather than question its direction.’

==Reception==

The Big Mo was described by the [[Financial Times]] as ‘A compelling book that journeys seamlessly from finances to the Iraq war, from oil prices and climate change to religion and pop culture in an effort to explain how we behave and why we are so easily led.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/a2fa4a8c-39fc-11e0-a441-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3vs5lm3rj&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian broadcaster [[Phillip Adams]], wrote, ‘In our personal, political and economic lives we seem to be swept along by circumstances. Our attempts to change direction are doomed. The Big Mo explains why.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/why-momentum-rules-our-world/2975654&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/australiatalks/live-simply-connect-less/3015768&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]]’s [[Steven Poole]] criticized the book for 'overstretching the Newtonian-physics analogy'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/05/steven-poole-nonfiction-choice-reviews&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Matcham, writing in [[The Australian]], said, ‘Speed and size define the events of our age. As news travels ever faster, its impact increases. The strength of [Roeder’s] book is the idea that momentum’s effects can be felt right across society, including in the media, where 15 minutes of fame is possible on a scale unimaginable a decade ago.’&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newindianexpress.com/education/edex/article476219.ece&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuamherald.ie/plus/roundup/articles/2014/03/28/4023611-bookshelf--the-big-mo-why-momentum-rules-our-world&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.financialriskstoday.com/bigmo_june.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Mo was first published by HarperCollins Australia (2011), Random House (Virgin books) UK, Europe &amp; USA (2011) and Xinhua Publishing House, Beijing, China (2012).

[[File:VertiCrop.jpg|thumb|Lettuce grown in indoor vertical farming system]]

'''Vertical farming''' is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and [[controlled-environment agriculture]] (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and [[fertigation]]. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to [[greenhouse]]s, where natural [[sunlight]] can be augmented with artificial [[lighting]] and [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]].&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974"&gt;Hix, John. 1974.

Hydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/|title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world|last=Marks|first=Paul|date=15 January 2014|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The term "vertical farming" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book ''Vertical Farming''. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about [[farming]] with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as "vertical" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000349328 |title=Vertical farming (1915) |publisher=E. I. duPont de Nemours Powder Co. |location=Wilmington, Del.  |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage of the term "vertical farming" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.

===Mixed-use skyscrapers===
Mixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect [[Ken Yeang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecture.org.au/news/enews/354-ken-yeang-and-bioclimatic-architecture|title=Ken Yeang and Bioclimatic Architecture|website=www.architecture.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.

===Despommier's skyscrapers===
Ecologist [[Dickson Despommier]] argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less [[embodied energy]] and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.{{citation needed|reason=the 2nd part of the sentence sounds like a reader's inserted opinion, not Despommier's|date=February 2016}}

Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at [[Columbia University]]. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15farm.html |title=Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest  |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Bina |last=Venkataraman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackable shipping containers===
Several companies have developed stacking recycled [[Intermodal_container|shipping containers]] in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. [[Freight Farms]] produces a "leafy green machine" that is a complete [[farm-to-table]] system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, [[LED]] lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2.4&amp;nbsp;m shipping container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-PUIXUPgw|title=2015 Leafy Green Machine by Freight Farms|first=|last=Freight Farms|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked "growpods".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zWommg6JVfY|title=PodPonics Info Video 3d Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar farm is under construction in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=r-Iymp-gdbo|title=PodPonics Oman Video Blog Part 1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=PrLTuGKcvPA|title=Oman Video Blog Part 2: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraFarms offer a proprietary&lt;ref name="localrootsfarms-how-we-farm-tech"&gt;{{cite web

Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"/&gt;

==Technology==
Lighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at [[Philips]] have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.

==History==
One of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.ctbuh.org/PDF_Previews/Journal/CTBUHJournal_2009-2.pdf Nakheel Harbor and Tower] &lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Delirious New York''.  Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas2014"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=163oAwAAQBAJ}}|title=Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan|last=Koolhaas|first=Rem|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroponicum ===
Early architectural proposals that contributge to VF include [[Le Corbusier]]'s Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruby|first1=Ilka|last2=Ruby|first2=Andreas|title=Groundscapes: el reencuentro con el suelo en la arquitectura contemporánea|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mglNAAAAYAAJ}}|year=2006|publisher=G.

Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974" /&gt; The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of [[greenhouse]] and [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] technology. Early [[Hydroponicum|hydroponicums]] integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These [[horticultural building system]]s evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a [[hydroponicum]] for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Hydroponics problems|url=http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811024138/http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' ''[[Hydroponics]]: The Bengal System,'' first published in 1951 with data from the then-[[East Pakistan]], today's [[Bangladesh]], and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf|title=link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf Hydroponics The Bengal System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sholto Douglas 1975"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195605662|edition=5th|location=New Dehli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.

=== Vertical farm ===
[[Dickson Despommier]] is a professor of [[environmental health]] sciences and [[microbiology]]. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.

Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21154137/|title=Could vertical farming be the future?

Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of [[Manhattan]] (about 2,000,000 people) using only {{convert|13|acre|ha|order=flip|0}} of [[rooftop gardens]]. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:

{{quote|Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.

Moreover, a gas [[chromatograph]] will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which [[Flavonoid|flavenoids]] the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the food the flavors you're so fond of, particularly for more aromatic produce like tomatoes and peppers. These are all right-off-the-shelf technologies. The ability to construct a vertical farm exists now. We don't have to make anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arnie Cooper |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science_environment/farming-in-high-rises-raises-hopes-1226 |title=Going up?

In 2011 the Plant in [[Chicago]] was building an [[anaerobic digestion#Power generation|anaerobic digester]] into the building. This will allow the farm to operate off the energy grid.

The firm is housed in a single story building covering 3.25 hectares, with racks stacked six high to house 17 million plants. The farm was to grow 14 lettuce crops per year, as well as spinach, kale, tomatoes, peppers, basil and strawberries. Water is scavenged from the farm's atmosphere with a [[dehumidifier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2015 study utilized inexpensive [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]] to supply sunlight to the plants, reducing energy costs.&lt;ref name="bowenpublishing.com" /&gt;

==Problems==

===Economics===
Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Clifton says: |url=http://e4capital.com/2009/08/24/vertical-farming/ |title=Vertical Farming: Too Far Outside the Box? &amp;#124; |publisher=E4capital.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing [[food miles]], the distance that food travels from farm to consumer.{{original research inline|date=September 2011}} However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that "food miles are, at best, a marketing fad."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. (July 22, 2009). Local food no green panacea: professor. CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/07/22/consumer-local-food.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.

The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |title=Starting a Commercial Greenhouse Business |publisher=Omafra.gov.on.ca |date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024230113/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Office [[occupancy cost]]s can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Dubai]], [[Milan]], [[Zurich]], and [[Sao Paulo]] ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket World in Figures, [[The Economist]], 2011 ed. pg 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy use===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:B11architecture exteriors040.jpg|thumb|A [[greenhouse]] with its lights on at night, contributing to ''[[light pollution]]'']] --&gt;

During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roach |first=J. |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090630-farm-towers-locally-grown.html |title=High-Rise Farms: The Future of Food?|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental writer [[George Monbiot]] calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/08/16/towering-lunacy/ |title=George Monbiot – Towering Lunacy |publisher=Monbiot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Economist argued that "even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough" and "the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Economist |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627 |title=Vertical farming: Does it really stack up?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Vertical Farm" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/greenhouse/bng01s01.html |title=Crops &amp;#124; Greenhouse &amp;#124; Greenhouse Energy Calculations &amp;#124; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Depending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse [[produce]] can create more greenhouse gases than field produce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125741/http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.

Greenhouses commonly supplement [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|author2=W.A.

Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to leak into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse growers commonly exploit [[photoperiodism]] in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=61B_RV3EdIcC|page=163}}|title=Light pollution handbook – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10|isbn=978-1-4020-2665-2|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or [[wetlands]] would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/greenhouse/nursery/environ/wmrecyc.html |title=Treating and Recycling Irrigation Runoff |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Vertical Harvest was raising funds for an urban, small-scale vertical farm in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/vertical-harvest-of-jackson-hole-will-grow-organic-produce-even-in-the-winter/|title=Vertical Harvest of Jackson Hole Will Grow Organic Produce Even in the Winter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Many of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or [[aeroponic]] growing methods.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archivedate= 2009-07-01 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Nicholas|last2=Stuhlmacher|first2=Michelle|last3=Miles|first3=Albie|last4=Uludere Aragon|first4=Nazli|last5=Wagner|first5=Melissa|last6=Georgescu|first6=Matei|last7=Herwig|first7=Chris|last8=Gong|first8=Peng|date=2018-01-01|title=A Global Geospatial Ecosystem Services Estimate of Urban Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000536/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–60|doi=10.1002/2017ef000536|issn=2328-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for the future===
It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite web|website=The Vertical Farm Project |year=2009 |title=Agriculture for the 21st Century and Beyond |url=http://www.verticalfarm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.&lt;ref name=vf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |title=Feeding time at the Zoo. |journal=The Horticulturalist |date=April 2010 |pp=12–15 |publisher=Institute of Horticulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |date= October 2011|title=High rise food |journal=The Horticulturalist |pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased crop production===
Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I|publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/?page_id=36 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Vertical Farm Video |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2009-04-23 |url= http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510091346/http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |archive-date= 2009-05-10 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

Despommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. [[dwarf wheat]] which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dwarf Wheat grown aboard the International Space Station | publisher = NASA| date = 9 February 2003| url = http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=2889| accessdate = 17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), year-round crops and "stacker" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block ({{convert|5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}) would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of {{convert|2400|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of traditional farming.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

===Weather disruption===
Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; "Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Big Food vs. Big Insurance|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2009-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.

=== Conservation ===
Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24Despommier.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Farm on Every Floor|last=Despommier|first=Dickson D.|date=2009-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/11/ch_vertical_farming.pdf Vertical take off], ''Fresh Produce Journal'', 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; due to VR's increased productivity.

Vertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Despommier| first = Dickson| authorlink = Dickson Despommier| title = The Rise of Vertical Farms| journal = Scientific American| volume = 301| issue = 5| pages = 60–67| publisher = Scientific American Inc.| location = New york| date = November 2009| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms| issn = 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and [[desertification]] caused by agricultural encroachment on natural [[biome]]s could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.

===Resource scarcity===
The scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus&lt;ref name="phosphorus"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311092124.htm Expertanswer. "Scarcity of phosphorus threat to global food production". ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.&lt;ref name="runoff"&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR009i003p00658 Timmons, D. R., et al. “Nitrogen and Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Agricultural Land as Influenced by Placement of Broadcast Fertilizer.” Water Resources Research , June 1973, doi:https://doi.org/10.1029/WR009i003p00658.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinction===
Withdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address [[Holocene extinction event|anthropogenic mass extinction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

Traditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be [[Ethics of eating meat#Argument that plant consumption also kills animals|unethical]] given a viable alternative. One study showed that [[wood mouse]] populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
Traditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[schistosomes]], exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. 

===Poverty and culture===
Food security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty.  Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-265-food-and-culture-spring-2011/|title=Food and Culture Spring 2011 course|work=ocw.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban growth===
Vertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt;

===Energy sustainability===
Vertical farms could exploit [[methane digesters]] to generate energy.  Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into [[biogas]] that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Case Study&amp;nbsp;— Landfill Power Generation, H. Scott Matthews, Green Design Initiative, Carnegie Mellon University. {{cite web |url=http://gdi.ce.cmu.edu/gd/education/landfill-case.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061623/http://gdi.ce.cmu.edu/gd/education/landfill-case.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }} Retrieved 07.02.09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and devices==
Vertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:

* [[Greenhouses]]
* The [[Folkewall]] and other vertical growing architectures&lt;ref name="Folkewalls"&gt;{{cite web|author=Folke Günther |url=http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml |title=The folkewall, greywater purification AND vertical growing |publisher=Holon.se |date=2013-01-06 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aeroponics]]
* [[Agricultural robot]]
* [[Aquaponics]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Controlled-environment agriculture]]
* [[Flower pots]]
* [[Grow lights]]
* [[Hydroponics]]
* [[Phytoremediation]]
* [[Precision agriculture]]
* [[Skyscrapers]]
* TerraFarm

==Plans==
Developers and local governments in multiple cities have expressed interest in establishing a vertical farm: [[Incheon]] ([[South Korea]]), [[Abu Dhabi]] ([[United Arab Emirates]]), [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] ([[China]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= McConnell |first= Kathryn |title= Vertical Farms Grow Food by Growing Up, Not Out |work= [[Bureau of International Information Programs]] |publisher= [[United States Department of State]] |date= 2008-07-01 |url= http://www.america.gov/st/foraid-english/2008/July/20080630192325AKllennoCcM0.5946161.html |accessdate= 2008-08-12 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080814122514/http://www.america.gov/st/foraid-english/2008/July/20080630192325AKllennoCcM0.5946161.html |archivedate= 2008-08-14 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  New York City, Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles, Las Vegas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextenergynews.com/news1/next-energy-news-las-vegas-vertical-farm-1.2b.html |title=Las Vegas to Build World's First 30 Story Vertical Farm |publisher=Nextenergynews.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle, Surrey, B.C., Toronto, Paris, Bangalore, Dubai, Shanghai and Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Despommier |first=Dickson |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms |title=Dickson Despommier.

In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/files/Dublin2010/papers/Frediani-Kevin.pdf|title=Vertical plant production as a public exhibit at Paignton Zoo|publisher= Proceedings of the 4th World Botanic Garden Congress, Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date= June 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Green Zionist Alliance]] proposed a resolution at the 36th World Zionist Congress calling on Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael ([[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel) to develop vertical farms in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Green Zionist Alliance (GZA) – Bold Resolutions for 36th World Zionist Congress |url= http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/06/green-zionist-alliance-gza-resolutions/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women’s reproductive health in the United States''' refers to the set of physical, mental, and social issues related to the health of [[women in the United States]]. It includes the rights of women in the United States to adequate sexual health, available contraception methods, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of women’s health issues in American culture is inspired by [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosser|first1=Sue V.|title=Overview of Women's Health in the U.S. Since the Mid-1960's|journal=History and Technology|date=December 2002|volume=18|issue=4|pages=355–369|doi=10.1080/0734151022000023802|url=http://www.swetswise.com/link/access%5Fdb?issn=0734-1512|deadurl=y|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this movement, women of the United States began to question the largely male-dominated health care system and demanded a right to information on issues regarding their physiology and anatomy.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"/&gt; The U.S. government has made significant strides to propose solutions, like creating the [[Women’s Health Initiative]] through the Office of Research on Women’s Health in 1991.&lt;ref name="Overview of Women's Health since 1960's"/&gt;

==Issues==

===Sexual health===
The Department of Health and Human Services has developed a definition for sexual health in the United States based on the [[World Health Organization]]’s definition of sexual health.&lt;ref name="WHO Defining sexual health"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=World Health Organization|title=Defining sexual health: report of a technical consultation on sexual health|date=January 2002|pages=28–31|accessdate=25 October 2014|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/sexual_health/defining_sexual_health.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
“Sexual health is a state of well-being in relation to sexuality across the life span that involves physical, emotional, mental, social and spiritual dimensions. Sexual health is an intrinsic element of human health and is based on positive, equitable, and respectful approach to sexuality, relationships, and reproduction, that is free of coercion, fear, discrimination, stigma, shame, and violence.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Department of Health and Human Services|title=CDC/HRSA Advisory Committee on HIV, Viral Hepatitis, and STD Prevention and Treatment|date=May 2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/maso/facm/pdfs/CHACHSPT/20120508_CHAC.pdf|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The United States government recognizes that gender is a factor which plays a significant role in sexual health.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services"/&gt;

===Contraception===
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has identified national reproductive health goals including reducing the level of unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the pregnancies reported in the United States, half are unplanned.&lt;ref name="Dept. of Health and Human Services" /&gt; Of the 62 million women in the U.S. who are able to have children, seven out of ten of these women are sexually active but do not want to become pregnant.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contraception]] is a major issue of women’s reproductive health. 86% of sexually active women practice some form of contraception and 30% of these women use a hormonal form of contraception.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S. have more freedoms in deciding their use of contraceptives among other global nations, comparatively.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have significant pull over the decision-making process women must make when choosing different types of contraception. Women of the U.S. still rely on their healthcare providers for the majority of information they receive about contraceptive use. In order to help healthcare providers provide appropriate family planning care, the CDC published the US Medical Elibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use,2010.&lt;ref name="Inapprop Use of CHC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=Jingbo|author2=Henry Hu|title=Inappropriate Use of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives for Birth Control Among Women of Reproductive Age in the United States|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2013|volume=22|issue=7|pages=595–603|doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC lists methods of [[birth control]] under two categories: reversible and permanent.

====Hormonal contraception====
[[Hormonal contraception]] is the most popular method of contraception among women in the United States. Women under the age of thirty more commonly use hormonal oral contraception as their preferred method. Hormonal contraceptives can be almost 100% effective when used perfectly,&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in most cases it is used imperfectly. Oral hormonal contraceptives have an 8% failure rate.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of oral hormonal contraceptives among women changes over the course of a year with 32% of women deciding to discontinue use of an oral hormonal contraceptive after one year of typical use.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrauterine contraception====
A large stigma exists among women on the topic of using an [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) as a form of contraception. The two types of IUDs that exist for current contraceptive use are Copper T 380A and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or Mirena. IUDs are underutilized by women in the United States with only 2% of women using IUD as an effective contraception.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of a contraceptive is described in terms of perfect use and typical use. An IUD is different than most forms of contraception, as it is 100% effective in both cases of use.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not possible to use IUDs improperly or inconsistently because they must be inserted inside of the uterus. Women in the United States have many fears about the use of IUDs, making them the less popular form of contraception.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many women in the U.S., IUDs are only an option when other traditional contraception methods have been used (hormonal birth control, barrier methods, etc.) or when a women has already had children.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear surrounding use of an IUD stems from a lack of proper education on all available contraception options available to women in the U.S.. Women have cited being afraid of the quality of the device itself, placing the device inside their bodies voluntarily, and the time required to hold the device in place.&lt;ref name="Urban Family Medicine IUC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Susan E.|author2=Ilana Winrob|title=Urban Female Family Medicine Patients'  Perception About Intrauterine Contraception|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–740|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1549|publisher=Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of knowledge about female anatomy and pregnancy prevention, even among women of the United States.

===Sexually Transmitted Diseases===
A health objective of the United States government through The United States Public Health Service is to reduce the number of cases of [[sexually transmitted diseases]] from the 1980s to today.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosher|first1=William D.|author2=Sevgi O. Aral|title=Testing for sexually transmitted diseases among women of reproductive age: United States, 1988|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|date=October 1991|volume=23|issue=5|pages=216–221|doi=10.2307/2135756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centers for Disease Control is responsible for many studies on the topic of STDs as well as the effect of STDs on women and girls.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; STDs are defined by the CDC as “infections you can get from having sex with someone who has an infection”.&lt;ref name="CDC Women's Reproductive Health" /&gt; There are more than twenty types of identifiable STDs caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses.&lt;ref name="CDC Women's Reproductive Health"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion|title=Women's Reproductive Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/WomensRH/index.htm|website=www.cdc.gov|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within one year in the United States there are an estimated 12 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases that occur. Of those 12 million cases there are 1.5 million cases of gonorrhea, 500,000 cases of genital herpes, and 110,000 cases of syphilis.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; Both women and men in the United States are affected by the STD epidemic. However, women have a stronger negative health reaction to some STDs than men. The negative health effects of STDs for women can include [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PIV), ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, fetal and perinatal infections, complications to pregnancy, fetal loss, cervical cancer, and increased risk of tubal pregnancy, intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the U.S. are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs for a variety of reasons. Some STDs appear asymptomatic in women&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; therefore women are less likely to seek out treatment for STDs than men. Like most health topics, there is a gap that exists in understanding the pathology of diseases in women versus men. Women receive less than adequate information about the prevalence of STDs as well as the symptoms of STDs.

As with contraception in the U.S., a stigma exists which prevents women from learning about all possible STDs and their treatment. A study by the Journal of Women’s Health identified STDs as a topic women would rather not talk about.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, with their partners, do not commonly discuss STDs as well.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma surrounding STDs in the U.S. prevents women from discussing the topic even among healthcare provides, close friends, partners, and family. Younger women do not understand the risk that STDs can pose to them. For example, [[Chlamydia infection|Chlamydia]] is one of the most common STDs affecting women and men in the United States. Women do not follow the recommendation that people should be screened for Chlamydia at least once per year.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most women do not even know any information about Chlamydia as an STD besides the fact that it is curable.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STD screening is most effective for identifying STDs in women, but is commonly underutilized by women in the U.S. Healthcare access and access to family planning clinics increases the probability that women will seek out and utilize STD screening.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; Screening is a form of testing healthy versus symptomatic people against traditional symptoms of STDs to determine STD prevalence. The Planned Parenthood Federation of America has available clinics across the United States for the purpose of screening for STDs as well as other family planning services. [[Planned Parenthood]] suggests that sexually active women screen for STDs at least annually.&lt;ref name="Testing for STDs"/&gt; A study by the Journal for Women’s Health identified a need for a knowledge campaign on STD screening targeting sexually active young women.&lt;ref name="Something we'd not talk about"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Allison L.|title="Something We'd Rather Not Talk About": Findings from CDC Exploratory Research on Sexually Transmitted Disease Communication with Girls and Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2010|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1823–1831|doi=10.1089/jwh.2010.1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taoism}}
{{Chinese folk religion}}
In [[Chinese philosophy]], '''yin and yang''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ɪ|n}} and {{IPAc-en||j|ɑː|ŋ|,_|j|æ|ŋ}}; {{lang-zh|{{linktext|陰|陽}}}} ''yīnyáng'', lit. "dark-bright", "negative-positive") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Feuchtwang|first=Stephan|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-415-85881-6|location=New York|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as [[qi]]. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things &lt;ref&gt;Feuchtwang, Sephan. “Chinese Religions.” Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third ed., Routledge, 2016, pp. 150-151. &lt;/ref&gt;. Included among these forms are humans. Many tangible [[Dualistic cosmology|dualities]] (such as [[light and dark]], fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical [[Chinese science]] and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of [[traditional Chinese medicine]],&lt;ref name=Porkert1974&gt;{{cite book|author=Porkert|title=The Theoretical Foundations of Chinese Medicine|publisher=MIT Press|year=1974|isbn=0-262-16058-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a central principle of different forms of [[Chinese martial arts]] and exercise, such as [[baguazhang]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] (t'ai chi), and [[qigong]] (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the ''[[I Ching]]''.

The notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as [[Duality (CoPs)|Communities of Practice]], but in this context yin and yang are better viewed as parts of an oneness that is expressed in the [[Tao]]. The term "dualistic-monism" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Georges Ohsawa]]|year=1976|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=oQqDZnm43mkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Unique Principle|isbn=978-0-918860-17-0|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light).  Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. [[taijitu]] symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.

In [[Taoism|Taoist]] metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of [[Confucianism]] on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of [[Dong Zhongshu]] ({{circa}} 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor Latener|first=Rodney Leon|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Confucianism|volume=2|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2005|page=869|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8239-4079-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic aspects==
These [[Chinese language|Chinese]] terms ''yin'' 陰 or 阴 "shady side" and ''yang'' 陽 or 阳 "sunny side" are linguistically analyzable in terms of [[Chinese characters]], [[pronunciations]] and [[etymology]], [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]], [[topography]], and [[loanword]]s.

===Characters===
The [[Traditional Chinese characters]] {{linktext|陰}}  and {{linktext|陽}} for the words ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' are both classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical- esphonetic characters]], combining the semantically significant [[Radical 170|"mound; hill" radical]] {{linktext|阝}} or {{linktext|阜}} with the phonetic indicators ''ying'' {{linktext|侌}} and ''yang'' {{linktext|昜}}. The first phonetic ''yīn'' {{linktext|侌|}} "cloudy" ideographically combines ''jīn'' {{linktext|今|}} "now; present" and ''yún'' {{linktext|云|}} "cloud", denoting the "今 presence of 云 clouds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernhard Karlgren]], ''Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese'', Paul Geunthner, 1923, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The second phonetic ''yáng'' {{linktext|昜|}} "bright" originally pictured {{linktext|日}} the "sun" with {{linktext|勿|}} "rays coming down".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wenlin]]'', version 4.1.1, 2012, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; This phonetic is expanded with the [[Radical 72|"sun" radical]] into ''yáng'' 暘 "rising sun; sunshine". The "mound; hill" radical 阝full forms semantically specify ''yīn'' 陰 "shady/dark side of a hill" and ''yáng'' 陽 "sunny/light side of a hill".

The [[Simplified Chinese characters]] {{linktext|阴}} and {{linktext|阳}} for ''yīn'' and ''yáng'' combine the same "hill" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic ''yuè'' {{linktext|月}} "moon" and ''rì'' {{linktext|日}} "sun", graphically denoting "shady side of a hill" and "sunny side of a hill". Compare the [[Classical Chinese]] names (which contain ''tài'' {{linktext|太}} "great") for these two heavenly bodies: ''Tàiyīn'' {{linktext|太陰}} "moon" and ''Tàiyáng'' {{linktext|太陽}} "sun".

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Modern Standard Chinese]] pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first [[Four tones|tone]] ''yīn'' "shady; cloudy" or sometimes falling fourth tone ''yìn'' "to shelter; shade", and 陽 or 阳 "sunny" is always pronounced with rising second tone ''yáng''.

Sinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rhyme dictionary]] and later [[rhyme tables]], which was subsequently used to reconstruct [[Old Chinese phonology]] from rhymes in the (11th-7th centuries BCE) ''[[Shijing]]'' and phonological components of Chinese characters. [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese]] have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.

Compare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions of ''yīn'' 陰 and ''yáng'' 陽:
* ''ˑiəm'' &lt; *''ˑiəm'' and ''iang'' &lt; *''diang'' ([[Bernhard Karlgren]])&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Karlgren, ''Grammata Serica Recensa'', Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 1957, 173, 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
* *''ʔjəm'' and *''raŋ'' ([[Li Fang-Kuei]])&lt;ref&gt;Li, Fang-Kuei, "Studies on Archaic Chinese", translated by Gilbert L. Mattos, ''Monumenta Serica'' 31, 1974:219–287.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''ʔ(r)jum'' and *''ljang'' ([[William H. Baxter]]),&lt;ref&gt;William H. Baxter, ''A Handbook of Old Chinese Phonology'', Mouton de Gruyter ,1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''ʔjəm'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' and ''jiaŋ'' &lt; *''laŋ'' (Axel Schuessler)&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 558, 572.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''im'' &lt; *''qrum'' and ''yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' ([[William H. Baxter]] and [[Laurent Sagart]])&lt;ref&gt;Baxter &amp; Sagart (2014), pp. 326-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schuessler gives probable [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] etymologies for both Chinese words.

''Yin'' &lt; *''ʔəm'' compares with [[Burmese language|Burmese]] ''ʔum&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;'' "overcast; cloudy", [[Adi language|Adi]] ''muk-jum'' "shade", and [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]] ''so'yǔm'' "shade"; and is probably cognate with Chinese ''àn'' &lt; *''ʔə̂mʔ'' {{linktext|黯}} "dim; gloomy" and ''qīn'' &lt; *''khəm'' {{linktext|衾}} "blanket"

''Yang'' &lt; *''laŋ'' compares with Lepcha ''a-lóŋ'' "reflecting light", Burmese ''laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "be bright" and ''ə-laŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;'' "light"; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese ''chāng'' &lt; *''k-hlaŋ'' {{linktext|昌}} "prosperous; bright"; ''bǐng'' &lt; *''braŋʔ'' {{linktext|炳}} "bright"; ''liàng'' &lt; ''*raŋh'' {{linktext|亮}} "(pale) light"; ''lǎng'' &lt; ''raŋʔ'' {{linktext|朗}} "brilliant light"; ''míng'' &lt; ''mraŋ'' {{linktext|明}} "bright, become light, enlighten". Schuessler surmises that those items either are [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area|areal]] words (cf. [[Tai languages|Tai]] ''plaŋ&lt;sup&gt;A1&lt;/sup&gt;'' "bright") or belong to an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] word family (cf. Proto-[[Vietic languages|Viet-Muong]]  ''hlaŋ&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;''); owing to "the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function"&lt;ref&gt;Schuessler, Axel, ''ABC Etymological Dictionary of Old Chinese'', [[University of Hawaii Press]], 2007, 356.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Meanings===
''Yin'' and ''yang'' are semantically complex words. 

A reliable [[Chinese dictionary#Chinese-English dictionaries|Chinese-English dictionary]] gives the following translation equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;[[John DeFrancis]], ed., ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, 2003, 1147, 1108.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yin''' 陰 or 阴 [[Noun]] ① [philosophy] negative/passive/female principle in nature ② Surname [[Bound morpheme]] ① the moon ② shaded orientation ③ covert; concealed; hidden ④ ⑦ negative ⑧ north side of a hill ⑨ south bank of a river ⑩ reverse side of a stele ⑪in intaglio [[Stative verb]] ① overcast &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Yang''' 陽 or 阳 [[Bound morpheme]] ① [Chinese philosophy] positive/active/male principle in nature ②the sun ④ in relief ⑤ open; overt ⑥ belonging to this world ⑦ [linguistics] masculine ⑧ south side of a hill ⑨ north bank of a river &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''yin-yang'' 陰陽 or 阴阳 means "yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.".

The [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Rolf Stein]] etymologically translates Chinese ''yin'' 陰 "shady side (of a mountain)" and ''yang'' 陽 "sunny side (of a mountain)" with the uncommon English geographic terms ''[[wikt:ubac|ubac]]'' "shady side of a mountain" and ''[[wikt:adret|adret]]'' "sunny side of a mountain" (which are of [[List of English words of French origin|French origin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Stein (2010), ''Rolf Stein's Tibetica Antiqua: With Additional Materials'', Brill, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;...

===Toponymy===
Many Chinese place names or [[toponyms]] contain the word ''yang'' "sunny side" and a few contain ''yin'' "shady side". In [[China]], as elsewhere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.

''Yang'' refers to the "south side of a hill" in [[Hengyang]] 衡陽, which is south of [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Mount Heng]] 衡山 in [[Hunan]] province, and to the "north bank of a river" in [[Luoyang]] 洛陽, which is located north of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] 洛河 in [[Henan]].
 
Similarly, ''yin'' refers to "north side of a hill" in [[Huayin]] 華陰, which is north of [[Mount Hua]] 華山 in [[Shaanxi]] province.

In [[Japan]], the characters are used in western [[Honshu]] to delineate the north-side [[San'in region]] 山陰 from the south-side [[San'yō region]] 山陽, separated by the [[Chūgoku Mountains|Chugoku mountain range]] 中国山地.

English ''[[wikt:yin|yin]]'', ''[[wikt:yang|yang]]'', and ''[[wikt:yin-yang|yin-yang]]'' are familiar [[loanwords]] of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|Chinese origin]].

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yin''' (jɪn) Also '''Yin''', '''Yn'''. [Chinese ''yīn'' shade, feminine; the moon.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib''. or as ''adj''., and ''transf''. Cf. '''yang'''. 
'''b.''' ''Comb''., as '''yin-yang''', the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as '''yin-yang symbol''', a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively ''yin'' and ''yang'', each containing a 'seed' of the other. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''yang''' (jæŋ) Also '''Yang'''. [Chinese ''yáng'' yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] 
'''a.''' In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also ''attrib.'' or as ''adj.'' Cf. '''yin'''.
'''b.''' ''Comb.'': '''yang-yin''' = ''yin-yang'' s.v. '''yin b.'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the earliest recorded "yin and yang" usages, the ''OED'' cites 1671 for ''yin'' and ''yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnoldus Montanus]], ''Atlas Chinensis: Being a relation of remarkable passages in two embassies from the East-India Company of the United Provinces to the Vice-Roy Singlamong, General Taising Lipovi, and Konchi, Emperor, Thomas Johnson'', tr. by J. Ogilby, 1671, 549: "The Chineses by these Strokes ‥ declare ‥ how much each Form or Sign receives from the two fore-mention'd Beginnings of Yn or Yang."&lt;/ref&gt; 1850 for ''yin-yang'',&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jones Boone (son)|William Jones Boone]], "Defense of an Essay on the proper renderings of the words Elohim and θεός into the Chinese Language," ''Chinese Repository'' XIX, 1850, 375: "... when in the Yih King (or Book of Diagrams) we read of the Great Extreme, it means that the Great Extreme is in the midst of the active-passive primordial substance (Yin-yáng); and that it is not exterior to, or separate from the Yin-yáng."&lt;/ref&gt; and 1959 for ''yang-yin''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Jung]], "Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self", in ''The Collected Works of C. G. Jung'', tr. by R. F. C. Hull, Volume 9, Part 2, p. 58" "[The vision of "Ascension of Isaiah"] might easily be a description of a genuine yang-yin relationship, a picture that comes closer to the actual truth than the ''privatio boni''. Moreover, it does not damage monotheism in any way, since it unites the opposites just and yang and yin are united in Tao (which the Jesuits quite logically translated as "God")."&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, ''yang-yin'' (like ''ying-yang'') occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword ''yin-yang''— yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some ''yangyin'' [[collocation]]s, such as 洋銀 (lit. "foreign silver") "silver coin/dollar", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'') enter ''yangyin'' *陽陰. While ''yang'' and ''yin'' can occur together in context,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' says" "Now, the lumber is not so important as the forest; the forest is not so important as the rain; the rain is not so important as yin and yang; yin and yang are not so important as harmony; and harmony is not so important as the Way. (12, 材不及林，林不及雨，雨不及陰陽，陰陽不及和，和不及道; tr. Major et al. 2010, 442).&lt;/ref&gt; ''yangyin'' is not synonymous with ''yinyang''. The linguistic term "[[Siamese twins (linguistics)|irreversible binomial]]" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English ''cat and mouse'' (not *''mouse and cat'') and ''friend or foe'' (not *''foe or friend''). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, ''tiandi'' 天地 "heaven and earth" and ''nannü'' 男女 "men and women". ''Yinyang'' meaning "dark and light; female and male; moon and sun", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including "linguistic convenience" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that "proto-Chinese society was matriarchal", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was "purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames, "''Yin'' and ''Yang''", in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy'', ed. by Antonio S. Cua, Routledge, 2002, 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Needham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: "lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956&lt;/ref&gt; He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes "There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; Cambridge University Press; 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese gender roles ===

In spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being "necessary", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to "yin" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.

The notion of yin and yang has led to the persecution and extinction of Asian sun goddess cults outside of Korea and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques H. Kamstra, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8sgUAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Yin%20yang&amp;f=false Encounter Or Syncretism: The Initial Growth of Japanese Buddhism]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2018}}

==Nature==
In [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the [[Tao Te Ching]] at chapter 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.

It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{cn|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.

Certain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] &amp; [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.
*Illness is the doorway to health.
*Tragedy turns to comedy.
*Disasters turn out to be blessings.

==Symbolism and importance==
Yin is the black side with the white dot in it, and yang is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the "sunny place' or "south slope") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.

Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.

Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.&lt;ref&gt;Osgood, Charles E. "From Yang and Yin to and or but." Language 49.2 (1973): 380–412 . [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The yin-yang symbol, having no "officially standardized" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it "frivolous" (that is, "merely" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos). {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Yin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Li CL. A brief outline of Chinese medical history with particular reference to acupuncture. Perspect Biol Med. 1974 Autumn;18(1):132-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has [[Emptiness|vacuity]].

===''I Ching''===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),&lt;ref&gt;
The text of the ''I Ching'' has its origins in a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' (周易 ''Zhōu yì'').  Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five "Confucian" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚋&lt;/span&gt;) and yang is solid (&lt;span style="font-size: 24px"&gt;⚊&lt;/span&gt;). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' ☱) or more yin (''e.g.'' ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷕&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-size: 20px"&gt;䷟&lt;/span&gt;). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.

===Taijitu===
{{Main|Taijitu}}

The principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally "Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the [[swastika]], common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in [[Celtic art]] and [[Notitia Dignitatum#Depictions|Roman shield markings]].&lt;ref name="Giovanni Monastra (2000)"&gt;Giovanni Monastra: "[http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html#t24 The "Yin–Yang" among the Insignia of the Roman Empire?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925054740/http://www.estovest.net/tradizione/yinyang_en.html |date=2011-09-25 }}," "Sophia," Vol. 6, No. 2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Late Roman Shield Patterns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/luke/ueda-sarson/MagisterPeditum.html|title=Late Roman Shield Patterns - Magister Peditum|work=www.ne.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helmut Nickel (1992), 146, 5"&gt;Helmut Nickel: "The Dragon and the Pearl," ''Metropolitan Museum Journal,'' Vol. 26 (1991), p. 146, Fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taijiquan===
{{main|T'ai chi ch'uan}}
Taijiquan (Chinese: 太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. [[Wu Jianquan]], a famous [[Chinese martial arts]] teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:

{{quotation|Various people have offered different explanations for the name ''Taijiquan''. Some have said: – 'In terms of [[meditation|self-cultivation]], one must train from a state of movement towards a state of stillness. ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' comes about through the balance of ''yin'' and ''yang''. In terms of the art of attack and defense then, in the context of the [[I Ching|changes]] of full and empty, one is constantly internally latent, to not outwardly expressive, as if the ''yin'' and ''yang'' of ''Taiji'' have not yet divided apart.' Others say: 'Every movement of ''Taijiquan'' is based on circles, just like the shape of a ''Taijitu''. Therefore, it is called ''Taijiquan''.|Wu Jianquan|The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woolidge|first=Doug|title=T’AI CHI The International Magazine of T’ai Chi Ch’uan Vol. 21 No. 3|publisher=Wayfarer Publications|date=June 1997|issn=0730-1049}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
