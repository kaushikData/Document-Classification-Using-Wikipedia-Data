'''Advertisements in schools''' is a controversial issue that is debated in the [[United States]]. Naming rights of sports stadiums and fields, sponsorship of sports teams, placement of signage, vending machine product selection and placement, and free products that children can take home are all prominent forms of advertisements in schools.

== Types of Advertisements in Schools ==

=== Buses ===
Many state laws permit advertising to be sold on the exterior and fewer permit advertising on the interior of [[School bus advertising|school buses]]. However, many of these laws prohibit ads for political speech, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, drugs, or material of sexual nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Wheels on the Bus Go "Buy Buy Buy": School Bus Advertising Laws|last = Pomeranz|first = Jennifer|date = September 2012|journal = American Journal of Public Health|doi = 10.2105/ajph.2012.300718|pmid = 22742065|volume = 102|edition = |pages = 1638–1643 |pmc=3482098}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free Products ===
Restaurant and fast-food chains frequently offer free treats in the form of coupons to students who receive good grades or have good attendance on their report card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thecouponchronicles.com/2013/05/over-40-report-card-good-grade-reward.html|title = Over 40 Report Card Good Grade Reward Freebies and Discounts|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain districts, free cell phones are offered to students who receive text messages from companies promoting academic success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/business/media/06adco.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title = Straight A's, With a Burger as a Prize|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, educational materials are donated to classrooms as a way to support a curriculum. Oftentimes these materials contain the company’s logo or views that are subjective to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibiblio.org/commercialfree/commercialism.html|title = What is Commercialism in Schools?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
[[Channel One News]] is a program designed for and broadcast to elementary, middle and high school students. It contains commercial advertising. Its advertising regulations have changed over the years and currently restrict advertisements related to food and beverages that are inconsistent with their healthy lifestyle initiatives, gambling, motion pictures above PG-13, politics, religion, and tobacco or alcohol products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.channelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Channel-One-Network-Advertising-Policies-and-Guidelines.pdf|title = Channel One Network Advertising Policies and Guidelines|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sponsorship ===
Sponsorship of school sports teams and fields or stadiums is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/38524016/ns/us_news/t/branded-public-schools-court-corporate-sponsors/#.Vju-nberRaR|title = Branded! Public Schools Court Corporate Sponsors|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many high school teams have received uniforms, shoes, and funding for upkeep of their stadiums or fields in exchange for naming rights or the team wearing the sponsor’s logo. Companies will also offer discounts to the team members they are sponsoring as a way to push sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865574959/Sponsorship-contracts-raise-concerns-benefit-programs.html?pg=all|title = High school sponsorship contracts raise concerns, but also benefit programs|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsorship also comes in the form of funds given to have the company’s logo put on report cards and supply lists. Companies know back-to-school time is a great time to increase profit. By putting their marketing material on school supply lists it encourages parents to shop at their stores instead of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/marketplacek12/2013/08/back-to-school_time_brings_new_corporate_sponsorships.html|title = Back-to-School Time Brings New Corporate Sponsorships|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vending machine products ===

Food and beverage companies spend on average $150 million each year advertising in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/26/the-loophole-in-new-school-junk-food-ad-bans.html|title = The loophole in new school junk food ad bans|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the drinks and foods are advertised and made available through vending machines. Even with regulations on what types of foods are allowed to be sold and marketed, the food and drink companies are still able to advertise their brand to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michelle-obama-announces-new-rules-advertising-junk-food-schools-article-1.1701140|title = Michelle Obama announces new rules for advertising junk food at schools|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments in favor of advertising==
According to some school administrators, states have cut funding for K-12 education consistently for the last eight years causing many districts to cut jobs, increase class size, and cut spending on supplies. Using [[Advertising|advertisements]] in [[schools]] is a way to raise money for [[school district]]s. According to proponents, schools, especially in less affluent areas, need ways to [[fundraising|raise]] money in order to keep school programs alive and alleviate the financial burden presented by the funding cuts.

Another argument is that some advertisements may create a positive correlation to a healthy diet or lifestyle products.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Arguments against advertising==
According to critics, many advertisements endorse products that are detrimental to children's health, such as unhealthy food, and some people argue that children are more easily drawn to persuasive advertisements than adults.&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-06-03/advertising-in-schools/55366346/1&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that schools should be environments where students will not be distracted from their work by advertisements.{{according to whom|date=January 2014}}

Channel One News has 2 minutes of advertising for every 12 minutes of news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ericdigests.org/1996-3/advertising.htm|title = Advertising in Schools. ERIC Digest.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can lose up to a full day of class time over a year for advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.commercialfreechildhood.org/issue/advertising-schools|title = Advertising in Schools|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a concern that children do not understand the motivation behind ads. Children under the age of 13 are a vulnerable population that lacks the executive functioning skills to comprehend what the advertisement is trying to sell and the techniques used to persuade and frame customer decisions.  Children do not possess the same knowledge of advertising tactics as adults and are more susceptible to their persuasive intent. Elementary school children are not necessarily able to comprehend the fact that advertising agencies may have a different perspective from their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children’s Understanding of Television Advertising: A Grounded Theory|last = Andronikidis|first = A.|date = April 2010|journal = Psycholog &amp; Marketing|doi = 10.1002/mar.20333|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 27 | issue = 4 |pages = 299–322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restrictions on Advertisements ==
Each state in the United States of America can define additional regulations for advertising in its local schools.

The National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs: Nutrition Standards for All Foods Sold in School, as Required by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 was updated in 2013 to reform school lunch options. This placed restrictions on what could be served in vending machines and sold on school grounds, with the exception of fundraisers (often candy bars or doughnuts) and after-school events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FNS-2011-0019|title = Docket Folder ID:FNS-2011-0019|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This caused a shift in advertising for many companies as it phased out advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods. While the Coca-Cola Company would not be able to advertise Coca-Cola, it can advertise other product lines such as Diet Coke and Dasani.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2006 the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative was implemented by the Council of Better Business Bureaus as a way to encourage corporations to regulate what they advertise to children. It is not required for businesses to participate in this regulation and there are no legal ramifications if corporations do not participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Advertising Soft Drinks to Children: Are Voluntary Restrictions Effective?|last = Berning|first = Joshua|date = 2013|journal = Agribusiness|doi = 10.1002/agr.21343|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 29 | issue = 4 |pages = 469–485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reactions==
'''{{EST}}'''&amp;nbsp;— President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] appealed for calm and denounced the rioters as criminals due to the damage they had caused:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All this had nothing to do with the inviolability of graves or keeping alive the memory of men fallen in World War II"...  "The common denominator of last night's criminals was not their nationality, but their desire to riot, vandalize and plunder".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042700165.html?hpid=sec-world Estonia Removes Soviet War Memorial] by Jari Tanner, in the Washington Post, April 27, 2007.

'''{{EST}}''' – Prime Minister [[Andrus Ansip]] said in a televised address, in Estonian and Russian, that he was forced to remove the statue after the first riots on Thursday night. He said the statue was under police guard and was safe. It and any remains would be moved to a military cemetery.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We must not let the sowers of hatred become the ones to split the nation or to plant prejudice", he said. "All nationalities were respected" ... "but violence was not". The memory of dead soldiers was not served when "a picture of a drunk shoplifter is being shown all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2007-04-28T194748Z_01_L28730346_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-ESTONIA-RUSSIA-COL.XML&amp;archived=False Estonia calm after Red Army site riots, Russia angry]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Reuters, April 28, 2007.

'''{{RUS}}''' – Belittling the World War II heroes' feats and desecrating monuments erected in their memory leads to discord and mistrust between countries and peoples, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said on Victory Day. "Those who try to belittle that priceless experience and desecrate monuments to war heroes today insult their own nations as well and sow discord and new mistrust between countries and peoples", Putin said at a parade on Red Square marking the 62nd anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11730593 Putin criticizes attempts to belittle WWII heroes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513141843/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11730593 |date=May 13, 2007 }} [[Interfax]] May 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dismantling of the monument on the eve of Victory Day on May 9 is "just one aspect of the policy, disastrous for Estonians, being conducted by provincial zealots of Nazism,"…  "These admirers of Nazism forget that politicians come and go, while the peoples in neighboring countries are neighbors for eternity. The dismantling of the monument and the mockery of the remains of the fallen soldiers is just more evidence of the vengeful policy toward Russians living in Estonia and toward Russia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/themeday1/16.html?id_issue=11722956 Россия категорически не приемлет варварское отношение эстонских властей к памяти тех, кто спас Европу от фашизма - заявление сенаторов] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235759/http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/themeday1/16.html?id_issue=11722956 |date=September 30, 2007 }} Interfax, April 27, 2007.

'''[[Council of Europe]]:'''
On April 27, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) René van der Linden expressed his regrets on the decision of the Estonian authorities to remove the Bronze Soldier memorial as this act is widening the rift between the country's citizens of Estonian and Russian origin. "I understand that the monument is controversial as it symbolises, although in different ways, painful moments of Estonia and Russia's past. Precisely because of this, the soldiers that this memorial commemorates should have been left to rest in peace rather than being used as a political tool." The President expressed his disappointment that Estonia had not heeded the appeals for a common understanding over the issue of the Bronze Soldier that he made earlier this year to the Estonian and Russian delegations to PACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Press/StopPressView.asp?ID%3D1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606221943/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Press/StopPressView.asp?ID=1900 |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }} Press release - 268(2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Council of Europe]]:'''
On May 5, the Council of Europe Secretary General Terry Davis called on all sides involved to use the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the victory against the Nazis to bring an end to the dispute about the moving of the Monument to fallen Soviet soldiers in Tallinn. Davis expressed his understanding for the reasons why the Estonian authorities have decided to move the remains of these soldiers, but also reservations about the way it has been done. He called on politicians and public in Estonia to draw conclusions from these events and accept that on such delicate and potentially divisive matters, even the best intentioned initiatives may backfire if they are not prepared, discussed and implemented with appropriate sensitivity. Davis called on the Russian authorities to be more respectful and less emotional in the way they express their opinions on such a sensitive issue. In conclusion, he welcomed the decision to commemorate the Monument at its new location on the occasion of the ceremonies marking the end of World War II. He underlined that this choice of date places the symbol of the Bronze Soldier in its proper context – the liberation of Europe and provides an ideal opportunity to end this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/oped/04052007-bronzesoldier_en.asp? |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904170057/http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/oped/04052007-Bronzesoldier_en.asp |archivedate=2007-09-04 |df= }} Press release - 289(2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{RUS}}''' – First Deputy Prime Minister [[Sergei Ivanov]] said that adequate measures, primarily, economic ones, should be taken against Estonia:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In particular, Russia must speed up the construction of modern ports on Russian territory on the Baltic Sea, in the towns of [[Ust-Luga]], [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]] and [[Vysotsk]]. Thereby, we will handle our own cargo flow and not allow other countries, including Estonia, to benefit from its transit.

'''{{SRB}}''' – On May 3, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia issued a statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The future of Europe is also based on full commitment to shared and best pages of European history, whereas the victory over Nazism and fascism more than half a century ago undoubtedly ranks among those pages deserving lasting admiration among all in Europe and in the world."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Condemning the unilateral action by Estonian authorities on the eve of 9 May as contrary to this commitment, it states: "The highest respect for such monuments in today's Germany is noteworthy. We in Serbia shall forever place flowers on the graves of the Red Army soldiers fallen in the battles for the liberation of Serbia and Belgrade from Nazi occupiers. We shall do so also on 9 May this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Statement/030507_1_e.html|title=mfa.gov.rs/Statement/030507|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''{{EU}}''' – On May 2, EU demanded Russia to implement the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and secure proper protection for the Estonian embassy in Moscow. EuroCommission spokesperson Christiana Homan said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We share the concern about the growing tension around Estonia's embassy, and demand that Russian authorities implement their obligations within the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commersant.com/p763227/Estonia_EU-Russia_summit/|title=Estonia Makes European Alliance against Russia - Kommersant Moscow|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044050/http://commersant.com/p763227/Estonia_EU-Russia_summit/|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''{{EU}}''' –  On May 9 (Europe Day), the Estonia-Russia relations were discussed at the [[European Parliament]].
Several members of the Parliament expressed their support for Estonia. E.g. [[Brian Crowley]] said

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people and, secondly, in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in what they have attempted to create - the uncertainty and instability, not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States.

In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by utilisation of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy, by utilising the power or strength of energy to try to make people kneel to the influence of the Russian Government and, most importantly of all, by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes.  Finally, may I say, a most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia to show them that now that they are part of the European Union, they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously.

'''[[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]]:'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to media reports as well as reports received by the IHF, police in some cases used disproportionate force against riot participants. Some protesters were reportedly hit with batons, beaten and mistreated after being taken into custody in a temporary detention facility established in a terminal at the Tallinn port. Some cases of apparent police brutality were documented by TV broadcasts and cell phone recordings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The riots in Tallinn and other Estonian cities have served to highlight remaining problems relating to the integration of the country's Russian-speaking minority, which constitutes about one third of the 1.4 million residents. Despite a number of important legislative reforms since the first years of independence, this minority is still not officially recognized as a [[linguistic minority]] and continues to face discrimination and exclusion in everyday life, thus fostering frustration and resentment among its members. Many Russian-speakers still lack Estonian citizenship, Russian-language education has gradually been reduced and stringent language requirements restrict access to the labor market for Russian-speakers.

{{flagicon|Russia}} On May 7 Chief Rabbi of Russia [[Berel Lazar]] has called on the Estonian authorities to review their position regarding the reburial of the remains of Soviet soldiers in Tallinn.

"Fighting against the dead, against the soldiers who have always been honored by all nations, is the most unworthy deed. It is immoral to profane the memory of the dead", he said. "Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. This is what Christ our Savior said."

{{flagicon|Russia}} On May 3 The Russian Congress of Jewish Religious Organizations and Associations ([[KEROOR]]) issued a statement criticizing the Estonian government for relocating a Soviet World War II memorial in Tallinn and for alleged Nazi sympathies. "The demonstratively defiant form in which the Estonian authorities have dismantled the Monument to the Liberator Warrior and are relocating the nearby grave of soldiers who gave their lives fighting fascism is not an accidental or spontaneous act", the KEROOR said in a statement. "Estonian authorities prefer to gloss over the fact that punitive detachments and the Estonian SS legion killed between 120,000 and 140,000 Russians, Jews, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Gypsies, and people of other ethnic groups during 1941-1944."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=2991|title=Interfax-Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{flagicon|Russia}} Russian professor of economy, [[Konstantin Sonin]], condemned the relocation of Bronze Soldier in ''[[The Moscow Times]]'' article on May 8, 2007, saying that not only "the Estonian government clearly did not show its best side", but also "journalists who wrote of the "Russian monster" in an editorial published in one of Estonia's most popular newspapers crossed all conceivable limits of journalistic etiquette and political correctness". The author discussed possible alternative ways for Russian response to such hostile actions. These could be limiting temporarily access to the memorial to the victims of the violent resettlement of the Baltic peoples or reducing funding for taking care of certain halls within the [[Museum of Political Repression]]. Sonin concludes that implementation of these methods is so far impossible, because Russia does not have any such monuments to the suffering of people from other countries&lt;ref name=Sonin&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2007/05/08/007.html Impossible Symmetry] [[Moscow Times]] May 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2007, three members of the [[Nashi (youth movement)|Nashi]] movement, clothed in tent coats, proceeded to stand in for the Bronze Soldier in its former location.

The Nashi movement had planned pickets in Estonia on September 22, 2007, to commemorate "liberation of Tallinn from fascism".  After the Estonian embassy in Moscow refused to issue [[visa (document)|visas]] for such purpose, pickets were instead held in front of the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 22 September 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/220907/esileht/valisuudised/284680.php Našistid piketeerisid Eesti saatkonna ees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125025626/http://www.postimees.ee/220907/esileht/valisuudised/284680.php |date=2008-01-25 }}, edited by Oliver Tiks&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Nashi activists picketed the [[European Commission]]'s Moscow offices on Tuesday{{When|date=January 2010}} to protest EU travel restrictions. Picket had been called "anti-Estonian" by the Estonian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/280108/esileht/valisuudised/308755.php|title=Eestis nn mäluvalves käinud naist piketeerib Euroopa Komisjoni esinduse ees  - Maailm - Postimees.ee|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129145553/http://www.postimees.ee/280108/esileht/valisuudised/308755.php|archivedate=2008-01-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blacklisting lead Nashi to accuse the [[European Union]] of violating democratic principles that European officials often accuse Russia of violating, echoing sentiments by then-[[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] who often accused European officials of applying double standards to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/world/europe/30russia.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin Estonia Bans Travel for Kremlin Youth Group] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims of police brutality ==
&lt;!-- Agreement (see talk) currently to include the development of controversy in this article --&gt;
The secretary of the [[Estonian Anti-Fascist Committee]] and at the same time the chairman of the [[Constitution Party (Estonia)|Constitution Party]] [[Andrei Zarenkov]] claimed that as detention centers are overcrowded many of the detainees were taken to a cargo terminal in Tallinn seaport. "People were forced to [[Squatting position|squat]] for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastic handcuffs which caused great pain", he said. "The security men selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers. We have an account that they beat a 12-year-old girl lying on the floor for attempting to stand up. We have pictures of a toilet which is stained with the blood of the injured detainees", Zarenkov said. He said that all the accounts would be collected, documented and submitted to human rights groups.&lt;ref name="zarenkov"&gt;Interfax: [http://www.interfax.com/3/266697/news.aspx Ethnic Russians quit Estonian police to stay away from violence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000535/http://www.interfax.com/3/266697/news.aspx |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police has denied the claims of the Anti-Fascist Committee. A spokesman for the northern police prefecture, Harrys Puusepp, refuted the charges of ill treatment of the detainees and also said that rumors of the resignation of police officers (see below) are untrue. "Nobody has beaten them. They have been treated politely. All amenities were provided for them and medical assistance was offered. Those who spent more than 12 hours in detention were supplied with meals", he said.&lt;ref name="zarenkov"/&gt;

The Estonian [[Chancellor of Justice]] has checked on these claims, visited all detention centres, and found no signs of violations of Constitution, nor any detainees who would support claims of police brutality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/250207/tartu_postimees/246794.php|title=Allar Jõks leidis Tartu psühhiaatriakliinikus rikkumisi - Arhiiv - Postimees: Värsked uudised Eestist ja välismaalt|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906222715/http://www.postimees.ee/250207/tartu_postimees/246794.php|archivedate=2012-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or make complaints.&lt;ref&gt;EPL: [http://epl.ee/artikkel/384174 Jõks: mulle pole esitatud ühtegi kaebust]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 22, 2007 the office of [[Procurator General of Estonia]] received more than fifty complaints on the police brutality, after checking the facts seven criminal cases against police have been opened.&lt;ref name="adv"&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2007/05/22/20070522180100853.html ''Barrister of Mark Sirõk: I have no complaints on investigation''] [[Radio Liberty]] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1 [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] [[Iltalehti]] published an interview with [[Germany|German]] nationals Klaus and Lucas Dornemanns (65 and 35 years old).&lt;ref name=Iltalehti&gt;[http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200705016054874_uu.shtml Saksalainen isä ja poika kertovat kauhun hetkistään Tallinnan poliisin huostassa (Germans, father and son Dornemanns talk about their nightmare in Tallinn Police)] [[Iltalehti]] May 1, 2005 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their story the Dornemanns were just walking in the area of Freedom Square when they were beaten and arrested by the police. However by their own later admission they attempted to cross the square between the lines of the security forces and demonstrators who were in a stand-off position. The son spent 8 hours in the terminal D and his 65-year-old father 10 hours. According to them at least half of the detainees had no connection to the vandalism on the Tallinn streets. Still they were denied access to water and toilets, they were even forbidden to move. If anybody attempted to stand up they were beaten by the police.&lt;ref name=Iltalehti/&gt; The article provides photograph of the Dornemanns showing large [[hematoma]]s over their bodies.

Members of the special fact-finding mission of [[State Duma|Russian Federation's Duma]] also visited the WCs of the detention area in temporary detention area in the D terminal of [[Port of Tallinn]], looking for blood stains caused by beatings erroneously reported by some newspapers, and found none.&lt;ref&gt;Postimees: [http://www.postimees.ee/010507/esileht/siseuudised/viimased_sundmused/258115.php Riigiduuma esindajate hinnangul on pronkssõdurit tükkideks lõigatud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907172655/http://www.postimees.ee/010507/esileht/siseuudised/viimased_sundmused/258115.php |date=2007-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarenkov also claimed that about 350 Russian-speaking police officers want to resign, or have already resigned, from Estonian police force so as not to participate in ostensibly violent actions to stop the unrest, such as mandatory beating of women and children.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Interfax: [http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/politics/2.html?id_issue=11724961 Русскоязычные полицейские подают заявления об уходе, не желая участвовать в насилии - Антифашистский комитет] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930232054/http://www.interfax.ru/r/B/politics/2.html?id_issue=11724961 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims have been refuted by Estonian police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Postimees: [http://www.postimees.ee/290407/esileht/siseuudised/257853.php Politsei: jutt lahkuvatest venelastest politseinikest on vale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914025942/http://www.postimees.ee/290407/esileht/siseuudised/257853.php |date=2007-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, the UN [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] has considered Estonia's report and expressed concern over "allegations of brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement personnel, especially with regard to the disturbances that occurred in Tallinn in April 2007, well documented by a detailed compilation of complaints".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayefsky.com/doc/estonia_t4_cat_39.doc|title=www.bayefsky.com/doc/estonia_t4_cat_39.doc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] (Council of Europe) has published its report on its 2007 visit to Estonia, stating that many of the persons detained by the police in connection with the April 2007 events in Tallinn were not granted all the fundamental safeguards (the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or another third party of their choice of their situation, the right of access to a lawyer, and the right of access to a doctor) from the outset of their detention: while many of the persons concerned were allowed to contact someone and to be assisted by a lawyer only when brought before a judge, a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to see a doctor whilst in police custody had been denied, even when they displayed visible injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/documents/est/2011-15-inf-eng.htm#_Toc187546649|title=CPT: Report: Estonia: Visit 09/05/2007-18/05/2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the relocation, the [[Embassy of Estonia in Moscow]] was besieged by protesters, including pro-Kremlin youth organisations ''[[Nashi (Ours)|Nashi]]'' and the ''[[Young Guard of United Russia]]''.

On Monday, April 30, Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet reported that "the situation had become much worse in the previous&lt;!--was: last--&gt; night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257966.php|title=Paet: ööga muutus olukord saatkonna juures hullemaks - Eesti uudised - Postimees.ee|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910164444/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257966.php|archivedate=2012-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is by now completely blocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258003.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915213205/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258003.php |archivedate=2007-09-15 |df= }} {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paet says that Estonia's foreign ministry had sent a [[Note verbale|note]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258005.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502032938/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258005.php |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }} {{et icon}}, also reported by Russian media: {{cite web |url=http://rian.ru/world/relations/20070430/64681928.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009214052/http://www.rian.ru/world/relations/20070430/64681928.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Russia's foreign ministry, due to Russia's apparent unwillingness and impotency to defend the embassy building and its staff (which violates [[diplomatic immunity|Diplomatic law]], especially the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]]). Estonia's foreign ministry claims that the life and health of the diplomats and their family members residing in Moscow have been directly threatened.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384003 {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonia's president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] expressed his astonishment that Russia has – despite the promises of foreign minister Lavrov – not taken actions to protect the diplomatic personnel. In Ilves' opinion, the ostensible powerlessness of Russia's defense services (e.g. [[OMON]]) is especially surprising, given their quick work when dispersing meetings of Russian opposition forces.&lt;ref&gt;As images show, the protesters have entered into embassy territory. E.g.

On the same day,&lt;!--2007-04-30--&gt; members of the crowd protesting before the embassy declared that if Estonian authorities would not set a date for the restoration of the Bronze Soldier statue in its former prominent place, they would begin demolishing the Estonian embassy building on May 1 (traditionally also Labour Day, important in Russia and the former [[Soviet Union]]). The building itself was covered with graffiti and stones were thrown at it.

During the night, protesters, both from pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]] parties, were playing and singing aloud famous [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war marches]] of the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; They called the Estonians [[Fascist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

On May 3, the ambassador Kaljurand left Moscow on a two-week vacation.
The protesters ended their blockade the same day. There has been speculation that the vacation
was suggested by
Germany's Foreign Minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (by means of behind-the-scenes [[realpolitik]])
to soothe Russian-Estonian tensions.

On May 1, Estonian foreign minister [[Urmas Paet]] suggested to consider calling off the upcoming EU-Russia Summit that was due to take place on 18 May: "We consider it necessary that the European Union react in the toughest way to Russia's behavior.

Spokesperson for German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] told that the summit will not be postponed, but
European Commission said that a decision to raise the issue at the EU-Russia Summit depends on the development of the current situation.&lt;ref name="euractiv"/&gt; Commission spokesperson Christiane Hohmann said: "We share the concerns about the increasing violence around the Estonian embassy in Moscow and we strongly urge the Russian authorities to implement their obligations under the Vienna Convention for diplomatic relations."&lt;ref name="euractiv"/&gt;

===Threatened and alleged sanctions===
On May 3, 2007, Russia suddenly announced plans for repairs to railway lines to Estonia, disrupting oil and coal exports to Estonia. As a result, oil companies scurried to secure alternative export routes. Normally Estonia's ports handle about a quarter of such shipments from Russia to world markets. Although Russia denied it was imposing economic sanctions or taking politically inspired action against Estonia, it is suspected that the sudden railway repair plan is connected to the row over the war memorial.&lt;ref&gt;S. WAGSTYL, "Russia rail move to hit Estonia supply line" in the ''[[Financial Times]]'', May 3, 2007, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinctly, many participants in the blockade believe that what were characterised as "riots" by Estonian official sources were actually a peaceful political demonstration and that Dmitri (also spelt Dmitry) Ganin, the man that died in the riots died through police brutality while attempting to defend the monument.&lt;ref&gt;ITAR-TASS: [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11488124&amp;PageNum=0 Estonia (sic) metropolitan denounces violence in Tallinn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184818/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11488124&amp;PageNum=0 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ITAR-TASS: [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11488690&amp;PageNum=0 Meetings and rallies banned in Estonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204509/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11488690&amp;PageNum=0 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPL: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384177 Rahutustes pussitatud Dmitri rüüstas poode]&lt;/ref&gt;  He has been ceremonially declared a "hero of Russia" by activists involved in the blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-04-29-estonia-russia_N.htm|title=Estonia blames Russian media for lies - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaanus Piirsalu, [http://jaanuspiirsalu.blogspot.com/2007/04/vene-noorte-uus-eeskuju-dmitri.html Vene noorte uus eeskuju — Dmitri], April 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dmitri Linter===
{{Update|date=January 2010}}

On May 4, Rambler-news reported that Mr. Linter had been taken by the Estonian law enforcement from the [[Mustamäe]] hospital under an [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous line]], and that his health and whereabouts had been withheld from his family since.&lt;ref name=Marina&gt;[http://www.rambler.ru/news/russia/0/10282539.html ''Wife of the Nochnoy Dozor's leader pleas to free her husband'']{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [[Rambler (portal)|Rambler-news]] 4 May 2007 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claim were soon refuted by the State Procurature, whose official release declares that "[Linter] was taken to the hospital because he claimed to have "various ills", he was given a full medical and declared healthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/280407/esileht/siseuudised/257797.php|title=Kohus võttis Öise Vahtkonna liidri vahi alla  - Eesti uudised - Postimees.ee|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915083026/http://www.postimees.ee/280407/esileht/siseuudised/257797.php|archivedate=2012-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement response==
&lt;!---{{relevance}}
{{NPOV-section}} Agreement (see talk) currently to include the development of controversy in this article ---&gt;

The police are treating the riots as disorderly conduct (a [[misdemeanor]] under Estonian law) or severe disorderly conduct committed in a group (a [[felony]] under Estonian law), depending on the circumstances of any particular incident, and are proceeding accordingly.  About 1,000 suspected rioters were arrested.  Acts of vandalism and looting are treated separately, and processed as criminal incidents separate from the rioting.

Three men ([[Dmitri Linter]], [[Maksim Reva]] and an 18-year-old school boy [[Mark Siryk|Mark Sirõk]]&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;)have been detained under a court order for up to 6 months, pending investigation of the suspicion of organising riots (a [[felony]] under Estonian law punishable of imprisonment of up to 5 years).&lt;ref&gt;Postimees: [http://www.postimees.ee/280407/esileht/siseuudised/257797.php Kohus võttis Öise Vahtkonna liidri vahi alla] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915083026/http://www.postimees.ee/280407/esileht/siseuudised/257797.php |date=2012-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postimees: [http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257965.php Märuli organiseerimises kahtlustatav vahistati teel kodanikuõpetuse eksamile] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120907042647/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257965.php |date=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were concerns about the health of Mark Sirõ, who has [[Haemophilia]], but his attorney stated that he had no complaints.&lt;ref name="adv"/&gt;

Since the riots took place in the centre of the city, after hours of tension, many thousands of frames of photographic and video material of the events are available, both from journalists and security cameras and from witnesses among general public (who usually used cellphone cameras).  The police have gathered a number of such photographs depicting unidentified suspects on a website at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014002826/http://tuvasta.politsei.ee/ Identification of Persons] (not available from outside Estonia while a foreign [[DDoS]] attack on Estonian government servers is underway&lt;ref&gt;Government Communication Office Briefing Room: [http://www.valitsus.ee/brf/index.php?id=282992&amp;tpl=1007&amp;external=&amp;search=&amp;aasta= Malicious cyber attacks against Estonia come from abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025711/http://www.valitsus.ee/brf/index.php?id=282992&amp;tpl=1007&amp;external=&amp;search=&amp;aasta= |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F-Secure Web log: [http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001181 Large attacks against websites run by the Estonian government]&lt;/ref&gt;) and asked the public to identify such unidentified people.

The police have also called for rioters and looters to turn themselves in voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;Postimees: [http://www.postimees.ee/290407/esileht/krimi/257874.php Politsei kutsub märatsenud noori end ise üles andma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501040112/http://postimees.ee/290407/esileht/krimi/257874.php |date=2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aiding law enforcement in investigating one's own unlawful acts, including turning oneself in before an arrest warrant has been issued, is considered a meritorious deed and grounds for lessening punishment under Estonian law.

218 out of almost 300 vandals, who were arrested during events on 26.–28. April, had a previous criminal record.&lt;ref name ="vandals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etv24.ee/index.php?0574636|title=ERR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/080507/esileht/siseuudised/viimased_sundmused/259481.php|title=Enamik aprilli lõpu mürglis vahistatutest on varem karistatud - Arhiiv - Postimees: Värsked uudised Eestist ja välismaalt|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916042008/http://www.postimees.ee/080507/esileht/siseuudised/viimased_sundmused/259481.php|archivedate=2007-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among their previous crimes are 45 drug-related violations, 91 larcenies and 18 robberies.&lt;ref name ="vandals"/&gt;

===Trials===
On June 27, 2007, the media reported of the first batch of [[trial]]s involving the prosecutors requesting non-suspended sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Postimees June 27, 2007: [https://archive.is/20130821023732/http://postimees.ee/270607/esileht/krimi/267676.php Massirahutuste telekangelasi ähvardab reaalne vangistus] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jevgeni Kazakov, 21, who was infamously pictured as the gleeful looter clutching a half-liter bottle of Sprite, a pack of Orbit chewing gum and two packs of Libresse female sanitary pads, was convicted through the ''negotiation procedure'' (comparable to [[plea bargain]] of [[common law]] legal systems) on June 27, 2007 and sentenced to one year in prison, with two months to be served immediately and the rest suspended for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;Postimees June 28, 2007: [http://postimees.ee/280607/esileht/krimi/268931.php Kohus saatis pronksööl rüüstamas käinud koka vangi]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 26, 2007, the media reported that Artur Kivik, 19, was sentenced to 2 month "shock incarceration". Sven Anniko, 18, was sentenced to one year in prison suspended for 3 years. Raido, 20, had been convicted and have to pay fine of 2000 EEK. Both Sven and Raido participated in looting of Hugo Boss store and stole some wine from convenience store.&lt;ref&gt;rus.delfi.ee June 26, 2007: [http://rus.delfi.ee/archive/article.php?id=16276209&amp;categoryID=309647&amp;ndate=1182805200 Оправданы трое участников беспорядков в Таллинне] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another accused looter, one 23-year-old Jevgeni (last name not published), reached an agreement of conviction and sentence of immediate one-year imprisonment with the prosecutor, but withdrew from it in front of judge.&lt;ref name='pm-jevgeni23-withdrew'&gt;Postimees July 3, 2007: [http://postimees.ee/030707/esileht/krimi/270100.php Pronksöö rüüstamistes süüdistatav loobus kokkuleppest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917000326/http://www.postimees.ee/030707/esileht/krimi/270100.php |date=2007-09-17 }} {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a suspended four-year imprisonment from an earlier conviction; this agreed conviction would have brought him a total of five years immediate real imprisonment.&lt;ref name='pm-jevgeni23-withdrew'/&gt; According to the Estonian laws regarding criminal proceedings, his case will now be reviewed by the prosecutor and investigators, and will likely go to a full trial afterwards.

A vandal, Sergei Dolgov, who has no Estonian citizenship but had been convicted before, was convicted in the felony of ''violation of public order during rioting'', over throwing rocks at policemen and vandalising lawn in front of [[Estonian National Library]].  He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 27 August 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/270807/esileht/krimi/279167.php Pronksööl politseinikele vastu hakanud mees sai tingimisi karistuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830045605/http://www.postimees.ee/270807/esileht/krimi/279167.php |date=2007-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2007, the harshest sentence has been that of [[Vjatšeslav Zjunin]], who was sentenced to a year of real imprisonment for looting and had an outstanding suspended sentence from an earlier conviction.  Most vandals and looters have been sentenced to community service or relatively small fines, however.&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 22 August 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/230807/esileht/siseuudised/278189.php Aprillivandaalid saavad leebeid karistusi] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130213033816/http://www.postimees.ee/230807/esileht/siseuudised/278189.php |date=2013-02-13 }} by Risto Berendson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activists' Trial===

Four [[Nochnoy Dozor (advocacy group)|Nochnoy Dozor]] activists have gone on trial in Estonia in January 2008, charged with fomenting unrest during the removal of a [[Bronze Soldier]] war memorial. [[Dmitri Linter]], [[Maksim Reva]], [[Mark Sirők]] and [[Dmitri Klenski]] could face up to five years in prison.&lt;ref name=BBCTrial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7187437.stm|title=Estonia trial of Russia activists|date=14 January 2008|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2009 the 4 activists, charged with organization of riots during Bronze Night, were found not guilty by the District Court of Harjumaa.  The prosecutor has appealed the ruling, citing numerous legal deficiencies. The acquittal, however, was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;V. Pettai M. Molder [http://www.webcitation.org/5vj55wWCv?url=http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/Reports/NIT%2D2010%2DEstonia%2Dfinal%2Dfinal.pdf Estonia p. 207]// Nations in Transit. [[Freedom House]] 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===

In relation to the rioting, 1200 people were arrested and 491 declared suspects of particular crimes.  As of 11 January 2009, 125 people have been convicted.  For 283 suspects, the criminal cases were ended without charges.

On most of the trials, the charges pressed were plundering during riots, vandalism during riots, arson during riots and disobedience of lawful police orders.  125 people so charged were convicted, one acquitted, and 10 are pending (including Linter, Reva, Sirők and Klenski).

Most of the damages caused by rioting were compensated by the government's reserve fund.  While the Ministry of Treasury undertook gathering and combining the debts so as to collect on them from the convicts, collection on many of them is unlikely due to the different focus of the investigations.  In particular, the Ministry of Treasury has paid out 25.6 million crowns of compensation; so far, 66 convicts have been billed for a total of 2.1 million crowns of damages.  As of mid-December 2008, less than 85 000 crowns of damages had been paid by the guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[[ERR Uudised]] 11 January 2009 21:43: [http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?06150684 Pronksiöö mässuga seoses on süüdi mõistetud 125 inimest]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American Patriotism''' is [[patriotism]] involving cultural attachment to the [[United States of America]]. Identified as related to [[American nationalism|American Nationalism]], but many diverse ethnic backgrounds share the culture. Today, the United States is widely considered one of the most [[Cultural diversity|culturally diverse]] countries internationally.

== History ==
The French and Indian War ended in 1765 and the British Colonials needed more money to pay for the British troops still remaining in the Colonies, so they passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]]. After successfully getting the Stamp Act repealed, some Americans started to get suspicious of the British government. These [[Political radicalism|radicals]], led by [[Samuel Adams]], "created Committees of Correspondence in the various Colonies to begin the long, slow work toward gaining independence from England."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voices of the American Revolution: Stories of Men, Women, and Children Who Forged Our Nation : Stories of Men, Women, and Children Who Forged Our Nation|last=Haven|first=Kendell F.|publisher=Englewood, Colo : Libraries Unlimited.|year=2000|isbn=9781563088568|location=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.butte.idm.oclc.org/ehost/detail?sid=af846816-2b1f-402c-8bd7-5ad490cff589@sdc-v-sessmgr04&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EB&amp;lpid=lp_1&amp;rid=0#AN=80802&amp;db=nlebk|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, however, the British passed the [[Tea Act|Tea Tax]] in 1773 which aggravated the majority of the Colonists. Samuel Adams took this chance to rally the [[Boston Tea Party]]; "The taxes of Americans were being increased without any comment or input from the Colonies. Cries of 'Taxation without representation!' rang loud and clear from Savannah to Maine"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wiser of the radicals wanted nothing more than to dump the tea into the harbor, to avoid bloodshed, which they did successfully. However, some younger radicals, such as Thomas Moore, sought a more violent reaction. The aftermath included many American ports rejecting incoming tea; though some shipments were offloaded, no one wanted to claim the tea. Resulting rotten tea after 3 years of sitting on the shore, the tea was dumped into the harbor. Ports in Philadelphia and New York refused to unload the shipments, causing the ships to turn back to England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On July 4, 1776, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was ratified, declaring the first 13 North American colonies free from Britain's rule. It emphasizes basic [[human rights]], such as that "all [[Man|men]] are created equal," that people have "inalienable rights," and that people have the right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." On June 21, 1788, the principles and values of the [[Constitution of the United States]] were ratified and the first legislature was established on March 4, 1789.

The difference in fatality rates by road classification reflects the difference in road design and use. The Interstate System is designed for high speeds, efficient movement of people and goods over long distances, with no at-grade intersections. Drivers have a clear view of the road, traffic, and signs. Collectors and local roads, however, are designed to provide more land access and lesser mobility. They may have sharp curves, steeper grades, and sight restrictions.

This distance is typically both determined and constrained by the proximate edge of clear visibility, but it may be attenuated to a margin of which beyond hazards may reasonably be expected to spontaneously appear.

As the original common law driving rule preceding statutized traffic law, it is an ever important foundational rule in today's complex driving environment.

As a corollary to the rule that drivers generally must not pose an "immediate hazard" upon where or when they cannot assure such distance ahead is clear, it follows that others may presume that no vehicle is posing an "immediate hazard" from beyond where they can see with proper lookout. Where there are cross roads or side roads with view obstructions, the assured clear distance terminates at the closest path of potential users of the roadway until there is such a view which assures the intersection will remain clear. In such situations, approach speed must be reduced in preparation for entering or crossing a road or intersection or the unmarked pedestrian crosswalks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d1/275 |title=California Vehicle Code §275(a) |publisher=The State of California |quote="Crosswalk" is...That portion of a roadway included within the prolongation or connection of the boundary lines of sidewalks at intersections where the intersecting roadways meet at approximately right angles, except the prolongation of such lines from an alley across a street.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/vctop/vc/d11/c5/21950 |title=California Vehicle Code §21950(a)&amp;(c) |publisher=The State of California

When approaching an un-signalized intersection controlled by a [[stop sign]], the assured clear distance ahead is:

:&lt;math&gt;
ACDA_{si} = V \left( \sqrt{\frac{2d_i}{a_i}} + t_{pc} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Normal acceleration "{{math|a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}" for a passenger vehicle from a stop up to 20&amp;nbsp;mph is about 0.15g, with more than 0.3g being difficult to exceed.&lt;ref name="J.

====ACDA as a function of horizontal sight distance====
Horizontal clearance is measured from the edge of the traveled way to the bottom of the nearest object, tree trunk or shrub foliage mass face, plant setback, or mature growth.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets |edition=6th |year=2011 |publisher=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |isbn=978-1560515081 |url=https://bookstore.transportation.org/collection_detail.aspx?ID=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; Horizontal sight distance is not to be confused with the clear recovery zone which provides hazardous vegetation set-back to allow errant vehicles to regain control, and is exclusive to a mowed and limbed-up forest which can allow adequate sight distance, but unsafe recovery.&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; The height and lateral distance of plants restrict the horizontal sight distance, at times obscuring wildlife which may be spooked by an approaching vehicle and run across the road to escape with their [[herd]].&lt;ref name="deer"&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Targeting mitigation efforts: The role of speed limit and road edge clearance for deer–vehicle collisions |doi = 10.1002/jwmg.712 |journal =The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=2014 |volume=78 |issue = 4 |pages=679–688 |quote=speed limit reduction and road edge clearance are both powerful mitigation tools to reduce the number of [[Deer–vehicle collisions]].|last1 = Meisingset |first1 = Erling L |last2 = Loe |first2 = Leif E |last3 = Brekkum |first3 = Øystein |last4 = Mysterud |first4 = Atle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDOT"/&gt; This principle also applies to approaching vehicles and pedestrians at uncontrolled intersections and to a lesser degree by un-signalized intersections controlled by a [[yield sign]]. Horizontal sight distance "{{math|d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;}}" affects the ACDA because the time {{math|t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;|V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} it takes for an intercepting object, animal, pedestrian, or vehicle with speed "{{math|V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}" to transverse this distance after emerging from the proximate edge of lateral visibility affords a vehicle with speed "{{math|V}}" a clear distance of "{{math|V*t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}." Thus, the assured clear intercept distance "{{math|ACDA&lt;sub&gt;si&lt;/sub&gt;}}" is:

:&lt;math&gt;
ACDA_{si}=\frac{V d_{hsd}}{V_i}
&lt;/math&gt;

The faster one drives, the farther down-road an interceptor must be in order to be able to transverse the horizontal sight distance in time to collide, however this says nothing of whether the vehicle can stop by the end of this type of assured clear distance. Equating this distance to the total stopping distance and solving for speed yields one's maximum [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Relation to the basic speed rule|safe speed]] as purely dictated by the horizontal sight distance.

===Dynamic "following" distance===
The ACDA may also be dynamic as to the moving distance past which a motorist can be assured to be able to stay clear of a foreseeable dynamic hazard—such as to maintain a distance as to be able to safely swerve around a bicyclist should he succumb to a fall—without requiring a full stop beforehand, if doing so could be exercised with [[due care]] towards surrounding traffic. Quantitatively this distance is a function of the appropriate time gap and the operating speed: {{math|d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}t&lt;sub&gt;gap&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;}}. The assured clear distance ahead rule, rather than being subject to exceptions, is not really intended to apply beyond situations in which a vigilant ordinarily prudent person could or should anticipate.&lt;ref name="75 ALR.3d 327"/&gt; A common way to violate the dynamic ACDA is by [[tailgating]].

===Measurement===
The most accurate way to determine the ACDA is to directly measure it. Whereas this is impractical, [[Geometric design of roads#Profile|sight distance formulas]] can be used with less direct measurements as rough baseline estimates. The [[empirical]] assured clear distance ahead calculated with [[computer vision]], [[range finding]], [[traction control]], and [[Geographic information system|GIS]], such as by properly [[Computer programming|programming]] computer hardware used in [[autonomous cars]], can be recorded to later produce or color baseline ACDA and safe speed maps for accident investigation, traffic engineering, and show disparities between safe speed and 85th percentile "operating" speed.&lt;ref name="computer vision"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/magazine/the-dream-life-of-driverless-cars.html |title=Sightlines/The Dream Life of Driverless Cars |author=Geoff Manaugh |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=MM68 |date=November 15, 2015 |quote=One of the most significant uses of 3-D scanning in the years to come will not be by humans at all but by autonomous vehicles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-driving cars&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html |title=Google’s Driverless Cars Run Into Problem: Cars With Drivers |author1=Matt Richtel |author2=Conor Dougherty |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |page=A1 |date=September 2, 2015 |quote=Google’s fleet of autonomous test cars is programmed to follow the letter of the law. But it can be tough to get around if you are a stickler for the rules. ...

It leaves what is considered the safe distance between itself and the car ahead. ...Dmitri Dolgov, head of software for Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, said that one thing he had learned from the project was that human drivers needed to be “less idiotic.” ... The laser system mounted on top of the driverless car sensed that a vehicle coming the other direction was approaching the red light at higher-than-safe speeds. The Google car immediately jerked to the right in case it had to avoid a collision. }}&lt;/ref&gt; may have a higher safe speed than human driven vehicles for a given ACDA where computer perception-reaction times are nearly instantaneous.

===Discretion===
The Assured Clear Distance Ahead can be subjective to the baseline estimate of a [[ordinary care|reasonable person]] or be predetermined by law. For example, whether one should have reasonably foreseen that a road was not assuredly clear past 75–100 meters because of tractors or livestock which commonly emerge from encroaching blinding vegetation is on occasion dependent on societal experience within the locale. In certain urban environments, a straight, traffic-less, through-street may not necessarily be assuredly clear past the entrance of the nearest [[Geometric design of roads#Effects of insufficient sight distance|visually obstructed intersection]] as law.&lt;ref name="189 Cal. 335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="22 Cal. App. 2d 636"/&gt;&lt;ref name="139 Cal. App. 2d 65"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Human Factors"/&gt; Within the assured clear distance ahead, there is certainty that travel will be free from obstruction which is exclusive of a failure to appreciate a hazard. Collisions generally only occur within one's assured clear distance ahead which are "unavoidable" to them such that they have zero comparative negligence including [[Act of God|legal acts of god]] and abrupt unforeseeably wanton negligence by another party. Hazards which penetrate one's proximate edge of clear visibility and compromise their ACDA generally require evasive action.

====Seconds of distance to stop rule====

Drivers and law enforcement alike can apply elementary level arithmetic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corestandards.org/assets/CCSSI_Math%20Standards.pdf |title=Common Core State Standard for Mathematics |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |page=27 |quote=See 4th grade math level}}&lt;/ref&gt; towards a [[rule of thumb]] to estimate minimal stopping distance in terms of how many seconds of travel ahead at their current speed. For speed "{{math|&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;}}" in miles per hour, this rule of thumb is as follows:

:::&lt;math&gt;\color{Sepia}{t\approx\frac{v}{20} + 1 \quad \text{(Seconds of distance to stop rule)}}&lt;/math&gt;

If this distance is greater than the ACDA, they need to slow down. While most experienced drivers develop a broad [[intuition]] required by everyday braking,&lt;ref name="Gibson&amp;Crooks"/&gt; this rule of thumb can still benefit some to recalibrate expectations for rare hard braking, particularly from high speeds. Additional simple corrections can be made to compensate for the environment and driving ability. Read more about the [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Seconds of distance to stop rule 2|Seconds of Distance to Stop Rule]].

==ACDA Rule specific case generalized to the Basic Speed Law==
The ACDA distances are a principal component to be evaluated in the determination of the maximum safe speed (V&lt;sub&gt;BSL&lt;/sub&gt;) under the [[Speed limit#Reasonable speed|basic speed law]], without which the maximum safe speed cannot be determined. As mathematical statements are more precise than verbal statements alone,&lt;ref name="Hand rule"/&gt; the relation of the ACDA as a [[subset]] of the basic speed rule for land based vehicles may be objectively quantified as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
V_{BSL}= \begin{cases}
 \sqrt{(\mu +e)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + e) g d_{ACDA_s} } - (\mu+e) g t_{prt}, &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_s} \le V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
2 g (\mu + e) (\frac{d_{hsd}}{v_i}-t_{prt}), &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_{si1}} &lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
2 g (\mu + e )\left(\sqrt{\frac{2 d_{sl}}{a_i}}+t_{pc}-t_{prt}\right), &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_{si2}} &lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl}\\
\\
 \frac{d_{ACDA_d}}{t_g}, &amp; \text{if } V_{ACDA_d}&lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{cs} \text{ or } V_{cl} \\
\\
 \sqrt{ \frac{(\mu+e) g r}{1-\mu e}}, &amp; \text{if } V_{cs}&lt;V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cl} \\
\\
 V_{cl}, &amp; \text{if } V_{cl}&lt; V_{ACDA_s} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si 1}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_{si 2}} \text{ or } V_{ACDA_d} \text{ or } V_{cs}
\end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the variable "e" is the [[sine]] of the [[angle]] of inclination of the road's [[slope]]. For a level road this value is zero, and for [[Small-angle approximation|small angles]] it approximates the road's percent [[Grade (slope)|grade]] divided by one hundred.
:&lt;math&gt;
e = \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \approx \tan(\theta) = \frac{\%grade}{100}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{refn|
In most jurisdictions, [[judicial notice]] shall be taken of the [[braking distance#Total stopping distance|total stopping distance]], and such notice is therefore logically and substantively taken of the maximum speed permitted to brake within the stopping distance as applied to the ACDA. The latter is merely the [[inverse function]] of the former. Furthermore, fundamental mathematical relationships are themselves subject to judicial notice.

&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA(s)}=\sqrt{\mu^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 \mu g d_{ACDA_s} } - \mu g t_{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, using the &lt;math&gt;\mu=0.7&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}=1.5&lt;/math&gt; values that produced [http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-880/ Code of Virginia § 46.2-880 Tables of speed and stopping distances], one simply obtains the same velocities that produced the [[braking distance#Total stopping distance|stopping distance]] in the statute:

[[Metric system|Metric]] ([[International System of Units|SI]]) – Speed in [[km/h]] from distance in [[Metre|meters]]:
&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA} \approx \sqrt{1372.3+ 177.8 d_{ACDA} } - 37.0&lt;/math&gt;

[[United States customary units|US customary]] – Speed in [[Miles per hour|MPH]] from distance in [[Foot (unit)|feet]]:
&lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA} \approx \sqrt{529.8+ 20.9 d_{ACDA} } - 23.0&lt;/math&gt;
|group="Note" |name="BSL formula example"}}

The maximum velocity permitted by the Assured Clear Distance Ahead is controlling of safe speed (V&lt;sub&gt;BSL&lt;/sub&gt;) for only the top and two cases. Safe speed may be greater or less than the actual [[speed limit|legal speed limit]] depending upon the conditions along the road.&lt;ref name="J.

See reference [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Derivations|V&lt;sub&gt;BSL&lt;/sub&gt; derivations]] for basic physics explanation.

===ACDA: forward line-of-sight===
For the top case, the maximum speed is governed by the assured clear "line-of-sight", as when the "following distance" aft of forward traffic and "steering control" are both adequate. Common examples include when there is no vehicle to be viewed, or when there is a haze or fog that would prevent visualizing a close vehicle in front. This maximum velocity is denoted by the case variable &lt;math&gt;V_{ACDA_s}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[coefficient of friction|friction coefficient]] is symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;—and itself a function of the [[Treadwear rating|tire type]] and [[road slipperiness|road conditions]], the distance &lt;math&gt;d_{ACDA_s}&lt;/math&gt; is the static ACDA, the constant &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gravity of Earth|acceleration of gravity]], and interval &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mental chronometry|perception-reaction time]]—usually between 1.0 and 2.5 seconds.&lt;ref name="Taoka"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taoka |first1=George T. |title=Brake Reaction Times of Unalerted Drivers |journal=ITE Journal |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= 19–21 |date=March 1989 |url=http://www.ite.org/membersonly/itejournal/pdf/jca89a19.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen&amp;Sivak"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Perception-response time to unexpected roadway hazards |author1=Paul L.

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of ACDA: forward line-of-sight|Table of safe speed versus forward line-of-sight]]

===ACDA: horizontal line-of-sight===
The second case describes the relationship of horizontal sight distance on safe speed. It is the maximum speed at which a vehicle can come to a full stop before an object, with speed V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, can intercept after having emerged and traveled across the horizontal sight distance "d&lt;sub&gt;hsd&lt;/sub&gt;." Urban and residential areas have horizontal sight distances that tend to be closely obstructed by parked cars, utility poles, street furnishing, fencing, signage, and landscaping, but have slower intercepting speeds of children, pedestrians, backing cars, and domestic animals. These interceptors combined with dense usage results in collisions that are more probable and much more likely to inflict harm to an outside human life. In rural areas, swift-moving spooked wildlife such as [[deer]],&lt;ref name="deer"/&gt; [[elk]], [[Moose#Vehicle collisions|moose]], and [[pronghorn|antelope]] are more likely to intercept a roadway at over 30&amp;nbsp;mph (48 kph). Wildlife will frequently transit across a road before a full stop is necessary, however collisions with large [[Game (hunting)|game]] are foreseeably lethal, and a driver generally has a duty not to harm his or her passengers. The foreseeable intercept speed or defectively designed horizontal sight distance may vary "reasonably" with [[judicial discretion]].

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of ACDA: horizontal line-of-sight|Table of safe speed versus horizontal line-of-sight]]

===ACDA: intersectional setback===
This third case regards safe speed around un-signalized intersections where a driver on an uncontrolled through street has a duty to slow down in crossing an intersection and permit [[stop sign|controlled]] drivers to be able pass through the intersection without danger of collision.&lt;ref name="213 Cal. 644"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Page v. Mazzei, 213 Cal. 644 |vol=213 |reporter=Official California Reports |opinion=644 |pinpoint= |court=[[Supreme Court of California]] |date=21 September 1931 |url=https://casetext.com/case/page-v-mazzei |accessdate= |quote=Where a car has actually entered an intersection before the other approaches it, the driver of the first car has the right to assume that he will be given the right of way and be permitted to pass through the intersection without danger of collision. He has a right to assume that the driver of the other car will obey the law, slow down, and yield the right of way, if slowing down be necessary to prevent a collision. ( Keyes v. Hawley, 100 Cal. App. 53, 60 [279 Pac. 674].) Nor is a plaintiff required to yield the right of way to one a considerable distance away whose duty it is to slow down in crossing an intersection. See [http://www.lexisnexis.com/clients/CACourts/ Official Reports Opinions Online]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver on the through street must anticipate and hence not approach at an unsafe speed which would prevent another driver from being able to enter while traffic was some distance away, or would be unsafe to a driver who has already established control of the intersection under a prudent acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, from a stop at a limit line a distance d&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; away.&lt;ref name=AASHO&gt;{{cite book |title=A Policy on Geometric Design of Rural Highways |publisher=American Association of State Highway and Traffic Officials |date=1969 |page=394 |quote=Where an obstruction, which cannot be removed except at prohibitive cost, fixes the vertices of the sight triangle at points that are less than the safe stopping distances from the intersection, vehicles may be brought to a stop (after sighting other vehicles on the intersecting road) only if they are traveling at a speed appropriate to the available sight distance.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACDA: following distance===
The pedantic fourth case applies when the dynamic ACDA "following distance" (d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) is less than the static ACDA "line-of-sight" distance (d&lt;sub&gt;ACDA&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;). A classic instance of this occurs when, from a visibility perspective, it would be safe to drive much faster were it not for a slower-moving vehicle ahead. As such, the dynamic ACDA is governing the basic speed rule, because in maintaining this distance, one cannot drive at a faster speed than that matching the forward vehicle. The "time gap" t&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; or "time cushion" is the time required to travel the dynamic ACDA or "following distance" at the [[operating speed]]. Circumstances depending, this cushion might be manifested as a [[two-second rule]] or three-second rule.

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of following distances|Table of 2-second following distances]]

===Critical speed===
In the fifth case, critical speed V&lt;sub&gt;cs&lt;/sub&gt; applies when road curvature is the factor limiting safe speed. A vehicle which exceeds this speed will [[slip angle|slide]] out of its lane. Critical speed is a function of curve [[radius]] "r," [[superelevation]] or banking "e," and friction coefficient "μ;"&lt;ref name="J. Stannard Baker"/&gt; the constant "g" again is the acceleration of gravity. However, most motorists will not tolerate a lateral acceleration exceeding 0.3g (μ=0.3) above which many will panic.&lt;ref name="Glennon-Hill"&gt;{{cite book |title=Roadway Safety and Tort Liability |edition=2 |publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, Inc. |author1=John C. Glennon |author2=Paul F.

Inc. |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of critical speed is often applied to the problem of [[traffic calming]], where curvature is both used to govern maximum road speed, and used in [[traffic circles]] as a device to force drivers to obey their [[Duty of care|duty]] to slow down when approaching an intersection.&lt;ref name="106 Cal. App. 2d 294"/&gt;&lt;ref name="179 Cal. 349"/&gt;

See [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead#Table of critical speeds|Table of curvatures and critical speeds]]

===Surface control===
The bottom case is invoked when the maximum velocity for surface control V&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; is otherwise reached. Steering control is independent from any concept of clear distance ahead. If a vehicle cannot be controlled so as to safely remain within its lane above a certain speed and circumstance, then it is irrelevant how assuredly clear the distance is ahead. Using the example of the previous case, the safe speed on a curve may be such that a driver experiences a lateral acceleration of less than 0.3g despite that the vehicle may not slide until it experiences 0.8g.

===Relationship of posted speed limits to the explicitness of driver care standard===
[[File:2005 winter road dipped beam.jpg|thumb|Distance seen with [[ECE Regulations|ECE]] light by night]]

Many people are challenged by the concept of ''unsafe speed'' because they find it vague and arbitrary.&lt;ref name="void for vagueness"/&gt; It is well known that people instead resolve such challenges by [[attribute substitution]],&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282 |citeseerx=10.1.1.194.6554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in this case can mean simply emulating the behaviors of others. In accord with the [[cultural theory of risk]], indeed a substantial part of a driver's [[risk perception]] comes from comparing their contemplated conduct to the behavior of others; this includes the safeness of a given speed, notwithstanding the actual risk. As a result of this uncorrected vagueness, group behavior can often be in opposition to safe speed and still be governing a hazardous posted speed limit.

To be able to guarantee "assurance" beyond proximate edge of clear visibility, in doing so exempting ACDA duty, a road must be designed and maintained such that there is not a chance of obstruction in one's lane beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. A road's vertical [[Geometric design of roads#Profile|profile]] must be assured to have such a curvature as not to hide hazards close behind its crests. [[Discretion]] for drivers and pedestrians to enter onto a potentially occupied lane from a side street must be assuredly eliminated such as with fences, merge lanes, or signalized access. There must also be an assurance of no opportunity for animals and debris to enter from side lots, and that there are continuous multi-hourly maintenance [[highway patrol|patrols]] performed. Furthermore, such road sections must be distinguished from other roads so that the driver could clearly and immediately know when he or she may or may not take such extended "assurance." Few roads might meet these requirements except some of the highest functional classification [[controlled-access highways]] such as [[freeways]] and [[autobahn]]s.&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt;

Even if such criteria are met, the law must also exempt driver liability for maintaining clear distance ahead. In most democracies, such liability for failures of the distance to remain clear beyond line of sight would ultimately be transferred to its taxpayers.&lt;ref name="Kenworthy"/&gt; This only generally occurs when governments have been tasked by constituents or their courts to take the responsibly to design and maintain roadways that "assure" the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility. Pressures to make such changes may arise from cultural [[Wikibooks:Professionalism/Diane Vaughan and the normalization of deviance|normalization of deviance]] and unnecessary risk, misunderstanding the purpose of the road [[functional classification]] system, underestimation of increased risk, and reclamation of commute time.&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt;

One of the greatest difficulties created by such an extension of the ACDA is the frequency at which roads reduce their [[functional classification]]&lt;ref name="FHWA"/&gt; unbeknownst to drivers who continue unaware they have lost this extended "assurance" or don't understand the difference. Such nuance in applicable jurisdictions is a prolific source of accidents.&lt;ref name="106 Cal.

[[File:Free body.svg|thumb|Forces on a vehicle skidding down a grade of angle ''θ''.]]

Starting with [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's Second law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]] and the Laws of [[Friction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = F_\text{friction} + F_\text{gravity} \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = \mu F_\text{normal} + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total} = \mu m g \cos{\theta} + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the net [[force]] to [[mass]] times [[acceleration]]:

:&lt;math&gt; F_\text{total}= m a &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mu m g \cos{\theta} + m g \sin{\theta} = m a &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a = g(\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta}) &lt;/math&gt;

Invoking the [[Equations of motion#Uniform acceleration|equations of motion]] and substituting acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{v^2}{ 2 a} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta})} &lt;/math&gt;

[[Small-angle approximation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \sin{\theta} \approx \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \cos{\theta} \approx 1 - \frac {\theta^2}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the small angle approximations, and exploiting that the product of a small angle squared, in radians, with the friction coefficient, θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;μ, is insignificant (for a steep 20% slope and a good friction coef. of 0.8, this equals (.2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;x0.8≈0.03):

:&lt;math&gt; d \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g[\mu (1 - \frac {\theta^2}{2} ) + \theta]} \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu + \theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, the total stopping distance is the sum of the braking and perception-reaction distances:

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} = d_\text{braking} + d_\text{perception-reaction} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} \approx \frac{v^2}{ 2 g(\mu + \theta)} + v t_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero as preparation to solve for velocity:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2 g (\mu + \theta)} v^2 + v t_{prt} - d_\text{total} \approx 0 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Completing the square]] or invoking the [[quadratic formula]] to find the solution:

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt{(\mu + \theta)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + \theta) g d_\text{total} } - ( \mu + \theta ) g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Use [[small-angle approximation]] to obtain a more field-able version of the above solution in terms of percent [[Grade (slope)|grade]]/100 "[[superelevation|e]]" instead of an angle θ in radians:

:&lt;math&gt; \theta \approx \tan(\theta) = \frac{\%grade}{100} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the angle as described produces the form of the formula of case 1 ():

:&lt;math&gt; V_{BSL1} \approx \sqrt{(\mu + e)^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 (\mu + e) g d_{ACDA} } - (\mu+e) g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

The Basic Speed Law constrains the Assured Clear Distance Ahead to the total stopping distance, and the small angle value of [[Grade (slope)|road grades]] approximates the [[superelevation]] "e."

Many roadways are level, in which case the small angle approximations or superelevation may be dropped altogether:
:&lt;math&gt; V_{BSL1} = \sqrt{\mu^2 g^2 t_{prt}^2+ 2 \mu g d_{ACDA} } - \mu g t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

''This model ignores the effects of [[air drag]], [[rolling resistance]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], and [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] as a vehicle's great [[momentum]] and [[weight]] dominate these factors; they increase the complexity of the formulas while insubstantially changing the outcomes in practically all driving situations except ultra-low-mass [[bicycles]] stopping from inherently dangerously high speeds; usability to the layman and conformance with current standard engineering assumptions&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VA Table"/&gt; is the objective and a vehicle's [http://hpwizard.com/aerodynamics.html lift factor] is often inaccessible.

The time required to travel down a road at speed v to said obstruction of distance d away:

:&lt;math&gt; t= \frac{d}{v} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two times:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{v} = \frac{d_i}{v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for this distance:
:&lt;math&gt; d=\frac{v d_{i}}{v_i} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating this to the total stopping distance, which is the sum of braking and perception-reaction distances:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v d_{i}}{v_i} = \frac{v^2}{2 g (\mu + e)} + v t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero, and factoring out a v:
:&lt;math&gt; v \left[ \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left(t_{prt} - \frac{ d_{i}}{v_i}\right) \right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the non-trivial case (or may distribute v in equation above and apply quadratic formula for same result):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + (t_{prt} - \frac{ d_{i}}{v_i}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the above equation, which provides the maximum safe speed as a function of horizontal sight distance, intercept velocity, and road-tire friction coefficient:

The time required for a vehicle to enter a controlled intersection from a stop is the sum of the perception time (t&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), the time required to actuate an automatic transmission or shift to first gear (t&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;), and the time to accelerate and enter or traverse the road (t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;). The sum of the first two quantities is t&lt;sub&gt;pc&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; t= t_p + t_c + t_a = t_{pc} + t_a &lt;/math&gt;

The time required for a vehicle entering with acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to transect the sum of the setback and shoulder distances d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; under uniform acceleration a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a stop via the [[Equations of motion#Constant linear acceleration: collinear vectors|equations of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt; t_a =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } &lt;/math&gt;

The time required to travel down a road at speed v to said obstruction of distance d away:

:&lt;math&gt; t= \frac{d}{v} &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the two times:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{v} =\sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for this distance:
:&lt;math&gt; d = v \left( \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Equating this to the total stopping distance, which is the sum of braking and perception-reaction distances:
:&lt;math&gt; v \left( \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } + t_{pc} \right) = \frac{v^2}{2 g (\mu + e)} + v t_{prt} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolating zero, and factoring out a v:
:&lt;math&gt; v [ \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left( t_{prt} - \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } - t_{pc} \right) ] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the non-trivial case (or may distribute v in equation above and apply quadratic formula for same result):
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v}{2 g (\mu + e)} + \left( t_{prt} - \sqrt{ \frac{ 2 d_i }{a_i} } - t_{pc} \right) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The normal force is equal and opposite to the sum of the gravitational and centripetal components:

:&lt;math&gt; m \frac{v^2}{r} \cos{ \theta } = \mu (m g \cos{\theta} + m \frac{v^2}{r} \sin{ \theta } ) + m g \sin{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

Isolate &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; terms:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{v^2}{r} \cos{ \theta } - \mu \frac{v^2}{r} \sin{ \theta } = g (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) &lt;/math&gt;

Then solve for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; v^2 ( \cos{ \theta } - \mu \sin{ \theta } ) = g r (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain:
:&lt;math&gt; v = \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu \cos{\theta} + \sin{\theta} ) } { \cos{ \theta } - \mu \sin{ \theta } } } &lt;/math&gt;
This is the full solution, however most corners are banked at less than 15 degrees (≈28% grade), so in such conditions, a fieldable small angle approximation may be used.

Substituting [[small-angle approximation]]s sinθ≈θ, cos≈1-θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2:

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r [\mu (1- \frac {\theta^2} {2}) + \theta ] } { 1- \frac {\theta^2}{2} - \mu \theta } } &lt;/math&gt;

Exploit that a small angle squared, in radians, is insignificant by substituting θ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;≈0 which obtains the formula used in case 5 (also tanθ≈e):

:&lt;math&gt; v \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu + \theta ) } { 1 - \mu \theta } } \approx \sqrt { \frac{g r (\mu + e ) } { 1 - \mu e } } &lt;/math&gt;

The ''seconds-of-distance-to-stop rule'' is derived as follows.

We first obtain the total stopping distance and then convert it into travel time, which is more easily applicable by the driver.

:&lt;math&gt; d_\text{total} = d_\text{braking} + d_\text{perception-reaction} &lt;/math&gt;

Invoking the [[Equations of motion#Uniform acceleration|equations of motion]],

:&lt;math&gt;d_\text{braking} = \frac{v^2}{2 a}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;d_\text{total} = \frac{v^2}{2 a} + v t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a=\mu g&lt;/math&gt;.

The time it takes to casually traverse the stopping distance at the travel speed is

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{d_\text{total}}{v}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the former into the latter,

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{2 \mu g}+t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be simplified into the rule-of-thumb form

:&lt;math&gt;t=C \cdot v + t_\text{prt}&lt;/math&gt;

by noting that

:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{f}{2 \mu g}&lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting (US Customary units)

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \approx \tfrac{7}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (dry) or &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (wet) or &lt;math&gt;\lessapprox \tfrac{2}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (snow);  &lt;math&gt;g \approx 32\;{\rm ft}\;{\rm s}^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f=\tfrac{22\;{\rm ft}\;{\rm s}^{-1}}{15\;{\rm mi\;h^{-1}}}&lt;/math&gt; (convert mph to fps); &lt;math&gt;t_{prt}=1.5\;{\rm s}&lt;/math&gt;,

we have

:&lt;math&gt;C=\tfrac{1}{30}&lt;/math&gt; (dry),  &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{20}&lt;/math&gt; (wet), and &lt;math&gt; \tfrac{1}{10}&lt;/math&gt; (snow).

This results in a seconds-of-distance-to-stop rule (in MPH) of

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{30} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (dry pavement)

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{20} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (wet pavement)

:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{v}{10} + 1.5&lt;/math&gt; (snow, hard-packed).

The dry rule does allow one to travel faster in dry weather, but expect emergency deceleration to be a bit uncomfortable. If one desires to remember only one rule, use the wet one. However, because the difference between wet and dry is half-a-second at 30 MPH and one second at 60 MPH, and because dividing by two is easier than three, we can use a correctable rule of thumb:

:::&lt;math&gt;\color{Sepia}{t\approx\frac{v}{20} + 1 \quad \text{(general rule of thumb)}}&lt;/math&gt; ''(instead add 2+ in wet or complex conditions, and also instead divide by 10 in snow/ice)''

For example, a speed of {{convert|60|mph}} corresponds to stopping distance of 4 seconds' travel at 60&amp;nbsp;mph. Drivers that require additional perception-reaction time, such as novices, elderly, or those in complex or adverse environments, can benefit by adding additional seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Effects of uncertainty, transmission type, driver age and gender on brake reaction and movement time. |author1=Lora Warshawsky-Livne |author2=David Shinar |journal=Journal of Safety Research |volume=33 |issue=1 |date=Spring 2000 |pages=117–128 |issn=0022-4375 |doi=10.1016/S0022-4375(02)00006-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022437502000063 |quote=Perception-reaction time increased significantly from 0.32 to 0.42 s (P&lt;.05) as uncertainty increased but brake-movement time did not change.

The time to traverse your stopping distance at travel speed should not be confused with the braking time to come to a full stop, which is a number nearly twice this value ( {{math| &lt;var&gt;t&lt;/var&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|&lt;var&gt;v&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;VAR&gt;&amp;mu;&lt;/VAR&gt; g}}+t&lt;sub&gt;ptr&lt;/sub&gt;}} ). As one is continually slowing down while braking, it will naturally take longer to get to the stopping limit.

A more correct perception-reaction time of one-and-a-half seconds is commonly used by the mathematically inclined.&lt;ref name="VA Table"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olsen&amp;Sivak"/&gt; Doing so to obtain your "seconds-of-distance-to-stop" for ''dry pavement'' and then converting time to actual distance by multiplying it by the travel velocity and {{math|{{sfrac|22|15}}}} to convert MPH to fps will yield results in close agreement with [http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-880/ this table].

Whereas most driving is done below {{convert|80|mph}}, ''maintaining a blanket 5 or 6 seconds of travel time to the edge of visibility'' ({{math|&lt;var&gt;t&lt;var&gt;{{=}}{{sfrac|80|20}}+1}}), ''will keep drivers in compliance with the ACDA rule in most simple highway driving conditions – day or night'' – with growing error towards safety at lower speeds.

On final note, slope has an effect on stopping distance. An additional second or so will need to be added when stopping while traveling down a steep incline, and conversely driving uphill will improve breaking.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt; This is accounting that a level road was assumed in the rule of thumb.

This table demonstrates why [[alley]]ways, [[parking lots]], [[parks]], and [[residential areas]] frequently set 5-15&amp;nbsp;mph speed limits when the side clearance from the road is less than 15 feet. An urban or residential street which permits a maximum speed limit of 25&amp;nbsp;mph under its very best conditions (roadsides cleared of visual obstructions past a 20-foot maintained [[right of way]]), may in practice be unsafe to drive at more than 10&amp;nbsp;mph within sections with utilized curbside parking. This table also suggests that the safe speed could be greater than a statutory 25&amp;nbsp;mph posted speed, where roadside clearance is sufficient such that no "foreseeable" object could emerge from the proximate edge of roadside visibility, transect the cleared area, and intercept the lane before the driver could come to a halt. However, wary road design engineers may have differing views of foreseeable intercept speeds than that reflected by the 85th percentile speed chosen by the public. This can have unfortunate consequences where a mass commuting public is unfamiliar with or does not appreciate specific local hazards. Narrow lane widths are purposely used for [[traffic calming]], because careful drivers universally choose their speed depending on the roadway width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/ |title=Urban Street Design Guide: Lane Width |publisher=National Association of City Transportation Officials |quote=as the width of the lane increased, the speed of the roadway increased}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard horizontal clearances are commonly set by [[AASHTO]] guidelines or a jurisdiction's department of transportation.&lt;ref name="AASHTO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/hdm/pdf/english/chp0300.pdf |title=CAHDM |pages=300–25 |quote=309.1 Horizontal Clearances for Highways: The horizontal clearance to all roadside objects should be based on engineering judgment with the objective of maximizing the distance between roadside objects and the edge of traveled way.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Croc''''' was a [[French language|French-language]] humour magazine published monthly in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada from 1979 until 1995.&lt;ref name=tsun&gt;{{cite news|author1=Isabella Maher|title=Former staff of defunct Que. humour magazine talk Charlie Hebdo|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/10/former-staff-of-defunct-que-humour-magazine-talk-charlie-hebdo|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=Toronto Sun|date=January 10, 2015|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''Croc'' ("Fang" in French)&lt;ref name="CJC-Spalding"/&gt; was begun in October 1979 by Jacques Hurtubise, Hélène Fleury, and Roch Côté, with the help of an $80,000 grant from the ''ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec'' ("Québec Ministry of Cultural Affairs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/emc/ministere-des-affaires-culturelles-du-quebec|title=Ministère des Affaires culturelles du Québec|accessdate=January 13, 2011|first=Gilles|last=Potvin|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name="BTF-QC-QuebecMarket"/&gt;  It printed the work of many leading [[cartoonist]]s of the era, many of whom were able to launch their careers through the magazine's help,&lt;ref name="CanEncFrenchComicStrips"/&gt; including animator [[Claude Cloutier]].&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2015/07/31/frame-x-frame-claude-cloutier/|title=Frame x Frame: Meet Filmmaker Claude Cloutier (interview)|date=31 July 2015|work=NFB.ca Blog|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Croc'' begat another magazine, ''Titanic'', dedicated entirely to comics.&lt;ref name="BTF-QC-QuebecMarket" /&gt; Croc's publishers briefly distributed [[Mad (magazine)#Past foreign editions|a localised edition of MAD magazine]] from 1991-1992, which adapted and translated existing "MAD" back articles by replacing [[New York City]] references to [[Montréal]] contexts.

For a number of reasons, ''Croc'' ceased publication in April 1995&lt;ref name=tsun/&gt; after 189 issues.

'''Daniel Boone''' ({{OldStyleDate|November 2, 1734||October 22}}{{spaced ndash}}September 26, 1820) was an [[American pioneer]], [[explorer]],  woodsman, and frontiersman, whose [[American Old West|frontier]] exploits made him one of the first [[Folklore of the United States|folk heroes]] of the [[United States]]. Boone is most famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now [[History of Kentucky|Kentucky]]. It was still considered part of [[History of Virginia|Virginia]] but was on the western side of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from most [[European colonization of the Americas|European-American settlements]]. As a young adult, Boone supplemented his farm income by [[hunting]] and [[trapping]] game, and selling their pelts in the [[Fur trade|fur market]].  Through this occupational interest, Boone first learned the easy routes to the area. Despite some resistance from [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes such as the [[Shawnee]], in 1775, Boone [[Trail blazing|blazed]] his [[Wilderness Road]]  from [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] through [[Cumberland Gap]] in the [[Cumberland Mountains#Geology and physiography|Cumberland Mountains]] into Kentucky. There, he founded the village of [[Boonesborough, Kentucky]], one of the first American settlements west of the Appalachians. Before the end of the [[18th century]], more than 200,000 Americans migrated to Kentucky/Virginia by following the route marked by Boone.&lt;ref&gt;For number of people, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone served as a [[militia (United States)|militia]] officer during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), which, in Kentucky, was fought primarily between the American settlers and British-allied Indians, who hoped to expel the Americans. Boone was captured by Shawnee warriors in 1778. He escaped and alerted Boonesborough that the Shawnee were planning an attack. Although heavily outnumbered, Americans repelled the Shawnee warriors in the [[Siege of Boonesborough]]. Boone was elected to the first of his three terms in the [[Virginia General Assembly]] during the Revolutionary War, and he fought in the [[Battle of Blue Licks]] in 1782. Blue Licks, a Shawnee victory over the Patriots, was one of the last battles of the Revolutionary War, coming after the main fighting ended in October 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. C. Adams, "An Appraisal of the Blue Licks Battle," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' (2001) 75#2 181–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, Boone worked as a [[Surveying|surveyor]] and [[merchant]], but fell deeply into debt through failed Kentucky [[land speculation]]. Frustrated with the legal problems resulting from his land claims, in 1799, Boone emigrated to eastern [[Missouri]], where he spent most of the last two decades of his life (1800–20).

Boone remains an iconic figure in [[History of the United States|American history]]. He was a legend in his own lifetime, especially after an [[The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke|account of his adventures]] was published in 1784, framing him as the typical American frontiersman. After his death, he was frequently the subject of heroic tall tales and works of fiction. His adventures—real and legendary—were influential in creating the archetypal frontier hero of American folklore. In American popular culture, he is remembered as one of the foremost early frontiersmen. The epic Daniel Boone mythology often overshadows the historical details of his life.&lt;ref&gt;For overview of Boone as early folk hero and American icon, as well as his enduring fame and the confusion of myth and history, see Lofaro, ''American Life'', 180–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Daniel Boone was of [[English American|English]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh]] ancestry. Because the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted during his lifetime, Boone's birth date is sometimes given as November 2, 1734 (the [[Old Style and New Style dates|"New Style" date]]), although Boone used the October date.&lt;ref&gt;Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Boone family belonged to the [[Religious Society of Friends]], called "Quakers", and were persecuted in England for their dissenting beliefs. Daniel's father, Squire (his first name, not a title) Boone (1696–1765) emigrated from the small town of [[Bradninch]], [[Devon]] (near [[Exeter]]) to [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] in 1713, to join [[William Penn]]'s colony of [[English Dissenters|dissenters]]. Squire Boone's parents, George Boone III and Mary Maugridge, followed their son to Pennsylvania in 1717, and in 1720 built a [[log cabin]] at [[Boonecroft]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database }} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web|url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050661_01H.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Boonecroft |accessdate=September 15, 2012 |author=E. Garrett Brinton |format=PDF |date=January 1982 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619221414/https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050661_01H.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, Squire Boone, who worked primarily as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–77). Sarah's [[Edward Morgan Log House|family]] were [[Quakers]] from [[Wales]], and had settled in 1708 in the area which became [[Towamencin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Towamencin Township]] of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]]. In 1731, the Boones moved to [[Exeter Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania|Exeter Township]] in the [[Oley Valley]] of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], near the modern city of [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the [[Daniel Boone Homestead]].
 
Daniel Boone was born there, November 2, 1734, the sixth of eleven children.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Meredith Mason. ''Frontiersman'', 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The Daniel Boone Homestead is four miles from the [[Mordecai Lincoln House (Lorane, Pennsylvania)|Mordecai Lincoln House]], making the Squire Boone family neighbors of Mordecai Lincoln, the great-great-grandfather of future president [[Abraham Lincoln]].  Mordecai's son, also named Abraham, married Ann Boone, a first cousin of Daniel.

Daniel Boone spent his early years on what was then the edge of the frontier. Several [[Lenape]] Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania [[Quakers]] had good relations with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. [[Folklore of the United States|Folk tales]] have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a [[Panthera|panther]] scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his [[rifle]] and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Boone's youth, his family became a source of controversy in the local Quaker community when two of the oldest children married outside the [[endogamous]] community, in present-day [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania]]. In 1742, Boone's parents were compelled to apologize publicly after their eldest child, Sarah, married John Willcockson, a "worldling" (non-Quaker). Because the young couple had "kept company", they were considered "married without benefit of clergy". When the Boones' oldest son Israel married a "worldling" in 1747, Squire Boone stood by him. Both men were expelled from the Quakers; Boone's wife continued to attend monthly meetings with their younger children.

==Yadkin River Valley, North Carolina==

In 1750, Squire Boone sold his land and moved the family to [[North Carolina]]. Daniel Boone did not attend church again. He identified as a [[Christian]] and had all of his children [[Baptism|baptized]]. The Boones eventually settled on the [[Yadkin River]], in what is now [[Davie County, North Carolina|Davie County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielboonefamily.org/misc/yadkin-main.shtml|title=Map of Davie County, N. Carolina Showing Original Land Grants|last=Lagle|first=Andrew|date=July 31, 2007|publisher=Margy Miles|location=Drums, PA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124036/http://www.danielboonefamily.org/misc/yadkin-main.shtml|archive-date=April 25, 2012|dead-url=|work=Daniel Boone; The extraordinary life of a common man|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Mocksville, North Carolina|Mocksville]]. This was in the western backwoods area.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 25–27; Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 16–17.

Because Boone grew up on the frontier, he had little formal education, but gained deep knowledge of the woods. According to one family tradition, a schoolteacher once expressed concern over Boone's education, but Boone's father said, "Let the girls do the spelling and Dan will do the shooting." Boone received some tutoring from family members, though his spelling remained unorthodox. Historian [[John Mack Faragher]] cautions that the folk image of Boone as semiliterate is misleading, and argues that he "acquired a level of literacy that was the equal of most men of his times." Boone regularly took reading material with him on his hunting expeditions—the [[Bible]] and ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' were favorites. He was often the only literate person in groups of frontiersmen. Boone would sometimes entertain his hunting companions by reading to them around the evening campfire.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 16–17, 55–6, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French and Indian War===
After the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763) broke out between the French and British, and their respective Indian allies, North Carolina [[Matthew Rowan|Governor Matthew Rowan]] called up a militia, for which Boone volunteered.  He served under [[Hugh Waddell (general)|Captain Hugh Waddell]] on the North Carolina frontier.  Waddell's unit was assigned to serve in the command of [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] in 1755, and Boone acted as a [[teamster|wagoner]], along with his cousin [[Daniel Morgan]], who would later be a key general in the American Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiXwK-_8DRkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22daniel%20morgan%22%20cousin%20%22daniel%20boone%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3MDhBjpaOq&amp;sig=2-YHvXhaBTdS7RuFqbsBK8lovaU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WiltVJCELM-pyATIqoDoDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22daniel%20morgan%22%20cousin%20%22daniel%20boone%22&amp;f=false|title=Daniel Boone in Pennsylvania|first=Paul A. W.|last=Wallace|date=1 August 2007|publisher=DIANE Publishing Inc.|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Battle of the Monongahela]], the denouement of the campaign and a bitter defeat for the British, Boone narrowly escaped death when the baggage wagons were assaulted by Indian troops.  Boone remained critical of Braddock's blunders for the rest of his life.

While on the campaign, Boone met John Findley, a packer who worked for [[George Croghan]] in the trans-Appalachian fur trade.  Findley first interested Boone in the abundance of game and other natural wonders of the Ohio Valley. Findley took Boone on his first fateful hunting trip to Kentucky 12 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Draper |first=Lyman C. |editor-last=Belue |editor-first=Ted Franklin |title=The Life of Daniel Boone |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39307349 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |year=1998 |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg, PA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
Boone returned home and on August 14, 1756, he married [[Rebecca Boone|Rebecca Bryan]], a neighbor in the Yadkin River Valley. Her brother married one of Boone's sisters. The couple initially lived in a cabin on his father's farm. They eventually had 10 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.booneassociation.com/timeline.html|date=|title=The life of Daniel Boone (1734–1820)|publisher=The Daniel Boone and Frontier Families Research Association|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Nathan Boone, was the [[first white child]] known to be born in Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D.

{{quote box|quote=I can't say as ever I was lost, but I was bewildered once for three days.|source= —Daniel Boone&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boone supported his growing family in these years as a market [[hunting|hunter]] and [[Animal trapping|trapper]], collecting pelts for the [[fur trade]]. Almost every autumn, Boone would go on [[longhunter|"long hunts"]], extended expeditions into the wilderness lasting weeks or months. Boone went alone or with a small group of men, accumulating hundreds of deer skins in the autumn, and trapping beaver and otter over the winter. The hunt followed a network of [[bison]] migration trails, known as the [[Medicine Trails]]. When the long hunters returned in the spring, they sold their take to commercial fur traders.&lt;ref&gt;For market hunting, see Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such frontiersmen often carved messages on trees or wrote their names on cave walls, and Boone's name or initials have been found in many places. A tree in present [[Washington County, Tennessee]] reads "D. Boon Cilled a. Bar on tree in the year 1760". A similar carving, preserved in the museum of the [[Filson Historical Society]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], reads "D. Boon Kilt a Bar, 1803." The inscriptions may also be among numerous forgeries of the famous trapper, part of a long tradition of phony Boone relics.&lt;ref&gt;For doubts about tree carvings, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 57–58; Belue's notes in Draper, ''Life of Daniel Boone'',163, 286; Elliott, ''Long Hunter'', 12. For historians who do not doubt the tree carvings, see Lofaro, ''American Life'', 18; Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 33. Faragher and Belue generally question traditional stories more than Bakeless, Elliott, and Lofaro.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cherokee conflict, temporary move to Virginia===

In 1758, a conflict erupted between the British forces and the [[Cherokee]], their allies in the French and Indian War (which continued in other parts of the continent). After the Yadkin River Valley was raided by Cherokee, the Boones and many other families fled north to [[Culpeper County, Virginia]]. Boone served in the North Carolina militia during this [[Anglo-Cherokee War|"Cherokee Uprising"]]. His militia expeditions went deep into Cherokee territory beyond the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and he was separated from his wife for about two years.

In 1762, Boone, his wife and four children moved back to the Yadkin River Valley from Culpeper. By the mid-1760s, with peace made with the Cherokee, colonial immigration into the area increased. The competition of new settlers decreased the amount of game available. Boone had difficulty making ends meet; he was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold his land to pay off creditors. After his father's death in 1765, Boone traveled with his brother Squire and a group of men to [[Florida]], which had become British territory after the end of the war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, Boone purchased land near [[Pensacola, FL|Pensacola]], but Rebecca refused to move so far away from her friends and family. The Boones moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin River Valley, and Boone began to hunt westward into the Blue Ridge Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kentucky==
[[File:Boone captured.png|thumb|"Capture of Boone and Stuart" from ''Life and Times of Col. Daniel Boone'' by Cecil B. Hartley (1859)]]

Boone first reached Kentucky in the fall of 1767 while on a long hunt with his brother [[Squire Boone]], Jr.  Boone's first steps in Kentucky were near present-day [[Elkhorn City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=50654|title=Daniel Boone's First Steps in Kentucky|last=McDermott|first=Forrest|date=December 18, 2011|work=The Historical Marker Database|access-date=2017-12-31|publisher=HMdb.org LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While on the Braddock expedition years earlier, Boone had heard about the fertile land and abundant game of Kentucky from fellow wagoner John Findley, who had visited Kentucky to trade with American Indians. Boone and Findley happened to meet again, and Findley encouraged Boone with more tales of Kentucky. At the same time, news had arrived about the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], in which the [[Iroquois]] had ceded their claim to Kentucky to the British. This, as well as the unrest in North Carolina due to the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]], likely prompted Boone to extend his exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 69–74. According to some versions of the story, Findley specifically sought out Boone in 1768, but Faragher believes it more likely that their second meeting was by chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 1769, he began a two-year hunting expedition in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, Boone and a fellow hunter, [[Benjamin Cutbirth (longhunter)|Benjamin Cutbirth]], were captured by a party of Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins and told them to leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be [[poaching|poachers]]. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again in the autumn of 1772.

On July 5, 1773, Boone packed up his family and, with a group of about 50 immigrants, began the first attempt by British colonists to establish a settlement in Kentucky. Boone was still an obscure hunter and trapper at the time; the most prominent member of the expedition was [[William Russell (Virginia)|William Russell]], a well-known Virginian and future brother-in-law of [[Patrick Henry]]. On October 9, Boone's eldest son James and a small group of men and boys who had left the main party to retrieve supplies were attacked by a band of [[Lenape|Delawares]], Shawnees, and Cherokees. Following the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, American Indians in the region had been debating what to do about the influx of settlers. This group had decided, in the words of historian John Mack Faragher, "to send a message of their opposition to settlement". James Boone and William Russell's son Henry were captured and gruesomely tortured to death. The brutality of the killings sent shock waves along the frontier, and Boone's party abandoned its expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 89–96, quote on 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Caleb Bingham]]'s ''Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap'' (1851–52) is a famous depiction of Boone.]]

The massacre was one of the first events in what became known as [[Dunmore's War]], a struggle between Virginia and, primarily, Shawnees of the Ohio Country for control of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In the summer of 1774, Boone volunteered to travel with a companion to Kentucky to notify surveyors there about the outbreak of war. The two men journeyed more than {{convert|800|mi|km}} in two months to warn those who had not already fled the region. Upon his return to Virginia, Boone helped defend colonial settlements along the [[Clinch River]], earning a promotion to captain in the militia, as well as acclaim from fellow citizens. After the brief war, which ended soon after Virginia's victory in the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]] in October 1774, the Shawnees relinquished their claims to Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;For Boone in Dunmore's War, see Lofaro, ''American Life'', 44–49; Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 98–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Dunmore's War, [[Richard Henderson (American pioneer)|Richard Henderson]], a prominent judge from North Carolina, hired Boone to travel to the Cherokee towns in present North Carolina and [[Tennessee]] and inform them of an upcoming meeting. In the 1775 treaty, Henderson purchased the Cherokee claim to Kentucky to establish a colony called [[Transylvania (colony)|Transylvania]]. Afterwards, Henderson hired Boone and Cutbirth to blaze what became known as the [[Wilderness Road]], which went through the [[Cumberland Gap]] and into central Kentucky. Along with a party of about 30 workers, Boone and Cutbirth marked a path to the [[Kentucky River]], where they founded [[Boonesborough, KY|Boonesborough]]. Other settlements, notably [[Harrodsburg, KY|Harrodsburg]], were also established at this time. Despite occasional Indian attacks, Boone returned to the Clinch Valley and brought his family and other settlers to Boonesborough on September 8, 1775.&lt;ref&gt;When, exactly, Henderson hired Boone has been a matter of speculation by historians. Some have argued that Boone's first expeditions into Kentucky might have been financed by Henderson in exchange for information about potential places for settlement, while Boone's descendants believed Henderson did not hire Boone until 1774. For doubts that Henderson hired Boone before 1774, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 74–76, 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolution==
[[File:Carl Wimar Abduction of Boones Daughter detail Amon Carter Museum.jpg|thumb|''Abduction of Boone's Daughter'', painting by [[Karl Ferdinand Wimar]], 1855/56, [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]]]]
Violence in Kentucky increased with the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance to drive out the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and [[Logan's Station]].&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 1776, Boone's daughter Jemima and two other teenaged girls were [[capture and rescue of Jemima Boone|captured outside Boonesborough]] by an Indian war party, who carried the girls north towards the Shawnee towns in the Ohio country. Boone and a group of men from Boonesborough followed in pursuit, finally catching up with them two days later. Boone and his men ambushed the Indians while they were stopped for a meal, rescuing the girls and driving off their captors. The incident became the most celebrated event of Boone's life. [[James Fenimore Cooper]] created a fictionalized version of the episode in his classic novel ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1826).&lt;ref&gt;For Boone's influence on James Fenimore Cooper, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 331; Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1777, [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]], British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, began to recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by [[Chief Blackfish]] attacked Boonesborough. Boone was shot in the ankle while outside the fort, but he was carried back inside amid a flurry of bullets by [[Simon Kenton]], a recent arrival at Boonesborough.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 147–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.&lt;ref name="backs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/explore/magazine/fallwin2003/simonkenton.htm |title=Jean Backs, "Simon Kenton-Frontier Hero" |accessdate=2014-03-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304213043/http://www.dnr.state.oh.us/parks/explore/magazine/fallwin2003/simonkenton.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2006 |df= }}, ''Explore'', Fall-Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

While Boone recovered, Shawnees kept up their attacks outside Boonesborough, destroying the surrounding cattle and crops. With the food supply running low, the settlers needed salt to preserve what meat they had, so in January 1778, Boone led a party of 30 men to the salt springs on the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]].&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 154.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, when Boone was hunting meat for the expedition, he was surprised and captured by warriors led by Blackfish. Because Boone's party was greatly outnumbered, Boone returned the next day with Blackfish and persuaded his men to surrender rather than put up a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 155–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackfish wanted to continue to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that the women and children were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.&lt;ref&gt;Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boone adoption.png|thumb|left|upright|Illustration of Boone's ritual adoption by the Shawnees, from ''Life &amp; Times of Col. Daniel Boone'', by Cecil B. Hartley (1859)]]

Boone and his men were taken to Blackfish's town of [[Chalahgawtha|Chillicothe]], where they were made to [[running the gauntlet|run the gauntlet]]. As was their custom, the Shawnees adopted some of the prisoners into the tribe to replace fallen warriors; the remainder were taken to Hamilton in Detroit. Boone was adopted into a Shawnee family at Chillicothe, perhaps into the family of Chief Blackfish himself, and given the name Sheltowee (Big Turtle). On June 16, 1778, when he learned Blackfish was about to return to Boonesborough with a large force, Boone eluded his captors and raced home, covering the {{convert|160|mi|km}} to Boonesborough in five days on horseback and, after his horse gave out, on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Boone biographers write that Boone was adopted by the chief, but see [[Chief Blackfish]] for doubts.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Boone's absence, his wife and children (except for Jemima) had returned to North Carolina, assuming he was dead. Upon his return to Boonesborough, some of the men expressed doubts about Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt-making party, he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnees across the [[Ohio River]], and then by helping to successfully defend Boonesborough against a [[siege of Boonesborough|10-day siege]] led by Blackfish, which began on September 7, 1778.

After the siege, Captain [[Benjamin Logan]] and Colonel [[Richard Callaway]]—both of whom had nephews who were still captives surrendered by Boone—brought charges against Boone for his recent activities. In the [[court-martial]] that followed, Boone was found "not guilty", and was even promoted after the court heard his testimony. Despite this vindication, Boone was humiliated by the court martial, and he rarely spoke of it.&lt;ref&gt;For court martial, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 199–202; Lofaro, ''American Life'', 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, Boone returned to North Carolina to bring his family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 203, writes without qualification that the Lincolns joined Boone on this trip, while Lofaro calls it a tradition. Other sources give a later date for the Lincoln migration; see [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of [[Boone's Station]]. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created [[Kentucky County, Virginia|Kentucky County]], so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, the cash was stolen from his room. Some of the settlers forgave Boone the loss; others insisted he repay the stolen money, which took him several years to do.

A popular image of Boone which emerged in later years is that of the backwoodsman who had little affinity for "civilized" society, moving away from places like Boonesborough when they became "too crowded". In reality, however, Boone was a leading citizen of Kentucky at this time. When Kentucky was divided into three Virginia counties in November 1780, Boone was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] militia. In April 1781, he was elected as a representative to the [[Virginia General Assembly]], which was held in Richmond. In 1782, he was elected sheriff of Fayette County.&lt;ref&gt;For Boone as a leading citizen, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the American Revolutionary War continued. Boone joined General [[George Rogers Clark]]'s invasion of the Ohio country in 1780, fighting in the [[Battle of Piqua]] on August 7. In October, when Boone was hunting with his brother Ned, Shawnees shot and killed Ned. Apparently thinking that they had killed Daniel Boone, the Shawnees beheaded Ned and took the head home as a trophy. In 1781, Boone traveled to Richmond to take his seat in the legislature, but British dragoons under [[Banastre Tarleton]] captured Boone and several other legislators near [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. The British released Boone on parole several days later. During Boone's term, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]] [[Siege of Yorktown|surrendered at Yorktown]] in October 1781, but the fighting continued in Kentucky unabated. Boone returned to Kentucky and in August 1782 fought in the [[Battle of Blue Licks]], in which his son Israel was killed. In November 1782, Boone took part in another Clark expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war.

==Businessman on the Ohio River==
After the Revolutionary War ended, Boone resettled in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Limestone]], then a booming Ohio River port. On his 50th birthday, historian [[John Filson]] published ''[[The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke]]'', a book which included a chronicle of Boone's adventures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Boone became a celebrity and kept a tavern, working as a surveyor, horse trader and land speculator.

The border war with American Indians north of the Ohio River resumed with the [[Northwest Indian War]]. In September 1786, Boone took part in a military expedition into the Ohio Country led by [[Benjamin Logan]]. Back in Limestone, Boone housed and fed Shawnees who were captured during the raid, and helped to negotiate a truce and prisoner exchange. Although the war escalated and would not end until the American victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] eight years later, the 1786 expedition was the last time Boone saw military action.&lt;ref&gt;For border war and prisoner exchanges, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 249–58. Most Boone biographers tell a story of [[Blue Jacket]], the Shawnee chief, escaping while in Boone's custody in Limestone, and suggest that Boone intentionally let the chief escape because the two men were friends. According to the scholarly biography of Blue Jacket, however, the chief escaped at a later time: see John Sugden, ''Blue Jacket: Warrior of the Shawnees'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2000), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was elected to the Virginia state assembly as a representative from [[Bourbon County, Kentucky|Bourbon County]].

Boone was initially prosperous, owning seven [[history of slavery in the United States|slaves]] by 1787 (a relatively large number for Kentucky at the time),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 235–37.&lt;/ref&gt; but began to have financial troubles while living in Limestone. According to the later folk image, Boone the trailblazer was too unsophisticated for the civilization which followed him and which eventually defrauded him of his land. Boone was not the simple frontiersman of legend, however: he engaged in land speculation on a large scale, buying and selling claims to tens of thousands of acres. The land market in frontier Kentucky was chaotic, and Boone's ventures ultimately failed because his investment strategy was faulty and because his sense of honor made him reluctant to profit at someone else's expense. According to Faragher, "Boone lacked the ruthless instincts that speculation demanded."&lt;ref&gt;For analysis of Boone's land speculation failures, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 245–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frustrated with the legal hassles that went with land speculation, in 1788, Boone moved upriver to [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]). There he operated a trading post and occasionally worked as a surveyor's assistant. When Virginia created [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]] in 1789, Boone was appointed lieutenant colonel of the county militia.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 266.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, he was elected to the Virginia legislature for the third time.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 267.&lt;/ref&gt; He contracted to provide supplies for the Kanawha militia, but his debts prevented him from buying goods on credit, so he closed his store and returned to hunting and trapping.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 268–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1795, Rebecca and he moved back to Kentucky, living in present [[Nicholas County, Kentucky|Nicholas County]] on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to [[Isaac Shelby]], the first governor of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 272–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued to make their way through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 273.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Kentucky assembly named [[Boone County, Kentucky|Boone County]] in his honor.&lt;ref name="Faragher, Daniel Boone, 274"&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missouri==
[[File:Boone Home Defiance MO-24.jpg|thumb|right|Boone lived much of the last part of his life with the family of his son Nathan in [[Daniel Boone Home|this home]] near present-day [[Defiance, Missouri]].]]

[[File:Boone by Audubon.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Boone&lt;br /&gt;by [[John James Audubon]], circa after 1810.]]

Having endured legal and financial setbacks, Boone sought to make a fresh start by leaving the United States.&lt;ref name="Faragher, Daniel Boone, 274"/&gt; In 1799, he moved his extended family to what is now [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]], [[Missouri]], but was then part of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 274–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish, eager to promote settlement in the sparsely populated region, did not enforce the official requirement that all immigrants had to be Roman Catholic. The Spanish governor appointed Boone "[[syndic]]" (judge and jury) and commandant (military leader) of the Femme Osage district.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 279.&lt;/ref&gt;  The many anecdotes of Boone's tenure as syndic suggest he sought to render fair judgments rather than to strictly observe the letter of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 285–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone served as syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri became part of the United States following the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government had been largely based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned [[United States Congress|Congress]] to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the [[War of 1812]] came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 304–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone spent his final years in Missouri, often in the company of children and grandchildren, where he continued to hunt and trap as much as his health and energy levels permitted. According to one story, in 1810 or later, Boone went with a group on a long hunt as far west as the [[Yellowstone River]], a remarkable journey at his age, if true. In 1816, a United States officer at [[Fort Osage]], on the Missouri, wrote:

{{quote|We have been honored by a visit from ''Colonel Boon'', the first settler of Kentucky; he lately spent two weeks with us ... He left this for the river Platt, some distance above.  Col Boon is eighty-five years of age, five feet seven inches high, stoutly made, and active for one of his years; is still of vigorous mind, and is pretty well informed.  He has taken part in all the wars of America, from before Braddock's war to the present hour.&lt;ref&gt;Boston ''Recorder'', July 3, 1816&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stories were told of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky to pay off his creditors, although some or all of these tales may be folklore. American painter [[John James Audubon]] claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by [[Chester Harding (painter)|Chester Harding]]. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.&lt;ref&gt;For Yellowstone, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 295. For doubts about Audubon's tale, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 308–10; Randell Jones, ''In the Footsteps of Daniel Boone'', 222.

==Death==

[[File:Daniel Boone's Grave Site.jpg|thumb|left|Purported resting place of Rebecca and Daniel Boone, Frankfort, Kentucky]]

Daniel Boone died of natural causes (other sources say from [[indigestion|acute indigestion]]) on September 26, 1820, at [[Daniel Boone Home|Nathan Boone's home]] on Femme Osage Creek, five weeks short of his 86th birthday. His last words were, "I'm going now. My time has come." He was buried next to Rebecca, who had died on March 18, 1813. The graves, which were unmarked until the mid-1830s, were near Jemima (Boone) Callaway's home on [[Tuque Creek]], about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from the present-day [[Marthasville, Missouri]]. In 1845, the Boones' remains were supposedly disinterred and reburied in a new cemetery, [[Frankfort Cemetery]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]. Resentment in Missouri about the disinterment grew over the years, and a legend arose that Boone's remains never left Missouri. According to this story, Boone's tombstone in Missouri had been inadvertently placed over the wrong grave, but no one had ever corrected the error. Boone's relatives in Missouri, displeased with the Kentuckians who came to exhume Boone, kept quiet about the mistake, and they allowed the Kentuckians to dig up the wrong remains. No contemporary evidence indicates this actually happened, but in 1983, a [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologist]] examined a crude plaster cast of Boone's skull made before the Kentucky reburial and announced it might be the skull of an African American. Black slaves had also been buried at Tuque Creek, so it is possible the wrong remains were mistakenly removed from the crowded graveyard. Both the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky and the Old Bryan Farm graveyard in Missouri claim to have Boone's remains.&lt;ref&gt;For burial controversy, see Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 354–62; Jones, ''Footsteps'', 227–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kentucky Legislature appropriated two thousand dollars in 1860 for the erection of a monument over the grave of Daniel Boone in Frankfort.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Boone: American Pioneer and Frontiersman By Pat McCarthy, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; The monument at Boone's grave site today was built by John Haley in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frankfortpublicart.com/images/docsAndLinks/boone/Daniel%20Boones%20Monument.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862 four marble panels were added depicting scenes from Daniel and Rebecca's lives. The panels were vandalized during the [[American Civil War]] and restored in 1906. Only one of the original panels still exists.&lt;ref&gt;https://lymanbhannaford.wordpress.com/2-april-1863/&lt;/ref&gt; The vandalism of the monument during the Civil War does not appear to be senseless in nature. [[Lyman Beecher Hannaford]] of the [[103rd Ohio Infantry]] who were garrisoned at [[Fort Hill (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Fort Hill]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] remarks in his letter dated April 2, 1863, "I have been walking around in the cemetery and I got a piece of Daniel Boone's monument. ³ I shall keep it till I go home. I have quite a number of pieces of rock and shell that I am keeping for specimens."

Daniel Boone remains an iconic figure in American history, although his status as an early American folk hero and later as a subject of fiction have tended to obscure the actual details of his life. Several places in the United States are named for him, including the [[Daniel Boone National Forest]], the [[Sheltowee Trace Trail]], the town of [[Boone, North Carolina]], various settlements carrying the name of "Boonville", and seven counties: [[Boone County, Illinois]], [[Boone County, Indiana]], [[Boone County, Nebraska]], [[Boone County, West Virginia]], [[Boone County, Missouri]], [[Boone County, Arkansas]], and [[Boone County, Kentucky]].  Schools across the United States are named for Daniel Boone, including schools in [[Birdsboro, Pennsylvania]], [[Douglassville, Pennsylvania]], [[Richmond, Kentucky]], [[Wentzville, Missouri]], [[Warrenton, Missouri]], [[Gray, Tennessee]], and [[Chicago]].

Daniel Boone was honored with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, where his remains were supposedly reburied.  He was a famous frontiersman in the development of Virginia, Kentucky and the trans-Appalachian west. A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone. His name and birth date were carved on the wall.&lt;ref&gt;"1968 American Folklore Issue", Arago: people, postage &amp; the post, National Postal Museum online, viewed March 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Navy]]'s {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|0}} [[Polaris missile|Polaris submarine]] {{USS|Daniel Boone|SSBN-629}}, was named after Boone.

===Emergence as a legend===
Boone emerged as a legend in large part because of land speculator John Filson's "The Adventures of Colonel Daniel Boon", part of his book ''The Discovery, Settlement and present State of Kentucke''. First published in 1784, Filson's book was primarily intended to popularize Kentucky to immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slotkin |first=Richard |authorlink= |title=Regeneration Through Violence: The Mythology of the American Frontier 1600–1860 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/333612 |accessdate=August 27, 2014 |year=1973 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, OK |isbn= |pages=268–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon translated into [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]], and made Boone famous in America and Europe. Based on interviews with Boone, Filson's book contained a mostly factual account of Boone's adventures from the exploration of Kentucky through the American Revolution. However, because the real Boone was a man of few words, Filson invented florid, philosophical dialogue for this "autobiography". Subsequent editors cut some of these passages and replaced them with more plausible—but still spurious—ones. Often reprinted, Filson's book established Boone as one of the first popular heroes of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 4–7; Lofaro, ''American Life'', 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like John Filson, [[Timothy Flint]] also interviewed Boone, and his ''Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky'' (1833) became one of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what [[Parson Weems]] did for [[George Washington]]. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians by swinging on vines (as [[Tarzan]] would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly influenced the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless [[dime novel]]s and books aimed at young boys.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 323–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbol and stereotype===
[[File:Daniel Boone protects his family.jpg|thumb|This 1874 lithograph entitled "Daniel Boone protects his family" is a representative image of Boone as an Indian fighter.]]
Thanks to Filson's book, in Europe, Boone became a symbol of the "natural man" who lives a virtuous, uncomplicated existence in the wilderness. This was most famously expressed in [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron's]] epic poem ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1822), which devoted a number of stanzas to Boone, including this one:

{{poemquote|
Of the great names which in our faces stare,
:The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,
Was happiest amongst mortals any where;
:For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he
Enjoyed the lonely vigorous, harmless days
Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, " Daniel Boone", 328.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byron's poem celebrated Boone as someone who found happiness by turning his back on civilization. In a similar vein, many folk tales depicted Boone as a man who migrated to more remote areas whenever civilization crowded in on him. In a typical anecdote, when asked why he was moving to Missouri, Boone supposedly replied, "I want more elbow room!" Boone rejected such an interpretation of his life, however. "Nothing embitters my old age," he said late in life, like "the circulation of absurd stories that I retire as civilization advances ..."&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 302, 325–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing simultaneously with the image of Boone as a refugee from society was, paradoxically, the popular portrayal of him as civilization's trailblazer. Boone was celebrated as an agent of [[Manifest Destiny]], a pathfinder who tamed the wilderness, paving the way for the extension of American civilization. In 1852, critic [[Henry Tuckerman]] dubbed Boone "the Columbus of the woods", comparing Boone's passage through the Cumberland Gap to [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyage to the New World. In popular mythology, Boone became the first to explore and settle Kentucky, opening the way for countless others to follow. In fact, other Americans had explored and settled Kentucky before Boone, as debunkers in the 20th century often pointed out, but Boone came to symbolize them all, making him what historian Michael Lofaro called "the [[founding fathers of the United States|founding father]] of westward expansion".&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 321–22, 350–52; Lofaro, ''American Life'', 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, when Native Americans were being [[Indian removal|displaced from their lands]] and confined on [[Indian reservation|reservations]], Boone's image was often reshaped into the stereotype of the belligerent, Indian-hating frontiersman which was then popular. In John A. McClung's ''Sketches of Western Adventure'' (1832), for example, Boone was portrayed as longing for the "thrilling excitement of savage warfare." Boone was transformed in the popular imagination into someone who regarded Indians with contempt and had killed scores of the "savages". The real Boone disliked bloodshed, however. According to historian John Bakeless, there is no record that Boone ever [[Scalping|scalped]] Indians, unlike other frontiersmen of the era. Boone once told his son Nathan that he was certain of having killed only one Indian, during the battle at Blue Licks, although he believed others might have died from his bullets in other battles. Even though Boone had lost two sons in wars with Indians, he respected Indians and was respected by them. In Missouri, Boone often went hunting with the very Shawnees who had captured and adopted him decades earlier. Some 19th-century writers regarded Boone's sympathy for Indians as a character flaw and therefore altered his words to conform to contemporary attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Bakeless, ''Master of the Wilderness'', 162–62; Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 39, 86, 219, 313, 320, 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In fiction===
Boone's adventures, real and mythical, formed the basis of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main character of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s [[Leatherstocking Tales]], the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 330–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, Boone was featured in numerous comic strips, radio programs, and films, such as the 1936 film ''[[Daniel Boone (1936 film)|Daniel Boone]]'', with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] playing the title role.

Daniel Boone was the subject of a [[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|TV series]] that ran on [[NBC]] from 1964 to 1970. In the theme song for the series, Boone was described as a "big man" in a "[[coonskin cap]]", and the "rippin'est, roarin'est, fightin'est man the frontier ever knew!"&lt;ref&gt;The complete lyrics of the song can be found [http://www.danielboonetv.com/themesong.html online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620142133/http://danielboonetv.com/themesong.html |date=2006-06-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not describe the real Boone, who was not a big man and did not wear a coonskin cap. Boone was portrayed this way because [[Fess Parker]], the tall actor who played him, was essentially reprising his role as [[Davy Crockett]] from an earlier [[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|TV series]]. That Boone could be portrayed the same way as Crockett, another American frontiersman with a very different personality, was another example of how Boone's image was reshaped to suit popular tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, ''Daniel Boone'', 338–39, 362; Lofaro, ''American Life'', 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants===
Boone's grandson [[Alphonso Boone]] was an early settler of the Willamette River Valley in Oregon, arriving in 1846 and establishing [[Boones Ferry]] the next year.&lt;ref name="eoot"&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Environment Triptych''''', by sculptor [[Jon Edgar]], is a group of three portrait heads of environmental thinkers of the day.

Edgar worked with three in either [[Cornwall]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] or [[Norfolk]] during visits in 2006 and 2007.

The heads have a relevance as individual portraits, but the interplay of the three heads plinthed together seemed to add something; perhaps emphasising the sitters’ diverse efforts in influencing human behaviour and our interaction with the planet and its other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonedgar.wordpress.com/2011/05/17/the-environment-series-heads/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Triptych'' has led to the ''[[Environment Series]]'' of heads of environmentally aware sitters,&lt;ref&gt;article on the Human Clay exhibition, Surrey Advertiser. 2 Dec 2011 p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/the_human_clay_jon_edgar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surrey.ac.uk/arts/visualarts/exhibitions%20and%20events/The%20Human%20Clay%20Exhibition.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Chris Rapley]], [[Gordon Murray]], [[Tim Smit]], and [[Guy Watson]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6095">'''Ethiopian Studies''' refers to a multi-disciplinary academic cluster dedicated to research on [[Ethiopia]] within the cultural and historical context of the [[Horn of Africa]].

==Overview==
{{further information|Ethiopian historiography|Outline of Ethiopia}}
The classical concept of Ethiopian Studies, developed by European scholars, is based on disciplines like [[philology]] and [[linguistics]], [[history]] and [[ethnography]]. It includes the study of Ethiopian [[arts]] and the history and [[theology]] of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]. The classical core of Ethiopian Studies is the philology of the written sources of [[Christian]] Ethiopia and [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethio-semitic linguistics]]. While this approach is still alive and has its role, Ethiopian Studies has opened to a wider concept that tries to avoid a bias in favour of the Christian Abyssinian culture ([[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrinya]]; ''cf''. [[Habesha people]]). It includes the study of the other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] languages and cultures of Ethiopia besides those of Ethio-semitic derivation; the nation's non-Afro-Asiatic languages and cultures, including the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region|southern Ethiopian]] cultures; non-Christian faiths, comprising [[Islam in Ethiopia|Islam]] and traditional religions; social and political sciences; as well as contemporary issues like environment and development studies.

==Institute of Ethiopian Studies==
The study of Ethiopian topics had been long been concentrated in European academic institutions. This is seen in such examples as [[Enno Littmann]] directing the German Aksum-Expedition in Ethiopia in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz70538.html|title=Littmann, Enno - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italy invaded Ethiopia]], some Italian scholars such as [[Enrico Cerulli]] were active in Ethiopia. As a result, many [[Ethiopian manuscript collections]] and other materials from Ethiopia are found in European museums and libraries.

Ethiopian Studies began a new era in 1963 when the Institute of Ethiopian Studies was founded on the campus of Haile Selassie University (which was later renamed [[Addis Ababa University]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aau.edu.et/ies/ies-library/ Institute of Ethiopian Studies website].&lt;/ref&gt; The heart of the IES is the library, containing a wide variety of published and unpublished materials on all types of matters related to Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.

==Conferences==
Ethiopian Studies scholars congregate at the interdisciplinary International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, a series of gatherings that takes place every three years. Traditionally, every third conference is held in Ethiopia. The 19th meeting was in Warsaw, August 24–28, 2015. The 20th conference will be in [[Mek'ele|Mekelle]], Ethiopia in 2018. Volumes of proceedings are published after most conferences.

==Journals and publications==
Ethiopian Studies is served by a few journals and publications specifically devoted to the field. These include:

*''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'' (Ethiopia)
*''ITYOPIS Northeast African Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities'' (Ethiopia)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tafla|first=Bairu|date=2014-03-09|title=ITYOPIS ኢትዮጲስ – Northeast African Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vol. 1|url=https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/aethiopica/article/view/714|journal=Aethiopica|volume=16|issue=1|pages=244–247|issn=2194-4024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exequatur''' is a legal document issued by a sovereign authority that permits the exercise or enforcement of a right within the [[jurisdiction]] of the authority. The word is a form of the [[Latin]] verb "''exequi''", which denotes "let it be executed".

==International relations==
An exequatur is a [[letters patent|patent]] which a [[head of state]] issues to a foreign [[Consul (representative)|consul]], guaranteeing the consul's rights and privileges of office and ensuring recognition in the [[Sovereign state|state]] to which the consul is appointed to exercise such powers. If a consul is not appointed by [[Letters patent|commission]], the consul receives no exequatur; the government will usually provide some other means to recognize the consul. The exequatur may be withdrawn, but in practice, where a consul is obnoxious, an opportunity is afforded to his government to recall him.

==Catholic Canon law==
{{Main|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}
{{canon law}}
An exequatur is a legal instrument issued by secular authorities in [[Roman Catholic]] nations to guarantee the legal force of [[Papal]] doctrines have legal force within the jurisdiction of the secular authority. This custom began during the [[Western Schism]], when the legitimately elected [[Supreme Pontiff]] permitted secular leaders to verify the authenticity of Papal decrees before enforcing them.

Some dissidents in the Church claim, however, that the custom arose as an implication of the nature of secular authority over the Church and that such a state privilege to verify Papal doctrine was exercised since the early days of the Church.  However, Church doctrine denies that any permission from secular authority is necessary for Papal decrees to be legally effective, even though secular authorities sometimes do not enforce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05707a.htm|title=Exequatur|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In Brazilian, French, Luxembourg, Italian, Mexican, and Spanish law, an exequatur is a judgment of a tribunal (in the case of Italy, the Court of Appeal) that a decision issued by a foreign tribunal is to be executed in the jurisdiction of the former, thereby granting authority to the decision of the foreign tribunal as if it issued from the native tribunal.

In [[Puerto Rico]], an exequatur is a document that validates a [[court order]] of a [[United States]] [[civil court]] as if a court of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico issued it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elnuevodia.com/madreboricuaclamaporayudapararecuperarasuhijo-1830092.html ''Madre boricua clama por ayuda para recuperar a su hijo: El padre del menor amenaza con que no devolverá el pequeño que se encuentra en Nuevo México. Diferentes entidades gubernamentales se pasan mutuamente la responsabilidad.''] Jessica Ríos Viner. El Nuevo Dia. 8 August 2014. Retrieved 8 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4957">{{English Feudalism}}

In the [[Middle Ages]], especially under the European [[Feudalism|feudal system]], '''feoffment''' or '''enfeoffment''' was the deed by which a person was given land in exchange for a pledge of service. This mechanism was later used to avoid restrictions on the passage of title in land by a system in which a landowner would give land to one person for the use of another. The [[common law]] of [[estates in land]] grew from this concept.

==England==
In English law, feoffment was a transfer of land or property that gave the new holder the right to sell it as well as the right to pass it on to his heirs as an inheritance. It was total relinquishment and transfer of all rights of ownership of an [[estate in land]] from one individual to another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/6844/Feoffment.html|title=Feoffment|author=|date=|website=law.jrank.org|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal England a feoffment could only be made of a [[fee (feudal tenure)|fee]] (or "fief"), which is an [[estate in land]], that is to say an ownership of rights over land, rather than ownership of the land itself, the only true owner of which was the monarch under his [[allodial title]]. Enfeoffment could be made of fees of various [[Feudal land tenure|feudal tenures]], such as [[Entail|fee-tail]] or [[fee-simple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Feoffment |volume=10|pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] or delivery of possession, known as [[livery of seisin]] was effected generally on the site of the land in a symbolic ceremony called "feoffment with livery of seisin." In the ceremony, the parties would typically go to the land with witnesses "and the transferor would then hand to the transferee a lump of soil or a twig from a tree -- all the while intoning the appropriate words of grant, together with the magical words 'and his heirs' if the interest transferred was to be a potentially infinite one."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Bergin &amp; Paul G. Haskell, ''Preface to Estates in Land and Future Interests'', p. 11, Foundation Press (2d ed. 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Written conveyances were customary and mandatory after 1677.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204343/feoffment|title=Feoffment - English law|author=|date=|website=britannica.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feoffee was thenceforward said to hold his property "of" or "from" the feoffor, in return for a specified service depending on the exact form of [[feudal land tenure]] involved in the feoffment. Thus for every holding of land during the [[Feudalism in England|feudal era]] there existed an historical unbroken chain of feoffees, in the form of [[Lord|overlords]], ultimately springing from feoffments made by [[William the Conqueror]] himself in 1066 as the highest overlord of all.

This pattern of land-holding was the natural product of William the Conqueror claiming an allodial title to all the land of England following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 and parcelling it out as large [[fee (feudal tenure)|fees]] in the form of [[English feudal barony|feudal baronies]] to his followers, who then in turn subinfeudated the lands comprising their baronies into [[manor]]s to be held from them by their own followers and knights.

When the new feoffee [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] another person from his holding, for example where he created a new [[manor]], he would become overlord to the person so enfeoffed, and a [[mesne lord]] within the longer historical chain of title. In modern English land law the theory of such long historical chain of title still exists for every holding in [[fee simple]], although for practical purposes it is not necessary at the time of conveyance to recite the descent of the fee from its creation. The establishment of a national [[Land Registry]] has obviated the need for recitals of descent.

==Asia==
In China and some other South East Asian countries, from the time of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1046–256 BCE) relatives and descendants of the ruling family were granted enfeoffments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/China_5000/?chapter=dicts/Spring_and_Autumn_Period|title=The Zhou Dynasty|publisher=China Civilisation Centre, City University of Hong Kong|accessdate=November 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005122732/http://www.english.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/China_5000/?chapter=dicts%2FSpring_and_Autumn_Period|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in return for pledging to protect the King or Emperor in times of war.

'''''First Love''''' ({{lang-ru|Первая любовь}}, ''Pervaya ljubov'') is a [[novella]] by [[Ivan Turgenev]], first published in 1860. It is one of his most popular pieces of short fiction. It tells the love story between a 21-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy.

==Background to the work==
''First Love'' was published in March 1860 in the ''[[Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya|Reader's Library]]''. Like many of Turgenev's works, this one is highly autobiographical. Indeed, the author claimed it was the most autobiographical of all his works.&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, David. 1954. ''Turgenev: a Life.'' London: Faber and Faber, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Turgenev is retelling an incident from his own life, his infatuation with a young neighbor in the country, Catherine Shakovskoy (the Zinaida of the novella), an infatuation that lasted until his discovery that Catherine was in fact his own father's mistress.

Critics were divided. Some criticized its light subject matter that did not touch upon any of the pressing social and political issues of the day. Others condemned the impropriety of that subject matter, namely a father and son in love with the same woman and a young woman who was the mistress of a married man. But it had its many admirers, including the French novelist [[Gustave Flaubert]], who gushed in [[Flaubert's letters|a letter]] to Turgenev, "What an exciting girl that Zinochka [Zinaida] is!"&lt;ref&gt;Magarshack, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The Countess Lambert, a close acquaintance of Turgenev, told the author that the [[Alexander III of Russia|Russian emperor]] himself had read the novella to the empress and been delighted by it.&lt;ref&gt;Troyat, Henri. 1988. ''Turgenev'' (New York: Dutton), 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central characters==

'''Vladimir Petrovich''' – The storyteller, at the time of narration a 16-year-old boy; the protagonist of the story.

'''Zinaida Alexandrovna Zasyekina''' – The object of Vladimir's affections. Capricious, mocking and difficult, she is inconsistent in her affections towards her suitors, of which Vladimir is the one to whom she shows (outwardly) the most affection. However, it is the affection of sister to brother rather than between lovers.

'''Pyotr Vasilyevich''' – Vladimir's father, a stoic symbol of 19th century masculinity; very 'British' in outlook and apparently unreceptive to emotion but the object of quiet admiration by the son

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32770">'''Fund governance''' refers to a system of checks and balances and work performed by the governing body (board) of an [[investment fund]] to ensure that the fund is operated in the best interests of the fund and its investors.&lt;ref name="SEC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.htm|title=Investment Company Governance|accessdate=16 July 2015|date=16 January 2006 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of fund governance is to uphold the regulatory principles commonly known as the four pillars of investor protection that are typically promulgated through the investment fund regulation applicable in the jurisdiction of the fund.&lt;ref name="Shadab"/&gt; These principles vary by jurisdiction and in the US, the [[Investment Company Act of 1940|1940 Act]] generally ensure that: (i) The investment fund will be managed in accordance with the fund’s investment objectives, (ii) The assets of the investment fund will be kept safe, (iii) When investors redeem they will get their pro rata share of the investment fund’s assets, (iv) The investment fund will be managed for the benefit of the fund’s shareholders and not its service providers.&lt;ref name="SEC2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1999/spch279.htm|title=Maintaining the Pillars of Protection in the New Millennium|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 May 1999 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund governance structures==
===Offshore investment funds===
Offshore investment funds are typically formed as companies in the [[Cayman Islands]] (85%).&lt;ref name="MourantOzannes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mourantozannes.com/media/452717/the-cayman-islands-a-guide-for-hedge-fund-managers.pdf|title=The Cayman Islands: A Guide for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Mourant Ozannes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELTOMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eltoma-global.com/en/jurisdictions/cayman-islands/hedge-fund.html|title=Hedge Fund|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=April 2014 |publisher=[[Eltoma Global]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an investment fund is formed as a company, its governing body is its board of directors. In this context, fund governance is commonly referred to as “fund directorships” or “independent director services”.&lt;ref name="Hedgeweek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2013/06/04/185273/independent-directors-considerations-and-queries|title=Independent Directors: Considerations and Queries|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 January 2014 |work=[[Hedge Week]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshore funds are commonly structured as a “[[Master-feeder|feeder]]” funds that will generally invest all monies received directly into a “[[Master-feeder|master]]” fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.dmsoffshore.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/HFLR-Reprint-04_11_13-How-Can-Hedge-Fund-Managers-Use-Advisory-Committees-to-Manage-Conflicts-of-Interest-and-Mitigate-Operational-Risks-Part-1-and.pdf|title=How Can Hedge Fund Managers Use Advisory Committees to Manage Conflicts of Interest and Mitigate Operational Risks? (Part One of Two)|volume=6|issue=5|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=11 April 2011 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Onshore investment funds===
Onshore investment fund are typically formed as [[limited partnership|limited partnerships (LPs)]] in the United States, most commonly in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref name="SSRN"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2265663|title=Are Hedge Funds Registered in Delaware Different?|date=December 2014 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These funds typically serve as the “master” fund to the offshore feeder fund.&lt;ref name="HF Law"/&gt;  The governing body (board) of the LP is its [[General partnership|general partner (GP)]] which is usually under the sole control and direction of the investment manager or fund sponsor. This structure is increasingly being challenged by institutional investors&lt;ref name="Gerald Kerner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hflawreport.com/issue/296|title=Indemnification Stanley Druckenmiller's Counsel Provides a Tutorial for Negotiating Exculpation, Indemnification, Redemption, Withdrawal and Amendment Provisions in Hedge Fund Governing Documents|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=5 February 2014 |work=[[Hedge Fund Law Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Druckenmiller"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-28/druckenmiller-lawyer-takes-on-hedge-funds-over-contracts|title=Druckenmiller Lawyer Takes On Hedge Funds Over Contracts|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=28 January 2014 |work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other stakeholders  to implement more independent governance and investor friendly mechanisms typically in the form of [[advisory boards]] or independent GPs or managing members.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Law"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/hedge-fund-governance-and-sec-enforcement-proceedings/|title=Hedge Fund Governance and SEC Enforcement Proceedings|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=Bloomberg BNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit trusts===
Investment funds can also be formed as unit trusts with a board of trustees as its governing body.&lt;ref name="Unit Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/uit.htm|title=Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=21 October 2013 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of governance==
The role of fund governance comprises both [[fiduciary duties]] and responsibilities owed by the governing body (board).&lt;ref name="Shadab"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=2234482|author=Shadab, Houman B.|title=Hedge Fund Governance|date=19 November 2013 |publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fiduciary duties are prescribed by the applicable laws of the fund’s jurisdiction and are inviolable. Responsibilities are prescribed through contractual terms in the various fund documents.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt; Fund governance responsibilities can vary widely between investment funds because fund documents are commonly negotiated between fund stakeholders based on their various (often competing) requirements and objectives. Although the objective of fund governance is investor protection, fiduciary duties typically require the board to act in the best interest of a fund taken as whole and not any particular investor.&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

==Key differences between fund governance and corporate governance==
Fund governance is often conflated with corporate governance. Although some principles and practices appear similar, there are important differences.&lt;ref name="AIMA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/4898EC23-66AA-4065-8EAD6137DEBC8126|title=Corporate governance challenges for hedge fund boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=March 2014 |publisher=[[Alternative Investment Management Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most notably:

===Legal structure===
Not all funds are formed as corporations and the legal form of the fund structure does not remove the need for sound fund governance.&lt;ref name="SEC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEC2"/&gt;

===Employees===
Unlike corporations, investment funds typically don't have any employees to manage or lead.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt; Corporate directors have more authority and a more complex set of duties to execute, such as approving major corporate investment and financial policies, monitoring diverse accounting systems, and selecting and terminating top corporate executives. Compared to hedge funds, the regulatory and competitive issues facing each company are highly idiosyncratic.&lt;ref name="Clifford"&gt;{{Citation|author=Clifford, Christopher|date=2014|title=Hedge Fund Boards|publisher=University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds operate by appointing service providers under service agreements with the fund and each service provider is governed by its own governing body independently of the fund.&lt;ref name="AIMA"/&gt;  This means that fund directors do not have any authority to direct the affairs of the service providers to the fund other than under the contractual responsibilities outlined in the service agreement.  Day-to-day managerial responsibilities are typically delegated to the investment manager and fund administrator. Compared to large corporations, hedge funds are relatively homogenous, and the duties of their directors are relatively limited and standardized. These factors should reduce the required time investment and increase the scalability of the director's human capital such that it can be employed efficiently across many funds.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

===Investors===
Corporations offer their shares publicly and widely typically with no qualification requirements.  Funds offer their shares privately on a restricted basis to sophisticated investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sophisticatedinvestor.asp Investopedia "Sophisticated Investor"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategy===
Corporations don’t have a rulebook (like an [[offering circular|offering memorandum]]) or delegated structure so corporate directors are responsible for formulating and implementing strategy to ensure the success of the corporation.  Corporate directors have a dual role of adviser and monitor, but this is not the case in a fund. Fund directors typically serve as a monitor since the fund is usually formed to pursue the investment objective defined by the investment manager as negotiated and agreed in the fund documents by its various stakeholders.  Fund directors will typically not have any responsibility for the investment strategy as the investment manager is not an employee of the fund unlike the CEO in a corporation.  Thus, “the advisory role of hedge fund directors is limited when compared to that of corporate directors.  For example, hedge fund directors do not advise the manager on portfolio strategy or security selection.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

==Growth of the professional fund governance firm==
Fund governance became a major fund servicing industry following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]] “spurred (by) several media reports arguing that professional directors must be too busy to provide the appropriate level of monitoring for their clients.”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Consequently, many fund governance firms proliferated in response to perceived demand for independent directors for hedge funds and the low barriers to entry evident in the industry. A ‘[[gold rush]]’ mentality developed worldwide after articles by the Financial Times&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011a"&gt;{{cite news| title= Cayman directors sit on hundreds of boards|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/913e31b6-114a-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the New York Times&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Serving on Many Boards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/02/business/dealbook/serving-on-many-boards.html|accessdate=28 December 2014|work=DealBook}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensationalized fund directors in the Cayman Islands as having ‘hundreds’ of directorships.&lt;ref name = "FT 20112011b"&gt;{{cite news| title= Less is more for Cayman ‘jumbo-directors’|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0ef083c8-1157-11e1-a95c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3fxldNH3L |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=FT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "DealbookNY01072012"&gt;{{cite news| title= In Caymans, It’s Simple to Fill a Hedge Fund Board|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/in-caymans-its-simple-to-fill-a-hedge-fund-board/?_r=0 |accessdate=28 December 2014|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DealbookNY01072012b"/&gt; Serving as a fund director was portrayed as a [[sinecure]]  because anyone, anywhere in the world, could serve as a director on a Cayman Islands mutual fund (the FT articles were later critiqued by the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'').&lt;ref name="CJR"&gt;{{Citation|author=Chittum, Ryan|date=11 November 2011|title=FT Style Undermines A Good Investigation|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this critical media scrutiny, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] implemented a number of reforms under the [[Cayman Islands Directors Registration and Licensing Law, 2014|Director Registration and Licensing Law, 2014]] which required all directors of Cayman Islands regulated mutual funds to become regulated.  As of 31 May 2015, the [[Cayman Islands Monetary Authority]] reported that there were 8,879 directors on Cayman Islands funds of which only 422 were based in the Cayman Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimoney.com.ky/ Cayman Islands Monetary Authority "CIMA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional firms vs. proprietors==
Fund governance providers range from limited-resourced, proprietorships of part-time directors (or so-called ‘boutique’ firms) to fully resourced professional services firms of full-time directors, “organized similarly to large law or accounting firms”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; In many parts of the world, serving as a fund director remains a [[cottage industry]]  where proponents argue that fund governance is different from the other services provided to the fund and not adaptable to the professional firm approach.  This mindset appears to be supported by the law in several jurisdictions that mandate that only “natural persons” provide director services.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Opponents  of the proprietor approach argue that boards should not be “dominated by part-timers at a time when they need to be vigilant about avoiding future crises”&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; and that professional funds “would never buy legal services or management advice from people only willing to spare a few hours a month”.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt;

Professional fund governance firms are also referred to as Board Service Providers (BSPs).&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://intranet.law.ox.ac.uk/ckfinder/userfiles/files/66_Stan_L_Rev_1051_BainbridgeHenderson.pdf|title=BOARDS-R-US: Reconceptualizing Corporate Boards|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 July 2015 |work=[[Stanford Law Review]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proponents argue that directors are independent service providers to a fund equivalent to its auditors, administrators and attorneys, all of whom use a professional firm approach and the same professional standards and expectations should also apply to fund governance.&lt;ref name="hedgeweek2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeweek.com/2014/12/19/215050/split-boards-favoured-fund-governance-intensifies|title=Split boards favoured as fund governance intensifies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 December 2014 |work=Hedge Week }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.K. all professional investment funds are required by law to appoint a BSP as an Authorised Corporate Director.  In the United States of America, BSPs are not required by law, but the SEC does “require funds to explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties”&lt;ref name = "SECIV"&gt;{{cite article| title= Part IV Securities and Exchange Commission|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf |accessdate=15 July 2015|work=SEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-financial crisis and several spectacular fund governance failures, there has been much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the [[Stanford Law Review]], [[University of Kentucky]] and [[University of Cambridge]] among many others.&lt;ref name="Clifford"/&gt; Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and for good reason. Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt;

Empirical and anecdotal evidence from other fund services providers such as legal, administration and audit also supports the professional firm approach and it continues to dominate the professional fund industry. As such professional fund governance firms have the “economies of scale to attract the best board members, introduce more rigorous training programs and develop the best proprietary knowledge”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21612147-case-outsourcing-company-boards-replacing-board|title=Replacing the board|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=16 Aug 2015 |work=[[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  plus economies of scale and scope allow firms to increase quality and/or lower cost by finding efficiencies in production, spreading fixed costs across a larger asset base and investing in technology.&lt;ref name="StandfordLaw"/&gt; Independent researchers further argue that BSPs bring “collective expertise, from the ability to process huge quantities of information to specialist advice”&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1"/&gt; use the power of technology for business intelligence, process management and information access to make fast and accurate decisions.

==Notable fund governance scandals and failures==
===Bear Stearns===
The Bear Stearns case is widely regarded as the seminal case of legal counsel conflicts among hedge fund directors.  Investors in the funds lost approximately $1.6 billion and “the two supposedly independent directors appointed by Walkers to serve Cioffi’s two hedge funds were Scott Lennon and Michelle Wilson-Clarke”&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/the-other-offshore-disaster/|title=The Other Offshore Disaster|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=24 June 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; were found by the Cayman Islands court to be conflicted as they were employees of an affiliate of [[Walkers (law firm)|Walkers]].   In his judgment the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands said “For reasons which I need not elaborate now (but would be prepared to if asked), I am led to an irresistible impression that the manner of the conduct of the directors, trustee and the lawyers advising them” — all Walkers employees — “over the resolutions for winding up was clandestine and suspicious and was certainly in breach of the strict prohibition — against such a resolution being taken during the pendancy of the investors’ petition for the removal of the directors."&lt;ref name="CohanNYTimes"/&gt;

===Sark Lark===
During the 1980s, Sark was notorious for the emergence of the so-called “nominee director” practice&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/25/offshore-secrets-sark-lark-britons|title=The 'Sark Lark' Britons scattered around the world|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Leigh|first1=David|last2=Frayman|first2=Harold|last3=Ball|first3=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. where the director is in name only and does not exercise his judgment independently but rather acts like an automaton under the control of another person.  
The most infamous example was in 1999, when Guinness world record holder and Sark resident Phil Crowshaw was found to have singlehandedly held 3,378 directorships registered in Sark, 1,312 registered directorships in England and more than 2,000 directorships registered in Dublin and Isle of Man.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/doors-open-to-reveal-secret-world-of-britains-offshore-tax-havens-1185984.html|title=Doors open to reveal secret world of Britain's offshore tax havens|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=20 November 1998 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later disqualified as a director by courts in Guernsey and the U.K. yet he was only one of “a group of residents who between them held directorships of thousands of companies scattered far and wide”.&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  These individuals were engaged in “the totally unacceptable practice of renting out their names as company directors without any real knowledge of what the companies are up to.”&lt;ref name="Guardian2"/&gt;  
In response [[Jack Straw]], the [[Home Secretary]] commissioned Andrew Edwards, former UK Treasury director to investigate these practices among Britain’s offshore dependencies.&lt;ref name="Independent2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/stamping-out-the-sark-lark-1102707.html|title=Stamping out the Sark Lark|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=27 June 1999 |work=[[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265705/4109.pdf|title=Review of Financial Regulation in the Crown Dependencies|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=November 1998 |publisher=The Stationery Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Edwards report called for various reforms including that “Guernsey, Alderney and Sark should introduce a system of licensing and registering directors and bring in a code of conduct governing the standards expected from directors and trustees.”  The Edwards report “also called for a limit to be set on the number of directorships held by individuals, suggesting a ceiling of five trading companies or 30 asset-holding (fund) companies”.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; The Sark Lark ignited the debate about director capacity and the backlash against independent directors in offshore jurisdictions.  It was the genesis of the now discredited notion that caps on directorships would improve director performance or the number of directorships held is a proxy for director performance.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20451176|title=Tax evasion flourishing with help from UK firms|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=25 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several jurisdictions arbitrarily introduced caps on director capacity based on the Edwards report. However, as recently as November, 2012, BBC reported that the Sark Lark was still thriving.&lt;ref name="BBC2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20495222|title=Cable to review 'sham' company directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=26 November 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weavering Capital===
{{see also|Grey Wolf (film)#Weavering Capital}}
The Weavering case was widely regarded as the seminal case on hedge fund directors’ duties and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/weavering-capital-boss-magnus-peterson-guilty-fraud|title=Weavering Capital boss found guilty of forgery and fraud|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=19 January 2015 |work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Bowers|first1=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Limited was listed on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]] and its directors Stefan Peterson and Hans Ekstrom were considered independent and in good standing under the Irish Stock Exchange standards. However, they were later found guilty by a Cayman Islands Court of being negligent in carrying out their fiduciary duties, and were held liable for US $111 million in damages.&lt;ref name="Mondaq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mondaq.com/caymanislands/x/375498/Commodities+Derivatives+Stock+Exchanges/Cayman+Court+Of+Appeal+Reverses+US111+Million+Judgment+Against|title=Cayman Court Of Appeal Reverses US$111 Million Judgment Against Weavering Directors|accessdate=15 July 2015|date=18 February 2015 |publisher=Mondaq }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was reversed on appeal and currently pending appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. The Weavering Capital Scandal became notorious because the Managing Director of the UK Management Company, Magnus Peterson, was jailed for 13 years on 8 counts of Fraud in 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financial-crime/11365885/Weavering-hedge-fund-founder-Magnus-Peterson-jailed-for-13-years-over-fraud.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the discovery that he had illegally used investors money to fund personal projects such as the ''[[Grey Wolf (Film)]]''.

==Fund governance standards==
===Reputational capital===
Successful fund governance firms have been criticized by their competitors in ‘boutique’ firms for having too many directorships or being “rubber stamp” directors.  However, independent empirical research has consistently revealed these allegations as counterfactual. Some studies&lt;ref name="Masulis"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|date=4 September 2012|publisher=SSRN|ssrn = 1108036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jof"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X13000470|title=Are All Inside Directors the Same|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=4 February 2013|journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=109|pages=63–82|doi=10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.02.004|last1=Field|first1=Laura|last2=Lowry|first2=Michelle|last3=Mkrtchyan|first3=Anahit}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used the number of directorships held by a director as a proxy for the reputational capital of the director - arguing that reputational incentives are particularly pronounced for professional hedge fund directors, and that directors who sit on more boards and the boards of better performing funds should be of higher quality. Thus, hiring a director who can be credibly perceived as being more independent could provide valuable certification for the fund.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; Busy professional directors are more common among funds that derive higher benefits from external certification and monitoring, and their departure from the board is associated with outflows of investor capital. This result is inconsistent with directors serving as uninformative (or most nefariously, pro-management) rubber-stamps and inconsistent with the theory that funds prefer rubber-stamp directors who face more time constraints, making them too busy to monitor the manager.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=How to run offshore management companies and funds with substance and corporate governance|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 September 2013|publisher=Alternative Investment Management Association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting shares===
An inordinate amount of scrutiny has been placed on issue of board capacity and composition to improve board performance, but those factors may become irrelevant to boards acting in the best interests of investors if the voting shares are held by the manager.&lt;ref name="Schroders"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aima.org/en/education/aimajournal/past-articles/index.cfm/jid/C511D286-70DE-4849-9A75AA28A66354A7|title=Investment and Corporate Governace: Schroders' Policy|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Schroders}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a serious conflict arises with the manager the degree to which the board can effectively act in the best interests of the fund can be neutralized in these circumstances. The voting shares give the manager complete discretion over the appointment and removal of directors; therefore controlling board composition and the ability to veto any of its decisions.  If the investment manager is dissatisfied with any decision, he can simply exercise his right to remove the director(s) and replace them with someone more amendable to the manager’s wishes.&lt;ref name="AIMAgovernance"/&gt;

===Composition===
The board requires has the right mix of skills, talent and capacity to function effectively.  Proprietors and boutique firms by definition have limited resources and – by design – do not invest the time or money required to deliver the full range of resources provided by professional firms.&lt;ref name="CFA Asset Manager"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/contributed/Pages/asset_manager_code_of_professional_conduct.aspx|title=Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=[[CFA Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the large fund governance firms become more dominant, it has become common for proprietors and other boutique firms to band together, pooling their resources to create a larger ‘virtual’  or ‘pseudo’ professional firm to offer greater scale and selection to compete with the large professional firms. These alliances are commonly marketed as ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards.&lt;ref name="MFA 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.managedfunds.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Final_2009_complete.pdf|title=Sound Practices for Hedge Fund Managers|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 July 2015|publisher=Managed Funds Associations}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these loose arrangements often lack the operating discipline and reputational investment of their large professional firm counterparts.&lt;ref name="HFSB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hfsb.org/sites/10377/files/hedge_fund_standards_-_as_at_february_2012.pdf|title=The Hedge Fund Standards|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Hedge Fund Standards Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the arrangements create co-dependency for business referrals and actually create higher complexity and potential for conflicts of interests since and they are entered into primarily for commercial reasons, and not to act in the best interests of the fund.  It is not uncommon for these arrangements to result in a high level of duplication and dysfunction.&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Split or mixed boards===
All directors owe the same [[fiduciary duties]] and directors each have [[joint and several liability]] so in reality ‘split’ or ‘mixed’ boards is a marketing aphorism and distinction without a difference.  Independent research&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt; has found that professional firms of quality directors have large reputational investment with high incentive to perform well and consistently outperform proprietorships.  This research found that “directors from a top ten firm are almost twice as likely as directors from smaller firms to obtain a new directorship.”&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;  This implies that directors are even more likely to be hired when their firm has a larger client base, and thus more reputational capital to protect. The single firm focus is counterfactual to the risk analysis. Unquestionably the area of greatest risk within any fund is within its investment portfolio.  Enormous authority over the fund affairs is often entrusted to the investment manager as a single individual, from a single firm, yet it would be universally accepted to be counterproductive and inefficient to appoint another manager from a different firm to manage the same portfolio at the same time, or another auditor from different firm to audit the same fund at the same time.  It is not obvious, other than the aforementioned marketing reason, why any one believes that appointing directors from different firms is an effective mechanism for eliciting independent judgment and deliberation than those doing the deciding work for a (single) firm instead.&lt;ref name=Clifford/&gt;&lt;ref name=HFSB/&gt;

===Lead director===
Boards are small organizations but like all organizations they need effective leadership to succeed.  The SEC recommends fund boards to appoint a lead director and it has become an industry leading practice for many fund boards to appoint a lead director to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the board.  The lead director may schedule, set and prioritize board meeting agendas and make sure the board receives reports from management on essential matters.&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"/&gt;  The lead director may also be the chief contact for the board’s counsel or the fund's auditors (or other service providers).  If the lead director is an independent director, he or she may represent the other independent directors in discussions with the fund management. SEC also recommends directors employ staff.&lt;ref name=StandfordLaw/&gt;&lt;ref name="SECic-262520"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ic-26520.pdf|title=Investment Company Governance; Final Rule|accessdate=2 September 2015|date=2 August 2014 |publisher=Securities Exchange Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13119">The [[global navigation satellite system]] (GNSS) positioning for receiver's position is derived through the calculation steps, or algorithm, given below. 
In essence, a GNSS receiver measures the transmitting time of GNSS signals emitted from four or more GNSS satellites and these measurements are used to obtain its position (i.e., spatial coordinates) and reception time.&lt;!--
In essence, from each received satellite signal a single measured quantity is obtained (time of arrival of information from the satellite). Four quantities need to be computed: three spatial coordinates and the absolute time. Thus, it is necessary to receive signals from a minimum of four satellites in order to solve for the four unknowns. With more than four signals available, it is possible to use the extra information to check for consistency and to improve the accuracy of the position and time. --&gt;

==Calculation steps==
# A [[global navigation satellite system|global-navigation-satellite-system]] (GNSS) receiver measures the apparent transmitting time, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tilde{t}_i&lt;/math&gt;, or "phase", of GNSS signals emitted from four or more GNSS [[satellite]]s (&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle i \;=\; 1,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4,\, ..,\, n&lt;/math&gt; ), simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Misra_Enge"&gt;Misra, P. and Enge, P.,  Global Positioning System: Signals, Measurements, and Performance, 2nd, Ganga-Jamuna Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
# GNSS satellites broadcast the messages of satellites' [[ephemeris]], &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_i (t)&lt;/math&gt;, and intrinsic clock bias (i.e., clock advance), &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t)&lt;/math&gt;{{clarify|what does 'sv' denote?|date=December 2017}} as the functions of ([[atomic clock|atomic]]) [[standard time]], e.g., [[GPST]].&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"&gt;[http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/IS-GPS-200D.pdf The interface specification of NAVSTAR GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The transmitting time of GNSS satellite signals, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t_i&lt;/math&gt;, is thus derived from the non-[[closed-form expression|closed-form]] [[equations]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tilde{t}_i \;=\; t_i \,+\, \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i) \;=\; \delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t_i) \,+\, \delta t_{\text{orbit-relativ},\, i} (\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{orbit-relativ},i} (\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] clock bias, periodically risen from the satellite's [[orbital eccentricity]] and Earth's [[gravity field]].&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"/&gt;  The satellite's position and velocity are determined by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t_i&lt;/math&gt; as follows: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_i \;=\; \boldsymbol{r}_i (t_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i \;=\; \dot{\boldsymbol{r}}_i (t_i)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;!-- The satellite's position is derived from &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_i \;=\; \boldsymbol{r}_i (t_i)&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;
# In the field of GNSS, "geometric range", &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_A,\, \boldsymbol{r}_B) &lt;/math&gt;, is defined as straight range, or 3-dimensional [[distance#Geometry|distance]],&lt;ref&gt;3-dimensional [[distance#Geometry|distance]] is given by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_A,\, \boldsymbol{r}_B) = |\boldsymbol{r}_A - \boldsymbol{r}_B| = \sqrt{(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2+(z_A-z_B)^2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\boldsymbol{r}_A = (x_A, y_A, z_A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\boldsymbol{r}_B = (x_B, y_B, z_B)&lt;/math&gt; represented in [[inertial frame]].&lt;/ref&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\boldsymbol{r}_A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\boldsymbol{r}_B&lt;/math&gt; in [[inertial frame]] (e.g., [[Earth-centered inertial]] (ECI) one), not in [[rotating frame]].&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"/&gt;&lt;!--  In 3 dimensional space geometric range or [[distance#Geometry|distance]] is given by &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_A,\, \boldsymbol{r}_B) =\sqrt{(x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2+(z_A-z_B)^2}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x_A, y_A, z_A, x_B, y_B, z_B&lt;/math&gt; are components of &lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{r}_A,\ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}_B&lt;/math&gt; respectively expressed in ECI coordinates.--&gt;
# The receiver's position, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;,  and reception time, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;, satisfy the [[light-cone]] equation of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}) / c \,+\, (t_i - t_{\text{rec}}) \;=\; 0 &lt;/math&gt; in [[inertial frame]], where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]. The signal time of flight from satellite to receiver is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -(t_i \,-\, t_{\text{rec}})&lt;/math&gt;.
# The above is extended to the [[Global navigation satellite system|satellite-navigation]] [[Real-time locating system|positioning]] [[equation]], &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}) / c \,+\, (t_i \,-\, t_{\text{rec}}) \,+\, \delta t_{\text{atmos},i} \,-\, \delta t_{\text{meas-err},i} \;=\; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{atmos},i}&lt;/math&gt; is [[atmospheric delay]] (= [[ionospheric delay]] + [[tropospheric delay]]) along signal path and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{meas-err},i}&lt;/math&gt; is the measurement error.
# The [[Gauss–Newton]] method can be used to solve the [[nonlinear]] [[least-squares problem]] for the solution: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{\text{rec}},\, \hat{t}_{\text{rec}}) \;=\; \arg \min  \phi ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\,  t_{\text{rec}} )&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}} ) \;=\; \sum_{i=1}^n ( \delta t_{\text{meas-err},i} / \sigma_{\delta t_{\text{meas-err},i} } )^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{meas-err},i}&lt;/math&gt; should be regarded as a function of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!-- and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \delta t_{\text{meas-err},i} ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}} ) \;=\; r(\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}) / c \,+\, (t_i \,-\, t_{\text{rec}}) \,+\, \delta t_{\text{atmos},i}  &lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;
&lt;!-- ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}} ) --&gt;
&lt;!-- , in order to obtain the solution of the receiver's position, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;, and reception time, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;. --&gt;
&lt;!-- \underset{(\boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}})  }{\arg \min} --&gt;
# The [[posterior distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \exp ( -\frac{1}{2} \phi ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}} ) )&lt;/math&gt;, whose [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{\text{rec}},\, \hat{t}_{\text{rec}})&lt;/math&gt;. Their inference is formalized as [[maximum a posteriori estimation]].
# The [[posterior distribution]] of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp ( -\frac{1}{2} \phi ( \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}},\, t_{\text{rec}} ) ) \, d t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt;.

--&gt;

== The GPS case ==
* For [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS),&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"/&gt; the non-closed-form equations in step 3 result in
&lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta t_i (t_i,\, E_i) \;\equiv\; t_i \,+\, \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i,\, E_i) \,-\, \tilde{t}_i \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Delta M_i (t_i,\, E_i) \;\equiv\; M_i (t_i) \,-\, (E_i \,-\, e_i \sin E_i) \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \begin{cases}
  \scriptstyle \Delta t_i (t_i,\, E_i) \;\triangleq\; t_i \,+\, \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i,\, E_i) \,-\, \tilde{t}_i \;=\; 0, \\
  \scriptstyle \Delta M_i (t_i,\, E_i) \;\triangleq\; M_i (t_i) \,-\, (E_i \,-\, e_i \sin E_i) \;=\; 0, 
\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;
in which &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the orbital [[eccentric anomaly]] of satellite &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle M_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean anomaly]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle e_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t_i,\, E_i) \;=\; \delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t_i) \,+\, \delta t_{\text{orbit-relativ},i} (E_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The above can be solved by using the [[bivariate analysis|bivariate]] [[Newton–Raphson]] method on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle t_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Two times of iteration will be necessary and sufficient in most cases. Its iterative update will be described by using the approximated [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] matrix as follows:
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle
\begin{pmatrix}
  t_i \\
  E_i \\
\end{pmatrix}
\leftarrow 
\begin{pmatrix}
  t_i \\
  E_i \\
\end{pmatrix}
- 
\begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp;&amp; 0 \\
  \frac{\dot{M}_i (t_i)}{1 - e_i \cos E_i} &amp;&amp; -\frac{1}{1 - e_i \cos E_i} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
  \Delta t_i \\
  \Delta M_i \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Tropospheric delay]] should not be ignored, while the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) specification&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"/&gt; doesn't provide its detailed description. &lt;!--mention it clearly.--&gt;

== The GLONASS case ==
* The [[GLONASS]] ephemerides don't provide clock biases &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\delta t_{\text{clock,sv},i} (t)&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\delta t_{\text{clock},i} (t)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Note==
* In the field of GNSS, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{r}_i \;=\; -c (\tilde{t}_i \,-\, \tilde{t}_{\text{rec}})&lt;/math&gt; is called [[pseudorange]], where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{t}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; is a provisional reception time of the receiver. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta t_{\text{clock,rec}} \;=\; \tilde{t}_{\text{rec}} \,-\, t_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; is called receiver's clock bias (i.e., clock advance).&lt;ref name="Misra_Enge"/&gt;
* Standard GNSS receivers output &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{r}_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \tilde{t}_{\text{rec}}&lt;/math&gt; per an observation [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]].
* The temporal variation in the relativistic clock bias of satellite is linear if its orbit is circular (and thus its velocity is uniform in inertial frame).
* The signal time of flight from satellite to receiver is expressed as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle -(t_i - t_{\text{rec}}) \;=\; \tilde{r}_i/c \,+\, \delta t_{\text{clock},i} \,-\, \delta t_{\text{clock,rec}}&lt;/math&gt;, whose right side is [[round-off error|round-off-error]] resistive during calculation.
* The geometric range is calculated as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle r(\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}}) \;=\; |  \Omega_{\text{E}} (t_i \,-\, t_{\text{rec}}) \boldsymbol{r}_{i,\text{ECEF}} \,-\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec,ECEF}}  |&lt;/math&gt;, where the [[ECEF|Earth-centred, Earth-fixed]] (ECEF) rotating frame (e.g., [[WGS84]] or [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame|ITRF]]) is used in the right side and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega_{\text{E}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth rotating matrix with the argument of the signal [[time of flight|transit time]].&lt;ref name="IS-GPS"/&gt; The matrix can be factorized as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Omega_{\text{E}} (t_i \,-\, t_{\text{rec}}) \;=\; \Omega_{\text{E}} (\delta t_{\text{clock,rec}}) \Omega_{\text{E}} (-\tilde{r}_i/c \,-\, \delta t_{\text{clock},i}) &lt;/math&gt;.
* The line-of-sight unit vector of satellite observed at &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec,ECEF}}&lt;/math&gt; is described as: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{e}_{i, \text{rec,ECEF}} \;=\; -\frac{\partial r(\boldsymbol{r}_i,\, \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec}})}{\partial \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec,ECEF}}} &lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[Global navigation satellite system|satellite-navigation]] [[Real-time locating system|positioning]] [[equation]] may be expressed by using the [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \boldsymbol{r}_{\text{rec,ECEF}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta t_{\text{clock,rec}}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The [[nonlinearity]] of the vertical dependency of [[tropospheric delay]] degrades the convergence efficiency in the [[Gauss–Newton]] iterations in step 7.
* The above notation is different from that in the Wikipedia articles, 'Position calculation introduction' and 'Position calculation advanced', of [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).

'''Gender roles in [[Mesoamerica]]''' were compleentary in nature, meaning that men and women had separate but equally important roles in society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Christine D.|date=2005-10-01|title=Gendered food behaviour among the Maya: Time, place, status and ritual|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1469605305057572|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=356–382|doi=10.1177/1469605305057572|issn=1469-6053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also suggests the existence of gender ambiguity and fluidity in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gender relations and roles also varied among different Mesoamerican cultures and societies, through time, and depending on social status.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Mesoamerica or Meso-America (Spanish: Mesoamérica) is a region and culture area in the Americas, extending approximately from central Mexico to Honduras and Nicaragua, within which a number of pre-Columbian societies flourished before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Although women's roles in agriculture have been underestimated, if it were not for the contributions of women in agriculture, the family would not survive.&lt;ref name="lopez" /&gt;

With the arrival of the Spanish and their subsequent colonial rule starting in the 16th century, Mesoamerican gender relations could no longer be considered distinct cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71833382|title=The legacy of Mesoamerica : history and culture of a Native American civilization|date=2007|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|others=Carmack, Robert M., 1934-, Gasco, Janine., Gossen, Gary H.|isbn=9780130492920|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|oclc=71833382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles and gender relations instead became subject to the practices of Spanish colonial rule and the [[casta]] system which racially categorized the Mesoamericans and their indigenous and mixed descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39890515|title=Race, caste, and status : Indians in colonial Spanish America|last=Howard)|first=Jackson, Robert H.

=== Labor ===
Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican art contains evidence of a gendered division of labor, depicting women engaged in domestic labor such as weaving, childrearing, tending to animals, and giving birth. Weaving was more strongly associated with gender for the Classic Mexica than the Classic Maya, for which it indicated class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCAA|first=Robert|date=May 2003|title=The Nahua calli of ancient Mexico: household, family, and gender|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/nahua-calli-of-ancient-mexico-household-family-and-gender/6BD6B350016AB6BF8778A32CAE5289AA|journal=Continuity and Change|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23–48|doi=10.1017/s026841600300448x|issn=1469-218X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men were depicted with weapons and in positions of religious and political authority. While evidence suggests that farming was seen as a male activity, the gendered divisions of labor may not have been so strict. Analysis of the bones of women revealed evidence of wear patterns strongly associated with the repetitive motion of grinding maize, suggesting women were primarily engaged in that labor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthrojournal.com/issue/october-2011/article/gender-in-mesoamerica-interpreting-gender-roles-in-classic-maya-society|title=Gender in Mesoamerica: Interpreting Gender Roles in Classic Maya Society|last=Plumer|first=Hannah|date=October 2011|website=The Collegiate Journal of Anthropology|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists such as Miranda Stockett believe it is likely that men, women, and children all participated in farming and domestic labor to varying degrees.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stockett|first=Miranda K.|date=2005-12-01|title=On the importance of difference: re-envisioning sex and gender in ancient Mesoamerica|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00438240500404375|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4|pages=566–578|doi=10.1080/00438240500404375|issn=0043-8243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also hold a variety of roles within the family. These range from harvesting the grains and preparing the food for the family, to taking care of the domesticated animals. When examining the role women play in planting and harvesting, one notices that this area still holds some stereotypes with how the women aid their husbands. In some societies women are responsible for sowing and harvesting the crops but are restricted from [[plough]]ing. The roles shared between men and women in agriculture in Santa Rosa, Yucatán. Although women are allocated such tasks as sowing, with all its association with fertility, they are rigidly excluded from ploughing.&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sage |first=Colin |title=Deconstructing the Household Different Places, Different Voices |author2=Janet Henshall Momsen |author3=Vivian Kinnaird |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |pages=243–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of not allowing women to plough is related to human reproduction. The common belief is that women should not be able to plough because it invades on the male’s role in human reproduction. Thus, men are able to carry out all stages of the agriculture cycle, including the planting of the seed, while women—even in their role as head of the household—are sanctioned to rely upon men for particular tasks.&lt;ref name="sage" /&gt; The reasoning behind limiting women’s roles with production of the crops is directly related to reproduction. Women rely on men for some tasks when planting crops, just as women need the assistance of the men in reproduction.

Aside from producing food, another important task that women carry out is food preparation, which demands the most attention because the women must sit by the hearth for long periods of time. In the role women have in the preparation of maize, after the grains have been harvested, the next step is to process them so the family can consume them. Apart from childbearing and childrearing, one of the women’s foremost duties was the processing of dried corn into maize flour. After being boiled with lime, softened maize kernels were ground with a tubular hand stone on a flat grinding stone (metate) into maize dough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Stone |first=Andrea J. |title=Women in Ancient Mesoamerica Women’s Role in Ancient Civilizations |author2=Bella Vivante |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1999 |pages=293–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the dough is formed, a variety of food items can be made. Here the metate plays an important role in the processing of maize, the staple crop of the culture.

{{quote|The last major role women hold in a society relates to animals. Many households have corrals for their domestic animals, and this is another area that women are responsible for. When discussing the roles women play with domestic animals the [[Livery yard|corral]] is very important to the women of the household and is another area where they spend a great deal of their time. Here she spent a good part of her time, taking care of the animals…caring for the chickens, cleaning the dovecote, feeding the mule, rabbits…here in the corral one eats from one’s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Goldsmith |first=Raquel Rubio |title=Seasons, Seeds and Souls Women of the Mexican Countryside |author2=Heather Fowler-Salamini |author3=Mary Kay Vaughan |publisher=The University of Arizona Press |year=1994 |pages=140–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Women play an important role in the survival of their families because the family survives from the work they perform in the corral.

Additionally, the success of Mesoamerican rituals was dependent on the production of food and textiles, to which women contributed much labor. These rituals were vital to ensuring good relationships with not only the gods but also within communities. In ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]],'' [[Diego de Landa]] observed that for nearly all rituals, Mayan women were responsible for preparing food for both offerings and consumption in addition to cloth as offerings.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Gender relations among the Mexica also suggested gender complementarity. For example, dying in battle and dying in childbirth elevated men and women respectively. In childbirth, women confront the goddess [[Cihuacoatl]], and if they died, their bodies were considered temporarily imbued with the power of the goddess. Since parts of their bodies could be used as a protective amulet or to curse others, the husband kept vigil by her body for four nights.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/156831786|title=Bonds of blood : gender, lifecycle and sacrifice in Aztec culture|last=1978-|first=Dodds Pennock, Caroline,|date=2008|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230003309|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire [England]|oclc=156831786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
Some Mesoamerican women were able to assume roles as political leaders, such as women in Maya society, others such as women in Mexica society were not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However while Mexica women couldn't serve in this capacity, they were given equal legal and economy rights and noble Mexica women could become priestesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, two influential political figures headed the highest levels of Mexica government. One was the ''tlatoani'', literally "the one who speaks", and another was the ''cihuacoatl'', literally "woman snake", both representing a male/female pair. The ''tlatoani'' was responsible for military affairs and the ''cihuacoatl'' was responsible for domestic affairs like the food supply and administering justice. The position of ''cihuacoatl'' was in reality occupied by a man, but the associations with femininity were significant enough that the ''cihuacoatl'', of the same name as the goddess, wore women's dress for ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As Mesoamerican states became more centralized over time, men's power became more associated with their control over women and their capacity for productive and reproductive labor. As a result, opportunities available to women were gradually limited.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/608820583|title=Gender and power in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|last=1956-|first=Joyce, Rosemary A.,|date=2000|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292740648|edition=First|location=Austin|oclc=608820583}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Mexica, military concerns may have eclipsed women's public significance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Gender ambiguity ===
Although pre-Columbian Mesoamerican art contained depictions of the body as male or female as represented by genitalia or secondary sex characteristics, it also included representations of bodies with exposed chests and waists but no visible sexual characteristics. Depictions of rituals conducted by elite Mesoamericans have included women dressed in the traditional costume of men and men dressed in the traditional costume of women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Classic Maya text also includes situations where gender is not linguistically marked or where gender is marked linguistically as male for a speaker who appears to be a woman or vice versa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This evidence suggests considerable fluidity between the genders in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican society.

The '''Global Sales Law Project'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsaleslaw.org&lt;/ref&gt; is a research project based at the [[University of Basel]] under the leadership of [[Ingeborg Schwenzer]]. It compares the sales and contract laws of more than 60 jurisdictions.

== Global Sales and Contract Law ==
The centerpiece of the project is the Global Sales and Contract Law handbook,&lt;ref&gt;http://lccn.loc.gov/2011939853&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Ingeborg Schwenzer together with [[Christopher Kee]] and [[Pascal Hachem]]. The work provides a comprehensive systematic analysis based on the functional comparative method. Particularly remarkable about the book is the approach of research in so far as the comparison is completely based on the functional comparative method rather than on the basis of separate country reports. The authors based their work on the doctoral theses of [[Mohamed Hafez]] (Arabia and the Middle East), [[Natia Lapiashvili]] (Eastern Europe and Central Asia), [[Edgardo Muñoz]] (Latin America), [[Jean Alain Penda Matipe]] (Central and Southern Africa), and [[Sophia Juan Yang]] (Southeast Asia). Each of these theses was a comparative legal work on one family of legal systems and all of them were supervised by Schwenzer.

== Commentary on the CISG ==
Also part of the Global Sales Law Project is the leading commentary on the [[CISG|United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)]], edited by Ingeborg Schwenzer. The commentary is published in German (5th edition),&lt;ref&gt;http://lccn.loc.gov/2009523957&lt;/ref&gt; English (3rd edition),&lt;ref&gt;http://lccn.loc.gov/2010288696&lt;/ref&gt; and Spanish (1st edition).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/schlechtriem-schwenzer-comentario-sobre-la-convencion-de-las-naciones-unidas-sobre-los-contratos-de-compraventa-internacional-de-mercaderias/oclc/754653801&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently being translated to Mandarin Chinese.

== CISG-online ==
CISG-online&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsaleslaw.org/index.cfm?pageID=28&lt;/ref&gt; is the only comprehensive database in the German-speaking world on CISG case law and as such also part of the project.

[[File:Handaxe by John Frere.png|thumb|The first published picture of a hand axe, drawn by John Frere in the year 1800.]]
[[File:Flint hand axe.JPG|thumb|right|Flint hand axe found in [[Winchester]]]]
A '''hand axe''' (or handaxe) is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[stone tool]] with two faces that is the longest-used [[tool]] in [[human history]]. It is usually made from [[flint]] or [[chert]]. It is characteristic of the lower [[Acheulean]] and middle [[Palaeolithic]] ([[Mousterian]]) periods. Its technical name ('''biface''') comes from the fact that the archetypical model is generally bifacial [[Lithic flake]] and [[Almond|almond-shaped]] (amygdaloidal). Hand axes tend to be [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] along their longitudinal [[Symmetry axis|axis]] and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic shape, and both faces have been [[Knapping|knapped]] to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.

Hand axes were the first prehistoric tools to be recognized as such: the first published representation of a hand axe was drawn by [[John Frere]] and appeared in a [[Great Britain|British]] publication in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frere, John|year=1800|title=Account of Flint Weapons Discovered at Hoxne in Suffolk|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/archaeologia/article/xviii-account-of-flint-weapons-discovered-at-hoxne-in-suffolk-by-john-frere-esq-frs-and-fas-in-a-letter-to-the-rev-john-brand-secretary/B7F977AE44B33A9E8CC0FAF1883C84D9|journal=Archaeologia|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of London|volume=13|pages=204–205|doi=10.1017/s0261340900024267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, their origins were thought to be natural or supernatural. They were called ''[[Thunderstone (folklore)|thunderstones]]'', because popular tradition held that they had fallen from the sky during storms or were formed inside the earth by a [[lightning strike]] and then appeared at the surface. They are used in some rural areas as an [[amulet]] to protect against storms.

Hand axe tools were possibly used to butcher animals; to dig for [[tuber]]s, animals and water; to chop wood and remove tree bark; to throw at prey; and as a source for [[flake tool]]s.
{{toclimit|3}}

==Terminology==
Four classes of hand axe are:{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

*1: Large, thick hand axes reduced from cores or thick flakes, referred to as [[blank (archaeology)|blanks]]
*2: Thinned blanks. While form remains rough and uncertain, an effort has been made to reduce the thickness of the flake or core
*3: Either a preform or crude formalized tool, such as an [[adze]]
*4: Finer formalized tool types such as [[projectile point]]s and fine bifaces

While Class 4 hand axes are referred to as "formalized tools", bifaces from any stage of a [[lithic reduction]] sequence may be used as tools. (Other biface typologies make five divisions rather than four).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

French [[antiquarian]] André Vayson de Pradenne introduced the word [[:Fr:biface|''biface'']] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vayson de Pradenne, André|chapter=La plus ancienne industrie de Saint-Acheul|title=L'Anthropologie|volume=XXX|year=1920|publisher=Publications Elsevier, Paris|issn=0003-5521|pages=441–496}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term co-exists with the more popular ''hand axe'' (''coup de poing''), that was coined by [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet]] much earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Mortillet, Gabriel|authorlink=Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|title=Le Préhistorique. Antiquité de l'homme|year=1883|publisher=Bibliothèque des Sciences Contemporaines. Paris|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued use of the word biface by [[François Bordes]] and Lionel Balout supported its use in France and Spain, where it replaced the term ''hand axe''. Use of the expression ''hand axe'' has continued in English as the equivalent of the French ''biface'' (''bifaz'' in Spanish), while biface applies more generally for any piece that has been carved on both sides by the removal of shallow or deep flakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andefsky Jr., William|chapter=Biface analysis|title=Lithics. A Macroscopic Approaches to Analysis|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-61500-6|doi=10.1177/146195710100400111|pages=177–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression [[:De:Faustkeil|''faustkeil'']] is used in [[German language|German]]. It can be literally translated as hand axe, although in a stricter sense it means "fist wedge". It is the same in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] where the expression used is ''vuistbijl'' which literally means "fist axe". The same locution occurs in other languages.{{Weasel inline|date=January 2017}}

However, the general impression of these tools were based on ideal (or classic) pieces that were of such perfect shape that they caught the attention of non-experts. Their [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] broadened the term's  meaning. Biface hand axe and bifacial lithic items are distinguished. A hand axe need not be a bifacial item and many bifacial items are not hand axes. Nor were hand axes and bifacial items exclusive to the Lower Palaeolithic period in the Old World. They appear throughout the world and in many different pre-historical epochs, without necessarily implying an ancient origin. Lithic typology is not a reliable chronological reference and was abandoned as a dating system. Examples of this include the "quasi-bifaces" that sometimes appear in strata from the [[Gravettian]], [[Solutrean]] and [[Magdalenian]] periods in France and Spain, the crude bifacial pieces of the [[Lupemban culture]] ([[10th millennium BC|9000&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;C.]]) or the [[wikt:pyriform|pyriform]] tools found near [[Sagua La Grande]] in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arqueologicas.tripod.com/bifaces.html|title=Bifaces en el paleolitico de Sagua|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website= arqueologia de sabeneque|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''biface'' refers to something different in English than ''biface'' in French or ''bifaz'' in Spanish, which could lead to many misunderstandings.{{cn|date=January 2017}} Bifacially carved cutting tools, similar to hand axes, were used to clear scrub vegetation throughout the [[Neolithic]] and [[Chalcolithic]] periods. These tools are similar to more modern [[adze]]s and were a cheaper alternative to polished axes. The modern day villages along the [[Sepik]] river in [[New Guinea]] continue to use tools that are virtually identical to hand axes to clear forest. "The term ''biface'' should be reserved for items from before the Würm II-III{{Clarify|date=January 2017}} [[Stadial|interstadial]]",&lt;ref name=benito&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benito del Rey, Luis|title=Aportación a un estudio tecnomorfológico del bifaz, útil del Paleolítico Inferior y Medio: Studia Zamorensia|year=1982|volume=III|publisher=Ediciones de la Universidad de Salamanca, Colegio Universitario de Zamora|issn=0211-1837|pages=305–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; although certain later objects could ''exceptionally'' be called bifaces.{{sfn|Benito del Rey|1982|page=305, note 1}}

''Hand axe'' does not relate to ''[[axe]]'', which was overused in lithic typology to describe a wide variety of stone tools.{{cn|date=January 2017}} At the time the use of such items was not understood. In the particular case of Palaeolithic hand axes the term axe is an inadequate description. Lionel Balout stated, "the term should be rejected as an erroneous interpretation of these objects that are not 'axes{{' "}}.&lt;ref name=balout&gt;{{cite journal|author=Balout, Lionel|title=Procédés d'analyse et questions de terminologie dans l'étude des ensembles industriels du Paléolithique inférieur en Afrique du nord|year=1967|journal=Background to Evolution in Africa|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|editor1=Walter W. Bishop|editor2=J. Desmond Clark|pages=701–735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies supported this idea, particularly those examining the signs of use.&lt;ref&gt;An alternative definition can be found on [http://www.winchkler.com.ar/Bb.htm#biface Biface] on [http://www.winchkler.com.ar/ Diccionario de uso para descripción de objetos líticos] by Doctor Giovanna Winchkler in Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Hand axes are mainly made of [[flint]], but [[rhyolite]]s, [[phonolite]]s, [[quartzite]]s and other coarse [[rocks]] were used as well. [[Obsidian]], natural volcanic glass, shatters easily and was rarely used.

==Uses==
Most hand axes have a sharp border all around, No academic consensus describes their use. The pioneers of Palaeolithic tool studies first suggested that bifaces were used as [[axe]]s or at least for use in demanding physical activities. Other uses showed that hand axes were a multi-functional tool. The different forms and shapes of known specimens led them to be described as the Acheulean "[[Swiss Army knife]]". Each type of tool could have been used for multiple tasks. 
[[File:Agarre de un bifaz.png|thumb|Drawing of a hand holding a hand axe]]

[[H. G. Wells|Wells]] proposed in 1899 that hand axes were used as missile weapons to hunt prey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=As We Know it: Coming to Terms with an Evolved Mind|author=Kohn, Marek|authorlink=Marek Kohn|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6SG5AAAAIAAJ}}|year=1999|publisher=Granta Books|isbn=978-1-86207-025-7|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an interpretation supported by [[William H. Calvin|Calvin]], who suggested that some of the rounder specimens of Acheulean hand axes were used as hunting projectiles or as "[[Murder|killer]] [[frisbee]]s" meant to be thrown at a herd of animals at a water hole so as to stun one of them. This assertion was inspired by findings from the [[Olorgesailie]] archaeological site in [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Calvin, William H.|title=Cómo piensan los cerebros|year=2001|publisher=Publisher Debate|place=Madrid|isbn=84-8306-378-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few specimens indicate hand axe [[hafting]], and some are too large for that use. However, few hand axes show signs of heavy damage indicative of throwing. 

In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, they could have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it is misleading to think of them as ''axes'', they could have been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a [[lithic core]] to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through [[retouch (lithics)|retouching]].

Baker suggested that the hand axe was not itself a tool, but a core from which flakes had been removed and used as tools (flake core theory).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Baker (January 27, 2006). [http://www.ele.net/acheulean/handaxe.htm The Acheulean Handaxe]. ele.net.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hand axes are often found with retouching such as sharpening or shaping, casting doubt on this idea.

Other theories suggest the shape is part tradition and part by-product of its manufacture. Many early hand axes appear to be made from simple rounded pebbles (from river or beach deposits). It is necessary to detach a 'starting flake', often much larger than the rest of the flakes (due to the oblique angle of a rounded pebble requiring greater force to detach it), thus creating an asymmetry. Correcting the asymmetry by removing material from the other faces, encouraged a more pointed (oval) form factor. (Knapping a completely circular hand axe requires considerable correction of the shape.) Studies in the 1990s at [[Boxgrove]], in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, revealed that the hand axe was able to expose [[bone marrow]].

[[Marek Kohn|Kohn]] and [[Steven Mithen|Mithen]] independently arrived at the explanation that symmetric hand axes were favoured by [[sexual selection]] as [[Fitness (biology)|fitness indicators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Singing Neanderthals|author=Mithen, Steven |authorlink=Steven Mithen|year=2005|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|pages=188–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohn in his book ''As We Know It'' wrote that the hand axe is "a highly visible indicator of fitness, and so becomes a criterion of mate choice."&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Marek (1999), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller]] followed their example and said that hand axes have characteristics that make them subject to sexual selection, such as that they were made for over a million years throughout Africa, Europe and Asia, they were made in large numbers, and most were impractical for utilitarian use. He claimed that a single design persisting across time and space cannot be explained by cultural imitation and draws a parallel between [[bowerbird]]s' [[wikt:bower|bowers]] (built to attract potential mates and used only during courtship) and [[Pleistocene]] [[Hominidae|hominids]]' hand axes. He called hand axe building a "genetically inherited propensity to construct a certain type of object." He discards the idea that they were used as missile weapons because more efficient weapons were available, such as [[javelin]]s. Although he accepted that some hand axes may have been used for practical purposes, he agreed with Kohn and Mithen who showed that many hand axes show considerable skill, design and symmetry beyond that needed for utility. Some were too big, such as the hand axe found in Furze Platt, England that is over a foot long. Some were too small - less than two inches. Some feature symmetry beyond practical requirements and show evidence of unnecessary attention to form and finish. Miller thinks that the most important clue is that under [[electron microscopes|electron microscopy]] hand axes show no signs of use or evidence of edge wear. Furthermore, hand axes can be good handicaps in [[Amotz Zahavi|Zahavi]]'s [[handicap principle]] theory: learning costs are high, risks of injury, they require physical strength, hand-eye coordination, planning, patience, pain tolerance and resistance to infection from cuts and bruises when making or using such a hand axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mating Mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature|author=Miller, Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|year=2001|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-928824-4|pages=288–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence from wear analysis===
The [[use-wear analysis]] of Palaeolithic hand axes is carried out on findings from emblematic sites across nearly all of Western Europe. Keeley and Semenov were the pioneers of this specialized investigation. Keeley stated, ''"''The morphology of typical hand axes suggests a greater range of potential activities than those of flakes''"''.&lt;ref name="keeley1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keeley, Lawrence H. |chapter=Microwear Analysis of Lithics|title=The Lower Palaeolithic site at Hoxne, England|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=London|isbn=0-226-76111-8|pages=129–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many problems need to be overcome in carrying out this type of analysis. One is the difficulty in observing larger pieces with a microscope. Of the millions of known pieces, few have been thoroughly studied. Another arises from the clear evidence that the same tasks were performed more effectively using utensils made from flakes:
{{quote|This raises the question: why make hand axes, whose production is more complicated and costly, if the flakes can do the same work with the same efficiency? The answer could be that, in general, hand axes were not conceived for a particular function (excluding certain specialized types) [...], they were not made for one main task but covered a much more general purpose.|Keeley{{sfn|Keeley|1993|p=136}}}}

Keeley based his observations on archaeological sites in England. He proposed that in base settlements where it was possible to predict future actions and where greater control on routine activities was common, the preferred tools were made from specialized flakes, such as [[racloir]]s, backed knives, [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] and punches. However, hand axes were more suitable on expeditions and in seasonal camps, where unforeseen tasks were more common. Their main advantage in these situations was the lack of specialization and adaptability to multiple eventualities. A hand axe has a long blade with different curves and angles, some sharper and others more resistant, including points and notches. All of this is combined in one tool. Given the right circumstances, it is possible to make use of [[Debitage|loose flakes]].&lt;ref name="keley2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Keeley, Lawrence H.|chapter=The Uses of Hand axes|title=Experimental Determination of Stone Tool Uses|year=1980|publisher=University of Chicago|location=London|isbn=0-226-42889-3|pages=160–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, Keeley states that a number of the hand axes studied were used as knives to cut meat (such as hand axes from [[Hoxne]] and [[Caddington]]). He identified that the point of another hand axe had been used as a clockwise [[drill]]. This hand axe came from [[Clacton-on-Sea]] (all of these sites are located in the east of England).

====Macroscopic traces====
Some hand axes were used with force that left clearly visible marks. Other visible marks can be left as the scars from retouching, on occasion it is possible to distinguish them from marks left by the initial manufacture. One of the most common cases is when a point breaks. This was seen at sites in Europe, Africa and Asia. One example comes from the El Basalito site in [[Province of Salamanca|Salamanca]], where excavation uncovered fragments of a hand axe with marks at the tip that appeared to be the result of the action of a wedge, which would have subjected the object to high levels of torsion that broke the tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benito del Rey Luis|author2=Benito Álvarez, José-Manuel|chapter=El análisis funcional de artefactos líticos prehistóricos: la Trazalogía|title=Métodos y materias instrumentales en Prehistoria y Arqueología (la Edad de la Piedra Tallada más antigua). Volume II: Tecnología y tipología|year=1998|publisher=Gráficas Cervántes, Salamanca|isbn=84-95195-05-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A break or extreme wear can affect a tool's point or any other part. Such wear was reworked by means of a secondary working as discussed above. In some cases this reconstruction is easily identifiable and was carried out using techniques such as the ''coup de tranchet'' (French, meaning "[[Tranchet axe|tranchet]] blow"), or simply with scale or scalariform retouches that alter an edge's symmetry and line.

==Forms==
[[File:Acheuleanhandaxes.jpg|right|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt;[[Acheulean]] hand axes from [[Kent]]. The types shown are (clockwise from top) chordate, ficron and ovate.&lt;/center&gt;]]

The most characteristic and common shape is a pointed area at one end, cutting edges along its side and a rounded base (this includes hand axes with a lanceolate and amygdaloidal shape as well as others from the family). Hand axes display a variety of shapes, including circular, triangular and elliptical--calling in to question the contention that they had a constant and only symbolic significance. They are typically between {{convert|8|and|15|cm}} long, although they can be bigger or smaller.
[[File:Bifaz en mano.jpg|thumb|left||upright|&lt;center&gt;Typical Acheulean hand axe&lt;/center&gt;]]
They were typically made from a rounded [[pebble|stone]], a [[boulder|block]] or [[lithic flake]], using a [[hammerstone|hammer]] to remove flakes from both sides of the item. This hammer can be made of hard stone, or of wood or [[antler]]. The latter two, softer hammers can produce more delicate results. However, a hand axe's technological aspect can reflect more differences. For example, [[uniface]] tools have only been worked on one side and partial bifaces retain a high proportion of the natural cortex of the [[tool stone]], often making them easy to confuse with [[chopping tool]]s. Further, simple bifaces may have been created from a suitable tool stone, but they rarely show evidence of [[Retouch (lithics)|retouching]].

In summary, hand axes are recognized by many typological schools under different archaeological paradigms and are quite recognisable (at least the most typical examples). However, they have not been definitively categorized. Stated more formally, the [[Ideal (ethics)|idealised]] [[Scientific modelling|model]] combines a series of well-defined [[Property (philosophy)|properties]], but no set of these properties are necessary or sufficient to identify a hand axe.

The apogee of hand axe manufacture took place in a wide area of the [[Old World]], especially during the [[Riss glaciation]], in a cultural complex that can be described as ''cosmopolitan'' and which is known as the [[Acheulean]]. The use of hand axes survived the Middle Palaeolithic in a much smaller area and were especially important during the [[Mousterian]], up to the middle of the [[Last glacial period]].

{{quote|source=''Préhistoire et Technologie lithique'', page 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacques Tixier]], coordinador|title=Préhistoire et Technologie lithique|year=1984|publisher=Éditions du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris|isbn=2-222-02718-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[In Europe s]mall bifaces are found from the late Acheulean until the Aurignacian|Pierre-Jean Texier}}

Hand axes dating from the lower Palaeolithic were found on the Asian continent, on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and in the Middle East (to the south of parallel 40° N), but they were absent from the area to the east of the 90° E [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]]. [[Hallam L. Movius|Movius]] designated a border (the so-called [[Movius Line]]) between the cultures that used hand axes to the west and those that made [[chopping tool]]s and small [[Retouch (lithics)|retouched]] [[lithic flake]]s, such as were made by [[Peking man]] and the [[Ordos culture]] in China, or their equivalents in [[Indochina]] such as the [[Hoabinhian]]. However, Movius hypothesis was found incorrect when many hand axes made in Palaeolithic era were found in 1978 at Hantan River, Jeongok, South Korea for the first time in East Asia. Some of them are exhibited at the Jeongok Prehistory Museum, South Korea.

The Padjitanian culture from [[Java]] was traditionally thought to be the only oriental culture to manufacture hand axes.{{sfn|Brézillon|1985|pp = 18–19}} However, a site in [[Baise, Guangxi|Baise]], China shows that hand axes were made in eastern Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ivpp.cas.cn/rh/rp/201303/t20130315_99730.html|title=Stone Artifacts Found from the Gonglou Site in Baise Basin, Guangxi, China|publisher=Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130717084522/http://www.ucalgary.ca/events/node/6912 Hand Axes in China?: Today’s View of the Movius Line] 16 March 2011.

In North America, hand axes make up one of the dominant tool industries, starting from the terminal [[Pleistocene]] and continuing throughout the [[Holocene]]. For example, the [[Folsom point]] and [[Clovis point]] traditions (collectively known as the fluted points) are associated with [[Paleo Indians]], some of the [[Models of migration to the New World|first people to colonize]] the [[new world]]. Hand axe technology is almost unknown in Australian prehistory.

==Construction==
Experiments in [[knapping]] have demonstrated the relative ease with which a hand axe can be made,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Semenov, S. A.|title=Tecnología prehistórica|year=1957|publisher=Akal editor, Madrid|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=mAUYAQAAMAAJ|page=82}}|isbn=84-7339-575-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could help explain their success. In addition, they demand relatively little maintenance and allow a choice of raw materials–any rock will suffice that supports a [[conchoidal fracture]]. It is easy to improvise their manufacture and correct mistakes without requiring detailed planning. No long or demanding apprenticeship is necessary to learn the necessary techniques. These factors combine to allow these objects to remain in use throughout pre-history. Their adaptability makes them effective in a variety of tasks, from heavy duty such as digging in soil, felling trees or breaking bones to delicate such as cutting ligaments, slicing meat or perforating a variety of materials.

Lastly, a hand axe represents a [[prototype]] that can be refined giving rise to more developed, specialised and sophisticated tools such as the tips of various projectiles, knives, adzes and hatchets.

==Analysis==
Given the typological difficulties in defining the essence of a hand axe, it is important when analysing them to take account of their archaeological context ([[geography|geographical location]], [[stratigraphy]], the presence of other elements associated with the same [[strata|level]], [[chronology]] etc.). It is necessary to study their physical state to establish any natural alterations that may have occurred: patina, shine, wear and tear, mechanical, thermal and / or physical-chemical changes such as cracking, in order to distinguish these factors from the scars left during the tool's manufacture or use.

The [[raw material]] is an important factor, because of the result that can be obtained by working it and in order to reveal the [[economy]] and movement of prehistoric humans. In the [[Olduvai Gorge]] the raw materials were most readily available some ten kilometres from the nearest settlements. However, [[flint]] or [[silicate]] is readily available on the [[fluvial terrace]]s of [[Western Europe]]. This means that different strategies were required for the procurement and use of available resources.&lt;ref name=hayden&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayden, Brian|chapter=From chopper to celt: the evolution of resharpening techniques|title=Time, energy and stone tools|editor=Ronin Torrence|year=1989|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=rEE9AAAAIAAJ|page=11}}|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-25350-0|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supply of materials was the most important factor in the manufacturing process as Palaeolithic artisans were able to adapt their methods to available materials, obtaining adequate results from even the most difficult raw materials.&lt;ref name=hayden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bordes, Tixier, Balout: in {{harvnb|Benito del Rey|1982|pp=306–307}} Hayden, Carol ''et al'', Jeske, etc.: in Torrence, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this it is important to study the rock's grain, texture, the presence of joints, veins, impurities or shatter cones etc.

In order to study the use of individual items it is necessary to look for traces of wear such as pseudo-retouches, breakage or wear, including areas that are polished. If the item is in a good condition it is possible to submit it to [[use-wear analysis]], which is discussed in more detail below. Apart from these generalities, which are common to all carved archaeological pieces, hand axes need a technical analysis of their manufacture and a morphological analysis.

===Technical analysis===
The technical analysis of a hand axe tries to discover each of the phases in its ''[[chaîne opératoire]]'' (operational sequence). The chain is highly flexible, as a toolmaker may focus narrowly on just one of the sequence's links or equally on each link. The links examined in this type of study start with the extraction methods of the raw material, then include the actual manufacture of the item, its use, maintenance throughout its working life, and finally its disposal.

A toolmaker may put a lot of effort into finding the highest quality raw material or the most suitable tool stone. In this way more effort is invested in obtaining a good foundation, but time is saved on shaping the stone: that is, the effort is focused on the start of the operational chain. Equally the artisan may concentrate the most effort in the manufacture so that the quality or suitability of the raw material is less important. This will minimize the initial effort, but will result in a greater effort at the end of the operational chain.

====Tool stone and cortex====
[[File:Bifaz sobre lasca.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Simple Acheulean hand axe made from a large quartzite flake (direction of knapping: lateral)&lt;/center&gt;]]
Hand axes are most commonly made from rounded pebbles or nodules, but many are also made from a large flake. Hand axes made from flakes first appeared at the start of the Acheulean period and became more common with time. Manufacturing a hand axe from a flake is actually easier than from a pebble. It is also quicker, as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer [[Knapping|knaps]] are required to finish the tool; it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a hand axe made from a flake, it should be remembered that its shape was predetermined (by use of the [[Levallois technique]] or Kombewa technique or similar). Notwithstanding this, it is necessary to note a tool's characteristics: type of flake, heel, knap direction.&lt;ref&gt;The orientation of a hand axe relates to its morphological axis. This may be difficult to determine as subsequent flaking may have erased evidence of its position. In this case, its orientation can be inferred from the marks on the lower face of the tool stone. The position of the heel can describe using a [[compass rose]]: a heel located at the base of the hand axe will be referred to as being in the southerly position. If a heel is to one side, its position will be referred to as being in the easterly or westerly position. If the heel was in the position now occupied by the hand axe's point, which will mean that its original location will have been destroyed, this is called the northerly position. It is also possible to assign intermediate positions (south-east, north-west etc.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural external cortex or ''rind'' of the tool stone, which is due to erosion and the physical-chemical alterations of [[weathering]], is different from the stone's interior. In the case of [[chert]], [[quartz]] or [[quartzite]], this alteration is basically mechanical, and apart from the colour and the wear it has the same characteristics as the interior in terms of [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[toughness]] etc. However, flint is surrounded by a [[limestone]] cortex that is soft and unsuitable for stone tools. As hand axes are made from a tool stone's core, it is normal to indicate the thickness and position of the cortex in order to better understand the techniques that are required in their manufacture. The variation in cortex between utensils should not be taken as an indication of their age.

Many partially-worked hand axes do not require further work in order to be effective tools. They can be considered to be simple hand axes. Less suitable tool stone requires more thorough working. In some specimens the cortex is unrecognisable due to the complete working that it has undergone, which has eliminated any vestige of the original cortex.

==Types==
It is possible to distinguish multiple types of hand axe:
{| align=center
|[[File:Monofaz Achelense.png|thumb|upright=.71|&lt;center&gt;Uniface hand axe.&lt;/center&gt;]]
|[[File:Bifaz parcial-El-Lombo.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Partial biface.&lt;/center&gt;]]
|}
*Uniface—flaked on one face with cortex completely covering the other side. This characteristic does not disqualify such tools as hand axes and gives no indication of their age.
*Partial biface—The cortex is present on the tool's base and central part. The overall area that is not knapped may extend to up to 2/3 of its length.
*Bifaces with basal cortex coverage—Only the artefact's base is covered with cortex, which does not cover more than a third of total length. In some cases the cortex is present on both the base and one side, thereby affecting one edge: such tools are called "natural backed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Victor Chabai|editor2=Jürgen Richter|editor3=Thorsten Uthmeier|title=Palaeolithic Sites of Crimea, Vol 3 Part 2, Kabazi V: Interstratification of Micoquian and Levallois – Mousterian Camp Sites|year=2008|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=RhXls6ublWEC|page=203}}|publisher=University of Cologne|page=203|isbn=978-966-650-231-8}} &lt;/ref&gt; De Mortillet emphasised the importance of the presence or absence of the cortex around the edge in the 19th century: "Even on some of the best worked pieces it is common to see, sometimes on the base but more often on the side, a small area that has not been worked, that is uncut. It could be thought that this is a mistake or an error. But often the most probable reason for this is that it was intentional. There are a large number of hand axes with an uncut base, unworked or partially cleaned ... an area has intentionally been left on these pieces as a grip, it is called the heel. This heel acts as a handle as it is easy to grip''".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel de Mortillet|title=Le Préhistorique. Antiquité de l'homme|year=1883|publisher=Bibliothèque des Sciences Contemporaines. Paris|page=139}} (''heel'' is no longer used to refer to hand axes with an unworked base, instead the actual part of the flake is named).&lt;/ref&gt; (This hypothesis remains unproven and is not commonly used.)
{| align=center
|[[File:Bifaz de los Tablazos.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hand axe with unworked base.&lt;/center&gt;]]
|[[File:Bifaz de dorso-Rincon.png|thumb|upright=.93|&lt;center&gt;Biface with a lateral back.&lt;/center&gt;]]
|}
*Hand axes with residual cortex on an edge—The whole of their edges are knapped except for a small area where the cortex remains (leaving a small area without a sharp edge). This area can be at the base, side or oblique. In all cases it is small, leaving cutting edges on both sides.
*Hand axes with a cutting edge around the whole circumference—The circumference is knapped to a cutting edge, although some residual areas of cortex may persist on either face, without affecting the cutting edge's effectiveness.

==Production==
Older hand axes were produced by direct [[percussion]] with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. [[Mousterian]] hand axes were produced with a soft [[Knapping|billet]] of [[antler]] or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border. An experienced [[flintknapper]] needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.

The manufacturing process employs [[lithic reduction]]. This phase is commonly thought of as the most important in hand axe fabrication, although it is not always used, such as for hand axes made from flakes or a suitable tool stone. An important concern is the implement that has been used to form the biface. If multiple implements were used, it is essential to discover in what order they were used and the result obtained by each one.The most common implements are:&lt;ref name=benito/&gt;
[[File:Bifaz-El Lombo (PD).png|thumb|Hand axe formed using a hard hammer, without further treatment.]]

===Hard hammer faces===
Hand axes can be made without subsequent reworking of the edges.&lt;ref name="alimen"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Henriette Alimen|author1=Alimen, Marie-Henriette|author2=Zuate y Zuber, José|chapter=Les bifaces: considerations morphologiques et technologiques|title=L'évolution de l'Acheuléen au Sahara nord-occidental|year=1978|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Meudon, France|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hammerstone]] was the most common percussive tool used during the Acheulean. The resulting artefact is usually easily recognizable given its size and irregular edges, as the removed flakes leave pronounced [[bulb of percussion|percussion bulbs]] and compression rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cotterell, B.|author2=Kamminga, J.|year=1987|title=The Formation of Flakes|journal=American Antiquity|volume=52|pages=675–708|doi=10.2307/281378}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hammerstone produces a small number of flakes that are wide and deep leaving long edges on the tool as their highly concave form yields curving edges. The cross-section is irregular, often sub-rhombic, while the intersection between the faces forms an acute angle of between 60° and 90° degrees. The shape is similar to that of the core as the irregularities formed during knapping are not removed. The notches obtained were exploited in the production sequence. It is common that this type of manufacture yields ''"''partial bifaces''"'' (an incomplete working that leaves many areas covered with cortex), "unifaces" (tools that have only been worked on one face), "[[Abbevillian|bifaces in the Abbevillian style]]" and ''"''nucleiform bifaces''"''. This type of manufacturing style is generally an indication of the age when a tool was made and with other archaeological data can provide a context that allows its age to be estimated.

[[File:Bifaz-Teso de San Francisco (PD+PD).png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hand axe formed using a hard hammer, the edges have also been worked using a hard hammer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

===Hard hammer faces and edges===
These hand axes have a more balanced appearance as the modification consists of a second (or third) series of blows to make the piece more uniform and provide a better finish. The modification is often called retouching&lt;ref&gt;For Jacques Tixier the reworking sometimes has the objective of sharpening the edge so he uses the term ''reprise'' (recovery); however, Lionel Balout uses the term ''secondary retouch'' or ''reworking'' equally; while François Bordes prefers the word ''regularization'': {{harvnb|Alimen|Zuate y Zuber|1978|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is sometimes carried out using invasive retouching or using softer, marginal, shallow blows that are only applied to the most marked irregularities leaving scale-like marks. The modification of edges with a hard hammer was carried out from the beginning of the Acheulean and persisted into the Musterian. It is therefore not useful as an indicator of chronology (in order for it to be considered as a marker it has to be accompanied by other complementary and independent archaeological data). The hand axes arising from this methodology have a more classical profile with either a more [[symmetry|symmetrical]] almond or oval shape and with a lower proportion of the cortex of the original core. It is not always the case that the retouching had the objective of reducing an edge's irregularities or deformities. In fact, it has been shown that in some cases the retouching was carried out to sharpen an edge that had been blunted by use or a point that had deteriorated.&lt;ref name=fritisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Tixier, Jacques|chapter=Les industries lithiques d'Aïn Fritissa (Maroc Oriental)|title=Bulletin d'Archéologie marocaine|volume=3|year=1960|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soft hammer finish===
[[File:Hand axe spanish.gif|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hand axe probably roughed-out using a hard hammer and then retouched using a soft hammer.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Some hand axes were formed with a hard hammer and finished with a soft hammer. Blows that result in deep [[conchoidal fracture]]s (the first phase of manufacture) can be distinguished from features resulting from sharpening with a soft hammer. The latter leaves shallower, more distended, broader scars, sometimes with small, multiple shock waves. However, marks left by a small, hard hammer can leave similar marks to a soft hammer.

Soft hammer finished pieces are usually balanced and symmetrical, and can be relatively smooth. Soft hammer works first appeared in the Acheulean period, allowing tools with these markings to be used as a ''[[Terminus post quem|post quem]]'' estimation, but with no greater precision. The main advantage of a soft hammer is that a flintknapper is able to remove broader, thinner flakes with barely developed heels, which allows a cutting edge to be maintained or even improved with minimal raw material wastage. However, a high-quality raw material is required to make their use effective. No studies compare the two methods in terms of yield per unit weight of raw material, or the difference in energy use. The use of a soft hammer requires greater use of force by the [[Knapping|flintknapper]] and a steeper [[learning curve]], although it offers more flakes for less raw material.&lt;ref name=hayden/&gt;

===Soft hammer only===
[[File:Bifaz con percutor blando.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Hand axe manufactured with a soft hammer, without the appearance of any marks made by a hard hammer.&lt;/center&gt;]]Hand axes made using only a soft hammer are much less common.&lt;ref name="alimen" /&gt; In most cases at least initial work was done with a hard hammer, before subsequent flaking with a soft hammer erased all vestiges of that work. A soft hammer is not suitable for all types of percussion platform and it cannot be used on certain types of raw material. It is, therefore, necessary to start with a hard hammer or with a flake as a core as its edge will be fragile (flat, smooth pebbles are also useful). This means that although it was possible to manufacture a hand axe using a soft hammer, it is reasonable to suppose that a hard hammer was used to prepare a ''blank'' followed by one or more phases of retouching to finish the piece. However, the degree of separation between the phases is not certain, as the work could have been carried out in one operation.

Working with a soft hammer allows a knapper greater control of the knapping and reduces waste of the raw material, allowing the production of longer, sharper, more uniform edges that will increase the tool's working life. Hand axes made with a soft hammer are usually more symmetrical and smooth, with rectilinear edges and shallow indentations that are broad and smooth so that it is difficult to distinguish where one flake starts and another ends. They generally have a regular biconvex cross-section and the intersection of the two faces forms an edge with an acute angle, usually of around 30°. They were worked with great skill and therefore they are more aesthetically attractive. They are usually associated with periods of highly developed tool making such as the [[Micoquien]] or the [[Mousterian]]. Soft hammer manufacturing is not reliable as the sole dating method.

Hand axes were created to be tools and as such they wore out, deteriorated and/or broke during use. Relics have suffered dramatic changes throughout their useful lives. It is common to find edges that have been sharpened, points that have been reconstructed and profiles that have been deformed by reworking in order to extend the piece's useful lifetime. Some tools were recycled later, leading Bordes to note that hand axes "are sometimes found in the Upper Palaeolithic. Their presence, which is quite normal in the Perigordian I, is often due, in other levels, to the collection of Mousterian or Acheulean tools.".&lt;ref name=bordes&gt;{{harvnb|Bordes|1961|pp= 49–55}}. The quote is from page 53 and the figure with dimensions is from page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
[[File:Bifaz-esquema.png|thumb|right|upright|&lt;center&gt;Basic scheme for the morphological description of an Acheulean hand axe.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Hand axes have traditionally been oriented with their narrowest part upwards (presupposing that this would have been the most active part, which is not unreasonable given the many hand axes that have unworked bases). The following typological conventions are used to facilitate communication. The [[symmetry axis|axis of symmetry]] that divides a biface in two is called the ''morphological axis.'' The ''main face'' is usually the most regular and better worked face. The ''base'' (not the ''heel'') is the bottom of the hand axe.&lt;ref name=fritisa/&gt;

*Terminal Zone—the narrowest end, opposite the base. Its most common shape is pointed, more or less acute or oval. Some hand axes have terminal ends that are rounded or polygonal (i.e. not pointed) while others have terminal ends that are transversal to the axis, called [[cleaver]] or spatulate.
*Proximal End (base)—opposite the terminal end (usually broader and thicker), it can be described as either ''reserved'' (partially or totally worked, but not cut); or ''cut'', with a rounded (polygonal), flat or pointed end.
*Edges—convex, rectilinear or concave, and more or less even. Edges on some specimens are [[Denticulate tool|denticulate]] – scalloped – or notched. Some specimens have unsharpened edges. The profile of a hand axe's worked edges can be regular without pronounced [[line (geometry)|rectilinear]] deviations (the edge is gently curved in the form of an [[S]]) or an edge may be more sinuous and wave-formed with pronounced curves or deviations in the edge's profile. On some specimens only selected areas have been formed into a working edge.
*[[Cross section (geometry)|Cross section]]—the horizontal cross-section taken at some distance from the base. It is possible to discern retouching or rebuilding in deteriorated parts of the edges. The following types of cross section are commonly seen: [[triangle|triangular]] (sub-triangular and backed triangular), [[rhombus|rhombic]] ([[rhomboid]]al and backed rhomboidal), [[Quadrilateral|trapezium]] ([[trapezoid]] and backed trapezoidal), [[pentagon]] (pentagonal and backed pentagonal), [[polygon]]al, biconvex or lenticular (sub lenticular).
*Profile—By definition, hand axes have a roughly balanced outline, with a morphological axis that also serves as an axis of [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] and a plane that serves as an axis of [[Isometry|bifacial symmetry]]. Not all hand axes are perfectly symmetrical. Symmetry was achieved only after millennia of development. Symmetry may not make tools more useful. Hand axes were used in a variety of heavy physical tasks. They deteriorated, wore out and broke and were often repaired with retouching of their edges, recovery of their points or complete reworking. The majority of discovered pieces are remains, pieces that have been discarded after a long life as tools, during which they often were damaged and/or adapted for specialized tasks. Such pieces may have lost whatever symmetry they initially had. Hand axe profiles can be classified into the following categories:

===Dimensions and ratios===
[[File:Bifaz dimensiones.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|&lt;center&gt;Basic dimensions to be measured on an Acheulean hand axe.&lt;/center&gt;]]

Hand axe measurements use the morphological axis as a reference and for orientation. In addition to length, [[width]], [[Three-dimensional space|depth]], specialists have proposed a wide range of other [[physical quantity|physical quantities]]. The most common were proposed by Bordes&lt;ref name=bordes/&gt;{{rp|51}} and Balout:&lt;ref name=balout/&gt;

*Maximum length ('''L''')
*Maximum width ('''m''')
*Maximum depth ('''e''')
*Distance from the base to the zone with the maximum width ('''a''')
*Width 3/4 of the way along the piece ('''o''')

'''A''' and '''o''' can be used to delineate the contour's cross section and to measure the angles of the edges (provided this is not an area covered in the stone's original cortex). These [[Degree (angle)|angular measurements]] for the edges are made using a [[goniometer]].

Edge length, weight and the length of the [[Circle#Properties#chord|chord]] described by the edges (if the piece has a transverse terminal bezel) can be measured. These measurements allow morphological and technical ratios to be established (for example, the relationship between the weight and the length of the cutting edges, or the relationship between the hammer used to form the piece and the angle obtained etc.).

The most commonly used coefficients were established by Bordes for the morphological-mathematical classification of what he called "classic bifaces" (Balout proposed other, similar indices):&lt;ref&gt;They are the ''Elongation index'', the ''Sectional index'' and the ''Convergence index'', {{harvnb|Balout|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Base-rounding index—allows classic bifaces to be separated into triangular, almond-shaped and oval families. The '''L/a''' ratio provides the following separation thresholds:

|''Oval bifaces''||align=center|&lt;math&gt;3.75&lt;{\frac{L}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
*Elongation index—separates common bifaces from the ''short'' (and, occasionally, from the ''elongated''). For example, within the family of ''Oval bifaces'' the index distinguishes discoidal bifaces from other types; in the ''Almond-shaped bifaces'' it identifies lanceolate or micoquien bifaces. The index is calculated using '''L/m.''' Thresholds:

{| style="background:#F0F0F0" cellspacing=10

|-----
|''Elongated bifaces''||align=center|&lt;math&gt;1.6&lt;{\frac{L}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
*Cross-sectional/planar index—divides the ''thick'' bifaces from the ''flat'' ones and is used only on certain types. In the ''Almond-shaped bifaces'' (along with the elongation index) it distinguishes the amygdaloid bifaces (thick) from the cordiform bifaces (flat). The index is calculated using '''m/e.''' Thresholds:

|''Flat bifaces''||align=center|&lt;math&gt;{\frac{m}{e}}&gt;2.35&lt;/math&gt;
|}
*Other indexes apply to the other types of bifaces (partial bifaces, bifaces with an unworked base, or cleaver, spatulate, Abbevillean, nucleiform, etc.).

==Bordes hand axe typology==
{{cita|Hand axes are so varied that they do not actually have a single common characteristic… [...] Despite the numerous attempts to classify hand axes, some of which date to the beginning of the [20th] century… their study does not comply completely satisfactorily to any typological list|Gabriel Camps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Camps, Gabriel|chapter=Les Bifaces|title=Manuel de recherche préhistorique|language=fr|year=1981|publisher=Doin Éditeurs|location=Paris|isbn=2-7040-0318-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The following guide is strongly influenced by the possibly outdated and basically morphological "Bordes method" classification system. This classification is particularly applicable to ''classic hand axes'',{{sfn|Bordes|1961|pp=57–66}}{{efn|name=Tixier|1=The Bordes typology singularly fails for cleavers and biface-cleavers, demonstrating an aspect of both types of tool, especially the cleavers, previously faced with more coherence by a classification scheme posed by Bordes’ colleague Jacques Tixier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tixier, Jacques|title=Le hachereau dans l'Acheuléen nord-africain.

''"''Distinguishing between different types of hand axes is not always easy.

|[[File:Bifaz triangular.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Triangular'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The triangular bifaces were initially defined by [[Henri Breuil]] as flat based, globular, covered with cortex, with two straight edges that converge at an acute apical zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Breuil, H. |author2=Koslowski, L.|title=Études de stratigraphie paléolithique dans le nord de la France, la Belgique et l'Angleterre |language=fr |year=1934|journal=L'Anthropologie|volume=42|pages=27–47|issn=0003-5521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bordes later redefined the definition, making it more narrow.{{sfn|Bordes|1961|pp= 58–59}} For Bordes a triangular biface is a piece of developed, working and balanced morphology; they are flat pieces with three rectilinear or slightly convex edges, they must be flat (m/e &gt; 2.35) and with a short, straight base (base rounding index L/a &lt; 2.5).&lt;br&gt;Specialists distinguish small variations within these strict limits such as ''elongated triangular'' (L/m &lt; 1.6), or pieces with slightly concave edges. Bordes named the latter ''«Sharks teeth»'' for their similarity to the fossilized teeth of ''[[Carcharodon megalodon]]'' that often appear near to the archaeological sites where these tools were found. The ''sub triangular bifaces'', have a general form similar to a triangle but are more irregular and less symmetrical.&lt;br&gt;Triangular bifaces are scarce in the Lower Palaeolithic (except in the late Acheulean in some French regions) and although they are more common during the Middle Palaeolithic (especially during the Mousterian), they virtually disappear without trace.

|[[File:Bifaz amigdaloide.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Amygdaloidal'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are the most common biface in this group, defined by their almond shape, symmetrical tendency and metric indices common to this category. Apart from their shape, which gives them their name ([[Latin]] for [[almond]]), they are bifaces of regular length (1.3 &lt; L/m &lt; 1.6), somewhat thick (m/e &lt; 2.35) and with an average base roundness index for this category (2.75 &lt; L/a &lt; 3.75). The base may be unworked or worked. They may have a sharp-pointed or oval apical zone. In some cases it may be slightly rounded (and narrow).&lt;br&gt;Amygdaloidal bifaces are nearly identical to cordiform bifaces, except that the latter are thick and the former are flat. Amygdaloidal bifaces usually have a coarse finish and high-degree of cortex coverage. This is not necessarily an indication of development or chronology. 
|-----
|[[File:Bifaz cordiforme.jpg|220px|center]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Cordiform'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cordiform biface is identical to the amygdaloidal when seen from the front, as it shares the same index values (elongation index: 1.3 &lt; L/m &lt; 1.6; and base roundness index: 2.75 &lt; L/a &lt; 3.75). When seen from the side it appears to be a flat biface (m/e &gt; 2.35). Occasionally, although this is not defining, they are worked with greater skill, better finished, with less cortex and greater balance. They may also have more acute, rectilinear edges increasing efficiency.&lt;br&gt;Their name, which comes from the Latin ''[[w:la:Cor|cor]]'' ([[heart]]), was suggested by [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|de Perthes]] in 1857. It became generally used when adopted by Breuil, Commont and Goury in the 1920s.&lt;br&gt;Bordes defined them mathematically as flat bifaces with rounded, short bases and a pointed or oval terminal zone. He defined eight variants, including an elongated form (L/m &gt; 1.6) and another that is more irregular that has been called ''Subcordiform''. The cordiform bifaces were common in both the Acheulean and the Mousterian.
|-----
|[[File:Bifaz lanceolado.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Lanceate'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Lanceate bifaces are the most aesthetically pleasing and became the typical image of developed Acheulean bifaces. Their name is due to their similar shape to the blade of a [[lance]]. It was coined by de Perthes (''lance axe'').&lt;br&gt;Bordes defined a lanceate biface as elongated (L/m &gt; 1.6) with rectilinear or slightly convex edges, acute apex and rounded base (2.75 &lt; L/a &lt; 3.75). They are often globular to the extent that it is not a flat surface (m/e &lt; 2.35), at least in its basal zone.&lt;br&gt;They are usually balanced and well finished, with straightened ground edges. They are highly characteristic of the latter stages of the Acheulean – or the Micoquian, as it is known – and of the Mousterian in the Acheulean Tradition (closely related to the Micoquian bifaces described below)).&lt;br&gt;A biface with a lanceate profile that is more coarsely worked and irregular, possibly due to a lack of finishing it is usually called a ''[[w:fr: Ficron|ficron]] style biface'' from the French term.&lt;ref&gt;Ficron is a word used by farmers in the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] region. The ''ficron'' is the point of a blade located at the end of a pole that allows peasants to push their boats along canals in flooded fields.{{harvnb|Bordes|1961|loc=58 nota 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-----
|[[File:Bifaz micoquiense.jpg|150px|center]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Micoquien'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Micoquian biface receives its name from the French cave of '''La Micoque''' in the community of [[Arrondissement of Sarlat-la-Canéda|Les Eyzies-de-Tayac]] (in the [[Dordogne]]), which also gave its name to a period at the end of the Acheulean, the [[Micoquien]]. This period is characterized by the technological development. It is thought that the Micoquien was not a separate culture from the Acheulean, but one of its final phases, and that Micoquian bifaces may be one of the few biface types that can be used as a chronological marker, a so-called index artifact. The biface is characteristic of the end of the Acheulean and was developed during the Riss-Würm interglacial.&lt;br&gt;Micoquien bifaces are similar to lanceate ones, they are almond-shaped (2.75 &lt; L/a &lt; 3.75), elongated L/m &gt; 1.6) and thick (m/e &lt; 2.35) with a rounded, often unworked base, but with markedly concave edges and an acute point. &lt;br&gt;Lanceate and Micoquian bifaces are usually associated. It is possible that reiterated sharpening of a lanceate biface gave rise to a Micoquian biface. They are common across the Old World.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of sites where they have been found include such European sites as [[Río Manzanares|Valle del Manzanares]] in [[Madrid]], Spain, Swanscombe in England and La Micoque in France as well as Oum-Qatafa and Tabún in Asia and Sidi-Zin in Africa, among others. {{harvnb|Brézillon|1985|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[File:Bifaz ovoide-Valladolid.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Discoid'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Disk (mathematics)|Discoid]] bifaces are entirely circular or oval in shape and are characterized by a base rounding index of greater than 3.75 and an elongation index of less than 1.3. They are rounded both at their base as well as at their terminal zone. If their manufactured form is shallow, they are difficult to distinguish from discoid cores of centripetal extraction, or if they are ''simple bifaces'' they look like simple flakes that have been retouched or chopping tools made from flakes.&lt;br&gt;This type of biface commonly arises from the continuous resharpening of the active region of a longer biface, that over time becomes shorter. They can also be broken specimens that were recycled and reworked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benito Álvarez|author2=José Manuel|title=Aportaciones al conocimiento del Achelense en la Meseta Norte|language=es|year=2002|publisher=Universidad de Salamanca (Tesis Doctoral, inédita)|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discoid bifaces cannot be used as indexes, although particularly finely worked examples appear among the [[Solutrean]] culture in [[Périgord]].&lt;ref name=bordes/&gt;{{rp|49–55}} 
|-----
|[[File:Bifaz ovoide.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Ovoid'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Ovoid bifaces are roughly [[oval]] (a kind of curve whose description is slightly ambiguous, but which is more or less egg-shaped). De Perthes published a definition in 1857 that is little changed.&lt;br&gt;Bordes stated that ovoid bifaces are similar to discoids but more elongated (1.3 &lt; L/m &lt; 1.6) and logically have a base rounding index related to the oval bifaces (greater than 3.75). Both the base and the terminal zone are rounded (if the base is short they are almost symmetrical), although the greatest width is below the longitudinal midway point.&lt;br&gt;Ovoid bifaces apparently appeared in the middle of the Acheulean, although they are not index artifacts and along with the amygdaloids are the most common type of biface among the Acheulean cultures.

|[[File:Bifaz eliptico.jpg|center|220px]]
|&lt;div align=center&gt;'''Elliptical'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;[[Ellipse|Elliptical]] bifaces are also known as ''[[w:fr:Limanda|Limandes]]'' (from the French word meaning [[Flatfish|flounder]]). They have three axes of symmetry, bilateral, bifacial and horizontal. If the base is short they are virtually identical at the terminal end, complicating identifying top from bottom.&lt;br&gt;In practice their dimensional ratios are equal to the ovoid tools, except that the elliptical bifaces are usually more elongated (L/m &gt; 1.6) and their maximum width (m) is nearer to their mid length.&lt;br&gt;Elliptical bifaces are found throughout the Acheulean and into the Mousterian. The finishing became more careful and balanced over time. Bordes usually differentiated flat elliptical bifaces (m/e &gt; 2.35, ''true Limandes'') from thick elliptical bifaces (m/e &lt; 2.35, ''Protolimandes'').

===Non-classic specimens===
Many specimens defeat objective classification. Bordes created a group he called "non-classic bifaces" to which mathematical indexes do not apply.{{sfn|Bordes|1961|pp=67–69}}
*Nucleiform bifaces—It is difficult to distinguish a true biface from a core with modified edges that was occasionally used as a tool. A piece could also be a blank or a chance occurrence. Despite their rough appearance, nucleiform bifaces were present in both the Acheulean and the Mousterian.
[[File:Bifaz nucleiforme (Torralba).png|thumb|center|upright=1.5|&lt;center&gt;Nucleiform biface from the Acheulean site at [[Torralba and Ambrona (archaeological site)|Torralba]], in Soria (Spain).&lt;/center&gt;]]
*Cleaver-bifaces—These bifaces have an apex that is neither pointed nor rounded. They possess a relatively wide terminal edge that is transverse to the morphological axis. This edge is usually more or less sub-rectilinear, slightly concave or convex. They are sometimes included within the classic types as they have a balanced, well-finished form. Cleaver-bifaces were defined by Chavaillón in 1958 as "biface with terminal bevel" (''biface à biseau terminal''&lt;ref name=alimen/&gt;), while Bordes simply called them "cleavers" (''hachereaux)''{{sfn|Bordes|1961|pp=57–66}}{{efn|name=Tixier}} The current term was proposed in French by Guichard in 1966 (''biface-hachereau''). The term biface-cleaver was proposed in Spanish in 1982 (bifaz-hendidor), with "biface" used as a [[noun]] referring to the typological group a piece belongs to due to its bifacial modelling and "cleaver" used as an [[adjective]] because of its morphology. Technically they are bifaces, but morphologically they are similar to cleavers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benito del Rey, Luis|title=Comentarios sobre hendidores en España, útiles de Paleolítico Inferior y Medio|language=es|year=1982|journal=Galaecia|volume=7/8|publisher=Departamento de Prehistoria y Arqueología de la Facultad de Geografía e Historia, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; although their personality is completely distinct:
{{quote|Some authors count them as cleavers {{harvnb|Bordes|1961|p=63}}, which J. Chavaillon does not agree with; the carving technique used to create a biface is not in any way similar to the manufacturing process for cleavers|Alimen{{sfn|Alimen|Zuate y Zuber|1978|p=121}}}}
The multi-use capability of a biface, including this type, conflicts with the technological simplicity of a cleaver, even though their morphology and function may be similar.
*Abbevillean style bifaces—This hand axe takes its name from the French [[Communes of France|municipality]] of [[Arrondissement of Abbeville|Abbeville]], where they were first found in a [[marl]] [[quarry]] in the valley of the [[River Somme]]. They were initially associated with Abbevillean culture, for which they are an index fossil (although paradoxically these hand axes are particularly scarce at the Abbeville site). The Abbevillean is an initial archaic phase of the Archulean, even if it does not always appear in the stratigraphic register. Archaic hand axes such as those from Abbeville can be found throughout the Lower Palaeolithic, without this suggesting any chronological or cultural reference, supporting the term ''Abbevillean style biface''.{{sfn|Benito del Rey|1982|pp=305-323}} These hand axes were worked using only a hard hammer, without retouching, leaving them sinuous. They are asymmetrical, varied and irregular, with their shape generally determined by the stone's own shape. Their base is covered by cortex along with large areas of the sides. They tend to be relatively thick.

*'''Partial bifaces''': These are without knapping affecting more than a small part of the core. They were created with only a few blows, although this depends on the correct core choice. They are often barely recognizable as chopping tools, but their general aspect and finishing qualifies them as bifaces. The extreme age of the industry to which they belong and the economy of effort serve to qualify them:
{{quote|A knapping so incomplete, but so careful, added to the morphology of the core, allows us to talk of a finished hand axe, that was not worked more because it was not necessary, thereby saving energy.|Benito del Rey y Benito Álvarez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benito del Rey Luis |author2=Benito Álvarez, José-Manuel|chapter=El análisis tipológico: los bifaces|title=Métodos y materias instrumentales en Prehistoria y Arqueología (la Edad de la Piedra Tallada más antigua).

===Tools sometimes categorized as bifaces===
Hand axes constitute an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They are particularly important in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites).&lt;ref name=keeley1/&gt; Hand axes, chopping tools and trihedral picks are considered ''&lt;u&gt;core&lt;/u&gt;'' utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer to flake tools as ''micro industry,'' as opposed to the more general size referred to as ''macro industry'', which includes hand axes and cleavers. However, some scrapers are as big as hand axes.

*The most elaborated [[chopping tool]]s and partial hand axes are linked and it is often difficult to distinguish between them. The concept of chopping tools is based on their lack of formal standardization (which is typical of hand axes) and includes the possibility that the pieces are shallow cores, which is unthinkable for the bifaces (except the nucleiforms).
*While hand axes and cleavers occasionally served for similar tasks, their design is fundamentally different.
*[[Trihedral Neolithic|Trihedral picks]] are no longer considered a specialized type of hand axe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leroy-Prost, Christiane|author2=Dauvois, Michel |author3=Leroy, Jean-Pierre|title=Projet pour un F.T.A. du groupe des trièdres de l'Acheuléen nord-africain |language=fr |year=1981|journal=Préhistoire Africaine|publisher=Melanges offerts au doyen Linel Balout&amp;nbsp;|editor1=Réunis par Colette Roubet|editor2=Henri-Jean Hugot|editor3=Georges Souville|id=Editions ADPF, Paris.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another group of tools commonly associated with hand axes is the ''biface leafpoint tools'' from the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic in the Old World. The difference between the two types is based on the latter's fine, light finishing with a soft hammer and in a morphology that suggests a specific function, possibly as the point of a projectile or a knife.{{sfn|Bordes|1961|p=41}} Representatives of these tools include well known examples from the specialized literature:
{{quote|The term leaf piece should be prefixed to leaf point, as many of them are not pointed. They have been found sporadically in a number of Mousterian sites in France, but they are most common in central European Mousterian sites and African sites from the end of the Aterian|Bordes{{sfn|Bordes|1961|p=41}}}}
*The biface leafpoint tools of central Europe are called ''blattspitzen''. They are [[projectile point]]s belonging to the Middle Palaeolithic with a leaf-shaped form. They are often dual pointed and flat, making them similar to [[Solutrean]] [[Bay laurel|laurel]] leaf blades. It is possible to distinguish the two only from their archaeological context. Blattspitzen survived in some Upper Palaeolithic cultures. The pieces from the eastern European [[Upper Palaeolithic|Szeletien]] culture (both blattspitzen and Micoquian bifaces) could be the link that connects the tradition of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic bifacial objects with those from the Upper Palaeolithic and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sonnevile-Bordes, Denise|title=L'áge de la pierre|language=fr|year=1961|publisher=Éditeur P.U.F., collection Qu sais-je?|location=Paris|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Hand axes found in Africa come from both the [[Aterian]] culture of North Africa and the [[Stillbay]] culture from East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leroi-Gourhan, André|chapter=El Paleolítico Medio|title=La Prehistoria|language=es|year=1980|publisher=Publisher Labour, Barcelona|isbn=84-335-9309-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these cases relate to Mousterian cultures, although they are relatively late and have their own style, at the end of the so-called African ''[[Stone Age#The Middle Stone Age (MSA)|Middle Stone Age]]''. In both cases a variety of objects are found, triangular, oval and other leaf-point. Hand axes and unifaces also came from other cultures.

==Importance==
The hand axe helped establish that early humans were capable of constructing relatively sophisticated tools that also reflected a sense of aesthetics. The 19th century publications of Frere, and more importantly of Boucher de Perthes, in France, described pieces that were balanced, symmetrical and crafted with a formal purity. Vilanova i Piera published similar works in Spain. This work was continued by Pérez de Barradas and del Prado at the start of the 20th Century.

{{quote|Art passed through a long formative period before becoming beautiful; but this does not mean that it ever stopped being a sincere and grandiose art, sometime more sincere and grandiose than beautiful; in mankind there is a creative nature that is manifested as soon as its existence is assured. When he was not worried or fearful, this demigod acting in tranquillity, found the material in his surroundings to breathe life into his spirit.|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], Conversations with [[Johann Peter Eckermann|Eckermann]].}}
[[File:Bifaz lanceolado-San Isidro (Madrid).png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Finely worked lanceate hand axe from the San Isidro site near Madrid.&lt;/center&gt;]]
As [[André Leroi-Gourhan|Leroi-Gourhan]] explained,&lt;ref name=leroi2&gt;{{cite book|author=Leroi-Gourhan, André|authorlink=André Leroi-Gourhan|chapter=Esbozo del Arte|title=El Arte y el Hombre|volume=1|year=1977|publisher=Fournier, S. A., Vitoria|isbn=84-320-2001-X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is important to ask what was understood of art at the time, considering the psychologies of non-modern humans. Archaeological records documenting rapid progress towards symmetry and balance surprised Leroi-Gourha. He felt that he could recognize beauty in early prehistoric tools made during the Acheulean:
{{quote|It seems difficult to admit that these beings did not experience a certain aesthetic satisfaction, they were excellent craftsmen that knew how to choose their material, repair defects, orient cracks with total precision, drawing out a form from a crude flint core that corresponded exactly to their desire. Their work was not automatic or guided by a series of actions in strict order, they were able to mobilize in each moment reflection and, of course, the pleasure of creating a beautiful object.|Leroi-Gourhan{{sfn|Leroi-Gourhan|1977|p=35}}}}

Many authors refer only to exceptional pieces. The majority of hand axes tended to symmetry, but lack artistic appeal. Generally, only the most striking pieces are considered, mainly 19th or early 20th century collections. At that time a lack of knowledge regarding prehistoric technology prevented a recognition of human actions in these objects. Other collections were made by aficionados, whose interests were not scientific, so that they collected only objects they considered to be outstanding, abandoning humbler elements that were sometimes necessary to interpret an archaeological site. Exceptions include sites methodically studied by experts where magnificently carved, abundant hand axes caused archaeologists to express admiration for the artists:
{{quote|Such is the perfection of the carving on some hand axes that they give the impression that the artist took great pleasure in them ''per se'', at least apparently, as the working does not make the pieces any more efficient. At any rate, we are unable to pronounce from this remove whether it was art or the utility of the hand axe that was being sought by making them so well. Although, in our heart of hearts we are sure that they were searching for beauty, aesthetics, as they could have achieved the same efficiency with cruder pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benito del Rey|author2=Luis y Benito Álvarez|author3=José Manuel|chapter=La Salamanca Paleolítica|title=Congreso de Historia de Salamanca 1989|volume=1|year=1992|publisher=Gráficas Ortega, S. A., Salamanca|isbn=84-604-3130-4|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The discovery in 1998 of an oval hand axe of excellent workmanship in the [[Atapuerca Mountains#Sima de los Huesos (1983-)|Sima de los Huesos]] in the Atapuerca Mountains mixed in with the fossil remains of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' reignited this controversy. Given that this is the only lithic remnant from this section of the site (possibly a burial ground), combined with the piece's qualities led it to receive special treatment, it was even baptized [[Excalibur]] and it became a ''star item''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rivera, Alicia|title=Un hacha hallada en Atapuerca indica que ya había ritos funerarios hace 400.000 años|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2003/01/08/sociedad/1041980401_850215.html|work=[[El País]]|date=8 January 2003|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the symbolic meaning of this example in particular, and hand axes in general, has multiplied in recent years, feeding both scientific and more general debate and literature.

Basch offered this counterargument:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Almagro Basch, Martín|chapter=La Prehistoria|title=Historia General del Arte|volume=1|year=1958|publisher=Montaner y Simón, S. A.|location=Barcelona|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Art is always the same, it is only possible to call someone an artist if they know how to create, within objective limits, the equivalent of the numinous complex experienced individually and expressed in a suitable manner in relation to the society in which the artist lives. In this was it is possible to distinguish an essentially artistic piece from a useful tool, although this may also be beautiful. When a prehistoric man was able to achieve the marvels that are the Acheulean axes, he did not make a work of art; nor did he make a work of art when he used his skill and experience to make a house or adapt rock shelters or caves for living or sanctuary.|Martín Almagro}}

Paradoxically, within the wide range of Acheulean objects, hand axes are one of the simplest tools. They do not require as much planning as other types of object, generally made from flakes, that are less striking but more sophisticated.

Archaeologists&lt;ref&gt;such as Chavaillon (op. cit., 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; have evidence of hand axes that are 1.2 million years old in Melka Kunturé (Ethiopia), but the oldest, from Konso-Gardula, could be 1.9 million years old:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Corbella, Josep|author2=Carbonell, Eudald|author3=Moyà, Salvador y Sala|title=Sapiens. El largo camino de los homínidos hacia la inteligencia|year=2000|publisher=Ediciones Península S.A.|location=Barcelona|isbn=84-8307-288-2|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is now known that they are the heritage of a number of human species, with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' the earliest, up until 1954 no solid evidence indicated who had fabricated hand axes: in that year, in Ternifine, Algeria, [[Camille Arambourg|Arambourg]] discovered remains that he called "Atlanthropus", along with some hand axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arambourg, Camille|authorlink=Camille Arambourg|title=Récentes découvertes de paléontologie humaine réalisées en Afrique du Nord française (L'Atlanthropus de Ternifine – L'Hominien de Casablanca)|year=1957|journal=Third Panafrican Congress on Prehistory|location=Livingstone|origyear=1955|publisher=London, Chatto &amp; Windus|editor1=Clark, J.D.|editor2=Cole, S.|pages=186–194
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the species associated with hand axes (from ''H. ergaster'' to [[Neanderthal|H. ''neanderthalensis'']]) show an advanced intelligence that in some cases is accompanied by modern features such as a relatively sophisticated technology, systems to protect against inclement weather (huts, control of fire, clothing), and certain signs of spiritual awareness (early indications of art such as adorning the body, carving of bones, ritual treatment of bodies, articulated language).

'''Hedwig glasses''' or '''Hedwig beakers''' are a type of glass beaker originating in the [[Middle East]] or [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] and dating from the 10th-12th centuries AD.  They are named after the [[Silesia]]n princess [[Hedwig of Andechs|Saint Hedwig]] (1174–1245), to whom three of them are traditionally said to have belonged.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"&gt;Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7&lt;/ref&gt; So far, a total of 14 complete glasses are known.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl and Kronz"&gt;Wedepohl and Kronz&lt;/ref&gt; The exact origin of the glasses is disputed, with [[Egypt]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] all suggested as possible sources; if they are not of Islamic manufacture they are certainly influenced by [[Glass in Islamic culture|Islamic glass]].&lt;ref name=BMH&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/r/relief_cut_glass_tumbler.aspx |title=Hedwig glass beaker " The British Museum |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date=1959-04-14 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=217275&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=RRM13372&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 |title=Search object details |publisher=British Museum |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Probably made by [[Muslim]] craftsmen, some of the [[iconography]] is Christian, suggesting they may have been made for export or for Christian clients.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/2GL6QSA8SMmcMCtPgHQJsw |title=A History of the World – Object: Hedwig glass beaker |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory that they instead originate from Norman Sicily in the 11th century was first fully set out in a book in 2005 by Rosemarie Lierke, and has attracted some support from specialists.&lt;ref name="Lierke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rosemarie-lierke.de/English/Hedwig_Beakers/hedwig_beakers.html|title=Hedwig Beakers|publisher=Rosemarie-lierke.de|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
All 14 of the complete Hedwig glasses so far known all have roughly the same form: they are squat, thick-walled and straight-sided with a flange around the base.  They are around 14&amp;nbsp;cm high and have a diameter of nearly 14&amp;nbsp;cm. All but one are richly decorated with wheel-cut relief with [[hatching|hatched]] details.

The glasses are mostly of a smoky metal colour with a couple of greenish or yellowish glass. The decorations are in two styles: four have abstract decorations derived from Samarra Style C; another eight have zoomorphic decorations of lions, [[griffin]]s and eagles and palm trees.&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"/&gt;
 
They were probably made in emulation of the [[quartz|rock crystal]] [[hardstone carving|carved vessels]] made in [[Fatimid Egypt]] rather earlier, which were objects of great luxury in the Middle Ages, and have also mostly survived in church treasuries.;&lt;ref name="Lierke"/&gt; an example can be seen in the Treasury of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, which also possesses a rock-crystal ewer in the same style. A number of the glasses were elaborated into [[reliquaries]], or in one case a [[chalice]], during the Middle Ages, with the addition of goldsmith's work, including those at Namur, Krakow and Halberstadt (see below).

==Distribution==
The Hedwig glasses were clearly high status objects. According to Ettinghausen and Grabar, writing in 1987, so far no examples of this type of glass have been found in the Near East: "all the preserved pieces come from the treasuries of Western churches and noble houses".&lt;ref name="Ettinghausen and Grabar 196-7"/&gt; Small shards of broken Hedwig glasses have been found in excavations.
In common with many Islamic objects imported into medieval Europe, they were credited with more antiquity than was in fact the case. The Amsterdam goblet carries the inscription:
"Alsz diesz glas war alt tausent jahr Es Pfalzgraf Ludwig Philipsen verehret war: 1643"
("When this glass was a thousand years old, it was given to Ludwig Philipsen, Count Palatine: 1643")

As of 2009, 14 complete Hedwig glasses and ten additional fragments are known.&lt;ref name="Wedepohl and Kronz"/&gt;

[[File:KB_Japanese.svg|thumb|A Japanese kana keyboard]]
In relation to the '''Japanese language and computers''' many adaptation issues arise, some unique to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and others common to [[language]]s which have a very large number of characters. The number of characters needed in order to write English is very small, and thus it is possible to use only one [[byte]] to encode one English character. However, the number of characters in Japanese is much more than 256, and hence Japanese cannot be encoded using only one byte, and Japanese is thus encoded using two or more bytes, in a so-called "double byte" or "multi-byte" encoding. Some problems relate to [[transliteration]] and  [[romanization]], some to character encoding, and some to the input of Japanese text.

==Character encodings==
{{Update|section|reason=The info about Unicode adoption is sorely out of date|date=January 2018}}
There are several standard methods to [[character encoding|encode]] Japanese characters for use on a computer, including [[JIS encoding|JIS]], [[Shift-JIS]], [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], and [[Unicode]].  While mapping the set of [[kana]] is a simple matter, [[kanji]] has proven more difficult. Despite efforts, none of the encoding schemes have become the de facto standard, and multiple encoding standards are still in use today.

For example, most Japanese [[email]]s are in [[ISO-2022-JP]] ("JIS encoding") and [[web page]]s in [[Shift-JIS]] and yet mobile phones in Japan usually use some form of [[Extended Unix Code]]. If a program fails to determine the encoding scheme employed,  it can cause {{Nihongo3|"misconverted garbled/garbage characters"|文字化け|''[[mojibake]]''|literally "transformed characters"}} and thus unreadable text on computers.

The first encoding to become widely used was [[JIS X 0201]], which is a [[ISO 646|single-byte encoding]] that only covers standard 7-bit ASCII characters with half-width katakana extensions. This was widely used in systems that were neither powerful enough nor had the storage to handle kanji (including old embedded equipment such as cash registers). This means that only [[katakana]], not kanji, was supported using this technique. Some embedded displays still have this limitation.

The development of kanji encodings was the beginning of the split. [[Shift JIS]] supports kanji and was developed to be completely backward compatible with [[JIS X 0201]], and thus is in much embedded electronic equipment. 

However, [[Shift JIS]] has the unfortunate property that it often breaks any parser (software that reads the coded text) that is not specifically designed to handle it. For example, a text search method can get false hits if it is not designed for Shift JIS. [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]], on the other hand, is handled much better by parsers that have been written for 7-bit ASCII (and thus [[Extended Unix Code|EUC]] encodings are used on UNIX, where much of the file-handling code was historically only written for English encodings). But EUC is not backwards compatible with JIS X 0201, the first main Japanese encoding. Further complications arise because the original Internet e-mail standards only support 7-bit transfer protocols. Thus {{IETF RFC|1468}} ("[[ISO-2022-JP]]", often simply called [[JIS encoding]]) was developed for sending and receiving e-mails.

In [[character set]] standards such as [[JIS X 0208|JIS]], not all required characters are included, so [[gaiji]] ({{lang|ja|外字}} "external characters") are sometimes used to supplement the character set. Gaiji may come in the form of external font packs, where normal characters have been replaced with new characters, or the new characters have been added to unused character positions. However, gaiji are not practical in [[Internet]] environments since the font set must be transferred with text to use the gaiji.  As a result, such characters are written with similar or simpler characters in place, or the text may need to be encoded using a larger character set (such as Unicode) that supports the required character.

[[Unicode]] was intended to solve all encoding problems over all languages. The [[UTF-8]] encoding used to encode Unicode in web pages does not have the disadvantages that Shift-JIS has. Unicode is supported by international software, and it eliminates the need for gaiji. There are still controversies, however. For Japanese, the kanji characters have been [[Han unification|unified]] with Chinese; that is, a character considered to be the same in both Japanese and Chinese is given a single number, even if the appearance is actually somewhat different, with the precise appearance left to the use of a locale-appropriate font. This process, called [[Han unification]], has caused controversy. The previous encodings in Japan, [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan Area]], [[Mainland China]] and [[Korea]] have only handled one language and Unicode should handle all. The handling of Kanji/Chinese have however been designed by a committee composed of representatives from all four countries/areas.  Unicode is slowly growing because it is better supported by software from outside Japan, but still (as of 2011) most web pages in Japanese use Shift-JIS. The [[Japanese Wikipedia]] uses Unicode.

== Text input ==
{{main|Japanese input methods}}
Written Japanese uses several different scripts: [[kanji]] (Chinese characters), 2 sets of ''kana'' (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed directly into a computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as there are far more kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an [[input method editor]] (IME), also sometimes known as a front-end processor, shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via [[romanization]] (''[[rōmaji]] nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:ローマ字入力|ローマ字入力]]}}) or direct kana input (''kana nyūryoku,'' {{Nihongo2|[[:ja:かな入力|かな入力]]}}). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices – each of the 10 digits (1–9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the [[gojūon]] table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.

There are two main systems for the [[romanization]] of Japanese, known as ''[[Kunrei-shiki]]'' and ''[[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn]]''; in practice, "keyboard romaji" (also known as ''[[wapuro romaji|wāpuro rōmaji]]'' or "word processor romaji") generally allows a loose combination of both. IME implementations may even handle keys for letters unused in any romanization scheme, such as ''L'', converting them to the most appropriate equivalent. With kana input, each key on the keyboard directly corresponds to one kana. The [[JIS X 6002|JIS keyboard]] system is the national standard, but there are alternatives, like the [[thumb-shift keyboard]], commonly used among professional typists.

== Direction of text ==

Japanese can be written in [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|two directions]]. ''Yokogaki'' style writes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as with English. ''Tategaki'' style writes first top-to-bottom, and then moves right-to-left.

At present, handling of downward text is incomplete. For example, [[HTML]] has no support for ''tategaki'' and Japanese users must use HTML tables to simulate it. However, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] level 3 includes a property "&lt;tt&gt;writing-mode&lt;/tt&gt;" which can render ''tategaki'' when given the value "&lt;tt&gt;vertical-rl&lt;/tt&gt;" (i.e. top to bottom, right to left). Word processors and [[Desktop publishing|DTP]] software have more complete support for it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">'''John Mitchell Kemble''' (2 April 1807 – 26 March 1857), English scholar and historian, was the eldest son of [[Charles Kemble]] the actor and [[Maria Theresa Kemble]]. He is notable for his major contribution to the history of the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[philology]] of the [[Old English]] language.

==Education==
Kemble received his education from [[Charles Richardson (lexicographer)|Charles Richardson]] and at [[Bury St Edmunds grammar school]], where he obtained in 1826 an exhibition to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he became a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KML824JM|name=Kemble, John Mitchell}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a law student, his historical essays were well received but he "would not follow the course of study prescribed by the university and was, moreover, fond of society and of athletic amusements", which caused the deferral of his graduation in 1829.&lt;ref name=Johnes&gt;Hunt, Rev. William. [https://archive.org/stream/dictionarynatio54stepgoog#page/n378/mode/2up Kemble, John Mitchell (1807-1857)] Entry in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' ed. Sidney Lee, v. 30 (1892)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.369}}

==Anglo-Saxon studies==
The bent of his studies was turned more especially towards the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period through the influence of one the brothers Grimm, [[Jacob Grimm]], under whom he studied at [[university of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1831). His thorough knowledge of the [[Teutonic languages]] and his critical faculty were shown in his ''Anglo-Saxon Poems of [[Beowulf]]'' (1833-1837), ''Über die Stammtafeln der Westsachsen'' (Munich 1836), ''Codex diplomaticus aevi Saxonici'' (London 1839-1848), and in many contributions to reviews; while his ''History of the Saxons in England'' (1849; new ed. 1876), though it must now be read with caution, was the first attempt at a thorough examination of the original sources of the early period of English history.

He was editor of the ''British and Foreign Review'' from 1835 to 1844; and from 1840 to his death was examiner of plays. In 1857 he published ''State Papers and Correspondence Illustrative of the Social and Political State of Europe from the Revolution to the Accession of the House of Hanover''.

His ''Horae Ferales, or Studies in the Archaeology of Northern Nations'', was completed by Dr [[Robert Gordon Latham]], and published in 1864.

==Marriage and death==
He married Nathalie Auguste, the daughter of Professor Amadeus Wendt of Göttingen, in about 1836. Though they had two daughters and a son, the marriage was not a happy one and they were living apart by about 1850.&lt;ref name=Johnes/&gt;{{rp|p.370}} The elder daughter, Gertrude (b. 1837) married [[Charles Santley|Sir Charles Santley]], the singer and died in 1882.&lt;ref name=Johnes/&gt;{{rp|p.371}}

Kemble died at [[Dublin]] on 26 March 1857 and is buried there in [[Mount Jerome Cemetery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13673">'''John Whitney Hall''' (September 13, 1916 &amp;ndash; October 21, 1997),&lt;ref name="JWH"&gt;"John Whitney Hall papers, 1930-1999", Yale University Library&lt;/ref&gt; the Tokyo-born son of missionaries in Japan, grew up to become a pioneer in the field of [[Japanese studies]] and one of the most respected historians of Japan of his generation.   His life work was recognized by the Japanese government. At the time he was honored with Japan's [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], he was one of only a very small number of Americans to have been singled out in this way.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Scott, Janny.  "John W. Hall, Historian of Japan, Dies at 81" [obituary]. ''New York Times,'' October 27, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Whitney Hall became an authority on pre-modern Japan; and he helped transform the way Western scholars view the period immediately preceding Japan's modernization as well as the thousand years before that. Professor [[Jeffrey Mass]], a one-time student and later colleague of Hall's on the Yale faculty, described him as a quiet, self-contained man—and a master punster.  Hall was a great admirer of [[Japanese culture]] and he amassed a large collection of prints, folk art and pottery; but in addition to being a dedicated academic, he was also an experienced mountain climber who had climbed extensively in the [[Japanese Alps]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Early years==
The only son of [[Congregational]] [[missionaries]], Professor Hall was born in Kyoto in 1916 and lived in Japan until he was a teenager. According to his wife Robin, he visited the United States with his parents as a child and he had been appalled by how little Americans knew about Japan.  After her husband's death, Mrs. Hall explained, "Being brought up in Japan and by missionaries, he was a very straight-arrow kind of person.  There is this kind of missionary feeling, that you must make something of this [life], not just throw it away."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

He prepared for college by attending Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. At [[Amherst College]], he majored in American studies, comparing the United States to Japan.  After receiving a A.B. degree in 1939, he returned to Japan an instructor in English at [[Doshisha University]] in Kyoto until 1941.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

During the war, he served with United States Naval Intelligence, leaving the service with the rank of Lieutenant Commander.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, John. (1968). ''Japan, From Prehistory to Modern Times,'' p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall earned his Ph.D. in East Asian languages and literatures from [[Harvard University]] in 1950. At Harvard, he became one of the first graduate students to study under [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], who was another missionary's son and a pioneering Japan scholar.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Academic entrepreneur==
Hall's [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' described him as "something of an academic entrepreneur" because he was so central in the work of building up the fledgling field of Japanese studies in the years after World War II.  In his lifetime, he served as a stalwart bridge linking historians in Japan with historians in the West. [[Harry Harootunian]], a professor of history at [[New York University]] and a former student of Professor Hall's, summarizes this view succinctly: "What I think guys like Hall tried to do was de-exoticize the study of Japan.  To de-exoticize anything is to bring it closer to us, to eliminate the distance that we imagine exists between ourselves and the object of our study."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Hall himself explained: "My own fascination with Japanese history lies primarily with the manner in which Japan's political and social institutions have changed and diversified over time and how this fundamentally 'Eastern' culture gave rise to a modern world power."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Professor Hall began teaching at the [[University of Michigan]], one of the few American universities that had a significant program in his field. He would become director of the Center for Japanese Studies (1957–1960) and a founder of the first American research venture in post-war Japan.  Through that program, a field research station in [[Okayama]], Professor Hall spent a year in Japan in 1952 and became the first person to begin examining the voluminous records of one of the daimyo families that had ruled Japan during the early modern period between 1600 and 1868. He became an expert in that period, identifying the seeds of Japan's subsequent industrialization and modernization—findings which challenged the traditional Western view that that period had been nothing more than Japan's rather backward, final feudal age.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

His earliest book was ''[[Tanuma Okitsugu]], 1718-1787''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Hardacre|Hardacre, Helen]]. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dS7DwqiUKnwC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=i ''The Postwar Development of Japanese Studies in the United States,'' p. 92].&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other interests, his research focused on the [[Kamakura period]] in the [[history of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardacre, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dS7DwqiUKnwC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=i p. 57].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Wilson Pierson]] recruited Whitney to join the [[Yale University]] faculty as part of a plan to expand the department's curriculum to include greater emphasis on Asian history.&lt;ref name="nyt1993"&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/obituaries/george-pierson-88-a-professor-at-yale-and-its-historian.html  "George Pierson, 88, A Professor at Yale And Its Historian,"] ''New York Times.'' October 15, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he was named as the [[A. Whitney Griswold]] Professor of History, a position he held until his retirement in 1983. Five years after arriving at Yale, Hall published his most famous book, ''Government and Local Power in Japan, 500 to 1700,'' which traced the development of Okayama during that period and, some say, opened up the first thousand years of Japanese history to the English-speaking world.  Although scholarly books rarely have a shelf life of more than a generation, some colleagues assert that Hall's book is in a category all its own.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

While at Yale, Hall served as Chairman of the History Department from 1973 through 1976.  He was also Chairman of the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department from 1971 through 1974.  In 1983, he retired from the faculty.  Yale University's John W. Hall Lecture Series in Japanese Studies was established in his memory.&lt;ref name="JWH" /&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s, Professor Hall became a leader in many of the organizations that were working to build up the field of Japanese studies. These groups were attempting to represent the interests of the field in order to get support from universities, foundations and the Japanese government. Professor Hall's activities included 
* Chairman, the [[Japan-United States Friendship Commission]]
* Chairman, the [[The U.S.-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange (CULCON)|United States-Japan Conference on Educational and Cultural Interchange]]
* Chairman, the [[Social Science Research Council]]/[[Joint Committee on Japanese Studies]].
Throughout these years, Professor Hall also worked closely with the Japan Foundation, which was set up by the Japanese government in the 1970s to help American universities establish Japanese studies programs.  The Japan Foundation eventually gave $1 million to 10 major universities for activities in the field.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Hall was honored with the Japan Foundation Award in 1976.&lt;ref name="japanfoundation"&gt;[http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/jfic/award/kikin.html  Japan Foundation Award, 1976] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311145301/http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/jfic/award/kikin.html |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kyriarchy''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|ɹ|i|ɑɹ|k|i}}, is in [[feminist theory]], a [[social system]] or set of connecting social systems built around [[Domination (sociology)|domination]], [[oppression]], and [[submission]]. The word was coined by [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]] in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileged]] in others. It is an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] extension of the idea of [[patriarchy]] beyond gender.&lt;ref name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza and Postcolonial Studies |author = Kwok Pui-lan | author-link = Kwok Pui-lan |year = 2009 |journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume = 25 |issue = 1 |pages = 191–197 |publisher = Indiana University Press |jstor =10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191  |doi=10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriarchy encompasses [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[speciesism]], [[homophobia]], [[classism]], [[economic justice|economic injustice]], [[colonialism]], [[militarism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[anthropocentrism]], and other forms of dominating hierarchies in which the subordination of one person or group to another is internalized and institutionalized.{{r|teraudkalns}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Master's Tools?: Feminist And Postcolonial Engagements of Historical-critical Discourse|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RO9YnY2xKaQC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2005|isbn = 9004130527|language = en|first = Caroline Vander|last = Stichele|first2 = Todd C.|last2 = Penner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined by Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2001"&gt;{{cite book |title = Wisdom Ways: Introducing Feminist Biblical Interpretation |chapter = Glossary |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |publisher = Orbis Books |location = New York |year = 2001 |chapterurl = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Frios |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufDNBgAAQBAJ |isbn=1608332527}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 when she published her book ''But She Said: Feminist Practices of Biblical Interpretation''.&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2009"&gt;{{cite book |title = Prejudice and Christian beginnings: investigating race, gender, and ethnicity in early Christian studies |chapter = Introduction: Exploring the Intersections of Race, Gender, Status and Ethnicity in Early Christian Studies |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |editor1-last  = Nasrallah |editor1-first = Laura |editor2-last = Schüssler Fiorenza |editor2-first = Elisabeth |publisher = Fortress Press |location = Minneapolis |year = 2009 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u7XoAi3VfOEC |isbn=1451412843}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from {{lang-el|κύριος, [[kyrios]]}}, "lord, master" and {{lang-el|ἄρχω, archō}}, "to lead, rule, govern".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;{{r|teraudkalns}} The word "kyriarchy" ({{lang-el|κυριαρχία, kyriarchia}}, a valid Greek formation, though it is not found in ancient Greek) can now be used to mean "[[sovereignty]]", i.e. the rulership of a sovereign.

== Usage ==
The term was originally developed in the context of feminist theological discourse, and has been used in some other areas of academia as a non-gender based descriptor of systems of power, as opposed to [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Susana|title=Close Kin and Distant Relatives: The Paradox of Respectability in Black Women's Literature|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=0813935512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kyriarchy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used outside of scholarly contexts.&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Natalie|title=Intersectionality and kyriarchy: A framework for approaching power and social justice in planning and climate change adaptation|journal=Planning Theory|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|page=132|doi=10.1177/1473095213516443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural positions==
Schüssler Fiorenza describes interdependent "stratifications of gender, race, class, religion, [[heterosexism|heterosexualism]], and age" as ''structural positions'' assigned at birth. She suggests that people inhabit several positions, and that positions with privilege become nodal points through which other positions are experienced. For example, in a context where gender is the primary privileged position (e.g., [[patriarchy]]), gender becomes the nodal point through which sexuality, race, and class are experienced. In a context where class is the primary privileged position (i.e., [[classism]]), gender and race are experienced through class dynamics. Fiorenza stresses that kyriarchy is not a hierarchical system as it does not focus on one point of domination. Instead it is described as a "complex pyramidal system" with those on the bottom of the pyramid experiencing the "full power of kyriarchal oppression". The kyriarchy is recognized as the [[status quo]] and therefore its oppressive structures may not be recognized.&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="reed-bouley" /&gt;

To maintain this system, kyriarchy relies on the creation of a servant class, race, gender, or people. The position of this class is reinforced through "education, socialization, and brute violence and [[malestream]] rationalization".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt; Tēraudkalns suggests that these structures of oppression are self-sustained by [[internalized oppression]]; those with relative power tend to remain in power, while those without tend to remain disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="teraudkalns"&gt;{{cite book |title = Religion and political change in Europe: past and present |chapter = Construction of Masculinities in Contemporary Christianity |pages = 223–232 |last = Tēraudkalns |first = Valdis |editor-last = Cimdiņa |editor-first = Ausma |publisher = PLUS |year = 2003 |isbn=8884921414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of oppression also amplify and feed into each other.&lt;ref name="reed-bouley"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antiracist Theological Education as a Site of Struggle for Justice|last = Reed-Bouley|first = Jennifer|date = Spring 2012|journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|doi = 10.2979/jfemistudreli.28.1.178|volume=28|pages=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morganton''' was a community once located in [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]], [[Tennessee]], in the southeastern United States.  Although now submerged by [[Tellico Reservoir|Tellico Lake]], during its heyday in the 19th century Morganton thrived as a [[flatboat]] port and regional business center.  An important [[ferry]] operated at Morganton for nearly 170 years.

Due largely to the decline in river trade that occurred in the mid-19th century with the construction of railroads in East Tennessee, Morganton was mostly deserted by the time the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] started buying up property for the construction of [[Tellico Dam]] in the late 1960s.  Today, the Morganton Cemetery, which overlooks the now-flooded townsite, is all that remains of the former town.  A road and [[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency|TWRA]] boat ramp are named for Morganton.

==Geographical setting==

The [[Little Tennessee River]] rises in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and meanders its way through southwestern [[North Carolina]] before entering Tennessee, where it flows for roughly {{convert|54|mi|km}} before emptying into the [[Tennessee River]] near [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]].  The completion of Tellico Dam at the river's mouth in 1979 created a lake that spans the lower {{convert|33|mi|km}} of the river.  Morganton was located {{convert|13.7|mi|km}} above the mouth of the Little Tennessee at the river's confluence with Bakers Creek, which flows westward from Maryville.&lt;ref&gt;James Polhemus and Richard Polhemus, ''An Assessment of the Archaeological Potential of Townsite of Morganton in Loudon County, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: Tennessee Valley Authority, 1978), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morganton site is visible from the junction of East Coast Tellico Parkway and Morganton Road, just west of [[Greenback, Tennessee|Greenback]].  The area is under the management of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

==History==
===Early history, 1800-1860===
[[Image:Morganton-site-tennessee1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|The former site of Morganton, now under Tellico Lake.]]

The Morganton area was part of the lands ceded by the [[Cherokee]] with the signing of the First Treaty of Tellico in 1798.  The first Euro-American settlers had arrived at the mouth of Bakers Creek in 1796, however, when the land was still claimed by the Cherokee.&lt;ref&gt;Polhemus and Polhemus, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several major villages of the [[Overhill Cherokee]] were located upstream from the Morganton site (the village of [[Mialoquo]] was situated just around Wears Bend, on the opposite side of the river), although most of these villages had either been destroyed or were in decline by the late 1790s.  Ethnologist [[James Mooney]] recorded a Cherokee legend regarding curiously blazed trees on the banks "opposite Morganton" that supposedly marked the location of hidden mines.&lt;ref&gt;James Mooney, ''Myths of the Cherokee and Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee'' (Nashville: C and R Elder, 1972), 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1799 a [[gristmill|grist mill]] had been established along Bakers Creek by Hugh and Charles Kelso.  The following year, Captain Robert Wear (1781-1846) arrived in the area, establishing a plantation near the mouth of the river and a ferry near the mouth of Bakers Creek.  In 1801, an inspection port was established near the ferry, and the small community that developed in its vicinity became known as "Portville."  The community of Portville incorporated in 1813 after the Kelso brothers donated land for the formation of a town square.  The community chose the name "Morganton" after Gideon Morgan (1751&amp;ndash;1830), a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veteran and prominent local merchant.&lt;ref&gt;Alberta and Carson Brewer, ''Valley So Wild'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: [[East Tennessee Historical Society]], 1975), 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polhemus and Polhemus, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1830s, Morganton had grown to become the main shipping hub and business center in the Little Tennessee region.  Flatboats carried local products such as [[whiskey]] and [[hemp]] to trade throughout the Tennessee Valley&amp;mdash; and sometimes as far away as [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]&amp;mdash; for products such as clothing, salt, and spices.  By 1832, the town had its own doctor, hatter's shop, hemp factory, wagon factory, cabinet shop, distillery, and silversmith.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer and Brewer, 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[steamboat]] line connecting Morganton and Knoxville began operating in 1831.&lt;ref name="Polhemus and Polhemus, 2"&gt;Polhemus and Polhemus, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline, 1861-1967===

[[Image:Morganton-mill-tva1.gif|right|210px|thumb|Abandoned mill along Bakers Creek in Morganton, photographed in 1939]]

In late 1863, at the height of the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[James Longstreet]] hoped to cross the Little Tennessee at Morganton en route from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] to dislodge the troops under the command of [[Ambrose Burnside]], who had occupied Knoxville earlier in the year.  Longstreet later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Had the means been at hand for making proper moves I should have marched for the rear of Knoxville via Morganton and Marysville...&lt;ref&gt;Yong Kim, ''The Sevierville Hill Site: A Civil War Union Encampment on the Southern Heights of Knoxville, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Transportation Center, 1993), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Longstreet lacked the materials to construct a [[pontoon bridge]], however, he was forced to cross the Tennessee River at [[Loudon, Tennessee|Loudon]], and approach from the west.  That same year, however, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] General [[William T. Sherman]] crossed the Little Tennessee at Morganton en route to Chattanooga.  Sherman tore down several of the town's houses to construct a pontoon bridge.&lt;ref name="Polhemus and Polhemus, 2"/&gt;

After the Civil War, railroads slowly replaced riverboats as the preferred mode of shipping and transportation.  When the [[L&amp;N Railroad]] laid tracks through nearby [[Greenback, Tennessee|Greenback]] in the late 19th century, Morganton slowly declined.  In 1947, a bridge near Niles Ferry became toll-free, putting most of the ferries along the Little Tennessee River out of business.  The Morganton Ferry was the last to go, folding in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer and Brewer, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological survey, 1978===

In 1968, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported 18 houses, a store, and a church at Morganton, all of which were to be torn down in anticipation of the construction of Tellico Dam.  In 1978, as the [[Snail darter controversy|Tellico Dam project was stalled by litigation]], University of Tennessee archaeologists conducted a test survey of the Morganton townsite.  Several early American artifacts were located, some dating to as early as 1762, as well as several projectile points.  The artifacts were similar to those uncovered at the nearby [[Tellico Blockhouse]] site, which had been excavated around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Polhemus and Polhemus, lithic and ceramic catalogues in ''An Assessment of the Archaeological Potential of Townsite of Morganton in Loudon County, Tennessee''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Park Glienicke''', (German: ''Park Klein-Glienicke'' or ''Glienicker Park'') is an ''English landscape garden'' in the southwestern outskirts of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. It is located in the locality of [[Wannsee]] in the [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]] borough. Close to [[Glienicke Bridge]] (known as ''Bridge of Spies'') the park is open to the general public. The park is part of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin]] (''Potsdam cultural ensemble''). Within the ensemble it is one of the five main parks, the others being [[Sanssouci Park]], [[New Garden, Potsdam|New Garden (Neuer Garten)]], [[Babelsberg Park]] and [[Pfaueninsel|Peacock Island (Pfaueninsel)]]. Regarding diversity in gardening styles within the Potsdam park ensemble Park Glienicke is only superseded by Sanssouci Park. Furthermore, it is a park especially characterized by one personality due to the intense involvement of [[Prince Charles of Prussia]]. The park covers approximately {{convert|116|ha|acre|lk=on}}&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, Horst et.al. (Ed.): "Berlin Handbuch. Das Lexikon der Bundeshauptstadt "[Berlin Handbook. The [[Encyclopedia]] of the [[Federal Capital]]], FAB Verlag, 1993, Berlin, p. 653&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1682 [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William of Brandenburg]], the ''Great [[Prince-elector|Elector]]'', commissioned the first [[Jagdschloss|hunting lodge]]  ''[[Jagdschloss Glienicke]] '' next to the uninhabited village [[Klein-Glienicke]] which suffered badly in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The lodge had a garden with four [[carp]] ponds. South of the lodge was an enclosed [[wildlife]] park; north a tree garden and two [[vineyard]]s.&lt;ref name="waldsee"&gt;Schultheiß-Block, Gabriele (Ed.): “Das Gantze Eyland muss ein Paradies werden, Jagdschloss Glienicke: 300 Jahre in Ansichten, Plänen, Portraits” [The Whole Island has to become a paradise, Hunting lodge Glienicke: 300 years by Views, Plans, Portraits], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Haus am Waldsee]] ([[:de: Haus am Waldsee|de]]), Berlin, 20 June – 9 August  1987&lt;/ref&gt; Already since 1660 the first wooden Glienicke Bridge linked the area to Potsdam. In 1715 under [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William]], the ''Soldier King'', the lodge became a military hospital for soldiers to be [[quarantine]]d. In 1747 the hospital head Dr. Mirow bought the tree garden and the new vineyard which were neglected since the Soldier King's death and established there an estate where besides farming [[kiln]]s for bricks and lime were operated. In 1758 the lodge itself was turned into a wallpaper factory which became an [[orphanage]] in 1827. From 1789 on the [[Berlin-Potsdam chaussee]] ([[:de: Berlin-Potsdamer Chaussee|de]]) was built distinctly separating former lodge and new estate. The Mirow estate had different owners until the [[Prussia]]n [[lieutenant general]] and head [[equerry]] [[Count]] [[Carl von Lindenau]] ([[:de:Carl Heinrich August von Lindenau|de]]) bought it in 1796&lt;ref name= "bergau"&gt;Bergau, Rudolf:  “Inventar der Bau- und Kunstdenkmäler in der Provinz Brandenburg”[Inventory of Historic Monuments and Works of Art in the [[Province of Brandenburg]]], Voss Verlag, 1885, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|378}} and converted it into an [[Ferme ornée|ornamented farm]].&lt;ref name="seilerdiss"&gt;Seiler, Michael: “Die Entwicklungsgeschichte des Landschaftsgartens Klein-Glienicke 1796–1883”[The evolution of the landscape garden Klein-Glienicke 1796–1883], [[Thesis#Germany|Dissertation]], 1986, Hamburg&lt;/ref&gt;/{{rp|22-}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

After the Prussian [[Chancellor]] [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] had purchased the estate in 1814, he commissioned the Prussian gardener [[Peter Joseph Lenné]] to design a park in 1816. The first part was the ''pleasure ground'' inspired by English landscape gardening. In 1822 Germany's renowned landscape gardener [[Hermann, Fürst von Pückler-Muskau|Prince Hermann von Pückler-Muskau]] brought the English architect [[John Adey Repton]](son of the great English landscape designer [[Humphry Repton]]) to Glienicke. After his return to England J.A. Repton designed a Hardenberg basket supposedly inspired by a wooden basket containing a bed of roses in Glienicke.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|85}}

[[File:Lüdicke Carl im Glienicker Park.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Charles tending trees in Park Glienicke, (H. Lüdeke, around 1880)]]
In November 1822 Chancellor Hardenberg died. In 1824 the estate was sold to Prince Charles of Prussia. It has remained a mystery why the unmarried third-born son of the Prussian king was the first son to get his own estate.&lt;ref name="Zehlchronik6"&gt;Seiler, Michael ;  Sperlich, Martin:  “Schloß und Park Glienicke” [Palace and Park Glienicke],  ''Zehlendorfer Chronik''[Chronicles of [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]], no. 6 (1987), Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} While the [[mansion]] was converted into [[Glienicke Palace]], designed by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]], Prince Charles developed the park together with Lenné and other gardeners in the following decades to the extent which is still visible today. Being a particular [[anglophile]] he had the nickname „Sir Charles Glienicke“ within the Prussian royal family. Yet he never travelled to England as he was opposed to British politics like his anglophile sister [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Charlotte]], the wife of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Russian Emperor Nicholas I]]. Visiting his sister Prince Charles travelled several times to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was especially fascinated by [[Pavlovsk Park]], which was designed as a classic English landscape garden. Park Glienicke was well known to the European [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] as the [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] for state visits to the Prussian capital required to pay also a visit to Prince Charles in Glienicke. On 14 August 1858 [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Consort]] [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]] visited Palace and Park Glienicke. Earlier that year their daughter [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]] had married Charles' nephew [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia]].

After the park had been officially called ''Prince's Charles of Prussia Park''(''Park des Prinzen Carl von Preußen'') since 1824 it was renamed to ''[[Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia|Prince's Friedrich Leopold of Prussia]] Park''(''Park des Prinzen Friedrich Leopold von Preußen'') in 1885. As Charles' son [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828–85)|Friedrich Carl of Prussia]] survived him by only two years the grandson Friedrich Leopold inherited Palace and Park Glienicke. Despite the instruction in Charles' will that the heirs should spend each year 30,000 [[German gold mark|Mark]] on the park Friedrich Leopold neglected the park. When Germany became a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] in 1919 Palace and Park Glienicke remained part of the Prince's property. Palace and park suffered further neglect as Friedrich Leopold moved to [[Lugano]] in [[Switzerland]] and took several pieces of art with him to pay off his debts.&lt;ref&gt;Sternaux, Ludwig: “Potsdam – Ein Buch der Erinnerung” [Potsdam – A Book of Recollection], Edwin Runge Verlag, 1924, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the Prussian state bought the part of Böttcherbergpark. A [[Real estate development|development]] plan of 1928 for that area was not carried out.&lt;ref name="Julier-etal1987"&gt;Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft” [Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|367}} Friedrich Leopold's intention to sell off the areas of the 1841 park extension was blocked by the Prussian state resulting in a lawsuit which ended with the Prince's death in 1931.&lt;ref name="Julier20Jh"&gt;Julier, Jürgen: “Glienicke im 20. Jahrhundert“[Glienicke in the 20th century], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185}}

After the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 the City of Berlin bought most of the park in 1934 and 1935. [[Julius Lippert]], [[Reichskommissar]] of Berlin pressed the [[legal guardian]] of the heir([[Minor (law)|a minor]]) to sell and used the confiscated assets of the German bank manager and art collector Herbert M. Gutmann to pay. The Prince's family kept an triangular area in the southwest of the park including palace and pleasure ground. The park was opened to the public and named ''Volkspark Glienicke''(People's Park Glienicke) indicating Lippert's [[populism|populist intention]]. The official opening was on [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birthday.&lt;ref name="krosigk6-1992"&gt;von Krosigk, Klaus; Wiegand, Heinz: „Glienicke“, ''Berliner Sehenswürdigkeiten''[Berlin Sights] vol. 6, Verlag Haude und Spener, 1992, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|62}}  The following years the park suffered e.g. from the changes to the Berlin-Potsdam [[chaussee]] which became part of the [[Reichsstraße (Deutsches Reich)|Reichsstraße]] 1. After being appointed mayor of Berlin in 1937 Julius Lippert planned to have Glienicke as his official residence and let acquire the remaining part which was not owned by the city. In 1940 Lippert lost his office and the palace became a military hospital afterwards.

[[file:Klein-Glienicke_Kraatzplan.jpg|thumb|[[Lithography|Lithographic]] map of Park Glienicke after last extensions, around 1862]]

After [[World War II]] early ideas to convert the park into a huge [[West Berlin]] sports complex close to the border to the [[Soviet occupation zone]] were dropped. In 1952 the park became a [[nature reserve]].&lt;ref name="Zehlchronik6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krosigk6-1992"/&gt; Besides the restoration of Palace Glienicke and some other buildings by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] and his students since the 1950s it took until 1969 for the park itself being regarded as a work of art by the West Berlin city administration. Since 1978 a special department for the [[conservation and restoration of historic gardens]] focused on [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]] and Park Glienicke. In 1981 the "Schinkel Year" provided further public funding and in 1982 the whole ensemble of Palace and Park was registered as historic monument and historic garden respectively. The [[Berlin Wall]] along the Berlin-Potsdam Chaussee on the one hand caused the demolition of some [[Swiss chalet style|Swiss chalets]] in the part of the Böttcherbergpark south of the chaussee, but on the other hand brought about the rebuilding of the chaussee to its original dimension.&lt;ref name="waldsee" /&gt;{{rp|106}}
 
After the German reunification the ''Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin'' were registered as UNESCO World Heritage Site on 1 January 1991. Since 1992 the park is part of the [[European Union|EU]] [[special protection area]] for wild birds "Western [[Düppel (Berlin)|Düppel]] Forest" (Westlicher Düppeler Forst). In 2000 the ''Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg'', formed in 1995, took over permanently the pleasure ground and the gardens near the palace. The rest of the park has remained with the Borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf.

==Garden areas around the Palace==
[[file: Klein-Glienicke Kraatz Pleasureground.jpg|thumb|Pleasure ground, detail of map of 1862]]
Following the design guidelines by Humphry Repton for the classic English landscape garden Park Glienicke has the [[flower garden]] at the palace in the specific form of a ''garden [[courtyard]]''. From 1816 on Lenné created the adjacent house garden, the ''pleasure ground'', one of his early works and one of his masterpieces.&lt;ref name="Supan1980"&gt;Börsch-Supan, Helmut: “Die Kunst in Brandenburg-Preußen. Ihre Geschichte von der Renaissance bis zum Biedermeier dargestellt am Kunstbesitz der Berliner Schlösser.“ [Art in Brandenburg-Prussia. Its history from [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] to [[Biedermeier]] described by the art owned by Berlin palaces.], Gebr. Mann Verlag, 1980, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|275–277}} The pleasure ground has seemingly a natural landscape, yet Lenné’s whole design is artificial and artistic. The area was developed between palace, chaussee and bridge keeper’s house. Lenné persuaded Hardenberg to buy a small farm estate, a so-called [[Büdnerei]] ([[:de: Büdner#Büdnerei|de]]), on a flat [[terrain]] at the chaussee. The topography of the “Büdnerei” and of four terraces for growing fruit and wine(north of  “Büdnerei”) vanished with the landscaping.&lt;ref name="Zehlchronik6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="krosigk6-1992"/&gt;

===Flower beds ===
[[Ellipse|Elliptical]] and round flower beds with [[terracotta]] [[palmette]] borders are typical for ''garden courtyard'' and ''pleasure ground''. The restoration was supported by discovering original border stones in the cellar of the ''Curiosity'' pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Michael: “Neue Untersuchungen zur ursprünglichen Gestaltung und zur Wiederherstellung des Pleasuregrounds von Klein-Glienicke.”[New research on the original design and the restoration of the Pleasure Ground at Klein-Glienicke.] In: Heikamp, Detlef (Ed.): “Schlösser, Gärten, Berlin. Festschrift für Martin Sperlich zum 60. Geburtstag 1979”[Palaces, Gardens, Berlin. [[Festschrift]] on Martin Sperlich‘s  60th birthday in 1979], Ernst Wasmuth Verlag, 1980, Tübingen, pp. 121–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the underground the beds are walled in allowing for specific irrigation, therefore the pleasure ground has been crisscrossed with water pipes. As the clay pipes on Peacock Island lasted only ten years after being installed in 1824 expensive iron pipes supplied by the Prussian industrial pioneer [[Franz Anton Egells|F.A. Egells]] ([[:de: Franz Anton Egells|de]]) were installed in Glienicke when in 1838 the pumping station started operating with a [[steam engine]], a gift by Charles’ father which was also manufactured by F.A. Egells.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|202}} The beds were filled with a loose [[subsoil]] which facilitated the quick replacement of plants. There are some figurative designed beds bordered with [[buxus]] which add to the pleasure ground an artificial aspect, e.g. the [[Oak]] Leaf bed near the ''Lions Fountain'' and the [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]](Greek:[[Artemis]]) or [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]  bed at the ''Casino''. An [[Athena]] statue, which is now at the [[British Museum]], stood in a niche on the northside of the Casino characterizing it as a place of art. Most striking is the [[Lilium|Lilies]] bed beneath Charles' bedroom windows at the western [[facade]] of the palace. It is a [[Heraldry|heraldic]] sign referring to Charles' younger sister [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1808–1870)|Louise]] who was married to [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. She was very supportive sending [[bulb]]s to Charles. In Glienicke planting of [[rose]]s has been almost non-existent in contrast to Babelsberg Park and Peacock Island. The pleasure ground in Glienicke is rather a  portrayal of an [[Roman villa|antique villa]] complex as described by [[Pliny the Younger]] than a reflexion on a longing for [[Italy]](Italiensehnsucht).

[[file: Klein-Glienicke Weinlaube.jpg|thumb|Vine Pergola covered with [[Vitis vinifera|common grape vine]]]] 
[[Vine]] [[Pergola]] and [[Adjutant]]s’ [[Peristyle]] are the architectural links between garden courtyard and pleasure ground.

The '''pleasure ground''' itself has several architectural elements:

===Lions Fountain===
The planning for a big new fountain started after the construction of the pumping station began in 1836.  On 23 October 1837 Prince Charles, Schinkel, Persius and Lenné met in Glienicke to discuss the fountain near the greenhouse which Count von Lindenau commissioned at the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Julier-etal1987" /&gt;{{rp|42}}  Schinkel drafted the fountain and a new greenhouse which never got beyond the design stage as on its site Persius build the Stibadium in 1840. The ''Lions Fountain'' has two [[Gilding|gilded]] [[cast-iron]] sculptures of [[Medici lions]] which were a present by Charlotte to her brother Charles on his 30th birthday in 1831.&lt;ref name="JulierParkGeb"&gt;Julier, Jürgen: “Parkgebäude nach Entwurf Schinkels “[Park buildings designed by Schinkel], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}}  The lions were placed on two high, zinc cast [[pedestal]]s, which flank the fountain,  each resting on four zinc cast [[Doric order|Doric]]  columns concealing the iron supporting structure. Charlotte and her husband, the Russian Emperor, were present at the official opening of the fountain on 2 June 1838. On the balustrade at the rear of the fountain, which is divided by the flight of steps from the palace, were placed four [[Allegory|allegorical]] terracotta statues (created around 1855) describing  both  commerce, science, art and military as the cornerstones of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the four seasons.&lt;ref name="Sievers"&gt;Sievers, Johannes: “Bauten für den Prinzen Carl von Preußen (Karl Friedrich Schinkel Lebenswerk)“[Buildings for Prince Charles of Prussia (Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s lifework)], Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1942, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} The creator of the statues was probably [[Christian Daniel Rauch]]’s student [[Alexander Gilli]] ([[:de: Alexander Gilli|de]])  who was “court sculptor” in Glienicke.&lt;ref name="Julier-etal1987" /&gt;{{rp|488–489}} Through the years the [[Jet (fluid)|jet]] of water changed. At first a simple jet of water was projected vertically from a [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] statue. Later that changed to [[aigrette]] and bell shapes. Also the Lions sculptures spouted water.&lt;ref name="krosigk6-1992"/&gt;{{rp|42}}  The Lions Fountain has become a symbol for Park Glienicke. The view from the chaussee to the fountain with the palace in the background was the most common subject of the numerous [[Veduta|vedute]] of Park Glienicke. After World War II the whole fountain was in a ruinous state. During the restoration from 1960 to 1964 most of the parts above ground had to be renewed.&lt;ref name="Julier20Jh" /&gt;{{rp|188}} Fifty years later the fountain had again serious construction defects. After the fall of a tree on the fountain the restoration could not be delayed anymore. As in 2009 the work started more defects were discovered and investigated. Financed by considerable private donations the restoration was completed in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spsg.de/presse-foto-film/pressearchiv/pressemeldung/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=213&amp;cHash=a94315671f8962fc4342907c601ed6b6/ |title= Einweihung der Löwenfontäne im Schlosspark Glienicke |last= SPSG |first=Press Release |date=19 August 2010  | website= Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg |access-date=7 January 2017 |language=German |trans-title=Opening of Lions Fountain in the Park of Glienicke Palace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curiosity Pavilion===
[[file:Klein Glienicke Neugierde.jpg|thumb|Curiosity Pavilion, view from garden]]
The [[pavilion]] named ''[[Curiosity]]'' dates back to 1796 and was rebuilt in strict [[Doric order]] by Schinkel in 1825. It has a cellar.&lt;ref name="JulierParkGeb" /&gt;{{rp|36}} Its name derives from the fact that it could be used to watch the traffic on the adjacent Berlin-Potsdam chaussee through the shutters while being invisible to passers-by.  Around 1848 the pavilion became a place for [[Collection (artwork)|arts collection]]. [[Spolia]] were inserted in the entrance hall. At the same time a [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] was installed as a cover on the garden façade. Already in 1842 the arcade was bought from the Russian arts collector [[Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato|Anatoly Demidov]] who lived in Florence.&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt; {{rp|78}}

=== Stibadium ===
The ''[[Stibadium]]'' was designed by [[Friedrich Ludwig Persius]] and built on the site of a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] greenhouse with a [[sunroom|garden room]](built after 1796) in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Eggeling, Tilo: “Ludwig Persius als Architekt in Glienicke.”[Ludwig Persius as architect in Glienicke.] In: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft” [Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}}  The semi-circular [[Tholos (building)|Tholos]] structure with a wooden half-[[cone]] roof was the main place for having tea. On the underside of the roof a twelve [[Deity|deities]] programme is painted. As there are 14 fields the [[Twelve Olympians]] were supplemented with [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and [[Amphitrite]]. The middle pillar had originally a [[zinc]]-cast [[Persephone|Kore]] designed by [[August Kiss]] which later was replaced with a marble copy of the [[Felicitas]] Publica in the monument [[Max-Joseph-Platz|Max-Joseph Denkmal]] by Christian Daniel Rauch in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine, Susanne: “Stibadium in Glienicke”. In: Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg](Ed.): “ludwig persius architekt des königs – baukunst unter friedrich wilhelm IV.”[ludwig persius, the king’s architect  – architecture for Frederick William IV], Verlag Schnell und Steiner, 2003, Regensburg, pp. 189-190&lt;/ref&gt; On the terrace stands a [[granite]] bowl by [[Christian Gottlieb Cantian]] which Charles inherited after his father died in 1840. The Stibadium had the function to be a shield between pleasure ground and [[Driveway|Drive]]. It had also the opposite purpose of the ''Curiosity'' pavilion. While looking on the common people from such an elevated and prestigious building the Prince's tea party was on show to the people at the same time. The paintings of the Twelve Olympians may seem presumptuous, yet they are an artistic expression of how Prussian aristocrats saw themselves in the age of [[Concert of Europe|European Restoration]].

===Rotunda===
After Glienicke Bridge was rebuilt in stone in 1834 Prince Charles asked for a round summerhouse at the new corner of the garden.&lt;ref name="JulierParkGeb" /&gt;{{rp|36}}  Based on ancient examples Schinkel designed a [[Rotunda (architecture)|''Rotunda'']] in which the first tea party took place on 2 July 1835.&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt;{{rp|114}} At Prince Charles’ instigation the pavilion was crowned with the reproduction of the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]]. The completed rotunda was opened with a big party on 16 August 1837.&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}} Rotunda, stone bridge and the residence [[Villa Schöningen]] on the opposite bank of the river Havel formed a little architectural ensemble on its own. This was destroyed when the stone bridge was replaced by the steel bridge in 1907. In 1935 the Rotunda was moved furthermore when the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee was expanded and became part of the [[Reichsstraße (Deutsches Reich)|Reichsstraße]] 1.

===Casino===
[[file:Gemälde Sandmann.jpg|thumb|Glienicke waterfront, from left: Water tower/Pumping station, Dummy Frigate, Casino, Rotunda, Bridge; foregrund left on river: miniature frigate ''Royal Luise''(2nd, 1831), (F. X. Sandmann, 1845)]] 
North of the Rotunda at the [[shore]] of Jungfernsee lies the two-storey ''[[Casino]]'' from 1824. Its terrace, overlooking the lake, was the most beautiful place for having tea. It was the first building Schinkel designed for Prince Charles. On the one hand its name refers to an one-storey building previously used to play [[Cue sports|billiards]] in it, which Schinkel redesigned; on the other hand there is the [[Italian language|Italian origin]] of the word "Casino" and that the building resembles country houses at the [[Gulf of Naples]].&lt;ref name="JulierParkGeb" /&gt;{{rp|33–38}} In autumn and winter 1822/23 Charles had accompanied his father and his brother William on a four and a half month journey to [[Italy]], where they spent four weeks in the Naples region visiting the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] sites of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt;{{rp|4–6}}

===Dummy Frigate===
Just north of the Casino was a ''dummy [[frigate]]'', designed by Schinkel, on an artificial [[peninsula]] which presumably  was thrown up as a bank of earth only in the 18th century serving as [[wharf]] for the ships transporting bricks and limestone. After the kilns were closed down in 1824 the peninsula became a [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]] and was included in the garden  design. The wooden construction of the frigate with three tall masts was used as a toolshed for the sailors who operated the Prince's [[Scale model|miniature]] fleet. The dummy frigate was singular in the German landscape architecture. Presumably the Prince was inspired to having such a construction by travelling as a 13-year-old aboard the miniature frigate (first [[Royal Luise]]) which in 1814 the [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Prussian King Frederick William III]] received as present from the [[George III of the United Kingdom|British King George III]], a coalition partner in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Leiste, Susanne: “Glienicke in Ansichten des 19. Jahrhunderts “[Glienicke in views of the 19th century], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987,  p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orangery and Greenhouses===
After the [[pumping station]] at the shore was finished in 1838 Persius designed and built up-to-date ''[[greenhouse]]s'' and an ''[[orangery]]''  in 1839. The buildings were erected to the west of the [[carriage house|coach house]] at the edge of the pleasure ground where three little greenhouses stood previously. The [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] of the orangery referred to the adjacent coach  house. The greenhouses, flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern [[gable|gable end]] of the orangery.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Margrit-Christine: “ Orangerie und Treibhäuser im Park Glienicke ”[Orangery and Greenhouses in Park Glienicke], In: Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg](Ed.): “ludwig persius architekt des königs – baukunst unter friedrich wilhelm IV.”[ludwig persius, the king’s architect  – architecture for Frederick William IV], Verlag Schnell und Steiner, 2003, Regensburg, pp. 208–210&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common fig|Figs]], [[peach]]es, [[pineapple]], [[prune]]s and [[strawberry|strawberries]] were grown in the greenhouses. The area in front of the greenhouses was used for extensive [[seedbed]]s. Orangery and one part of the greenhouses were demolished in 1940 and reconstructed in 1981.

=== Cloister Courtyard ===
[[file:Klosterhof Glienicke Vasenbild.jpg|thumb|Cloister Courtyard, painting on vase, 1854]]
In 1850 the ''[[Cloister]] Courtyard'' between Casino and the greenhouses was erected as the last building on the pleasure ground. The formal reason for the building was to house Charles' extensive collections of medieval art and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] sculptures. Historic building parts were purchased in [[Venice]] to be used as spolia in the Cloister Courtyard where Charles developed the first collection of Byzantine works of art in modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zuchold, Gerd H.:  “Byzanz in Berlin. Der Klosterhof im Schloßpark Glienicke ” [The Byzantine Empire in Berlin. The Cloister Courtyard in the Park of Glienicke Palace],  ''Berliner Forum''[Berlin Forum], no. 6 (1984), Berlin, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; The building has been described as a political statement by Prince Charles in the aftermath of the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|revolution of 1848]]. It is regarded as a tribute to the Byzantine Empire as a God-given unity of throne and altar in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Middle Ages]]. Furthermore, it is seen as a hidden tribute to Russia and its political order as the Russian emperors saw themselves as successors of the Byzantine Emperors.&lt;ref name="Zuchold1993"&gt;Zuchold, Gerd. H.:  “ Der Klosterhof im Park von Schloss Glienicke in Berlin” [The Cloister Courtyard in the Park of Glienicke Palace in Berlin],  ''Die Bauwerke und Kunstdenkmäler von Berlin'' [The historical buildings and works of art of Berlin], supplement 20/21, Gebr. Mann Verlag, 1993, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51-}} The Cloister Courtyard represents an unusual mixture of a romantic architecture depicting the contemporary atmosphere and of the function as a museum, so to speak a very late [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] with scientific pretension and political statement.&lt;ref name="Supan1980" /&gt;{{rp|290–291}} Part of the collection in the Cloister Courtyard was the [[Imperial Throne of Goslar]] which Charles acquired with the help of his former tutor [[Heinrich Menu von Minutoli]] who had fostered Charles’ interest in [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Schütte, Margret: “Prinz Friedrich Carl Alexander von Preußen (Biografische Skizze ).“[Prince Frederick Charles Alexander of Prussia (Biographical Sketch).], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987,  pp. 191-210&lt;/ref&gt; The throne was kept together with other medieval treasures in a [[chapel]]-like [[Bank vault|vault]] resembling a [[Schatzkammer]].&lt;ref name= "bergau" /&gt; {{rp|383}} In 1871 Charles loaned the throne to his brother [[William I, German Emperor|Emperor William I]] to be used  as the Emperor's  seat in the imperial ceremony opening the first Berlin [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. Charles left the throne in his will to the town of Goslar. The most precious [[relief]] on the walls of the Cloister Courtyard was a late 12th century [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of the Byzantine Emperor. Nowadays only a reproduction is on display. The original is part of the Byzantine Collection of the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Museum in Georgetown, Washington, D.C..

===Coach House Courtyard and Palace Tower===
The ''Coach House Courtyard'' dates from 1828 (design by Schinkel) and housed Charles' collection of [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]]. The four [[arch]]es refer to the Roman [[Agoranomion]] in [[Athens]] which Schinkel and his contemporaries thought of as the most important arch architecture of the "Old Greeks". The  ''Palace [[Tower]] '' adjacent to the coach house was built in 1832 and was used as a difficult to climb vantage point. Charles called the tower the “Good Charles”(Guter Carl).&lt;ref name="Julier-etal1987" /&gt;{{rp|16}} In 1874 a late neoclassical observation [[loggia]] was put on the tower and the coach house was expanded including a second storey which was removed after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard, Andreas: “Die Bautätigkeiten der Architekten v. Arnim und Petzholtz “[ The building activities of the architects von Arnim and Petzholtz], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987,  p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garden Furniture and Pergolas===
[[file: Gartensessel stilisiert.jpg|thumb|Wrought iron garden chair, around 1830]]
The [[wrought iron]] [[garden furniture]] is missing.  Due to its great weight it was probably kept at outdoor places for the tea parties during the summer season which lasted from 1 May(day of purchase of Glienicke) until 3 November ([[Hubertus]]’s hunt). Some of the garden furniture was probably designed by Schinkel,&lt;ref&gt;Sievers, Johannes: “Die Möbel (Karl Friedrich Schinkel Lebenswerk)“[The Furniture (Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s lifework], Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1950, Berlin, pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; other parts were in [[Louis Quinze]] style or [[Empire style]].&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt;{{rp|48}} Wrought iron benches were presumably placed at smaller vantage points like e.g. the [[Syringa vulgaris|Lilac]] Pergola on the Lenné hill(as it is called nowadays) or the [[Tilia|Lime Trees]] Pergola.  The Lime Trees Pergola is the only non-architectural pergola in Glienicke which is still visible today. It consists of eight lime trees at a junction near the Cloister Courtyard which are the remains of the late 18th century [[Geometry|geometrical]] aligned avenue trees. Near Lions Fountain and Stibadium the “Sphingentreppe”, a low rise flight of steps, is covered with a [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] designed by Persius. The flight of steps is named after the [[Sphinx]] statues placed at the foot of the steps which like the ill-fitting steps are from the demolished neoclassical greenhouse with a garden room at the site of today’s Stibadium.

===Smaller Architectural Elements=== 
There are some smaller architectural elements on the pleasure ground. Near the Lions Fountain a [[mosaic]] floor marks a former place for tea parties under the former King’s Lime Tree which was one of the most impressive solitary trees on the estate. In front of the Curiosity pavilion is the “La Laitière“ Fountain. It is an [[Glacial erratic|erratic]] crowned with a milkmaid bronze sculpture.  The sculpture was a gift to Charles by his sister Charlotte in 1827. It was a copy of the original sculpture by Russian sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835) on the pleasure ground at the palace of [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. The sculpture refers to the [[fable]] about [[the milkmaid and her pail]] by [[Jean de La Fontaine]].  Today’s copy was created in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Seiler1987"&gt;Seiler, Michael: “Entstehung des Landschaftsgartens Klein-Glienicke.“[The evolution of the landscape garden Klein-Glienicke.], in: Julier, Jürgen et. al.(Ed.) : “Schloss Glienicke: Bewohner, Künstler, Parklandschaft”[Glienicke Palace: Occupiers, Artists, Landscaped Park], Catalogue of an exhibition at the [[Glienicke Palace]], Berlin, 1 August  – 1 November  1987&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}  The Boy’s Fountain is located in the middle of the pleasure ground. At its place was at first a sentimental memorial fountain called the “Monument“. Only after 1851 it was rebuilt into today’s Boy’s Fountain. It was inspired by a fountain design draft by [[Friedrich August Stüler]] published in 1850 on which the (destroyed) Frog’s Fountain in Sanssouci was modelled. For the Frog’s Fountain [[Friedrich Wilhelm Dankberg]] ([[:de:Friedrich Wilhelm Dankberg|de]]) created a statue of a boy carrying a bowl from which Prince Charles commissioned a zinc copy.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|205}} On Lenné hill half hidden at bushes a „remnants of columns arrangement” is placed. The arrangement includes two column sections of the ancient [[Greek temple]] of [[Poseidon]] at Cape [[Sounion]], a [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]] and another one from the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|St. Paul's outside the Walls]] [[basilica]] in Rome.&lt;ref name= "bergau" /&gt; {{rp|383}}

==Outlying Park areas==
[[file:Klein-Glienicke Übersicht Parkbereiche neu.jpg|thumb|Modern overview of parts of Park Glienicke since last extensions]]
The outlying park areas were separated from the pleasure ground by walls, fences or so-called invisible fences thus keeping out [[livestock]] and wildlife which roamed in the outlying park. In the middle of today’s park lies the part of the ''Big Meadows''(Großer Wiesengrund). In the west of it the part of the ''Shore Ridge Path''(Ufer-Höhenweg) is located which is continued to the north by the part of the ''Hunter's Court'' (Jägerhof). In the northeast the part of the ''Karpathen'' is a mountain park with steep slopes. South of it and east of the Big Meadows stretches a part which is dominated by ''Wooded Valleys''(Waldtäler-Partie). South of the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee are the ''Böttcherberg-Park'' with its [[Swiss chalet style|Swiss chalets]] area and the adjacent ''Hunting Lodge Garden''(Jagdschlossgarten).  The east of the Hunter's Court and the wooded valleys became part of the park when Frederick William, who became King of Prussia in June 1840, gave the area on the basis of a kind of [[perpetual usufruct]] to his brother Charles as a [[Christmas]] present in 1840.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|186}} The Böttcherberg-Park belonged already to the Lindenau estate since 1804, yet the main landscape design effort started only in 1841.&lt;ref name="Seiler1987" /&gt; {{rp|137}} The largest part of the ''Karpathen'' was bought in 1851.&lt;ref name="Seiler1987" /&gt; {{rp|137}} Charles’ work on the plans for the Hunting Lodge Garden started about the time when his brother, the King, suffered several [[stroke]]s in summer 1857. The Swiss chalets in Böttcherberg-Park were built from 1863 to 1867.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|250}} after the owner of the adjacent Babelsberg Park, Charles’ brother William, the [[Prince regent]], became King in 1861. Some of the names of the parts are historical.  Big Meadows, Shore Ridge Path, the part of the Hunter's Court and the part of the Wooded Valleys are auxiliary names as the traditional names by Charles and his family are not known.

[[file: Lenné Situationsplan 1831 Ausschn.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Park Glienicke, Detail without park extensions, (P. J. Lenné, 1831)]]
Lenné’s park design is characterized by very many and seemingly surprising [[sightline]]s in the park itself as well as in the Potsdam cultural ensemble. The continuous interlocking of meadows creating the highest degree of views is also typical for Lenné.  Figurative flower beds, lively structured ponds and mountainous designed park parts are typical for landscape gardening by Prince Pückler. In Glienicke Prince Charles united both approaches, yet the western parts of the park show clearly the hand of Lenné. Regarding the park design Charles did not meet Pückler in person for decades, although they were introduced at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1818. Yet it is remarkable that Charles used the presence of Pückler’s employee [[Jacob Rehder]] ([[:de: Jacob Heinrich Rehder|de]]) at Babelsberg to consult him about Pückler’s approach to landscape design while Pückler travelled through the north of Africa and the [[Near East]] from 1834 to 1840.&lt;ref name="Seiler1987"/&gt;{{rp|149}}  Around 1837/38 Charles deviated from Lenné’s design principles when he designed three [[canyon|”gorges”]] in the part of the Shore Ridge Path and started to subdivide Lenné’s unified designed park into parts. Pückler started the first of his eight visits to Prince Charles in Glienicke only in 1853, the same year the court gardener Friedrich Schojan, who had already served Hardenberg, retired.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|62–79, 124–161}}  Schojan was succeeded by August Gieseler who previously worked at [[Muskau Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, Clemens Alexander: “Verzeichnis der Hofgärtner und leitenden Beamten der preußischen Gartenverwaltung bis 1945“[Index of court gardeners and senior officials of the Prussian administration of gardens until 1945], p. 311, in: Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg[Foundation for Prussian Palaces and Gardens in Berlin-Brandenburg](Ed.): “Preußisch Grün: Hofgärtner in Brandenburg-Preußen“[Prussian Green: Court Gardeners in Brandenburg-Prussia],  accompanying book to the exhibition “Preußisch Grün. Vom königlichen Hofgärtner zum Gartendenkmalpfleger“[Prussian Green. From Royal Court Gardener to [[Curator]] of Historic Gardens] at the Glienicke Palace, Berlin, 18 July - 17 October 2004, Henschel Verlag, 2004, Leipzig, pp. 302–339&lt;/ref&gt;
 
1824 was a busy year for Charles in Glienicke. Besides the architectural work with Schinkel and Persius he worked with Lenné and Schojan regarding the park design and ordered as much [[Coppicing|coppice]] as possible for planting in autumn and spring. For the first phase the planting of around 26,000 copses was recorded, mostly oaks, [[Populus|poplars]], [[robinia|locust trees]] and lilac trees.&lt;ref name="Zehlchronik6" /&gt;{{rp|30}} The huge number of copses resulted in a big [[Logistics|logistical]] effort. On the park terrain of that time planting on a massive scale of between 40,000 &lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|138}} and 50.000 copses&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt; happened during the first years. Despite consisting mostly of young [[Fagus sylvatica|beeches]] procurement did get difficult. As neighbouring [[Plant nursery|tree nurseries]] and forests ran fast out of copses [[Corporate sourcing|sourcing]] took Lenné, who was in charge, to more distant regions, especially the state forest Lüdersdorf in the [[Uckermark]].&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|128}} At more exposed places in the park up to 40-years old trees were planted at huge costs during the following years.&lt;ref name="Sievers" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

[[file: Klein-Glienicke Drive-Übersicht.jpg|thumb|Sketch of ''Drive'' and park road network]]
Through a network of park roads and [[footpath]]s most of the park was accessible. Pure footpaths were to be found in difficult terrain. At very [[Grade (slope)|steep slopes]] footpaths with steps were available which were lost when most of the park became “Volkspark”. One path with steps was across the ''Karpathen'', another one linked the main park road, the Drive, with the ''Big Hunting Parasol''. There were also paths with steps to reach the lower parts of the ''[[Alder]]s Bridge''  in the part of the Shore Ridge Path.&lt;ref name="seilerdiss" /&gt;{{rp|170}}

Touring Park Glienicke by coach was done on the Drive, the main park road, which began at the ''Middle Gate'', nowadays an inconspicuous flight of stairs at the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee(Königstraße). When the chaussee was expanded to become Reichsstraße 1 the street level was raised at the park. Middle Gate was not anymore at the level of the Big Meadows requiring a flight of stairs. To access the “Volkspark” a monumental limestone flight of stairs was probably built in 1935 which was replaced by a more modest construction after 1945.&lt;ref name="Zehlchronik6" /&gt;{{rp|170}} In the 19th century visitors drove through Middle Gate, then past the big erratic with the date 1 May 1824(date of purchase of estate by Prince Charles) and along Big Meadows where the Palace Pond and the Workers’ Quarters were on sight to finally reach the open part of the Garden Courtyard where they entered the Palace. From the Palace the Drive, allowing a view of Coach House Courtyard, went north along Shore Ridge with the ''Tent'' as highest vantage point. Close to Hunter’s Court after a rather sharp bend the park road went south to the Big Meadows during the first years. Only at the end of the 1830s the completion of the three “gorges” with the pertinent bridges on Shore Ridge and buildings like the Court Gardener’s House with the adjacent water tower of the pumping station increased significantly the number of sights inside the park along the sightlines from the Drive. With the park extensions after 1840 the Drive was also extended to include the new parts in the north and the east. Several times the [[curve]] in the north was redesigned to a larger radius enabling a new route in the north which offered e.g. a splendid view of Peacock Island from the Drive. In its design the main park road became more dramatic in the east. From a dam leading southeastward views were possible into “gorges” adorned with erratics. Passing the [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|Hermitage]] the Drive descended into the wooded parts from where in a big westward curve it ascended to the edge of a steep slope which was impressive regarding the usual regional topography. From vantage points there magnificent long distance views on the Potsdam cultural ensemble were possible.  At the ''Upper Gate'' the Berlin-Potsdam chaussee was crossed and the tour continued into Böttcherberg-Park. Following another steep ascent the ''Alexandra Bench'' offered a view into the gorge there. At the ''Rondell'' the tour would usually be continued to the adjacent Babelsberg Park. On a shorter tour the coach would drive from the Rondell via the Middle Gate back to the Palace.
 
The park roads were built in layers. Coarse material was covered with fine material. The [[cross slope|camber]] ensured that rain ran fast off the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Dreger, Hans-Joachim Dreger: “Gartendenkmalpflege in Brandenburg“ [Preservation of Historic Gardens in Brandenburg],  in: “Landesdenkmalamt Berlin und Brandenburgisches Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologisches Landesmuseum“[Department of Heritage, State Berlin and Department of Heritage Preservation and Archaeological Museum, State Brandenburg] (Ed.): “Gartenkunst und Gartendenkmalpflege“ [Garden Design and Preservation of Historic Gardens], “Denkmalpflege in Berlin und Brandenburg“[ Heritage Preservation in Berlin und Brandenburg],  “Arbeitshefte“[working papers],  no. 2 (2004), Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg,  p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;   At slopes the park roads had narrow and flat [[Street gutter|gutters]] which were flanked by pebbles of erratics preventing erosion. At [[Intersection (road)|intersections]] the gutters crossed the road.

A '''party motivator''' is a person paid to entertain attendants at a party. Typically, party motivators are attractive young men and women who dress fashionably and attempt to engage guests in socializing and dancing. Hiring party motivators is primarily a phenomenon within the [[United States|American]] upper middle and upper classes; they are especially common at [[bar mitzvah]]s.

'''Philosophy of language''' in the analytical tradition explored logic and accounts of the mind at the end of the nineteenth century, with English-speaking writers [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] being pivotal, followed by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''), the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], while on the continent a foundation work was Ferdinand de [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/|title=Philosophy of Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of Language may investigate the relations between language, language users, and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-language|title=Philosophy of language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scope of Philosophy of Language may include inquiry into the origins of [[language]], the nature of meaning, the usage and cognition of language. It overlaps to some extent with the study of [[Epistemology]], [[Logic]], [[Philosophy of mind|Philosophy of Mind]] and other fields (including linguistics and psychology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_philosophy_of_language.html|title=Philosophy of Language - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense it may be said that the philosophy of language explores the relationship between language and reality. In particular, philosophy of language studies issues that cannot be addressed by other fields, like linguistics, or psychology. Major topics in the philosophy of language include the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|nature of meaning]], [[intentionality]], [[reference]], the constitution of sentences, concepts, [[learning]], and [[thought]].

==Overview==
The topic that has received the most attention in the philosophy of language has been the ''nature'' of meaning, to explain what "meaning" is, and what we mean when we talk about meaning. Within this area, issues include: the nature of [[synonymy]], the origins of meaning itself, our apprehension of meaning, and the nature of composition (the question of how meaningful units of language are composed of smaller meaningful parts, and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts).

Secondly, this field of study seeks to better understand what speakers and listeners do with language in [[communication]], and how it is used socially. Specific interests include the topics of [[Language acquisition|language learning]], language creation, and [[speech act]]s.

Thirdly, the question of how language relates to the minds of both the speaker and the [[Language interpretation|interpreter]] is investigated. Of specific interest is the grounds for successful [[translation]] of words and concepts into their equivalents in another language.

Finally, philosophers of language investigate how language and meaning relate to [[truth]] and [[Reference|the reality being referred to]]. They tend to be less interested in which sentences are ''actually true'', and more in  ''what kinds of meanings can be true or false''. A truth-oriented philosopher of language might wonder whether or not a meaningless sentence can be true or false, or whether or not sentences can express propositions about things that do not exist, rather than the way sentences are used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Major topics and sub-fields==

===Composition and parts===
{{Philosophy-of-language-key-terms}}
It has long been known that there are different [[parts of speech]]. One part of the common sentence is the [[lexical word]], which is composed of [[nouns]], verbs, and adjectives. A major question in the field – perhaps the single most important question for [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalist]] and [[structuralism|structuralist]] thinkers – is, "How does the meaning of a sentence emerge out of its parts?"

[[File:syntactic-semantic trees.gif|right|thumb|230px|Example of a syntactic tree]]

Many aspects of the problem of the composition of sentences are addressed in the field of linguistics of [[syntax]]. Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the [[principle of compositionality]] to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences. The principle of compositionality asserts that a sentence can be understood on the basis of the meaning of the ''parts'' of the sentence (i.e., words, morphemes) along with an understanding of its ''structure'' (i.e., syntax, logic).&lt;ref&gt;Pagin, P. "Are Holism and Compositionality Compatible?" In ''Olismo''. ed. Massimo dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. 2002. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, syntactic propositions are arranged into 'discourse' or 'narrative' structures, which also encode meanings through [[pragmatics]] like temporal relations and pronominals.&lt;ref&gt;Syntax: An Introduction, Volume 1
Talmy GivónJohn Benjamins Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to use the concept of ''functions'' to describe more than just how lexical meanings work: they can also be used to describe the meaning of a sentence. Take, for a moment, the sentence "The horse is red". We may consider "the horse" to be the product of a ''[[propositional function]]''. A propositional function is an operation of language that takes an entity (in this case, the horse) as an input and outputs a ''semantic fact'' (i.e., the proposition that is represented by "The horse is red"). In other words, a propositional function is like an algorithm. The meaning of "red" in this case is whatever takes the entity "the horse" and turns it into the statement, "The horse is red."&lt;ref name="Stainton"&gt;Stainton, Robert J. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=889RAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophical perspectives on language]. Peterborough, Ont., Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists have developed at least two general methods of understanding the relationship between the parts of a linguistic string and how it is put together: syntactic and semantic trees. [[Syntax|Syntactic]] trees draw upon the words of a sentence with the ''[[grammar]]'' of the sentence in mind. [[Semantics|Semantic]] trees, on the other hand, focus upon the role of the ''meaning'' of the words and how those meanings combine to provide insight onto the genesis of semantic facts.

{{Main|Meaning (linguistic)}}
{{Main|Meaning (philosophy of language)}}

There have been several distinctive explanations of what a [[Meaning (linguistics)|linguistic "meaning"]] is. Each has been associated with its own body of literature.

* The [[ideational theory of meaning]], most commonly associated with the British [[empiricism|empiricist]] [[John Locke]], claims that meanings are [[mental representation]]s provoked by signs.&lt;ref&gt; Grigoris Antoniou, John Slaney (eds.), ''Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence'', Springer, 1998, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this view of meaning has been beset by a number of problems from the beginning (see the main article for details), interest in it has been renewed by some contemporary theorists under the guise of ''[[semantic internalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Ned. "Conceptual Role Semantics" [http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/faculty/block/papers/ConceptualRoleSemantics.html (online)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Truth-conditional semantics|truth-conditional theory of meaning]] holds meaning to be the conditions under which an expression may be true or false. This tradition goes back at least to [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]] and is associated with a rich body of modern work, spearheaded by philosophers like [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref name="Tarsk"&gt;Tarski, Alfred.

* The [[use theory of meaning]], most commonly associated with the [[late Ludwig Wittgenstein]], helped inaugurate the idea of "meaning as use", and a [[communitarian]] view of language.

* The [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] theory of meaning claims that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality it is describing through [[speech act]]s, which for linguistics was as revolutionary a discovery as for [[physics]] was the discovery that the very act of [[measurement]] can change the measured reality itself.  [[Speech act]] theory was developed by [[J. L. Austin]], although other previous thinkers have had similar ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Filozofija jezika i pragmatika |trans-title=Philosophy of language and pragmatics |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |deadurl=no |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Revija |volume=30 |issue=7 |page=99 |year=1990 |issn=0034-6888 |archivedate=10 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AZGjjiCD?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446878.rec_PUPOVAC.PDF |accessdate=6 June 2015 |df= }} [http://katalog.nsk.hr/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=000147293 (NSK)].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''reference theory of meaning'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, also known collectively as ''[[semantic externalism]]'', views meaning to be equivalent to those things in the world that are actually connected to signs.

* The [[verificationist]] theory of meaning is generally associated with the early 20th century movement of [[logical positivism]]. The traditional formulation of such a theory is that the meaning of a sentence is its method of verification or falsification. In this form, the thesis was abandoned after the acceptance by most philosophers of the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]] of [[confirmation holism]] after the publication of [[W.V.O. Quine|Quine]]'s "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Voltolini, A. (2002) "Olismi Irriducibilmente Indipendenti?". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo Dell'Utri. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Dummett]] has advocated a modified form of verificationism since the 1970s. In this version, the ''comprehension'' (and hence meaning) of a sentence consists in the hearer's ability to recognize the demonstration (mathematical, empirical or other) of the truth of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Dummett"&gt;Dummett, M.

* A [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic theory of meaning]] is any theory in which the meaning (or understanding) of a sentence is determined by the consequences of its application. Dummett attributes such a theory of meaning to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and other early 20th century [[American philosophy|American]] pragmatists.&lt;ref name="Dummett" /&gt;
* The [[contrast theory of meaning]] suggests that knowledge attributions have a ternary structure of the form 'S knows that p rather than q'.

===Reference&lt;!--'Philosophy of reference', 'Reference theory', and 'Theory of reference' redirect here--&gt;===

Investigations into how language interacts with the world are called '''theories of reference'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. [[Gottlob Frege]] was an advocate of a [[mediated reference theory]]. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components: sense and reference. The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding sentence expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. [[Referent]]s are the objects in the world that words pick out. The senses of sentences are thoughts, while their referents are [[truth value]]s (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in [[propositional attitude]] ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;Frege, G. (1892) "On Sense and Reference". In ''Frege: Senso, Funzione e Concetto''. eds. [[Eva Picardi]] and [[Carlo Penco]]. Bari: Editori Laterza. 2001. {{ISBN|88-420-6347-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in his later writings and for reasons related to his theory of acquaintance in [[epistemology]], held that the only directly referential expressions are, what he called, "logically proper names". Logically proper names are such terms as ''I'', ''now'', ''here'' and other [[indexical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Jason. (2006). [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf Philosophy of Language in the Twentieth Century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424165706/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/routledge.pdf |date=2006-04-24 }}. Forthcoming in the Routledge Guide to Twentieth Century Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaynesford, M. de ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed proper names of the sort described above as "abbreviated [[definite description]]s". Hence ''Donald J. Trump'' may be an abbreviation for "the current President of the United States and husband of Melania Trump."  Definite descriptions are denoting phrases (see "[[On Denoting]]") which are analyzed by Russell into existentially quantified logical constructions. Such phrases denote in the sense that there is an object that satisfies the description. However, such objects are not to be considered meaningful on their own, but have meaning only in the [[proposition]] expressed by the sentences of which they are a part. Hence, they are not directly referential in the same way as logically proper names, for Russell.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1905) "On Denoting". Published in ''Mind''.[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Russell/denoting/ online text], Neale, Stephen (1990) Descriptions, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (1903) ''I Principi della Matematica''. Original title: ''The Principles of Mathematics''. Italian trans. by Enrico Carone and Maurizio Destro. Rome: Newton Compton editori. 1971. {{ISBN|88-8183-730-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Frege's account, any [[referring expression]] has a sense as well as a referent. Such a "mediated reference" view has certain theoretical advantages over Mill's view. For example, co-referential names, such as ''Samuel Clemens'' and ''Mark Twain'', cause problems for a directly referential view because it is possible for someone to hear "Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens" and be surprised – thus, their cognitive content seems different.

Despite the differences between the views of Frege and Russell, they are generally lumped together as [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivists]] about proper names. Such descriptivism was criticized in [[Saul Kripke]]'s ''Naming and Necessity''.

Kripke put forth what has come to be known as "the modal argument" (or "argument from rigidity"). Consider the name ''Aristotle'' and the descriptions "the greatest student of Plato", "the founder of logic" and "the teacher of Alexander". [[Aristotle]] obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not [[logical truth|necessarily true]] that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions. Aristotle may well have existed without doing any single one of the things for which he is known to posterity. He may have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he may have died in infancy. Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description "the last great philosopher of antiquity" and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary’s description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are ''[[rigid designator]]s'', according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists. In the same work, Kripke articulated several other arguments against "[[Frege–Russell view|Frege–Russell]]" descriptivism.&lt;ref name="SK" /&gt;

It is worth noting that the whole philosophical enterprise of studying reference has been critiqued by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] in various works.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. ''New horizons in the study of language and mind''. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piattelli-Palmarini, Massimo, Juan Uriagereka, and Pello Salaburu, eds.

=== Mind and language ===

==== Innateness and learning ====
Some of the major issues at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind are also dealt with in modern [[psycholinguistics]]. Some important questions are ''How much of language is innate? Is language acquisition a special faculty in the mind? What is the connection between thought and language?''

There are three general perspectives on the issue of language learning. The first is the [[behaviorist]] perspective, which dictates that not only is the solid bulk of language learned, but it is learned via conditioning. The second is the ''hypothesis testing perspective'', which understands the child's learning of syntactic rules and meanings to involve the postulation and testing of hypotheses, through the use of the general faculty of intelligence. The final candidate for explanation is the [[Psychological nativism|innatist]] perspective, which states that at least some of the syntactic settings are innate and hardwired, based on certain modules of the mind.&lt;ref name="Fodor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fodor |first=Jerry A. |title=The Modularity of Mind: An Essay in Faculty Psychology |year=1983 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;Pinker, S. (1994) ''L'Istinto del Linguaggio''. Original title: ''The Language Instinct''. 1997. Milan: Arnaldo Mondadori Editori. {{ISBN|88-04-45350-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are varying notions of the structure of the brain when it comes to language. [[Connectionism|Connectionist]] models emphasize the idea that a person's lexicon and their thoughts operate in a kind of distributed, [[associationism|associative]] network.&lt;ref&gt;Churchland, P. (1995) Engine of Reason, Seat of the Soul: A Philosophical Journey Into the Brain. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychological nativism|Nativist model]]s  assert that there are [[language acquisition device|specialized devices]] in the brain that are dedicated to language acquisition.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt; [[Computationalism|Computation]] models emphasize the notion of a representational [[language of thought]] and the logic-like, computational processing that the mind performs over them.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, J and E. Lepore. (1999) "All at Sea in Semantic Space: Churchland on Meaning Similarity." Journal of Philosophy 96, 381–403.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergentism|Emergentist]] models focus on the notion that natural faculties are a complex system that emerge from simpler biological parts. [[Reductionism|Reductionist]] models attempt to explain higher-level mental processes in terms of the basic low-level neurophysiological activity of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, D.R. (1979)''Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-394-74502-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Language and thought ====
An important problem which touches both philosophy of language and [[philosophy of mind]] is to what extent language influences thought and vice versa. There have been a number of different perspectives on this issue, each offering a number of insights and suggestions.

Linguists [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir and Whorf]] suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a "linguistic community" can think about certain subjects (a hypothesis paralleled in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Kay, P. and W. Kempton. 1984. "What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis?" American Anthropologist 86(1): 65–79.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, language was analytically prior to thought. Philosopher [[Michael Dummett]] is also a proponent of the "language-first" viewpoint.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil&gt;{{cite book |last=Bunnin |first=Nicholas |first2=E. P. |last2=Tsui-James |title=The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |pages=97, 120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stark opposite to the Sapir–Whorf position is the notion that thought (or, more broadly, mental content) has priority over language. The "knowledge-first" position can be found, for instance, in the work of [[Paul Grice]].&lt;ref name="BlackwellPhil" /&gt; Further, this view is closely associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and his [[language of thought]] hypothesis. According to his argument, spoken and written language derive their intentionality and meaning from an internal language encoded in the mind.&lt;ref name="LOT"&gt;Fodor, J. ''The Language of Thought'', Harvard University Press, 1975, {{ISBN|0-674-51030-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main argument in favor of such a view is that the structure of thoughts and the structure of language seem to share a compositional, systematic character. Another argument is that it is difficult to explain how signs and symbols on paper can represent anything meaningful unless some sort of meaning is infused into them by the contents of the mind. One of the main arguments against is that such levels of language can lead to an infinite regress.&lt;ref name="LOT" /&gt; In any case, many philosophers of mind and language, such as [[Ruth Millikan]], [[Fred Dretske]] and Fodor, have recently turned their attention to explaining the meanings of mental contents and states directly.

Another tradition of philosophers has attempted to show that language and thought are coextensive – that there is no way of explaining one without the other. Donald Davidson, in his essay "Thought and Talk", argued that the notion of belief could only arise as a product of public linguistic interaction. [[Daniel Dennett]] holds a similar ''interpretationist'' view of [[propositional attitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gozzano, S. "Olismo, Razionalità e Interpretazione". In ''Olismo'' ed. Massimo dell'Utri. 2002. Macerata: Quodlibet. {{ISBN|88-86570-85-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To an extent, the theoretical underpinnings to [[cognitive semantics]] (including the notion of semantic [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]) suggest the influence of language upon thought.&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G. (1987) ''Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind''. Chicago:University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same tradition views meaning and grammar as a function of conceptualization, making it difficult to assess in any straightforward way.

Some thinkers, like the ancient sophist [[Gorgias]], have questioned whether or not language was capable of capturing thought at all.
{{cquote|...speech can never exactly represent perceptibles, since it is different from them, and perceptibles are apprehended each by the one kind of organ, speech by another. Hence, since the objects of sight cannot be presented to any other organ but sight, and the different sense-organs cannot give their information to one another, similarly speech cannot give any information about perceptibles. Therefore, if anything exists and is comprehended, it is incommunicable.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgias (c. 375 BCE) translated by Kathleen Freeman. In Kaufmann, W. ''Philosophic Classics: Thales to Ockham''. New Jersey: Prentice Hall, Inc. 1961, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are studies that prove that languages shape how people understand causality. Some of them were performed by [[Lera Boroditsky]]. For example, English speakers tend to say things like "John broke the vase" even for accidents. However, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speakers would be more likely to say "the vase broke itself." In studies conducted by Caitlin Fausey at [[Stanford University]] speakers of English, Spanish and Japanese watched videos of two people popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later everyone was asked whether they could remember who did what. Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/Proceedings/2009/papers/559/paper559.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Russian language|Russian]] speakers, who make an extra distinction between light and dark blue in their language, are better able to visually discriminate shades of blue. The [[Pirahã people|Piraha]], a tribe in [[Brazil]], whose language has only terms like few and many instead of numerals, are not able to keep track of exact quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boroditsky |first=Lera |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467304575383131592767868?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_MIDDLETopNews#printMode |title=Lost in Translation.

In one study German and Spanish speakers were asked to describe objects having opposite [[gender]] assignment in those two languages. The descriptions they gave differed in a way predicted by [[grammatical gender]]. For example, when asked to describe a "key"—a word that is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish—the [[German language|German]] speakers were more likely to use words like "hard," "heavy," "jagged," "metal," "serrated," and "useful," whereas Spanish speakers were more likely to say "golden," "intricate," "little," "lovely," "shiny," and "tiny." To describe a "bridge," which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said "beautiful," "elegant," "fragile," "peaceful," "pretty," and "slender," and the Spanish speakers said "big," "dangerous," "long," "strong," "sturdy," and "towering." This was the case even though all testing was done in English, a language without grammatical gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/boroditsky09/boroditsky09_index.html |title=How Does Our Language Shape The Way We Think? |publisher=Edge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of studies conducted by Gary Lupyan, people were asked to look at a series of images of imaginary aliens.&lt;ref&gt;http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/papers/lupyan_rakison_mcClelland_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Whether each alien was friendly or hostile was determined by certain subtle features but participants were not told what these were. They had to guess whether each alien was friendly or hostile, and after each response they were told if they were correct or not, helping them learn the subtle cues that distinguished friend from foe. A quarter of the participants were told in advance that the friendly aliens were called "leebish" and the hostile ones "grecious", while another quarter were told the opposite. For the rest, the aliens remained nameless. It was found that participants who were given names for the aliens learned to categorize the aliens far more quickly, reaching 80 per cent accuracy in less than half the time taken by those not told the names. By the end of the test, those told the names could correctly categorize 88 per cent of aliens, compared to just 80 per cent for the rest. It was concluded that naming objects helps us categorize and memorize them.

In another series of experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102193358/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lupyan/web/lupyan_2008_jepG.pdf |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of people was asked to view furniture from an [[IKEA]] catalog. Half the time they were asked to label the object – whether it was a chair or lamp, for example – while the rest of the time they had to say whether or not they liked it. It was found that when asked to label items, people were later less likely to recall the specific details of products, such as whether a chair had arms or not. It was concluded that labeling objects helps our minds build a prototype of the typical object in the group at the expense of individual features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727761.500-whats-in-a-name-the-words-behind-thought.html?full=true |title=What's in a name?

=== Social interaction and language ===
A common claim is that language is governed by social conventions. Questions inevitably arise on surrounding topics. One question is, "What exactly is a convention, and how do we study it?", and second, "To what extent do conventions even matter in the study of language?" [[David Kellogg Lewis]] proposed a worthy reply to the first question by expounding the view that a convention is a ''rationally self-perpetuating regularity in behavior''. However, this view seems to compete to some extent with the Gricean view of speaker's meaning, requiring either one (or both) to be weakened if both are to be taken as true.&lt;ref name=BlackwellPhil /&gt;

Some have questioned whether or not conventions are relevant to the study of meaning at all. [[Noam Chomsky]] proposed that the study of language could be done in terms of the I-Language, or internal language of persons. If this is so, then it undermines the pursuit of explanations in terms of conventions, and relegates such explanations to the domain of "meta-semantics". ''Metasemantics'' is a term used by philosopher of language Robert Stainton to describe all those fields that attempt to explain how semantic facts arise.&lt;ref name="Stainton" /&gt; One fruitful source of research involves investigation into the social conditions that give rise to, or are associated with, meanings and languages. ''[[Etymology]]'' (the study of the origins of words) and ''[[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]]'' (philosophical argumentation over what makes "good grammar", relative to a particular language) are two other examples of fields that are taken to be meta-semantic.

Not surprisingly, many separate (but related) fields have investigated the topic of linguistic convention within their own research paradigms. The presumptions that prop up each theoretical view are of interest to the philosopher of language. For instance, one of the major fields of sociology, [[symbolic interactionism]], is based on the insight that human social organization is based almost entirely on the use of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Teevan, James J. and W.E. Hewitt. (2001) Introduction to Sociology: A Canadian Focus. Prentice Hall: Toronto. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, any explanation of a [[social structure]] (like an [[institution]]) would need to account for the shared meanings which create and sustain the structure.

[[Rhetoric]] is the study of the particular words that people use to achieve the proper emotional and rational effect in the listener, be it to persuade, provoke, endear, or teach. Some relevant applications of the field include the examination of [[propaganda]] and [[didactic]]ism, the examination of the purposes of [[Profanity|swearing]] and [[pejorative]]s (especially how it influences the behavior of others, and defines relationships), or the effects of gendered language. It can also be used to study [[linguistic transparency]] (or speaking in an accessible manner), as well as [[performative]] utterances and the various tasks that language can perform (called "speech acts"). It also has applications to the study and interpretation of law, and helps give insight to the logical concept of the [[domain of discourse]].

[[Literary theory]] is a discipline that some literary theorists claim overlaps with the philosophy of language. It emphasizes the methods that readers and critics use in understanding a text. This field, an outgrowth of the study of how to properly interpret messages, is unsurprisingly closely tied to the ancient discipline of [[hermeneutics]].

==Language and Continental philosophy==
In [[Continental philosophy]], language is not studied as a separate discipline, as it is in [[analytic philosophy]]. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[semiotics]], [[hermeneutics]], Heideggerean [[ontology]], [[existentialism]], [[structuralism]], [[deconstruction]] and [[critical theory]]. The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as "[[logos]]", meaning discourse or dialectic. Language and concepts are also seen as having been formed by history and politics, or even by historical philosophy itself.

The field of hermeneutics, and the theory of interpretation in general, has played a significant role in 20th century Continental philosophy of language and [[ontology]] beginning with [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger combines phenomenology with the hermeneutics of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Heidegger believed language was one of the most important concepts for ''[[Dasein]]''. Heidegger believed that language today is worn out because of overuse of important words, and would be inadequate for in-depth study of Being (''Sein''). For example, ''Sein'' (''being''), the word itself, is saturated with multiple meanings. Thus, he invented new vocabulary and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|linguistic styles]], based on [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[Etymology|etymological]] word relations, to disambiguate commonly used words. He avoided words like consciousness, ego, human, nature, etc. and instead talked holistically of [[Being-in-the-world]], [[Dasein]].

With such new concepts as ''Being-in-the-world'', Heidegger constructs his theory of language, centered on [[Speech communication|speech]]. He believed speech (talking, listening, silence) was the most essential and pure form of language. Heidegger claims writing is only a supplement to speech, because even a reader constructs or contributes one's own "talk" while reading. The most important feature of language is its ''projectivity'', the idea that language is prior to human speech. This means that when one is "thrown" into the world, his existence is characterized from the beginning by a certain pre-comprehension of the world. However, it is only after naming, or "articulation of intelligibility", can one have primary access to ''Dasein'' and ''Being-in-the-World''.&lt;ref name="Being"&gt;Heidegger, Martin.(1996) ''Being and Time''. New York: Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-19770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] expanded on these ideas of Heidegger and proposed a complete hermeneutic ontology. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer describes language as "the medium in which substantive understanding and agreement take place between two people."&lt;ref name="Gadamer"&gt;Gadamer, Hans G. (1989)''Truth and Method'', New York: Crossroad, 2nd ed., {{ISBN|0-8264-0401-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gadamer claims that the world is linguistically constituted, and cannot exist apart from language. For example, monuments and statues cannot communicate without the aid of language. Gadamer also claims that every language constitutes a world-view, because the linguistic nature of the world frees each individual from an objective environment: "... the fact that we have a world at all depends upon [language]  and presents itself in it. The world as world exists for man as for no other creature in the world."&lt;ref name="Gadamer" /&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]], on the other hand, proposed a hermeneutics which, reconnecting with the original Greek sense of the term, emphasized the discovery of  hidden meanings in the equivocal terms (or "symbols") of [[ordinary language]]. Other philosophers who have worked in this tradition include [[Luigi Pareyson]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="Volli"&gt;Volli, U. (2000) ''Manuale di Semiotica''. Rome-Bari: Editori Laterza. {{ISBN|88-420-5953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Semiotics]] is the study of the transmission, reception and meaning of signs and symbols in general. In this field, human language (both natural and artificial) is just one among many ways that humans (and other conscious beings) are able to communicate. It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others. Every object, every person, every event, and every force communicates (or ''signifies'') continuously. The ringing of a telephone for example, ''is'' the telephone. The smoke that I see on the horizon is the sign that there is a fire. The smoke signifies. The things of the world, in this vision, seem to be ''labeled'' precisely for intelligent beings who only need to interpret them in the way that humans do. Everything has meaning. True communication, including the use of human language, however, requires someone (a ''sender'') who sends a ''message'', or ''text'', in some code to someone else (a ''receiver''). Language is studied only insofar as it is one of these forms (the most sophisticated form) of communication. Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Roland Barthes]], and [[Roman Jakobson]]. In modern times, its best-known figures include [[Umberto Eco]], [[A.J. Greimas]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Tullio De Mauro]].&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; Investigations on signs in non-human communications are subject to [[biosemiotics]], a field founded in the late 20th century by [[Thomas Sebeok]] and [[Thure von Uexküll]].

==Problems in the philosophy of language==

===Vagueness===
One issue that has troubled philosophers of language and logic is the problem of the [[vagueness]] of words. The specific instances of vagueness that most interest philosophers of language are those where the existence of "borderline cases" makes it seemingly impossible to say whether a predicate is true or false. Classic examples are "is tall" or "is bald", where it cannot be said that some borderline case (some given person) is tall or not-tall. In consequence, vagueness gives rise to the [[paradox of the heap]]. Many theorists have attempted to solve the paradox by way of ''n''-valued logics, such as [[fuzzy logic]], which have radically departed from classical two-valued logics.&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, Roy. (2006) "Vagueness". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/vagueness/#3&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem of universals and composition ===
{{Further|problem of universals}}
One debate that has captured the interest of many philosophers is the debate over the meaning of ''[[universals]]''. One might ask, for example, "When people say the word ''rocks'', what is it that the word represents?" Two different answers have emerged to this question. Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called "rocks". Others have said that the word stands for some collection of particular, individual rocks that we associate with merely a nomenclature. The former position has been called ''[[philosophical realism]]'', and the latter ''[[nominalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue here can be explicated if we examine the proposition "Socrates is a Man".

From the radical realist's perspective, the connection between S and M is a connection between two abstract entities. There is an entity, "man", and an entity, "Socrates". These two things connect in some way or overlap.

From a nominalist's perspective, the connection between S and M is the connection between a particular entity (Socrates) and a vast collection of particular things (men). To say that Socrates is a man is to say that Socrates is a part of the class of "men". Another perspective is to consider "man" to be a ''property'' of the entity, "Socrates".

There is a third way, between nominalism and radical realism, usually called "moderate realism" and attributed to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Moderate realists hold that "man" refers to a real essence or form that is really present and identical in Socrates and all other men, but "man" does not exist as a separate and distinct entity. This is a realist position, because "Man" is real, insofar as it really exists in all men; but it is a moderate realism, because "Man" is not an entity separate from the men it informs.

=== Nature of language ===
Many philosophical discussions of language begin by clarifying terminology. One item which has undergone  significant scrutiny is the idea of language itself. Those philosophers who have set themselves to the task ask two important questions: "What is language in general?" and "What is a particular, individual language?"

Some [[semiotic]] outlooks have stressed that language is the mere manipulation and use of symbols in order to draw attention to signified content. If this were so, then humans would not be the sole possessors of language skills.&lt;ref name="Volli" /&gt; On the other hand, many works by linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] have emphasized the role of syntax as a characteristic of any language.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1985)''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory/'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;

More puzzling is the question of what it is that distinguishes one particular language from another. What is it that makes "English" English? What's the difference between Spanish and French? Chomsky has indicated that the search for what it means to be a language must begin with the study of the internal language of persons, or [[I-language]]s, which are based upon certain rules (or principles and parameters) which generate grammars. This view is supported in part by the conviction that there is no clear, general, and principled difference between one language and the next, and which may apply across the field of all languages. Other attempts, which he dubs ''E-languages,'' have tried to explain a language as usage within a specific speech community with a specific set of well-formed utterances in mind (markedly associated with linguists like Bloomfield).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. "Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin, and Use." ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal versus informal approaches ===
Another of the questions that has divided philosophers of language is the extent to which formal logic can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and understanding of natural languages. While most philosophers, including [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], have been more or less skeptical about formalizing natural languages, many of them developed formal languages for use in the sciences or formalized ''parts'' of natural language for investigation. Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, [[Richard Montague]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]].&lt;ref&gt;Partee, B. [http://people.umass.edu/partee/docs/Richard_Montague_by_%20Partee_05.pdf Richard Montague (1930–1971)]. In Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 2nd Ed., ed. Keith Brown. Oxford: Elsevier. V. 8, pp. 255–57, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other side of the divide, and especially prominent in the 1950s and 60s, were the so-called "Ordinary language philosophers". Philosophers such as [[P. F. Strawson]], [[John Langshaw Austin]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]] stressed the importance of studying natural language without regard to the truth-conditions of sentences and the references of terms. They did not believe that the social and practical dimensions of linguistic meaning could be captured by any attempts at formalization using the tools of logic. Logic is one thing and language is something entirely different. What is important is not expressions themselves but what people use them to do in communication.&lt;ref&gt;Lycan, W. G. (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j94wa55sCU8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophy of Language: A Contemporary Introduction]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Austin developed a theory of [[speech act]]s, which described the kinds of things which can be done with a sentence (assertion, command, inquiry, exclamation) in different contexts of use on different occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Austin |first=J.L. |year=1962 |title=[[How to Do Things With Words]]: The William James Lectures delivered at Harvard University in 1955 |editor=ed. J.O. Urmson. |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=0-674-41152-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strawson argued that the truth-table semantics of the logical connectives (e.g., &lt;math&gt; \land &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \lor &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow &lt;/math&gt;) do not capture the meanings of their natural language counterparts ("and", "or" and "if-then").&lt;ref&gt;P. F. Strawson, "On Referring". ''Mind'', New Series, Vol. 59, No. 235 (Jul., 1950), pp. 320–344&lt;/ref&gt; While the "ordinary language" movement basically died out in the 1970s, its influence was crucial to the development of the fields of speech-act theory and the study of [[pragmatics]].  Many of its ideas have been absorbed by theorists such as [[Kent Bach]], [[Robert Brandom]], [[Paul Horwich]] and [[Stephen Neale]].&lt;ref name="Brand" /&gt; In recent work, the division between semantics and pragmatics has become a lively topic of discussion at the interface of philosophy and linguistics, for instance in work by Sperber and Wilson, Carston and Levinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32589501|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Sperber,|first=Dan|last2=Wilson|first2=Deirdre|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=|year=|isbn=9780631198789|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=32589501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49525903|title=Thoughts and utterances : the pragmatics of explicit communication|last=Robyn.|first=Carston,|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Pub|isbn=9780631178910|location=Oxford, U.K.|oclc=49525903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45733473|title=Presumptive meanings : the theory of generalized conversational implicature|last=C.|first=Levinson, Stephen|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262621304|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=45733473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While keeping these traditions in mind, the question of whether or not there is any grounds for conflict between the formal and informal approaches is far from being decided. Some theorists, like [[Paul Grice]], have been skeptical of any claims that there is a substantial conflict between logic and natural language.&lt;ref&gt;Grice, Paul. "Logic and Conversation". ''Perspectives in the Philosophy of Language.'' (2000) ed. Robert Stainton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation and interpretation===
Translation and interpretation are two other problems that philosophers of language have attempted to confront. In the 1950s, [[W.V. Quine]] argued for the indeterminacy of meaning and reference based on the principle of ''[[radical translation]]''. In ''[[Word and Object]]'', Quine asks readers to imagine a situation in which  they are confronted with a previously undocumented, group of indigenous people where they must attempt to make sense of the utterances and gestures that its members make. This is the situation of radical translation.&lt;ref name="WVQ"&gt;Quine, W.V. (1960) ''Word and Object''. MIT Press; {{ISBN|0-262-67001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that, in such a situation, it is impossible ''in principle'' to be absolutely certain of the meaning or reference that a speaker of the indigenous peoples language attaches to an utterance. For example, if a speaker sees a rabbit and says "gavagai", is she referring to the whole rabbit, to the rabbit's tail, or to a temporal part of the rabbit. All that can be done is to examine the utterance as a part of the overall linguistic behaviour of the individual, and then use these observations to interpret the meaning of all other utterances. From this basis, one can form a manual of translation. But, since reference is indeterminate, there will be many such manuals, no one of which is more correct than the others. For Quine, as for Wittgenstein and Austin, meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but is rather something that, if it can be attributed at all, can only be attributed to a whole language.&lt;ref name="WVQ" /&gt; The resulting view is called ''[[semantic holism]]''.

Inspired by Quine's discussion, [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] extended the idea of radical translation to the interpretation of utterances and behavior within a single linguistic community. He dubbed this notion ''radical interpretation''. He suggested that the meaning that any individual ascribed to a sentence could only be determined by attributing meanings to many, perhaps all, of the individual's assertions, as well as their mental states and attitudes.&lt;ref name="TandI" /&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|History of linguistics}}

===Ancient philosophy===
Linguistic speculation in [[Indian subcontinent|India]] is attested since the [[Vedic period]] ([[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]]), beginning with the deification of ''[[vāk]]'' "speech" and the role of language (utterance, [[shabda]]) in [[Kalpa (ritual)|ritual]]. [[Vyākaraṇa|Sanskrit grammatical tradition]] gives rise to linguistic philosophy beginning in the final centuries BC and early centuries AD, notably in the philosophical schools of [[Nyaya]] and [[Mimamsa]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the West, inquiry into language stretches back to the 5th century BC with [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, S. "History of the Philosophy of Language". In ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. ed. Ted Honderich. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both in India and in Greece, linguistic speculation predates the emergence of [[grammar|grammatical traditions]] of systematic description of language, which emerged around the 5th century BC in India (see [[Yāska]]), and around the 3rd century BC in Greece (see [[Rhianus]]).

In the dialogue ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', Plato considered the question of whether the names of things were determined by convention or by nature. He criticized [[conventionalism]] because it led to the bizarre consequence that anything can be conventionally denominated by any name. Hence, it cannot account for the correct or incorrect application of a name. He claimed that there was a natural correctness to names. To do this, he pointed out that [[compound words]] and phrases have a range of correctness. He also argued that primitive names had a natural correctness, because each [[phoneme]] represented basic ideas or sentiments. For example, for Plato the letter ''l'' and its sound represented the idea of softness. However, by the end of the ''Cronic'', he had admitted that some social conventions were also involved, and that there were faults in the idea that phonemes had individual meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Cratylus''(c. 360 BCE) Series: Cambridge Studies in the Dialogues of Plato. Trans. David Sedley. Cambridge:University of Cambridge Press. 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58492-0}} also available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1616 Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle interested himself with the issues of [[logic]], categories, and meaning creation. He separated all things into categories of [[species]] and [[genus]]. He thought that the meaning of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] was established through an abstraction of the similarities between various individual things. This theory later came to be called ''nominalism''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven K. Strange, (1992) ''Porphyry: On Aristotle, Categories''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. {{ISBN|0-8014-2816-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Aristotle took these similarities to be constituted by a real commonality of form, he is more often considered a proponent of "moderate realism".

The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers made important contributions to the analysis of grammar, distinguishing five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, appellatives (names or [[epithet]]s), [[conjunctions]] and [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. They also developed a sophisticated doctrine of the ''lektón'' associated with each sign of a language, but distinct from both the sign itself and the thing to which it refers. This ''lektón'' was the meaning (or sense) of every term. The ''lektón'' of a sentence is what we would now call its [[proposition]]. Only propositions were considered "[[truth-bearer]]s" or "truth-vehicles" (i.e., they could be called true or false) while sentences were simply their vehicles of expression. Different ''lektá'' could also express things besides propositions, such as commands, questions and exclamations.&lt;ref&gt;Mates, B. (1953) ''Stoic Logic''. Berkeley: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-02368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval philosophy===
Medieval philosophers were greatly interested in the subtleties of language and its usage. For many [[Scholasticism|scholastics]], this interest was provoked by the necessity of translating [[Greek language|Greek]] texts into [[Latin]]. There were several noteworthy philosophers of language in the medieval period. According to Peter J. King, (although this has been disputed), [[Peter Abelard]] anticipated the modern ideas of ''[[sense and reference]]''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Peter. ''Peter Abelard.'' Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abelard/#4&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[William of Ockham]]'s ''[[Sum of Logic|Summa Logicae]]'' brought forward one of the first serious proposals for codifying a mental language.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, D. (1999) "Is there Synonymy in Occam's Mental Language?". Published in ''The Cambridge Companion to Ockham'', edited by Paul Vincent Spade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58244-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholastics of the high medieval period, such as Ockham and [[John Duns Scotus]], considered logic to be a ''scientia sermocinalis'' (science of language). The result of their studies was the elaboration of linguistic-philosophical notions whose complexity and subtlety has only recently come to be appreciated. Many of the most interesting problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers. The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of ''syncategorematic'' words such as ''and'', ''or'', ''not'', ''if'', and ''every''. The study of ''categorematic'' words (or ''terms'') and their properties was also developed greatly.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;Marconi, D. "Storia della Filosofia del Linguaggio". In ''L'Enciclopedia Garzantina della Filosofia''. ed. Gianni Vattimo. Milan: Garzanti Editori. 1981. {{ISBN|88-11-50515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major developments of the scholastics in this area was the doctrine of the ''suppositio''.&lt;ref name="KKP"&gt;[[Norman Kretzmann|Kretzmann, N.]], [[Anthony Kenny]] &amp; [[Jan Pinborg]]. (1982) ''Cambridge History of Later Medieval Philosophy''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-22605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context. It can be ''proper'' or ''improper'' (as when it is used in [[metaphor]], [[metonym]]s and other figures of speech). A proper suppositio, in turn, can be either formal or material accordingly when it refers to its usual non-linguistic referent (as in "Charles is a man"), or to itself as a linguistic entity (as in "''Charles'' has seven letters"). Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between [[use–mention distinction|use and mention]], and between language and metalanguage.&lt;ref name="KKP" /&gt;

There is a tradition called speculative grammar which existed from the 11th to the 13th century.  Leading scholars included, among others, Martin of Dace and Thomas of Erfurth.

===Modern philosophy===
Linguists of the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods such as [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]], [[Athanasius Kircher]] and [[John Wilkins]] were infatuated with the idea of a [[philosophical language]] reversing the [[confusion of tongues]], influenced  by the gradual discovery of [[Chinese character]]s and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] (''[[Hieroglyphica]]''). This thought parallels the idea that there might be a universal language of music.

European scholarship began to absorb the [[Vyākaraṇa|Indian linguistic tradition]] only from the mid-18th century, pioneered by [[Jean François Pons]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] (the ''editio princeps'' of [[Varadarāja]], a 17th-century [[Sanskrit]] grammarian, dating to 1849).

In the early 19th century, the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] insisted that language ought to play a larger role in [[Western philosophy]]. He argues that philosophy has not sufficiently focused on the role language plays in cognition and that future philosophy ought to proceed with a conscious focus on language:

{{quote|If the claim of philosophers to be unbiased were all it pretends to be, it would also have to take account of language and its whole significance in relation to speculative philosophy&amp;nbsp;... Language is partly something originally given, partly that which develops freely. And just as the individual can never reach the point at which he becomes absolutely independent&amp;nbsp;... so too with language.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In Cloeren, H. ''Language and Thought''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contemporary philosophy===
{{also|Ordinary language philosophy}}
The phrase "[[linguistic turn]]" was used to describe the noteworthy emphasis that contemporary philosophers put upon language.

Language began to play a central role in Western philosophy in the early 20th century. One of the central figures involved in this development was the German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]], whose work on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language in the late 19th century influenced the work of 20-century [[analytic philosopher]]s [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. The philosophy of language became so pervasive that for a time, in [[analytic philosophy]] circles, philosophy as a whole was understood to be a matter of philosophy of language.

In [[Continental philosophy]], the foundation work was [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'', published posthumously in 1916.

In [[phonetics]] and [[linguistics]], a '''phone''' is any distinct speech sound or gesture, regardless of whether the exact sound is critical to the meanings of words.

In contrast, a [[phoneme]] is a speech sound in a given language that, if swapped with another phoneme, would change the meaning of the word. Phones are absolute and are not specific to any language, but phonemes can be discussed only in reference to specific languages.

For example, the English words ''kid'' and ''kit'' end with two distinct phonemes, and swapping one for the other would change the word's meaning. However, the difference between the /p/ sounds in ''pun'' ([pʰ], with [[aspirated consonant|aspiration]]) and ''spun'' ([p], without aspiration) never affects the meaning of a word in English. Thus, [pʰ] and [p] are two distinct phones but not distinct phonemes in English.

By contrast, swapping the same two sounds in [[Hindi]] or [[Urdu]] can change one word into another: [pʰal] (फल) means 'fruit', and [pal] (पल) means 'moment' {{harv|CIIL|2008}}. The sounds are then different phonemes.

As can be seen in those examples, phonemes, rather than phones, are the features of speech that are reflected (more or less imperfectly) in a writing system.

==Overview==
In the context of spoken languages, a phone is an unanalyzed sound of a language {{harv|Loos|1997}}. A phone is a speech [[segment (linguistics)|segment]] that possesses distinct physical or perceptual properties and serves as the basic unit of phonetic speech analysis. Phones are generally either [[vowel]]s or [[consonant]]s.

A [[phonetic transcription]] (based on phones) is enclosed within [[square bracket]]s ([&amp;nbsp;]) rather than the [[slash (punctuation)|slashes]] (/&amp;nbsp;/) of a phonemic transcription (based on phonemes). Phones (and often phonemes also) are commonly represented by using symbols of the IPA.

For example, the [[English phonology|English]] word ''spin'' consists of four phones, [s], [p], [ɪ] and [n], and the word thus has the phonetic representation [spɪn]. The word ''pin'' has three phones; in that word, the initial sound is [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and so can be represented as [pʰ]; the word's phonetic representation would then be [pʰɪn]. (The precise features that are shown in a phonetic representation depend on whether a narrow or [[broad transcription]] is being used and the features that the writer wishes to draw attention in a particular context.)

When phones are considered to be realizations of the same phoneme, they are called [[allophone]]s of that phoneme (more information on the methods of making such assignments can be found under [[phoneme]]). In English, for example, [p] and [pʰ] are considered allophones of a single phoneme, which is written /p/. The phonemic transcriptions of those two words is thus /spɪn/ and /pɪn/, and aspiration no longer being shown since it is not [[Phonemic contrast|distinctive]].

In [[articulatory phonetics]], the '''place of articulation''' (also '''point of articulation''') of a [[consonant]] is the point of contact where an [[wikt:obstruction|obstruction]] occurs in the [[vocal tract]] between an '''articulatory gesture''', an active articulator (typically some part of the tongue), and a passive location (typically some part of the roof of the mouth). Along with the [[manner of articulation]] and the [[phonation]], it gives the consonant its distinctive sound.

The terminology in this article has been developed for precisely describing all the consonants in all the world's spoken languages. No known language distinguishes all of the places described here so less precision is needed to distinguish the sounds of a particular language.

==Overview==
The human voice produces sounds in the following manner:{{sfnp|Titze|2008}}{{page missing|date=August 2018}}{{sfnp|Titze|1994}}{{page missing|date=August 2018}}

#[[Air pressure]] from the [[human lung|lungs]] creates a steady flow of air through the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] (windpipe), larynx (voice box) and [[human pharynx|pharynx]] (back of the throat).
#The [[vocal folds]] in the larynx vibrate, creating fluctuations in air pressure, known as [[sound wave]]s.
#[[Acoustic resonance#Resonance of a tube of air|Resonances]] in the vocal tract modify these waves according to the position and shape of the lips, jaw, tongue, [[soft palate]], and other speech organs, creating [[formant]] regions and so different qualities of [[sonorant]] ([[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]) sound.
#Mouth and nose openings radiate the sound waves into the environment.

==The larynx==
The ''[[larynx]]'' or ''voice box'' is a cylindrical framework of [[cartilage]] that serves to anchor the [[vocal folds]]. When the [[muscle]]s of the vocal folds contract, the airflow from the lungs is impeded until the vocal folds are forced apart again by the increasing air pressure from the lungs. The process continues in a periodic cycle that is felt as a vibration (buzzing). In singing, the vibration [[frequency]] of the vocal folds determines the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of the sound produced. Voiced [[phoneme]]s such as the pure vowels are, by definition, distinguished by the buzzing sound of this periodic [[oscillation]] of the vocal cords.

The lips of the mouth can be used in a similar way to create a similar sound, as any [[toddler]] or [[trumpeter]] can demonstrate. A rubber [[Balloon#Balloons as decoration or entertainment|balloon]], inflated but not tied off and stretched tightly across the neck produces a squeak or buzz, depending on the [[tension (physics)|tension]] across the neck and the level of [[pressure]] inside the balloon. Similar actions with similar results occur when the vocal cords are contracted or relaxed across the larynx.

==Place of articulation (passive)==
The passive place of articulation is the place on the more stationary part of the vocal tract where the articulation occurs and can be anywhere from the lips, upper teeth, gums, or roof of the mouth to the back of the throat. Although it is a continuum, there are several contrastive areas so languages may distinguish consonants by articulating them in different areas, but few languages contrast two sounds within the same area unless there is some other feature which contrasts as well.  The following areas are contrastive:
*The upper lip (''{{lcons|labial}}'')
*The upper teeth, either on the edge of the teeth or inner surface (''{{lcons|dental}}'')
*The [[alveolar ridge]], the gum line just behind the teeth (''{{lcons|alveolar}}'')
*The back of the alveolar ridge (''{{lcons|post-alveolar}}'')
*The [[hard palate]] on the roof of the mouth (''{{lcons|palatal}}'')
*The [[soft palate]] further back on the roof of the mouth (''{{lcons|velar}}'')
*The [[uvula]] hanging down at the entrance to the throat (''{{lcons|uvular}}'')
*The throat itself, a.k.a. the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] (''{{lcons|pharyngeal}}'')
*The [[epiglottis]] at the entrance to the windpipe, above the voice box (''{{lcons|epiglottal}}'')

The regions are not strictly separated. For instance, in some sounds in many languages, the surface of the tongue contacts a relatively large area from the back of the upper teeth to the alveolar ridge, which is common enough to have received its own name, ''{{lcons|denti-alveolar}}''. Likewise, the alveolar and post-alveolar regions merge into each other, as do the hard and soft palate, the soft palate and the uvula, and all adjacent regions. Terms like ''pre-velar'' (intermediate between palatal and velar), ''post-velar'' (between velar and uvular), and ''upper'' vs. ''lower'' pharyngeal may be used to specify more precisely where an articulation takes place. However, although a language may contrast pre-velar and post-velar sounds, it does not also contrast them with palatal and uvular sounds (of the same type of consonant) so contrasts are limited to the number above, if not always their exact location.

==Place of articulation (active)==
The articulatory gesture of the active place of articulation involves the more mobile part of the vocal tract, typically some part of the tongue or lips. The following areas are known to be contrastive:
*The lower lip (''{{lcons|labial}}'')
*Various parts of the front of the tongue (''{{lcons|coronal}}''):
**The [[Tongue tip|tip of the tongue]] (''{{lcons|apical}}'')
**The upper front surface of the tongue just behind the tip, called the [[Tongue blade|''blade'']] of the tongue (''{{lcons|laminal}}'')
**The surface of the tongue ''under'' the tip (''{{lcons|subapical}}'')
*The body of the tongue (''{{lcons|dorsal}}'')
*The base {{aka}} root of the tongue and the throat (''{{lcons|pharyngeal}}'')

In [[bilabial consonants]], both lips move so the articulatory gesture brings the lips together, but by convention, the lower lip is said to be active and the upper lip passive. Similarly, in [[linguolabial consonant]]s the tongue contacts the upper lip with the upper lip actively moving down to meet the tongue; nonetheless, the tongue is conventionally said to be active and the lip passive if for no other reason than that the parts of the mouth below the vocal tract are typically active, and those above the vocal tract are typically passive.

In dorsal gestures, different parts of the body of the tongue contact different parts of the roof of the mouth, but it cannot be independently controlled so they are all subsumed under the term ''dorsal''. That is unlike coronal gestures involving the front of the tongue, which is more flexible.

The epiglottis may be active, contacting the pharynx, or passive, being contacted by the aryepiglottal folds. Distinctions made in these laryngeal areas are very difficult to observe and are the subject of ongoing investigation, and several still-unidentified combinations are thought possible.

The glottis acts upon itself. There is a sometimes fuzzy line between glottal, aryepiglottal, and epiglottal consonants and [[phonation]], which uses these same areas.

Unlike the passive articulation, which is a continuum, there are five discrete active articulators: the lip (''[[labial consonant]]s''), the flexible front of the tongue (''[[coronal consonant]]s'': laminal, apical, and subapical), the middle–back of the tongue (''[[dorsal consonant]]s''), the root of the tongue together with the [[epiglottis]] (''[[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]]'' or ''radical consonants''), and the [[glottis]] (''[[glottal consonant]]s''). The articulators are discrete in that they can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called ''coarticulation'' (see below). The distinction, however, between the various coronal articulations, laminal, apical, and subapical is a continuum, without clear boundaries.

==Table of gestures and passive articulators and resulting places of articulation==
The following table shows the possible combinations of active and passive articulators.

The possible locations for [[sibilant]]s as well as non-sibilants to occur are indicated in &lt;span style="border: 1px dashed red;"&gt;dashed red&lt;/span&gt;. For sibilants, there are additional complications involving [[tongue shape]]; see the article on [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]]s for a chart of possible articulations.

A precise vocabulary of compounding the two places of articulation is sometimes seen. However, it is usually reduced to the passive articulation, which is generally sufficient. Thus ''dorsal–palatal'', ''dorsal–velar'', and ''dorsal–uvular'' are usually just called "palatal", "velar", and "uvular". If there is ambiguity, additional terms have been invented, so ''subapical–palatal'' is more commonly called "retroflex".

''NOTE:'' Additional shades of passive articulation are sometimes specified using ''pre-'' or ''post-'', for example ''prepalatal'' (near the border between the [[postalveolar]] region and the [[hard palate]]; ''prevelar'' (at the back of the [[hard palate]], also ''post-palatal'' or even ''medio-palatal'' for the middle of the hard palate); or ''postvelar'' (near the border of the [[soft palate]] and the [[uvula]]). They can be useful in the precise description of sounds that are articulated somewhat farther forward or back than a prototypical consonant; for this purpose, the "fronted" and "retracted" IPA diacritics can be used. However, no additional shade is needed to phonemically distinguish two consonants in a single language.{{efn|Occasionally claims to the contrary are met. For example, some dialects of [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] are said to distinguish palatal, prevelar and velar consonants. In reality, the dialects distinguish [[palato-alveolar]] ([[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[postalveolar]]), {{lcons|palatal}} and {{lcons|velar}} consonants; the claim is based on the imprecise usage of "palatal" to mean "palato-alveolar".}}

==Homorganic consonants==
{{main|Homorganic consonant}}
Consonants that have the same place of articulation, such as the alveolar sounds {{IPA|/n, t, d, s, z, l/}} in [[English language|English]], are said to be [[Homorganic consonants|''homorganic'']]. Similarly, labial {{IPA|/p, b, m/}} and velar {{IPA|/k, ɡ, ŋ/}} are homorganic. A homorganic nasal rule, an instance of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], operates in many languages, where a nasal consonant must be homorganic with a following stop. We see this with English ''i'''n'''tolerable'' but ''i'''m'''plausible''; another example is found in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], where the present tense of ''ba'' "hide" is ''mba'' "is hiding", while the present of ''sun'' "sleep" is ''nsun'' "is sleeping".

==Central and lateral articulation==
{{main|Lateral consonant}}
The tongue contacts the mouth with a surface that has two dimensions: length and width. So far, only points of articulation along its length have been considered. However, articulation varies along its width as well. When the airstream is directed down the center of the tongue, the consonant is said to be ''central''. If, however, it is deflected off to one side, escaping between the side of the tongue and the side teeth, it is said to be ''[[lateral consonant|lateral]]''. Nonetheless, for simplicity's sake the place of articulation is assumed to be the point along the length of the tongue, and the consonant may in addition be said to be central or lateral. That is, a consonant may be lateral alveolar, like English {{IPA|/l/}} (the tongue contacts the alveolar ridge, but allows air to flow off to the side), or lateral palatal, like Castilian Spanish ''ll'' {{IPA|/ʎ/}}. Some [[Indigenous Australian languages]] contrast dental, alveolar, retroflex, and palatal laterals, and many [[Native American languages]] have lateral [[fricative]]s and [[affricate]]s as well.

==Coarticulation==
Some languages have consonants with two simultaneous places of articulation, which is called [[co-articulated consonant|coarticulation]]. When these are [[doubly articulated consonant|doubly articulated]], the articulators must be independently movable, and therefore there may be only one each from the major categories ''labial, coronal, dorsal'' and ''pharyngeal''.

The only common doubly articulated consonants are [[labial–velar consonant|labial–velar]] stops like {{IPA|[k͡p]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ͡b]}} and less commonly {{IPA|[ŋ͡m]}}, which are found throughout [[Western Africa]] and [[Central Africa]]. Other combinations are rare but include [[labial–alveolar consonant|labial–(post)alveolar stops]] {{IPA|[t͡p d͡b n͡m]}}, found as distinct consonants only in [[Yélî Dnye language|a single language in New Guinea]], and a [[uvular–epiglottal consonant|uvular–epiglottal]] stop, {{IPA|[q͡ʡ]}}, found in [[Somali language|Somali]].

More commonly, coarticulation involves [[secondary articulation]] of an [[approximant consonant|approximantic]] nature. Then, both articulations can be similar such as labialized labial {{IPA|[mʷ]}} or palatalized velar {{IPA|[kʲ]}}. That is the case of English {{IPA|[w]}}, which is a velar consonant with secondary labial articulation.

Common coarticulations include these:

* [[Labialization]], rounding the lips while producing the obstruction, as in {{IPA|[kʷ]}} and English {{IPA|[w]}}.
* [[Palatalization (phonetics)|Palatalization]], raising the body of the tongue toward the hard palate while producing the obstruction, as in [[Russian language|Russian]] {{IPA|[tʲ]}} and {{IPA|[ɕ]}}.
* [[Velarization]], raising the back of the tongue toward the soft palate ([[soft palate|velum]]), as in the English dark el, {{IPA|[lˠ]}} (also transcribed {{IPA|[ɫ]}}).
* [[Pharyngealization]], constriction of the throat ([[human pharynx|pharynx]]), such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]] "emphatic" {{IPA|[tˤ]}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">'''Political jurisprudence''' is a [[legal theory]] that some [[judicial]] decisions are motivated more by [[politics]] than by unbiased judgment. According to Professor [[Martin Shapiro]] of [[University of California, Berkeley]], who first noted the theory in 1964: "The core of  political [[jurisprudence]] is a vision of courts as political agencies and judges as political actors." Legal decisions are no longer focused on a judge's analytical analysis (as in [[Analytical jurisprudence]]), but rather it is the judges themselves that become the focus for determining how the decision was reached. Political jurisprudence advocates that judges are not machines but are influenced and swayed by the political system and by their own personal beliefs of how the law ''should'' be decided. That is not to say necessarily that judges ''arbitrarily'' make decisions they personally feel should be right without regard to [[stare decisis]]. Instead they are making decisions based on their political, legal, and personal beliefs ''as it relates'' to the [[law]]. Deeply, and with more implication for the society, the decisions of the judges is not only modified from the politics, but modify itself the politics and the process of law making in a so influent way, that we can say that the policy-making is "judicialized".&lt;ref&gt;Stone Sweet, Alec.

'''''Red Heat: Conspiracy, Murder, and the Cold War in the Caribbean''''' is a historical study of the political scene in the [[Caribbean]] during the 1950s and 1960s, written by the British historian [[Alex von Tunzelmann]] and first published in 2011 by [[Henry Holt and Company]]. Educated at [[Oxford University]], Von Tunzelmann (1977-) had previously published a study of the collapse of British India, entitled ''[[Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire]]'' (2007).

''Red Heat'' explores the political regimes of three presidents who each ruled over a Caribbean nation during the 1950s and 1960s; [[François Duvalier]] of Haiti, [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the Dominican Republic and [[Fidel Castro]] of Cuba. In particular it looks at their administrations in the context of the [[Cold War]] between the capitalist United States and the socialist [[Soviet Union]], with the former backing Duvalier and Trujillo and the latter backing Castro.

The book was widely reviewed in the mainstream press in both the United Kingdom and United States, gaining a predominantly positive reception, with most reviewers praising von Tunzelmann's writing style.

==Synopsis==
{{Empty section|date=December 2011}}
The book covers the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] administrations in their dealings with [[Fulgencio Batista]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Rafael Trujillo]] and [[François Duvalier]].  Tunzelmann describes the US administration as being blindsided during the Batista regime. As Castro emerges,  the spectre of [[communism]] at its backdoor  becomes the overriding concern of American policy in its dealings with its neighbors. Tunzelmann makes the case that Fidel Castro (in contrast to his brother [[Raul Castro|Raul]] and  [[Che Guevara]]) was not a communist at the beginning of the revolution, rather a nationalist who wanted to free his country from US domination and corruption, yet  was gradually pushed by American policy into the communist camp. His initial overtures toward the US government were rebuffed, and the CIA made numerous attempts to undermine the revolution and assassinate him. With the ill-fated [[Bay of Pigs invasion]], there was no way back. Castro sought shelter in the Soviet camp. The escalating conflict with Castro led to the extremely dangerous [[Cuban missile crisis]] when blunders by the superpowers almost led to a nuclear holocaust. In their anti-communistic phobia the US supported other regimes in the Caribbean to prevent another communistic take-over. In the course of this policy, it supported knowingly murderous dictators such as Duvalier and Trujillo. Tunzelmann explains that these  "puppets" skillfully exploited their masters producing communist threats to extract money and support. "The result was tyranny, conspiracy, murder, and black magic; it was poverty, violence, and a new model of global interventionism that still dominates American policy." (page 6)  The tragic outcome of the secret war in the Caribbean was that it "toppled democracies, supported dictators, and financed terrorism". (page 376)

==Reception==

===U.K. press reviews===
In the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', Ian Thomson referred to the book as "a zingy, well-researched history of the Cold War and its depredations in the Caribbean" which "offers a [[James Ellroy]]-like canvas of Duvalierist corruption, dubious CIA operatives and White House paranoia." Ultimately, Thomson considering it to be a "highly readable synthesis of all the available accounts" already published of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tho11|Thomson 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the U.K. newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', Jad Adams described ''Red Heat'' as providing a "vivid image" of the events in the Caribbean at the time, believing that it "deftly juggles" the histories of Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. He positively noted that the book's dust jacket "is designed like that for a thriller, and there is certainly a deal of sex and violence between these covers, told at a cracking pace."&lt;ref name="Adams 2011"/&gt;

The journalist and historian [[Richard Gott]], writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', noted his opinion that it was "refreshing to have the view of a writer who was not alive at the time", with Von Tunzelmann therefore being "unaffected by personal reminiscence". Gott felt that as a result the author was clearly "amazed" by what she had unearthed in the "archives and the huge library of published works" on the subject, presenting her conclusions in a "forthright" manner.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Got11|Gott 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. press reviews===
In his article for newspaper ''[[The Washington Post]]'', David Hoffman described ''Red Heat'' as containing "Suitcases full of cash, torture chambers, gunboats, coups, dictatorship and revolutionary fervor spill[ing] out of these pages." Noting that Von Tunzelmann set Castro apart from Trujillo and Duvalier by portraying him in a more positive light, Hoffman argues that in her writing, the author "carries a distinct, admonishing voice" which was evidently "disdainful of the errors made by the United States [and] outraged by the brutality of the island bosses". Furthermore, he felt that she "packs a lot into these pages, sometimes more than a reader can absorb, including a flock of minor characters."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hoff|Hoffman 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' featured a review of the book by the news correspondent [[Tom Gjelten]], who noted that in his opinion, Von Tunzelmann had clearly set out to emphasise that this period was "a deplorable chapter in American history", an assessment which he agreed with. Expanding on this, he felt however that whilst the work was "thorough in scope and quite readable", von Tunzelmann was "so scolding in tone that her book is harder to finish than it should be."&lt;ref name="Gjelten 2011"&gt;[[#Gje11|Gjelten 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that the author had sometimes pushed her own opinions ahead of the evidence, Gjelten wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most of the references cited by von Tunzelmann consist of books by other people, but she apparently has read enough to satisfy her curiosity on questions that have confounded other historians, like when, exactly, Fidel Castro actually became a Communist. She declares flatly that when he announced in 1961 that he had long been a Marxist-Leninist in secret, "it was not accurate. It was meant to impress the Soviets." Maybe, but we do not know that for sure.&lt;ref name="Gjelten 2011"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, he felt that the book was not as good as that of its predecessor, ''Indian Summer'', because its author "overreaches in her assessment of her story's importance", claiming that the events in the Caribbean at this time dramatically changed the world, something he was sceptical about.&lt;ref name="Gjelten 2011"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Arian Smedley was largely positive of the book, noting that the "author's editorial comments make for an interesting read, but they sometimes get in the way of the story." Believing that von Tunzelmann "does make points that aren't hard to agree with", Smedly cited the example of the "inherent hypocrisy of the U.S. intervening in Cuba to protect against the potential danger of communism while ignoring human rights violations in neighboring nations." Ultimately, Smedley felt that "At points in the book, ''Red Heat'' is so bizarre, you may not believe what you're reading, and at times, the story is so horrifying, you may be brought to tears."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sme11|Smedley 2011]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many views are held or have been expressed by '''religious organisations''' in relation to '''same-sex marriage'''. Arguments both in favor of and in opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine. Although the majority of world religions oppose to same-sex marriage, the number of religious denominations that are conducting same-sex marriages have been increasing in recent times. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to [[Homosexuality and religion|religious views on homosexuality]].

==Religious support==

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}
Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in [[Buddhist]] teachings, there has been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Issues. (May 20, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 ''Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109194247/http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 |date=2008-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no objection of the Buddha found in the Tipitaka. Buddha was neither supportive nor against marriages between members of the same gender. Also, from the Tipitaka, it is clear that the Buddha acknowledged the difference between hermaphrodites and homosexual practitioners. Hermaphrodites and eunuchs are not allowed to be ordained, but there is no sanction against homosexuality. As for the lay homosexual people, Buddha gave no rule or advice as to whether they should be allowed to marry or not. Buddha posted himself simply as the one who shows the way. He did not insist that he had any right to enforce on others what they should do. With this principle, the original teachings of the Buddha do not cover social ceremonies or rituals. Weddings and marriages of all kinds are regarded as mundane and have no place in Buddhism.&lt;ref name = Mettanando&gt;Mettanando Bhikkhu (July 13, 2005). [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0 ''Religion and Same-Sex Marriage.''] The Buddhist Channel: Bringing Buddha Dharma Home - Issues. ''The Bangkok Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1995, some religious leaders gave testimony to the Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law in support of same-gender marriages. [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], co-founder and teacher of the Honolulu Diamond Sangha, a Zen Buddhist society established in 1959, with centers in Manoa and Palolo, gave written testimony on the subject of same-sex marriage. Aitken explains that by applying the Four Noble Abodes (loving kindness, compassion, joy in the attainment of others, and equanimity) to the issue of same-sex marriage, he finds compassion for and with the gay or lesbian couple who wish to confirm their love in a legal marriage. Aitken cites a precept about sex which Zen Buddhists inherit from earlier classical Buddhists teachings.

It is one of the sixteen precepts accepted by all Zen Buddhist monks, nuns and seriously committed lay people. He understands this to mean that self-centered sexual conduct is inappropriate, and he vows to avoid it. He believes that self-centered sex is exploitive sex, non-consensual sex, sex that harms others.  It is unwholesome and destructive in a heterosexual as well as in a homosexual context. He goes on to explain that The Legislative Reference Bureau compiled a formidable list of rights that are extended to married couples in Hawai'i, but which are denied to couples
who are gay and lesbian.

He argues that gay and lesbian unions would be "settled even more" if they were acknowledged with basic married rights. Aitken says, "A long-standing injustice would be corrected, and the entire gay and lesbian community would feel more accepted. This would stabilize a significant segment of our society, and we would all of us be better able to acknowledge our diversity. I urge you to advise the Legislature and the people of Hawai'i that legalizing gay and lesbian marriages will
be humane and in keeping with perenniel principles of decency and mutual encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, T. (January 6, 1996). [http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/zen.buddhist.perspective.on.same.sex.marriage "A Zen Buddhist perspective on same-gender marriage."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christianity and sexual orientation|Christianity and homosexuality}}
Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples generally comes from certain Christian denominations that are considered theologically liberal. Some examples of religious organizations voicing their support for same-sex marriage include [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/issues/marriage-equality/|title=Marriage Equality and the UCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916035526/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church of the United States]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church In America]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]],  the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[United Protestant Church of France]], the [[United Protestant Church in Belgium]], the [[Icelandic Church]], the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]], the [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia]], the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]], the [[Protestant Church in Baden]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany]], the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the [[Quaker]]s, the liberal [[Old Catholic Church]] and the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] church which supports the rights of gays and lesbians to marry both in the church and through the state.&lt;ref&gt;

Some biblical scholars who hold to a more theologically liberal Christian view of same-sex marriage, such as representatives of the Metropolitan Community Church, make the claim that the word "homosexual" as found in many modern versions of the Bible is an interpolation and is not found in the original biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnsmcc.org/new/BibleAbuse/ |title=Welcome - Bible Abuse Directed at Homosexuals |publisher=Stjohnsmcc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument from scripture holds that since the original authors of the Bible never mention 'homosexuals' or committed Christian homosexual couples, there cannot exist a biblical prohibition of marriage rights for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923075213/http://www.gaychurch.org/gay_and_christian_yes/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MCC, biblical texts interpreted by some as references to homosexuality refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship which lack relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="Rev1990"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christians]] who support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriage may base their belief in same-sex marriage on the view that marriage, as an institution, and the structure of the family is a biblical moral imperative that should be honored by all couples, heterosexual and homosexual alike. Supporting same-sex marriage reflects their Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126093800/http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm |date=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc2009.org/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=986&amp;type=Final|title=ページが見つかりません。|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/ |title=Would Jesus Discriminate? |publisher=Wouldjesusdiscriminate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a theologian from the United Church of Canada, "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God."&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |title=Equality Rights |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313234743/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91486340|title=Gay Rights, Religious Liberties: A Three-Act Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of same-sex marriages have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|date=15 May 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/us/10beliefs.html|title=Will Same-Sex Marriage Collide With Religious Liberty?|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|date=10 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040904063.html|title=Faith Groups Increasingly Losing Legal Battles Over Gay Rights|first=Jacqueline L.|last=Salmon|date=10 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious arguments for and against marriage rights for same-sex couples are not always evenly divided among theologically conservative religious groups and liberal groups.  While self-identified theological liberal organizations such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), support same-sex marriage, other more conservative and or orthodox organizations including some [[Mennonite]] churches, the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Old Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/Church_agrees_to_bless_gay_partnerships.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6817696&amp;cKey=1150533957000&amp;ty=st |title=Church agrees to bless gay partnerships - SWI |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090612/http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.&lt;ref&gt;King, Michael A.

====Episcopal Church of the United States====
The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (as of 2015: 7,115 open parishes and missions; 2,009,084 active baptized members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.episcopalchurch.org/files/2013_table_of_statistics_0.pdf|title = Table of Statistics of the Episcopal Church|date = 2013|accessdate = 2015-07-02|website = Episcopal Church|publisher = Episcopal Church|last = |first = |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at their 2009 [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] declared that: "bishops, particularly those in dioceses within civil jurisdictions where same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are legal, may provide generous pastoral response to meet the needs of members of this Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/11/30/episcopal_bishop_approves_priests_role_in_same_sex_marriages_in_eastern_mass/|title=Episcopal role OK’d in gays’ weddings|last=Paulson|first=Michael|date=November 30, 2009 |publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution that was to be voted on later to approve an official [[liturgy]] for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called "''The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,''" would enable priests to bestow the church’s blessing on same-sex couples; priests could refuse to perform marriages, and bishops could prohibit same-sex marriage in their diocese. Denial would come without penalty, but the priest or diocese would have to direct same-sex couples they decline to another church or priest willing to perform the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Episcopal Church approves religious weddings for gay couples after controversial debate|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-01|access-date = 2015-07-02|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = George|last = Conger|at = Para. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was confirmed on July 9, 2015 (three years later) on a 129 for and 26 against (with 5 abstaining) vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/07/episcopalians-vote-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-in-churches/2/|agency = Associated Press|title = Episcopalians Vote to Allow Same-Sex Wedding Ceremonies in Churches|first = Brady|last = McCombs|date = 2015-07-01|via = LGBTQ Nation|last2 = Zoll|first2 = Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metropolitan Community Church====
The [[Metropolitan Community Church]] (43,000 members) sees its mission being social as well as spiritual by standing up for the rights of minorities, particularly those of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. MCC has been a leading force in the development of [[Queer theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Gray, ''Gay religion By Scott Thumma'',  Alta Mira Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the MCC is notable for publicly supporting same-sex marriage as early as the 1960s. Notably in 1970 [[Troy Perry]], the church's founder, filed the first lawsuit in the U.S. seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Perry lost that lawsuit but launched the debate over same-sex marriage in the U.S. Today, MCC congregations around the world perform more than 6000 same-sex marriage ceremonies annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=edited by Stephen|title=Contemporary Christianity and LGBT sexualities|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=9780754676249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presbyterian Church USA====
The [[Presbyterian Church USA]] General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission ruled in 2006 that same-sex ceremonies are not forbidden, as long as they are not considered to be the same as marriage services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2006/01/msg00291.html|title=wfn.org - [PCUSANEWS] Austin pastor won't be tried on gay 'marriage' accusation|website=www.wfn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate on the issue within the church evolved over the years. In 2000, the General Assembly had approved language for the church constitution that stated church teachings were that people were "to live           either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.," and barred church officers and property from being used for blessing or approval upon any other form of fidelity relationship, but ratification for this language was never obtained by the presbyteries. By 2014, the General Assembly passed an Authoritative Interpretation permitting pastors to sign marriage licences for same-gender couples where permitted by civil law in the states where their church was found, which took immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc-biz.org/PC-Biz.WebApp_deploy/(S(zbcely2njokyzcp51e0oharv))/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=4599|title=PC-Biz|website=www.pc-biz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2015, ratification by a majority of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between "a man and a woman," to "two people, traditionally a man and a woman," thus giving official sanction to, while not making it mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/us/presbyterians-give-final-approval-for-same-sex-marriage.html|title=Largest Presbyterian Denomination Gives Final Approval for Same-Sex Marriage|first=Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=17 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Church of Christ====
The United Church of Christ's General Synod (998,906 members) passed a resolution affirming "equal marriage rights for all people regardless of gender" in 2005. The church allows but does not require pastors to perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====United Church of Canada====
The [[United Church of Canada]] (600,000 members) was active in the campaign that led to legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Canada. The United Church now allows individual congregations to decide whether or not to perform these marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |title=Equal Marriage Civil Recognition of Same-Sex Partnerships |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011081832/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, in the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, where same-sex marriages have been legal since 2001, individual congregations decide if they will perform them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriages based on a moral commitment to equality, or a belief that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God", as affirmed by the United Church of Canada's 37th General Council.&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"/&gt;

====Liberal Catholic theologians====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
Even within the Roman Catholic Church, there can be found a few a groups who support for same-sex marriage. For example, while the Vatican and most of the Roman Catholic hierarchy oppose same sex marriages, there are a few Catholic theologians who support gay marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Catholic_defense_of_same_sex_marriage.htm|title=After 2 more deaths Planned Parenthood alters method for abortion pill (printer friendly)|website=www.religiousconsultation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical biblical scholarship====
According to [[Daniel A. Helminiak]],&lt;ref&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, pages 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bible]] may be interpreted literally or within historical-cultural context.  Under a literalist reading, the Bible can be read as condemning [[homosexuality]] (and, by extension, gay marriage).&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, chapter nine: Summary and conclusion, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Read in cultural context, the Bible "was not addressing our current questions about sexual ethics and does not condemn gay sex [or gay marriage]s as we understand it today."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; Helminiak argues that Biblical passages said to be against homosexuality (and same-sex marriages) do not actually say anything against gay and lesbian sexual relationships or identity. "The sin of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was inhospitality, not homosexuality. [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] condemns sex with [[angels]], not sex between two men. Not a single Bible text indisputably refers to lesbian sex. [...] there follows no valid conclusion whatsoever about homosexuality. Biblical figures [...] may well have been involved in homogenital relationships, seen as part of God's plan. And Jesus himself said nothing at all about homosexuality, not even when face to face with a man in a gay relationship."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] also argues for a move beyond [[Biblical literalism|literalism]]. The Bible was written for a world unlike our own.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.S. (1975). ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Culture.'' Anchor Books: Hamdon, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bratcher, Dennis (2006). "Community and Testimony: Cultural Influence in Biblical Studies" in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resource for Growing Christians.''[http://www.crivoice.org/community.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monogamy]], for example, only became the norm in the [[Christian]] world in the last 150 years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Israel C.S. (July, 1998): "The History of Monogamy" in [http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/monogamy/mono-history.htm ''Patriarchy Website.'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, Miller argues that the Bible supports the idea of monogamous relationships, including gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Lisa. "Our Mutual Joy: Opponents of gay marriage often cite Scripture. But what the Bible teaches about love argues for the other side" in ''NEWSWEEK.'' From the magazine issue dated Dec 15, 2008. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/172653/output/print]&lt;/ref&gt; Robin Kar argues that same-sex marriage is partly the result of certain religious and spiritual developments within Judeo-Christian society, which led to love-based marriages in the West.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3049650|title=Transformational Marriage: How to End the Culture Wars Over Same-Sex Marriage|first=Robin|last=Kar|date=8 October 2017|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, there are now religious reasons for Christians to support "transformative" marriage for all people and to dispense with the assumption that same-sex marriage reflects encroaching secularism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Hindus===
{{See also|Homosexuality and Hinduism}}
There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in [[Hinduism]], similar to many other religions.  A liberal view is presented by Mathematician Shakuntala Devi, in her 1977 book, ''The World of Homosexuals'', in which she interviewed Srinivasa Raghavachariar, head priest of the Srirangam temple. He said that same-sex lovers must have been cross-sex lovers in a former life. The sex may change but the soul retains its attachments, hence the love impels these souls towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;"It started in 1977 with the publication of a book by a woman who is better known as a mathematician. Shakuntala Devi's The World of Homosexuals can be said to have inaugurated social-reformist homophilic Indian writing in English. She concluded her book by calling for not only the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India, but also its 'full and complete acceptance' by the heterosexual population so that the Indian homosexual may lead a dignified and secure life." Arvind Narrain and Gautam Bhan (eds). (2005) [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue14/chatterjee_review.html ''Because I Have a Voice: Queer Politics in India.''] New Delhi: Yoda Press. Devi, Shakuntala (1977). ''The World of Homosexuals'', Delhi: Vikas, (p. 155).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, Ruth Vanita (writer/reporter for ''GALVA - The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc.'') interviewed a Shaiva priest who performed the marriage of two women; having studied Hindu scriptures, he had concluded, "Marriage is a union of spirits, and the spirit is not male or female" (p.&amp;nbsp;147).&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2006). [http://www.galva108.org/lovesrite.html ''Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As Amara Das Wilhelm, a Krishna devotee and founder of GALVA, notes in his book, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', "several Gaudiya Vaishnava authorities emphasize that since everyone passes through various forms, genders and species in a series of lives, we should not judge each other by the material body but view everyone equally on a spiritual plane, and be compassionate as God is."&lt;ref&gt;Das Wilhelm, Amara (2004). [http://www.galva108.org/galvabook.html ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex - Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ruth Vanita, "Indian newspapers, over the last 25 years, have reported several same-sex weddings and same-sex joint suicides, mostly by Hindu female couples in small towns, unconnected to any gay movement. Several weddings took place by Hindu rites, with some family support, while the suicides resulted from families forcibly separating lovers." According to Vanita, the phenomena of increased visibility of same-sex weddings "...suggest the wide range of Hindu attitudes to homosexuality today. The millennia-long debate in Hindu society, somewhat suppressed in the colonial period, has revived. In 2004, Hinduism Today reporter Rajiv Malik asked several Hindu swamis (teachers) their opinion of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1300&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The swamis expressed a range of opinions, positive and negative. They felt free to differ with each other; this is evidence of the liveliness of the debate, made possible by the fact that Hinduism has no one hierarchy or leader. As Mahant Ram Puri remarked, "We do not have a rule book in Hinduism. We have a hundred million authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2008).

====Catholic Church opposition====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] argues from a theological perspective against recognizing same-sex unions.  According to Catholic moral doctrine, acts of sexual intimacy are only proper between a man and a woman within wedlock.  Secular government recognition of any other union within the definition of "marriage" would therefore reflect a belief in the moral equivalence of acts between a husband and wife and acts between two men or two women; this belief is contrary to Catholic doctrinal teaching.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Catholic opponents also argue that inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage would also evidence rejection of the idea that, in general, it is best that children be raised by their biological mother and father, and that it is the community's interest in ensuring the well-being of children is the sole basis for the government's licensee and involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, ''Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions between Homosexual Persons'' (2003) [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html] (visited January 20, 2008) (statement by Vatican department charged with promoting and safeguarding the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Views in Scripture=====
{{See also|The Bible and homosexuality}}
Within the [[Christian]] tradition, religious objections to same-sex marriages are often based upon the [[Bible]].

Some religious arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon [[Old Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19:4-11, [[Leviticus]] 18:22, and [[Leviticus]] 20:13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles2/GagnonHomosexuality.php |title=Robert Gagnon - The Bible and Homosexual Practice: An Overview of Some Issues |publisher=Orthodoxytoday.org |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/september/11.36.html |title=What God Hath Not Joined |publisher=Christianity Today |date=2004-09-01 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianfamilylawassociation.org/same-sex_relationships |title=A Christian Perspective on Same-Sex RelationshipsNeither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor reviler, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 |publisher=Christian Family Law Association |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nosamesexmarriage.com/marriage/bible_verses.php|title=The Bible and No Same Sex Marriage|website=nosamesexmarriage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are based upon [[New Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1, [[I Corinthians]] 6:8-10, and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 1:7.&lt;ref name="ref_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;  [[Conservatism|Conservative]] Christians note that the book of [[Leviticus]] contains a prohibition against male-male sexuality.  While the Biblical passages mentioned above do not define the institution of marriage, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:22-24 reads as follows:  "Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man.' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+2:22-24&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:22-24 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is quoted by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19:4-5;&amp;version=31;|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 19:4-5 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evangelical opposition====
According to Reverend [[Rick Warren]], a pastor of the conservative [[Evangelical Christian]] [[Saddleback Church|Saddleback]] [[megachurch]], homosexuals are people who "think they are smarter than God" and who choose "to disobey God's sexual instructions."&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/news/2008/12/rick-warren-transcript.aspx|title=Steven Waldman Interviews Rick Warren|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Warren’s point of view, marriage is an ordinance from God that unites a man and a woman.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt; [[James Dobson]], in ''[[Marriage Under Fire]]'' and elsewhere, argues that legalization for or passive tolerance of same-sex marriages would widen the definition of families.

The [[ex-gay movement]] takes the view that I Corinthians 6:9-11 offers Christian believers [[Sexual orientation change efforts|freedom from the sin of homosexual behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901081023/http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.messiah.edu/~chase/h/articles/art1.htm|title=freeministry.org - This website is for sale! - freeministry Resources and Information.|website=home.messiah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evangelical author and counselor [[Joe Dallas]] notes that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual behavior uniformly prohibit that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joedallas.com/resources/Relevance%20&amp;R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Churches====
{{Main|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Same-sex marriage}}
The [[Orthodox Church in America]]&lt;ref name="OnMarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26|title=On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life|publisher=Orthodox Church in America|accessdate=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also opposed to same-sex marriage, as is the [[Unification Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml Unification Church pres sees smaller mass weddings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322013906/http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml |date=2009-03-22 }}, [[The Monitor (Uganda)]], 2008-12-30, "Moon said the church does not give its wedding blessing to same sex couples."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (15 million members) believes that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that children are entitled to be raised by a mother and a father who honor their marital vows with complete fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt;  They believe marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations, but is an important part of rearing children.  They teach that same-sex marriage undermines the purpose of marriage.&lt;ref name="TheDivine" /&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (8.2 million members) believes God condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and his wife.  They teach that while the bible condemns homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwww.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/bible-about-homosexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Judaism===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Judaism}}
Judaism, like Christianity, reflects differing views between conservative and liberal adherents.  [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst members of the same sex. The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment  banning same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that recent research by Chana Etengoff &amp; Colette Daiute suggest that positive reconciliations between sexual minority individuals and Orthodox Jewish family members is possible (a process referred to as theistic mediation),&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2014). Family Members’ Uses of Religion in Post–Coming-Out Conflicts With Their Gay Relative. Psychology of Religion and Spirituality. 6(1), 33-43. doi: 10.1037/a0035198&lt;/ref&gt; both with and without clinical support.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2015).

===Theravada Buddhists===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
Thai [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] (over 150 million members), being the more conservative wing of Buddhism are less supportive of gay rights and marriages. Human rights issues have received poor attention in Theravada countries, as the culture is rooted in the belief in the Law of Karma, which is more popular among Thai Buddhists than philosophical and advanced scriptural studies in Buddhism. Many monasteries and monks advocate their lay followers to see the world through the lens of karma, i.e., every person is born to pay back their sins. According to their explanations, all homosexuals and sexual deviants were once offenders of the Third Precept (prohibiting sexual misconduct) - at least in their past lives, and they must pay off their past sins in their present life. Therefore, they deserve all that society gives to them. This belief system creates strong conservative values in Theravada Buddhist culture. For these reasons, it is unlikely that Buddhists will easily approve a law to allow gay marriage. Gay and lesbian activists in Thailand will probably not be as successful as their fellows in European countries or Canada.&lt;ref name = Mettanando/&gt; It is important to note, however, that Theravada Buddhists outside of the South-East Asian Area, are generally more supportive, or neutral, to same-sex marriage, and LGBT rights as a whole.

There is also a concern that religious people might be marginalized for their beliefs about marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=16199|title=New Hampshire law marginalizes supporters of traditional marriage, bishop says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/04/07/DI2009040702538.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Opposing Views|first=David Catania and Brian|last=Brown|date=7 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents point to the way [[Carrie Prejean]] was treated during the [[Miss USA 2009 controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/30/miss-california-carrie-pr_0_n_193503.htmlMiss|title=California Carrie Prejean To Campaign Against Gay Marriage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also concerns about violence and intimidation against religious people.  After a vote to make same-sex marriage illegal in California, same-sex marriage supporters published names of donors to the bill and classified them based on religion and many religious symbols were targeted.  Elder [[Dallin H. Oaks]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, likened the attacks against religious people to voter intimidation against black people during the American civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/religious-freedom|title=Transcript of Elder Dallin H.

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] argue that by defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution, the state infringes upon the constitutional right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Glassman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atheism.about.com"/&gt; In this view, religious groups that do wish to celebrate same-sex marriages are discriminated against when government policies do not permit their religious groups to celebrate marriages as they see fit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">'''Russell T. McCutcheon''' is a Canadian scholar with a Ph.D. in religious studies from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1995. He is a professor and was department chair from 2001-2009 at the [[University of Alabama]]. He was one of the editors of the quarterly periodical ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 1997-2001''. In 2005, McCutcheon was elected President of the Council of Societies for the Study of Religion (CSSR), headquartered at [[Rice University]]. He is the founder and series editor for the anthology series, ''Critical Categories in the Study of Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.routledge.com/Critical-Categories-in-the-Study-of-Religion/book-series/TFSE00054 ''Critical Categories in the Study of Religion''] accessed June 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been noted for a controversy concerning methodology in the field of Religious Studies.  This controversy centered on a rather polemical exchange between McCutcheon and Dr. [[Robert A. Orsi]], who held a teaching position at [[Harvard University]] and [[Harvard Divinity School]], with Orsi referring to McCutcheon's book, ''The Discipline of Religion'', as "chilling". Orsi also made the comment, "the assumption appears to be that the scholar of religion by virtue of his or her normative epistemology, theoretical acuity, and political knowingness, has the authority and the right to make the lives of others the objects of his or her scrutiny. He or she theorizes them." McCutcheon responded with a paper included in the [[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]] entitled, "It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!: On the Limits of the Humanistic Study of Religion and the Costs of Saving Others from Themselves."&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_american_academy_of_religion/v074/74.3mccutcheon01.html ""It's a Lie.

[[File:Groote.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dutch language|Dutch]] stenography using the "System Groote"]]
'''Shorthand''' is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed and brevity of writing as compared to [[longhand]], a more common method of writing a language. The process of writing in shorthand is called '''stenography''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''stenos'' (narrow) and ''graphein'' (to write). It has also been called '''brachygraphy''', from Greek ''brachys'' (short) and '''tachygraphy''', from Greek ''tachys'' (swift, speedy), depending on whether compression or speed of writing is the goal.

Many forms of shorthand exist. A typical shorthand system provides symbols or abbreviations for words and common phrases, which can allow someone well-trained in the system to write as quickly as people speak. Abbreviation methods are alphabet-based and use different abbreviating approaches. Several [[autocomplete]] programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for frequently used phrases. Many journalists use shorthand writing to quickly take notes at press conferences or other similar scenarios.

Shorthand was used more widely in the past, before the invention of recording and [[dictation machine]]s. Shorthand was considered an essential part of secretarial training and police work, as well as useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes are typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later typing, data entry, or (mainly historically) transcription to [[Cursive|longhand]], although longer term uses do exist, such as encipherment: diaries (like that of the famous [[Samuel Pepys]]) are a common example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Pepys |first1=Samuel |year=1970 |title=The diary of Samuel Pepys: a new and complete transcription |first2=Robert |last2=Latham |first3=William |last3=Matthews |publisher=Bell &amp; Hyman |isbn=978-0-7135-1551-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JS9bAAAAMAAJ}}, Volume I, pp. xlvii–liv (for Thomas Shelton's shorthand system and Pepys' use of it)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Classical antiquity ===

The earliest known indication of shorthand systems is from the [[Parthenon]] in [[Ancient Greece]],  where a mid-4th century BC marble slab was found. This shows a writing system primarily based on vowels, using certain modifications to indicate consonants. [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] tachygraphy is reported from the 2nd century BC onwards, though there are indications that it might be older. The oldest datable reference is a contract from [[Middle Egypt]], stating that Oxyrhynchos gives the "[[semeiographer]]" Apollonios for two years to be taught shorthand writing. Hellenistic tachygraphy consisted of word stem signs and word ending signs. Over time, many syllabic signs were developed.

In [[Ancient Rome]], [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]] (103–4&amp;nbsp;BC), a slave and later a [[freedman]] of [[Cicero]], developed the [[Tironian notes]] so that he could write down Cicero's speeches. Plutarch (c46-c120 AD) in his "Life of Cato the Younger" (95-46 BC) records that Cicero, during a trial of some insurrectionists in the senate, employed several expert rapid writers, whom he had taught to make figures comprising numerous words in a few short strokes, to preserve Cato's speech on this occasion.  The Tironian notes consisted of [[Latin]] word stem abbreviations (''notae'') and of word ending abbreviations (''titulae''). The original Tironian notes consisted of about 4000 signs, but new signs were introduced, so that their number might increase to as many as 13,000. In order to have a less complex writing system, a syllabic shorthand script was sometimes used. After the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], the Tironian notes were no longer used to transcribe speeches, though they were still known and taught, particularly during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. After the 11th century, however, they were mostly forgotten.

When many [[monastery]] libraries were [[secularization|secularized]] in the course of the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]], long-forgotten manuscripts of Tironian notes were rediscovered.

=== Imperial China ===
[[File:Treatise On Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sun Guoting]]'s ''Treatise on Calligraphy'', an example of cursive writing of Chinese characters]]
{{See also|Cursive script (East Asia)}}
In imperial [[China]], clerks used an abbreviated, highly cursive form of [[Chinese character]]s to record court proceedings and criminal confessions. These records were used to create more formal transcripts. One cornerstone of imperial court proceedings was that all confessions had to be acknowledged by the accused's signature, personal seal, or thumbprint, requiring fast writing.{{failed verification|date=April 2011}} Versions of this technique survived in [[Clerical worker|clerical]] professions into the modern day, and influenced by Western shorthand methods, some new methods were invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.163.com/su_yi168/blog/static/25354182200762410439112/?hasChannelAdminPriv=true|title=(原创)漢語速記的發展及三個高潮的出現 - 阿原的日志 - 网易博客|author=su_yi168,阿原|work=163.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185536/http://blog.163.com/su_yi168/blog/static/25354182200762410439112/?hasChannelAdminPriv=true|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.59146.com/sujichangshi/2006/6/2006060511315637175.html 中国速记的发展简史]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112112454/http://www.59146.com/sujichangshi/2006/6/2006060511315637175.html |date=2009-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://suji.net.cn/news/jctj/jctj/2006810183842.htm 迎接中国速记110年(颜廷超)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161417/http://suji.net.cn/news/jctj/jctj/2006810183842.htm |date=December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/suji123|title=教授弋乂_新浪博客|work=sina.com.cn|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160208205300/http://blog.sina.com.cn/suji123|archivedate=2016-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe and America ===

An interest in shorthand or "short-writing" developed towards the end of the 16th century in [[England]]. In 1588 [[Timothy Bright]] published his ''Characterie; An Arte of Shorte, Swifte and Secrete Writing by Character'' which introduced a system with 500 arbitrary symbols each representing one word. Bright's book was followed by a number of others, including Peter Bales' '' The Writing Schoolemaster'' in 1590, John Willis's ''Art of Stenography'' in 1602, Edmond Willis's ''An abbreviation of writing by character'' in 1618, and [[Thomas Shelton (stenographer)|Thomas Shelton]]'s ''Short Writing'' in 1626 (later re-issued as ''Tachygraphy'').

Shelton's system became very popular and is well known because it was used by Samuel Pepys for his diary and for many of his official papers, such as his letter copy books. It was also used by [[Sir Isaac Newton]] in some of his notebooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Richard S. Westfall]] |title=Notes and records of the Royal Society, Volume 18, Issue 1 |year=1963|pages=10–16|publisher=Royal Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGQSAAAAIAAJ |chapter=Short-Writing and the State of Newton's Conscience, 1662}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelton borrowed heavily from his predecessors, especially Edmond Willis. Each consonant was represented by an arbitrary but simple symbol, while the five vowels were represented by the relative positions of the surrounding consonants. Thus the symbol for B with symbol for T drawn directly above it represented "bat", while B with T below it meant "but"; top-right represented "e", middle-right "i", and lower-right "o". A vowel at the end of a word was represented by a dot in the appropriate position, while there were additional symbols for initial vowels. This basic system was supplemented by further symbols representing common prefixes and suffixes.

One drawback of Shelton's system was that there was no way to distinguish long and short vowels or diphthongs; so the b-a-t sequence could mean "bat", or "bait", or "bate", while b-o-t might mean "boot", or "bought", or "boat". The reader needed to use the context to work out which alternative was meant. The main advantage of the system was that it was easy to learn and to use. It was popular, and under the two titles of ''Short Writing'' and ''Tachygraphy'', Shelton's book ran to more than 20 editions between 1626 and 1710.

Shelton's chief rivals were [[Theophilus Metcalfe]]'s ''Stenography'' or ''Short Writing'' (1633) which was in its "55th edition" by 1721, and [[Jeremiah Rich]]'s system of 1654, which was published under various titles including ''The penns dexterity compleated'' (1669). Another notable English shorthand system creator of the 17th century was William Mason ([[floruit|fl.]] 1672–1709) who published ''Arts Advancement'' in 1682.

[[File:Heinrich Roller Grabstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone of [[Heinrich Roller]], inventor of a [[German language|German]] shorthand system, with a sample of his shorthand]]

Modern-looking geometric shorthand was introduced with [[John Byrom]]'s ''New Universal Shorthand'' of 1720. [[Samuel Taylor (stenographer)|Samuel Taylor]] published a [[Taylor shorthand|similar system]] in 1786, the first English shorthand system to be used all over the English-speaking world. [[Thomas Gurney (shorthand writer)|Thomas Gurney]] published ''Brachygraphy'' in the mid-18th century. In 1834 in [[Germany]], [[Franz Xaver Gabelsberger]] published his [[Gabelsberger shorthand]]. Gabelsberger based his shorthand on the shapes used in German cursive handwriting rather than on the geometrical shapes that were common in the English stenographic tradition.
[[File:קצרנות בשפת יידיש.jpg|thumb|[[Yiddish]] Shorthand]]
[[File:שיטות קצרנות בשפה העברית.jpg|thumb|[[Hebrew]] Shorthand]]
Taylor's system was superseded by [[Pitman shorthand]], first introduced in 1837 by English teacher [[Sir Isaac Pitman]], and improved many times since. Pitman's system has been used all over the English-speaking world and has been adapted to many other languages, including [[Latin language|Latin]]. Pitman's system uses a [[phonemic orthography]]. For this reason, it is sometimes known as ''phonography'', meaning "sound writing" in Greek. One of the reasons this system allows fast transcription is that [[vowel]] sounds are optional when only consonants are needed to determine a word. The availability of a full range of vowel symbols, however, makes complete accuracy possible. Isaac's brother Benn Pitman, who lived in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], was responsible for introducing the method to America. The record for fast writing with Pitman shorthand is 350 [[wpm]] during a two-minute test by Nathan Behrin in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/12/30/102911691.pdf|title=NEW WORLD'S RECORD FOR SHORTHAND SPEED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Behrin wrote on Pitman shorthand in 1914:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The seeker after high speed should devote himself to obtaining a thorough mastery of the principles of his system of shorthand. Not until the ability to write shorthand without mental hesitation has been acquired, should speed practice begin.

A student observing the note-taking of an experienced stenographer will be struck with admiration at the smoothness of the writing and the perfect regularity of the outlines. An excellent method of practice for the like facility is in the copying of a selection sentence by sentence until the whole is memorized, and then writing it over and over again.

All notes taken at any speed should strictly be compared with the printed matter. It will then be found that many words are taken for others because of the forms they assume when written under pressure. Most of these can be avoided by careful attention to the writing. Experience alone will authorize any deviation from the text-book forms.

Phrasing should be indulged in sparingly on unfamiliar matter. But on familiar matter the student should always be alert for opportunities of saving both time and effort by employing the principles of intersection, elimination of consonants and the joining of words of frequent occurrence.

Nothing less than absolute accuracy should satisfy the student. Conflicting outlines should be carefully distinguished. Where words may be distinguished either by the insertion of vowels or the changing of one of the outlines, the latter should always be the method employed; vowels should freely be inserted whenever possible. The sense of the matter should be carefully preserved by the punctuation of the notes, indicating the full stop and leaving spaces in the notes between phrases.

The best matter of the for the student beginning practice for speed is to be found in the dictation books compiled by the publishers of the system. At first, the dictation should be slow to permit the making of careful outlines. Gradually the speed should be increased until the student is obliged to exert himself to keep pace with the reader; and occasionally short bursts of speed should be attempted as tests of the writer's progress.

The student ambitious to succeed will endeavor to familiarize himself with all matters pertaining to stenography. By reading the shorthand magazines he will keep himself in touch with the latest developments in the art. Facility in reading shorthand will also be acquired by reading the shorthand plates in these magazines. For comparison and suggestion, he will study the facsimile notes of practical stenographers. He will neglect no opportunity to improve himself in the use of his art. And finally he will join a shorthand society where he will come in contact with other stenographers who are striving toward the same goal as himself.&lt;ref name=Behrin&gt;{{cite journal|first=Nathan|last=Behrin|date=January 1914|title=High Speed in Shorthand|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT5FAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA389|journal=The Stenographer|volume=43|number=1|page=389|access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite being 175 years old Pitman's shorthand is still relevant today and used by thousands of journalists, executive PAs and secretaries across the world. In Europe, particularly in Great Britain there are thousands of educational institutions teaching Pitman's shorthand.
  
In the [[United States]] and some other parts of the world it has been largely superseded by [[Gregg shorthand]], which was first published in 1888 by [[John Robert Gregg]]. This system was influenced by the handwriting shapes that Gabelsberger had introduced. Gregg's shorthand, like Pitman's, is phonetic, but has the simplicity of being "light-line." Pitman's system uses thick and thin strokes to distinguish related sounds, while Gregg's uses only thin strokes and makes some of the same distinctions by the length of the stroke. In fact, Gregg claimed joint authorship in another shorthand system published in pamphlet form by one [[Thomas Stratford Malone]]; Malone, however, claimed sole authorship and a legal battle ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/greggj.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=27 July 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084212/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/greggj.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two systems use very similar, if not identical, symbols; however, these symbols are used to represent different sounds. For instance, on page 10 of the manual is the word d i m 'dim'; however, in the Gregg system the spelling would actually mean n u k or 'nook'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/scriptphonograph00maloiala#page/10/mode/2up|title=Script phonography|work=archive.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306205113/http://www.archive.org/stream/scriptphonograph00maloiala#page/10/mode/2up|archivedate=2016-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
{{Cquote |Our Japanese pen shorthand began in 1882, transplanted from the American Pitman-Graham system.  Geometric theory has great influence in Japan.  But Japanese motions of writing gave some influence to our shorthand.  We are proud to have reached the highest speed in capturing spoken words with a pen.  Major pen shorthand systems are Shuugiin, Sangiin, Nakane and Waseda [a repeated vowel shown here means a vowel spoken in double-length in Japanese, sometimes shown instead as a bar over the vowel].  Including a machine-shorthand system, Sokutaipu, we have 5 major shorthand systems now.

There are several other pen shorthands in use (Ishimura, Iwamura, Kumassaki, Kotani, and Nissokuken), leading to a total of nine pen shorthands in use. In addition, there is the Yamane pen shorthand (of unknown importance) and three machine shorthands systems (Speed Waapuro, Caver and Hayatokun or sokutaipu.)

Japanese shorthand systems ('sokki' shorthand or 'sokkidou' stenography) commonly use a syllabic approach, much like the common writing system for Japanese (which has actually two syllabaries in everyday use). There are several semi-cursive systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://sokki.okoshi-yasu.net/sb-housiki.html | publisher = Okoshi Yasu | title = Housiki | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222518/http://sokki.okoshi-yasu.net/sb-housiki.html | archivedate = 2016-03-03 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most follow a left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sokki.okoshi-yasu.net/sb-bunrei.html|title=速記文字文例|work=okoshi-yasu.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230155/http://sokki.okoshi-yasu.net/sb-bunrei.html|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several systems incorporate a loop into many of the strokes, giving the appearance of Gregg, Graham, or Cross's Eclectic shorthand without actually functioning like them.&lt;ref name="Sokkidou"&gt;{{citation | publisher = OCN | place = JP | url = http://www12.ocn.ne.jp/~sokkidou/t12/ | title = Sokkidou | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130522074907/http://www12.ocn.ne.jp/~sokkidou/t12/ | archivedate = 2013-05-22 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kotani (aka Same-Vowel-Same-Direction or SVSD or V-type)&lt;ref name="Sokkidou 60"&gt;{{citation | publisher = OCN | place =  | url = http://www12.ocn.ne.jp/~sokkidou/t12/60c.html | title = Sokkidou | page = 60 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130522081801/http://www12.ocn.ne.jp/~sokkidou/t12/60c.html | archivedate = 2013-05-22 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; system's strokes frequently cross over each other and in so doing form loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Nifty | url = http://homepage3.nifty.com/Steno/001g/2/20.html | title = Steno | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304112954/http://homepage3.nifty.com/Steno/001g/2/20.html | archivedate = 2016-03-04 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese also has its own variously cursive form of writing kanji characters, the most extremely simplified of which is known as [[Cursive script (East Asia)|Sōsho]].

The two Japanese syllabaries are themselves adapted from the Chinese characters (both of the syllabaries, katakana and hiragana, are in everyday use alongside the Chinese characters known as kanji; the kanji, being developed in parallel to the Chinese characters, have their own idiosyncrasies, but Chinese and Japanese ideograms are largely comprehensible, even if their use in the languages are not the same.)

Prior to the Meiji era, Japanese did not have its own shorthand (the kanji did have their own abbreviated forms borrowed alongside them from China). Takusari Kooki was the first to give classes in a new Western-style non-ideographic shorthand of his own design, emphasis being on the non-ideographic and new. This was the first shorthand system adapted to writing phonetic Japanese, all other systems prior being based on the idea of whole or partial semantic ideographic writing like that used in the Chinese characters, and the phonetic approach being mostly peripheral to writing in general (even today, Japanese writing uses the syllabaries to pronounce or spell out words, or to indicate grammatical words. Furigana are written alongside kanji, or Chinese characters, to indicate their pronunciation especially in juvenile publications. Furigana are usually written using the hiragana syllabary; foreign words may not have a kanji form and are spelled out using katakana.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Miller |first1=J. Scott |year=1994 |title=Japanese Shorthand and Sokkibon |publisher=Sophia University |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/2385259}}, Volume 49, No. 4, pp. 473 (for the origins of modern Japanese shorthand)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new sokki were used to transliterate popular vernacular story-telling theater (yose) of the day. This led to a thriving industry of sokkibon (shorthand books). The ready availability of the stories in book form, and higher rates of literacy (which the very industry of sokkibon may have helped create, due to these being oral classics that were already known to most people) may also have helped kill the yose theater, as people no longer needed to see the stories performed in person to enjoy them. Sokkibon also allowed a whole host of what had previously been mostly oral rhetorical and narrative techniques into writing, such as imitation of dialect in conversations (which can be found back in older gensaku literature; but gensaku literature used conventional written language in-between conversations, however.)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Miller |first1=J. Scott |year=1994 |title=Japanese Shorthand and Sokkibon |publisher=Sophia University |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/2385259}}, Volume 49, No. 4, pp. 471–487 (for the origins of modern Japanese writing and shorthand)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

=== Geometric and script-like systems ===
Shorthands that use simplified letterforms are sometimes termed ''stenographic'' shorthands, contrasting with alphabetic shorthands, below. Stenographic shorthands can be further differentiated by the target letter forms as geometric, script, and semi-script or elliptical.

''Geometric'' shorthands are based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The first modern shorthand systems were geometric. Examples include [[Pitman Shorthand]], [[Boyd's Syllabic Shorthand]], Samuel Taylor's Universal Stenography, the French Prévost-Delaunay, and the [[Duployan shorthand|Duployé]] system, adapted to write the [[Kamloops Wawa]] (used for [[Chinook Jargon]]) writing system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n3895.pdf std.dkuug.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040508/http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3895.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Script'' shorthands are based on the motions of ordinary handwriting. The first system of this type was published under the title ''Cadmus Britanicus'' by Simon Bordley, in 1787. However, the first practical system was the German [[Gabelsberger shorthand]] of 1834. This class of system is now common in all more recent German shorthand systems, as well as in Austria, Italy, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Russia, other Eastern European countries, and elsewhere.

''Script-geometric'', or ''semi-script'', shorthands are based on the ellipse. Semi-script can be considered a compromise between the ''geometric'' systems and the ''script'' systems. The first such system was that of George Carl Märes in 1885. However, the most successful system of this type was [[Gregg shorthand]], introduced by [[John Robert Gregg]] in 1888. Gregg had studied not only the ''geometric'' English systems, but also the German Stolze stenography, a ''script'' shorthand. Other examples include [[Teeline Shorthand]] and [[Thomas Natural Shorthand]].

The semi-script philosophy gained popularity in Italy in the first half of the 20th century with three different systems created by {{ill|Giovanni Vincenzo Cima|it|lt=Cima|vertical-align=sup}}, {{ill|Meschini|it|Erminio Meschini|vertical-align=sup}}, and {{ill|Stenital Mosciaro|it|lt=Mosciaro|vertical-align=sup}}.

=== Systems resembling standard writing ===
Some shorthand systems attempted to ease learning by using characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems have often been described as '''alphabetic''', and purists might claim that such systems are not 'true' shorthand. However, these alphabetic systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand. Alphabetic shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 words per minute or more—but require only a fraction of the time to acquire a useful speed of between 60 and 100 words per minute.

Non-stenographic systems often supplement alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, giving special significance to capitalised letters, and sometimes using additional non-alphabetic symbols. Examples of such systems include [[Stenoscript]], [[Speedwriting]] and [[Forkner shorthand]]. However, there are some pure alphabetic systems, including [[Personal Shorthand]], [[SuperWrite]], Easy Script Speed Writing, and [[Keyscript Shorthand]] which limit their symbols to ''a priori'' alphabetic characters. These have the added advantage that they can also be typed—for instance, onto a [[computer]], [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]], or [[cellphone]]. Early editions of Speedwriting were also adapted so that they could be written on a typewriter, and therefore would possess the same advantage.

=== Varieties of vowel representation ===
Shorthand systems can also be classified according to the way that vowels are represented.
* ''[[Alphabet]]ic'' – Expression by "normal" vowel signs that are not fundamentally different from consonant signs (e.g., Gregg, Duployan).
* ''Mixed alphabetic'' – Expression of vowels and consonants by different kinds of strokes (e.g., Arends' system for German or [[Melin Shorthand|Melin's Swedish Shorthand]] where vowels are expressed by upward or sideway strokes and consonants and consonant clusters by downward strokes).
* ''[[Abjad]]'' – No expression of the individual vowels at all except for indications of an initial or final vowel (e.g., Taylor).
* ''Marked abjad'' – Expression of vowels by the use of detached signs (such as dots, ticks, and other marks) written around the consonant signs.
* ''Positional abjad'' – Expression of an initial vowel by the height of the word in relation to the line, no necessary expression of subsequent vowels (e.g., Pitman, which can optionally express other vowels by detached diacritics).
* ''[[Abugida]]'' – Expression of a vowel by the shape of a stroke, with the consonant indicated by orientation (e.g., Boyd).
* ''Mixed abugida'' – Expression of the vowels by the width of the joining stroke that leads to the following consonant sign, the height of the following consonant sign in relation to the preceding one, and the line pressure of the following consonant sign (e.g., most German shorthand systems).

=== Machine shorthand systems ===
Traditional shorthand systems are written on paper with a stenographic pencil or a stenographic pen. Some consider that strictly speaking only handwritten systems can be called shorthand.

Machine shorthand is also a common term for writing produced by a [[stenotype]], a specialized [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]. These are often used for court room transcripts and in live [[subtitling]]. However, there are other shorthand machines used worldwide, including: [[Velotype]]; [[Palantype]] in the UK; [[Grandjean Stenotype]], used extensively in France and French-speaking countries; [[Michela Stenotype]], used extensively in Italy; and [[Stenokey]], used in Bulgaria and elsewhere.

== Common modern English shorthand systems ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
One of the most widely used forms of shorthand is still the Pitman shorthand method described above, which has been adapted for 15 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitmanshorthand.homestead.com/|title=The Joy of Pitman Shorthand|author=|date=|website=pitmanshorthand.homestead.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515090449/http://pitmanshorthand.homestead.com/|archivedate=2011-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pitman's method was extremely popular at first and is still commonly used, especially in the UK, its popularity has been superseded, especially in the U.S., by [[Gregg shorthand]], developed by John Robert Gregg in 1888.

In the UK, the spelling-based (rather than phonetic) [[Teeline Shorthand|Teeline shorthand]] is now more commonly taught and used than Pitman, and Teeline is the recommended system of the [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]] with an overall speed of 100 words per minute necessary for certification. Other less commonly used systems in the UK are Pitman 2000, PitmanScript, [[Speedwriting]], and Gregg. Teeline is also the most common shorthand method taught to New Zealand journalists, whose certification typically requires a shorthand speed of at least 80 words per minute.

In Nigeria, Shorthand is still taught in higher institutions of learning especially for students studying Office Technology Management and Business Education.

{{Stone Age|245}}

A '''stone tool''' is, in the most general sense, any tool made either partially or entirely out of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. Although stone tool-dependent societies and cultures still exist today, most stone tools are associated with [[prehistory|prehistoric]], particularly [[Stone Age]] cultures that have become extinct. [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] often study such prehistoric societies, and refer to the study of stone tools as [[lithic analysis]]. [[Ethnoarchaeology]] has been a valuable research field in order to further the understanding and cultural implications of stone tool use and manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Sillitoe, P. and K. Hardy 2003 Living lithics: ethnoarchaeology in highland Papua New Guinea. Antiquity 77:555-566&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone has been used to make a wide variety of different tools throughout history, including [[arrow heads]], spearpoints and [[querns]]. Stone tools may be made of either [[ground stone]] or [[chipped stone]], and a person who creates tools out of the latter is known as a [[flintknapper]].
 
Chipped stone tools are made from [[cryptocrystal]]line materials such as [[chert]] or [[flint]], [[radiolarite]], [[chalcedony]], [[obsidian]], [[basalt]], and  [[quartzite]] via a process known as [[lithic reduction]]. One simple form of reduction is to strike stone [[lithic flake|flake]]s from a nucleus (core) of material using a [[hammerstone]] or similar hard hammer fabricator. If the goal of the reduction strategy is to produce flakes, the remnant [[lithic core]] may be discarded once it has become too small to use. In some strategies, however, a [[flintknapper]] reduces the core to a rough [[uniface|unifacial]] or [[biface|bifacial]] [[Lithic reduction#Preform|preform]], which is further reduced using [[soft hammer]] flaking techniques or by [[pressure flaking]] the edges.

More complex forms of reduction include the production of highly standardized blades, which can then be fashioned into a variety of tools such as [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, [[knife|knives]], [[sickle]]s and [[microliths]]. In general terms, chipped stone tools are nearly ubiquitous in all pre-metal-using societies because they are easily manufactured, the [[tool stone]] is usually plentiful, and they are easy to transport and sharpen.

==Evolution==
[[File:National park stone tools.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A selection of [[prehistoric]] stone tools.]]

Archaeologists classify stone tools into [[Industry (archaeology)|industries]] (also known as complexes or technocomplexes&lt;ref name="Clarke 1978"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analytical Archaeology|last=Clarke|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1978|isbn=0231046308|edition=2nd|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that share distinctive technological or morphological characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Learning in Neanderthals and Modern Humans Volume 1: Cultural Perspectives|last=Kadowaki|first=Seiji|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9784431545118|editor-last=Akazawa|editor-first=Takeru|location=Tokyo|pages=62–63|chapter=Issues of Chronological and Geographical Distributions of Middle and Upper Palaeolithic Cultural Variability in the Levant and Implications for the Learning Behaviour of Neanderthals and ''Homo sapiens''|editor-last2=Nishiaki|editor-first2=Yoshihiro|editor-last3=Aoki|editor-first3=Kenichi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 in the 2nd edition of ''World Prehistory'', [[Grahame Clark]] proposed an evolutionary progression of [[flint-knapping]] in which the "dominant lithic technologies" occurred in a fixed sequence from Mode 1 through Mode 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Grahame |last=Clarke |title=World Prehistory: a New Outline | year=1969 |edition=2 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He assigned to them relative dates: Modes 1 and 2 to the Lower [[Palaeolithic]], 3 to the [[Middle Palaeolithic]], 4 to the [[Upper Paleolithic|Advanced]] and 5 to the [[Mesolithic]]. They were not to be conceived, however, as either universal—that is, they did not account for all [[lithic technology]]; or as synchronous—they were not in effect in different regions simultaneously. Mode 1, for example, was in use in [[Europe]] long after it had been replaced by Mode 2 in [[Africa]].

Clark's scheme was adopted enthusiastically by the archaeological community. One of its advantages was the simplicity of terminology; for example, the Mode 1 / Mode 2 Transition. The transitions are currently of greatest interest. Consequently, in the literature the stone tools used in the period of the [[Palaeolithic]] are divided into four "modes", each of which designate a different form of complexity, and which in most cases followed a rough [[chronological]] order.

===Mode I: The Oldowan Industry===
{{Commons category|Oldowan}}
[[File:Chopping tool.gif|thumb|left|240px|A typical Oldowan simple chopping-tool. This example is from the Duero Valley, [[Valladolid]].]]

{{Main|Oldowan}}

The earliest stone tools in the life span of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' are [[Oldowan|Mode 1]] tools,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke's "chopper tools and flakes."&lt;/ref&gt; and come from what has been termed the [[Oldowan Industry]], named after the type of site (many sites, actually) found in [[Olduvai Gorge]], [[Tanzania]], where they were discovered in large quantities. Oldowan tools were characterised by their simple construction, predominantly using [[lithic core|core]] forms. These cores were river pebbles, or rocks similar to them, that had been struck by a spherical [[hammerstone]] to cause [[conchoidal fracture]]s removing flakes from one surface, creating an edge and often a sharp tip. The blunt end is the proximal surface; the sharp, the distal. Oldowan is a percussion technology. Grasping the proximal surface, the hominid brought the distal surface down hard on an object he wished to detach or shatter, such as a bone or tuber.

The earliest known Oldowan tools yet found date from 2.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago, during the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] period, and have been uncovered at [[Gona]] in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Semaw, S. |author2=M. J. Rogers |author3=J. Quade |author4=P. R. Renne |author5=R. F. Butler |author6=M. Domínguez-Rodrigo |author7=D. Stout |author8=W. S. Hart |author9=T. Pickering |author10= S. W.

The Industry flourished in southern and eastern Africa between 2.6 and 1.7&amp;nbsp;million years ago, but was also spread out of Africa and into [[Eurasia]] by travelling bands of ''H. erectus'', who took it as far east as [[Java]] by 1.8&amp;nbsp;million years ago and [[North China (continent)|Northern China]] by 1.6&amp;nbsp;million years ago.

===Mode II: The Acheulean Industry===

{{Commons category|Acheulean}}

{{Main|Acheulean Industry}}

Eventually, more complex, Mode 2 tools began to be developed through the [[Acheulean Industry]], named after the site of [[Saint-Acheul (Amiens)|Saint-Acheul]] in France. The Acheulean was characterised not by the core, but by the [[biface]], the most notable form of which was the [[hand axe]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke's "bifacially flaked hand axes."&lt;/ref&gt; The Acheulean first appears in the archaeological record as early as 1.7&amp;nbsp;million years ago in the [[Turkana District|West Turkana]] area of [[Kenya]] and contemporaneously in southern Africa.
[[File:Biface (trihedral) Amar Merdeg, Mehran, Ilam, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran.jpg|thumb|A Biface (trihedral) from Amar Merdeg, Zagros foothills, Lower Paleolithic, National Museum of Iran]]
The Leakeys, excavators at Olduvai, defined a "Developed Oldowan" Period in which they believed they saw evidence of an overlap in Oldowan and Acheulean. In their species-specific view of the two industries, Oldowan equated to ''H. habilis'' and Acheulean to ''H. erectus''. Developed Oldowan was assigned to ''habilis'' and Acheulean to ''erectus''. Subsequent dates on ''H. erectus'' pushed the fossils back to well before Acheulean tools; that is, ''H. erectus'' must have initially used Mode 1. There was no reason to think, therefore, that Developed Oldowan had to be ''habilis''; it could have been ''erectus''. Opponents of the view divide Developed Oldowan between Oldowan and Acheulean. There is no question, however, that ''habilis'' and ''erectus'' coexisted, as ''habilis'' fossils are found as late as 1.4 million years ago. Meanwhile, African ''H. erectus'' developed Mode 2. In any case a wave of Mode 2 then spread across Eurasia, resulting in use of both there. ''H. erectus'' may not have been the only hominin to leave Africa; European fossils are sometimes associated with ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', a contemporary of ''H. erectus'' in Africa.

In contrast to an Oldowan tool, which is the result of a fortuitous and probably [[ex tempore]] operation to obtain one sharp edge on a stone, an Acheulean tool is a planned result of a manufacturing process. The manufacturer begins with a blank, either a larger stone or a slab knocked off a larger rock. From this blank he or she removes large flakes, to be used as cores. Standing a core on edge on an anvil stone, he or she hits the exposed edge with centripetal blows of a hard hammer to roughly shape the implement. Then the piece must be worked over again, or retouched, with a soft hammer of wood or bone to produce a tool finely chipped all over consisting of two convex surfaces intersecting in a sharp edge. Such a tool is used for slicing; concussion would destroy the edge and cut the hand.

Some Mode 2 tools are disk-shaped, others ovoid, others leaf-shaped and pointed, and others elongated and pointed at the distal end, with a blunt surface at the proximal end, obviously used for drilling. Mode 2 tools are used for butchering; not being composite (having no haft) they are not very appropriate killing instruments. The killing must have been done some other way. Mode 2 tools are larger than Oldowan. The blank was ported to serve as an ongoing source of flakes until it was finally retouched as a finished tool itself. Edges were often sharpened by further retouching.

===Mode III: The Mousterian Industry===

{{Commons category|Mousterian}}

{{Main|Mousterian}}

Eventually, the Acheulean in Europe was replaced by a lithic technology known as the [[Mousterian Industry]], which was named after the site of [[Le Moustier]] in France, where examples were first uncovered in the 1860s. Evolving from the Acheulean, it adopted the [[Levallois technique]] to produce smaller and sharper knife-like tools as well as scrapers. Also known as the "prepared core technique," flakes are struck from worked cores and then subsequently retouched. &lt;ref&gt;Clarke's "flake tools from prepared cores."&lt;/ref&gt; The Mousterian Industry was developed and used primarily by the [[Neanderthals]], a native European and Middle Eastern hominin species, but a broadly similar industry is contemporaneously widespread in Africa. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Pettitt |first=Paul | year=2009 | contribution=The Rise of Modern Humans | title=The Human Past: World Prehistory and the Development of Human Societies | edition=2nd | editor-first=Chris | editor-last=Scarre | location=London | publisher=Thames and Hudson | pages=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mode IV: The Aurignacian Industry===
The widespread use of long [[lithic blade|blade]]s (rather than flakes) of the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] Mode 4 industries appeared during the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, although blades were still produced in small quantities much earlier by Neanderthals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lewin | first=R. |last2=Foley |first2=R. A. | year=2004 | title=Principles of Human Evolution |edition=2 | publisher=Blackwell Science |location=UK | isbn=0-632-04704-6 | page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aurignacian]] culture seems to have been the first to rely largely on blades &lt;ref&gt;Clarke's "punch-struck blades with steep retouch."&lt;/ref&gt; The use of blades exponentially increases the efficiency of core usage compared to the Levallois flake technique, which had a similar advantage over Acheulean technology which was worked from cores.

===Mode V: The Microlithic Industries===
{{double image|right|Arpón con microlitos.png|100|Tværmose arrow (Denmark).png|100|The most widely accepted hypothesis is that geometric microliths were used on projectiles such as this harpoon.|Trapezoid microliths and arrow with a trapeze used to strengthen the tip, found in a peat bog at Tværmose (Denmark)}}

{{Main|Microlith}}

Mode 5 stone tools involve the production of [[microlith]]s, which were used in composite tools, mainly fastened to a shaft.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke's "microlithic components of composite artifacts."&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Magdalenian]] culture. Such a technology makes much more efficient use of available materials like flint, although required greater skill in manufacturing the small flakes. Mounting sharp flint edges in a wood or bone handle is the key innovation in microliths, essentially because the handle gives the user protection against the flint and also improves leverage of the device.

In prehistoric [[Japan]], ground stone tools appear during the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, that lasted from around 40,000 BC to 14,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;"Prehistoric Japan, New perspectives on insular East Asia", Keiji Imamura, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, {{ISBN|0-8248-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere, ground stone tools became important during the [[Neolithic]] period beginning about 10,000 BC. These ground or polished implements are manufactured from larger-grained materials such as [[basalt]], [[jade]] and [[jadeite]], [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] and some forms of [[rhyolite]] which are not suitable for flaking. The greenstone industry was important in the [[English Lake District]], and is known as the [[Langdale axe industry]]. Ground stone implements included [[adze]]s, [[celt (tool)|celt]]s, and [[axe]]s, which were manufactured using a labour-intensive, time-consuming method of repeated grinding against an abrasive stone, often using water as a lubricant. Because of their coarse surfaces, some ground stone tools were used for grinding plant foods and were polished not just by intentional shaping, but also by use. [[Mano (stone)|Manos]] are hand stones used in conjunction with [[metate]]s for grinding corn or grain. Polishing increased the intrinsic [[mechanical strength]] of the axe. Polished stone axes were important for the widespread clearance of woods and forest during the Neolithic period, when crop and livestock farming developed on a large scale. They are distributed very widely and were traded over great distances since the best rock types were often very local. They also became venerated objects, and were frequently buried in [[long barrow]]s or [[round barrow]]s with their former owners.

During the [[Neolithic]] period, large axes were made from flint [[nodule (geology)|nodule]]s by chipping a rough shape, a so-called "rough-out". Such products were traded across a wide area. The rough-outs were then polished to give the surface a fine finish to create the axe head. Polishing not only increased the final strength of the product but also meant that the head could penetrate wood more easily.

There were many sources of supply, including [[Grimes Graves]] in [[Suffolk]], [[Cissbury]] in [[Sussex]] and [[Spiennes]] near [[Mons]] in [[Belgium]] to mention but a few. In [[Great Britain|Britain]], there were numerous small quarries in [[downland]] areas where flint was removed for local use, for example.

Many other rocks were used to make axes from stones, including the [[Langdale axe industry]] as well as numerous other sites such as [[Penmaenmawr]] and [[Tievebulliagh]] in [[Co Antrim]], [[Ulster]]. In Langdale, there many [[outcrop]]s of the [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] were exploited, and knapped where the stone was extracted. The sites exhibit piles of waste flakes, as well as rejected rough-outs. Polishing improved the [[mechanical strength]] of the tools, so increasing their life and effectiveness. Many other tools were developed using the same techniques. Such products were traded across the country and abroad.

==Modern uses==
The invention of the [[flintlock]] gun mechanism in the sixteenth century produced a demand for specially shaped [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflints]].&lt;ref&gt;Flayderman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Flint#To ignite fire or gunpowder|gunflint]] industry survived until the middle of the twentieth century in some places, including in the English town of [[Brandon, Suffolk|Brandon]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, R (1935), The Flint-knapping Industry at Brandon, ''Antiquity'', vol. IX&lt;/ref&gt;

For specialist purposes [[Glass knife|glass knives]] are still made and used today, particularly for cutting [[thin section]]s for [[electron microscopy]] in a technique known as [[microtomy]]. Freshly cut blades are always used since the sharpness of the edge is very great. These knives are made from high-quality manufactured [[glass]], however, not from natural raw materials such as chert or obsidian. Surgical knives made from [[obsidian]] are still used in some delicate surgeries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/lab/howto/protocols/glassknife.stm Glass Knife Making] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310060530/http://synapses.clm.utexas.edu/lab/howto/protocols/glassknife.stm |date=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Struve [[Geodesy|Geodetic]] Arc''' is a chain of survey [[Triangulation_(surveying)|triangulations]] stretching from [[Hammerfest]] in Norway to the [[Black Sea]], through ten countries and over 2,820&amp;nbsp;km, which yielded the first accurate measurement of a meridian.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

The chain was established and used by the German-born Russian scientist [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] in the years 1816 to 1855 to establish the [[Reference ellipsoid|exact size and shape]] of the [[earth]]. At that time, the chain passed merely through two countries: [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Union of Sweden-Norway]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. The Arc's first point is located in [[Tartu Observatory]] in Estonia, where Struve conducted much of his research.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

In 2005, the chain was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] as a memorable ensemble of the chain made up of 34 commemorative plaques or built obelisks out of the original 265 main station points which are marked by drilled holes in rock, iron crosses, cairns, others.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

Measurement of the triangulation chain comprises 258 main triangles and 265 geodetic vertices. The northernmost point is located near Hammerfest in Norway and the southernmost point near the Black Sea in Ukraine. This inscription is located in ten countries, the most of any UNESCO World Heritage.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

At publication in 1858, the flattening of the earth was estimated at one part in 294.26. The earth's equatorial radius was estimated at 6,378,360.7 metres.&lt;ref name=nor&gt;[[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]],Dronningensg 13, P.O.Box 8196, Dep. 0034, [[Oslo]], Norway (2005), ''Norwegian Points on The Struve Geodetic Arc'' (pamphlet)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the work was repeated using satellite navigation. The new flattening estimate was one part in 298.257 222 101 and the equatorial radius was 6,378,136.8 metres.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

An earlier survey, in 1740, had given flattening at one part in 178 and an equatorial radius of 6,396,800 metres.&lt;ref name=nor/&gt;

'''Suasa '''was an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] town in what is now the ''[[comune]]'' of [[Castelleone di Suasa]], [[Marche]], [[Italy]]. It is located in the Pian Volpello locality, in the valley of the [[Cesano River]].

==History==
Suasa was founded by the Romans in the early 3rd century BC, after the [[Battle of Sentinum]] (295 BC), in a territory inhabited by the [[Senones]]. The town was crossed by a secondary trait of the [[Via Flaminia]] and by the [[Via Salaria Gallica]], which connected it to ''Forum Sempronii'' ([[Fossombrone]]) and [[ancient Ostra|Ostra]]. In 232 BC, it became a prefecture and, in the 1st century BC, a ''[[municipium]]''.

Suasa started to decline from the 3rd century; in 409, it was sacked by [[Alarich I|Alarich]]'s [[Goths]] during his march against Rome (see [[sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]]). It was abandoned in the 6th century after the [[Gothic War (6th century)|Gothic War]], the population moving to nearby settlements.

The remains have been axcavated by the [[University of Bologna]] since 1987. The edifices found include:
*an amphitheater
*a theater
*the ''Coiedii [[domus]]''
*a late-Republican era ''domus''
*the ''[[cardo maximus]]''
*a [[necropolis]]

== The Archaeological Park ==
[[Image:Anfiteatro di Suasa - Ingresso all'arena.JPG|thumb|250px|Entrance to Suasa amphitheater from a ''[[vomitorium]]''.]]
The Suasa archaeological park is an archaeological area in Castelleone di Suasa (province of Ancona, Marche, Italy).

It includes the remains of the ancient town of Suasa, abandoned in the 6th century AD. The open-air museum of a Roman house (the Coiedii domus), of great interest because its size and architectonic complexity, can be visited in the park.

The domus was inhabited over a long period, reaching its maximum splendour in the 2nd century AD. The mosaics discovered in the interior are splendid and are the most important unitary complex of the Marches. Mythological, floral, and geometric scenes can be admired, but above all, a magnificent marble floor created with over fifteen different kinds of stone.

An avant-garde roofing and super-elevated passageways make the visit easily available.

The large amphitheatre lies at the foot of the hill. During the summer season evocative theatrical performances are held there

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="889">A '''tactile voting device''' is a device to enable a visually impaired person to mark a ballot paper in secret. 

The plastic device is attached to a ballot paper, and consists of a number of flaps, each covering one of the boxes on the paper. A number, corresponding to the box covered, is embossed in black on each flap. The number shows up well against the white background of the ballot paper, and is raised so it can be identified by touch.

Once the voter knows which number corresponds to each candidate or option, they lift the relevant flap or flaps, so they know where to make their mark.

In the [[United Kingdom]], all polling stations are legally required to provide a tactile voting device to any visually impaired voter.&lt;ref&gt;NI Direct,

'''''The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Robin Moore]] first published in 1969 about the notorious "[[French Connection]]" drug trafficking scheme. It is followed by the book ''[[The Setup (book)|The Setup]]''. The book was adapted to film in 1971 as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', written by [[Ernest Tidyman]] and directed by [[William Friedkin]].

==Overview==
The story follows the exhausting investigation of New York City detectives [[Eddie Egan]] and [[Sonny Grosso]] as they attempt to uncover the participants of a major drug ring.  Acting on a hunch, the detectives begin surveillance on [[Pasquale Fuca|Pasquale "Patsy" Fuca]], who was observed in a nightclub consorting with known criminals.  It soon becomes apparent that Fuca is involved in a large drug trafficking operation, including two Frenchmen: [[Jean Jehan]], the main person responsible for importing the heroin shipment to the United States, and [[Jacques Angelvin]], a television personality.

'''''Valley of the Wolves: Iraq''''' ({{lang-tr|Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak}}) is a 2006 [[Cinema of Turkey|Turkish]] [[action film]] directed by [[Serdar Akar]] and starring [[Necati Şaşmaz]], [[Billy Zane]] and [[Ghassan Massoud]]. The story concerns a Turkish commando team which goes to [[Iraq]] to track down the [[US military]] commander responsible for the [[Hood event]].

The film is set during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]] and includes references to other real events such as the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib prison scandal]]. The film, which went on nationwide general release across Turkey on {{start date|2006|02|03}}, was the highest-grossing Turkish films of 2006 and is one of the most expensive [[Turkey|Turkish]] films ever made.

It is part of the ''[[Valley of the Wolves]]'' media franchise, based on [[Valley of the Wolves (TV series)|the Turkish television series of the same name]], and was followed by ''[[Valley of the Wolves: Gladio]]'' (2008) and ''[[Valley of the Wolves: Palestine]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Luke | last=Harding

Filmed with a budget of [[U.S. dollar|$]]14 million, this was the most expensive Turkish film ever made at the time of its release before being surpassed by [[A.R.O.G.]].&lt;ref name=nyt1 /&gt; The film grossed $27.9 million at the box office — $25.1 million in Turkey and $2.8 million in [[Europe]].

Opinions of the film greatly varied.

==Background==
The film covers through fiction real-life events like the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]], [[Daniel Pearl|the execution of Daniel Pearl]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture scandal]]. Nevertheless, the film's primary focus is [[Hood Event|the Hood event]] ({{lang-tr|Çuval Olayı}}), an incident on July 4, 2003 following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] where a group of [[Turkish Armed Forces|Turkish military personnel]] operating in northern [[Iraq]] were captured, led away with [[Hood (headgear)|hood]]s over their heads, and interrogated by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]].

The arrest is infamous in Turkey as the so-called "Hood event". The soldiers were led out of their headquarters at gunpoint, with hoods over their heads and subsequently detained for sixty hours before being released, after [[Turkey]] protested to the United States. This was the first time such an incident had taken place between the two NATO allies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Though neither side ever apologized, a US-Turkish commission set up to investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = | last= 
|pages= | title= Regret over Turkish troops' arrest| date= 2003-07-15| work= [[BBC News]]| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3067319.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[US Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] wrote a letter to the [[Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], expressing sorrow over what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=abundance-of-rumsfeld-letters-in-turkish-press-2003-07-20 Abundance of 'Rumsfeld letters' in Turkish press] ''[[Hürriyet Daily News]]'', 7/20/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Many Turks took offense at the incident while it lasted, and after it as well.

==Plot==
The film opens with a fictional depiction of a real-life incident, the "[[Hood event]]". On July 4, 2003, the Turkish soldiers believe they are having an ordinary visit from their [[NATO]] allies, but a sudden change occurs, and 11 allied Turkish [[special forces]] soldiers and 13 civilians are arrested by Colonel Sam William Marshall ([[Billy Zane]]), in the northern Iraq town of [[Sulaymaniyah]]. They are forced to wear hoods while in detention, and are released some time later.

A Turkish officer named Suleyman Aslan, who was a member of the special forces troops involved in the Hood event, is unable to bear the shame of what happened, and commits suicide. Before doing so, he writes a letter saying goodbye to his friend, Polat Alemdar ([[Necati Şaşmaz]]). Alemdar is a former Turkish intelligence agent who has recently severed links to the government agency for which he worked. Determined to avenge his friend's humiliation, Alemdar travels to [[Iraq]] along with several of his colleagues, seeking vengeance on the American commander whose actions led to Aslan's suicide.

At a checkpoint, Alemdar and his team kill three Iraqi Kurdish paramilitary troops called "[[Peshmerga|Peshmerge]]". They attach explosives to the foundation of a hotel, to which they demand Colonel Sam William Marshall, who was responsible for the hooding incident, come. When Marshall arrives, Polat wants him to put a sack over his head and to publicly leave the hotel with him, allowing journalists to take photos, taking the same insult he committed to Polat's dead friend. The group threatens to blow up the hotel unless Marshall and some of his men let themselves be led out of the hotel while hooded. Marshall refuses and brings in a group of Iraqi children as [[human shield]]s. Alemdar gives in and leaves.

Marshall raids an Arab wedding on the pretext of hunting [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|"terrorists"]]. When the usual celebratory gunfire starts, one soldier states: "Now they are shooting, now they are terrorists"; they attack a wedding party, where a small child named Ali sticks a branch up the barrel of one of the soldiers' guns. At first, the soldier just hushes the boy away; the second time, he opens fire and afterwards looks astonished as he sees the little child dead. The rest of the soldiers panic and open fire on the wedding guests, beat up the bride, shoot the groom, the guests and children. The survivors are captured and forced into an airtight container truck and sent to [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.

En route to Abu Ghraib, an American soldier complains that the prisoners might be suffocating in the truck. One of Marshall's men then fires on the truck, spraying the detainees with bullets. "See, now they won't suffocate to death", he says. When the soldier threatens to report the incident, he is promptly shot. In Abu Ghraib, a group of American soldiers, among them the sole female Westerner in the film (a clear reference to [[Lynndie England]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture scandal]]), is making naked human pyramids from those arrested in the wedding, aided by an Arab interpreter. The prisoners are washed with high pressure nozzles in what appears to be cattle stalls.

In a later scene, the [[Daniel Pearl|execution of a Western journalist]] by Iraqi rebels is about to take place, but the [[sheikh]] Abdurrahman Halis Karkuki, who is esteemed by the rebels, prevents it, and offers the journalist the opportunity to kill the rebel who was about to kill him. The rebel does not resist, but the journalist declines the offer. Thereafter, the bride who survived the earlier massacre, Leyla, wants revenge by becoming a [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]], but is talked out of it by the Sheikh. Leyla hurries to a market to stop her brother-in-law Abu Ali, the father of the child killed at the wedding, from blowing himself up in the place where Col. Marshall is having a meeting, but she arrives too late. Alemdar and his men, who are there to assassinate Marshall, are led to safety by Leyla.

Alemdar and his team then attempt to kill Marshall again by rigging a bomb in a piano (which once belonged to [[Saddam Hussein]]) that is being delivered to Marshall as a gift. The bomb explodes prematurely, and Marshall survives. Alemdar and Leyla then go to a mosque, to meet the sheikh. Marshall tracks them down, however, and a big firefight ensues. The entire village and mosque are destroyed by heavy gunfire. Together they manage to kill Marshall, but Leyla is also killed by Marshall.

==Controversy==
The film upset some viewers for its heavy and incriminating subject matter. Some{{Who|date=August 2012}} have criticized it for alleged stereotyping and "black and white" portrayal of the opposing forces.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,401565,00.html |title=Controversy Over Turkish Movie: Beyond the Valley of the Wolves - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy arrives mainly from the following scenes:

* In one sequence, American soldiers raid an Iraqi wedding and massacre a number of civilians, which might be an allusion to a [[Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre|wedding party massacre]] perpetrated by US forces caught on tape in Mukaradeeb on May 19, 2004.
* U.S. soldiers torture detainees in [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib prison]], which includes a female soldier making a human pyramid, referring to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] by US soldiers. It is the first depiction of actions by American soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison ever to appear on film.
* While captives are transported on a long journey in a container on a truck, one guard says to the other: "They might suffocate in the container because there is no fresh air supply". The truck stops, the American guard gets off the truck and fires hundreds of bullet-holes into the container with an automatic weapon "in order to make holes for the air to get in", and as a result many detainees are injured or get killed. A similar event is reported to have occurred in [[Afghanistan]] after the battle for [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] on November 9, 2001, with [[Taliban]] soldiers in the container and soldiers of the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] as their guardians, as described in the documentary film ''[[Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death]]'' by [[Ireland|Irish]] filmmaker [[Jamie Doran]]. This event is also reenacted in the film ''[[The Road to Guantanamo]]''.
* The film features a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] [[U.S. Army]] doctor ([[Gary Busey]]) who, as an inhuman figure common in urban legends and [[anti-Semitic]] propaganda, removes organs from injured civilian prisoners to sell to rich people in [[New York City|New York]], [[London]] and [[Tel-Aviv]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]].

== Scriptwriter and director point of view ==
The film's scriptwriter Bahadir Ozdener has defined the film by saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifeinmotion.wordpress.com/2007/02/11/valley-of-the-wolves-iraq/ |title=Review at |publisher=lifeinmotion.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our film is a sort of political action. Maybe 60 or 70 percent of what happens on screen is factually true. Turkey and America are allies, but Turkey wants to say something to its friend. We want to say the bitter truth. We want to say that this is wrong.}}

The movie's director, Serdar Akar, went further and said the film was supposed to promote a dialogue between religions.&lt;ref name="Letsch 2006"&gt;{{de icon}} Letsch, Constanze, "Dialog der Kulturen", in ''Jungle World'', 2006-02-22, {{ISSN|1613-0766}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reception==
{{Prose|section|date=May 2018}}

===Turkey===
* The film has pulled in record audiences on its release in Turkey, capitalizing on widespread opposition to the [[Iraq War]].
* When asked about the factual nature of the scenario, [[Bülent Arınç]], the chairman of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Parliament]], replied "yes, this was exactly as it happened". He called the movie "an extraordinary film that will go into history".&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Letsch, 2006: "ein extraordinärer Film, der Geschichte machen wird".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foreign minister [[Abdullah Gul]] states that "the film is no worse than some of the productions of Hollywood studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medienkritik.typepad.com/blog/2006/02/hollywood_stars.html |title='&amp;#39;US Hollywood "Stars" Zane and Busey Spreading America-Hate Worldwide'&amp;#39; Feb '06 |publisher=medienkritik.typepad.com |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Istanbul]] mayor [[Kadir Topbaş]] told the ''[[Associated Press]]'' that the movie "was very successful — a soldier's honor must never be damaged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11150082/ |title=New Turkish film {{sic|villifies|nolink=y}} Americans|publisher=[Amer[MSNBC]]|date=2006-02-02|accessdate=2012-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reception in the Turkish media was split. Some called it a milestone for the Turkish film industry — others warned the movie might lead to a strengthening of religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Letsch 2006"/&gt;
* [[Mehmet Ali Birand]], a prominent Turkish columnist and anchorman, said he admired the filmmakers. "They have played with the inner feelings, unsatisfied feelings of Turkish public opinion, and they are making money."{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

=== Germany ===
* In Germany, the home of [[European Union]]'s largest Turkish community, the film was heavily criticized for its alleged racism and [[antisemitism]] by several politicians{{Who|date=August 2012}} from both the right and left ends of the spectrum of mainstream German politics and in several leading newspapers{{Which|date=August 2012}}{{Where|date=August 2012}}. As a reviewer in the mainstream magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' put it, referring to the film's reliance on a revenge motif, "This wouldn't be so bad if the film didn't portray the opponents of Turks and Muslims so brutally — the bad guys in this black and white world are the Americans, the Kurds, the Christians and the Jews.&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt;
* In an interview with ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild am Sonntag]]'' on February 19, 2006, [[Bavaria]]n premier [[Edmund Stoiber]] called upon German theatre owners to stop showing ''Valley of the Wolves''. Shortly afterward, Germany's largest cinema chain, [[CinemaxX]], pulled the film, which had been popular among Germany's large Turkish community, from its theatres in response to the criticism from politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0072910/ |title=''German Movie Chain Pulls Anti-American Flick''|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2006-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film won a [[Bogey Awards|Bogey Award]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for Kurtlar vadisi – Irak|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493264/awards|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The Central Council of Jews", a Jewish-German organization, have expressed its opinion that ''Valley of the Wolves – Iraq'' (''Kurtlar Vadisi – Irak'') holds [[antisemitic]] views, and is racist. It requested German cinemas stop showing the film.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===United States===
* The film has received only minor exposure in the United States and is not widely known.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* On [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] ''[[The Daily Show]]'', [[Jon Stewart]] lampooned actors [[Billy Zane]] and [[Gary Busey]], in an attempt to satirize the mainstream media's reaction to the film. During the same segment, several clips were played from American films portraying unidentified terrorists of [[Muslim]], [[Arab]] or [[Middle East]]ern extraction. The segment juxtaposes the stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in Hollywood films from the 1980s and 90s to the reactions of mainstream American media pundits regarding the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/ezkzwz/film-threat|title=Film Threat - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart - 02/16/06 - Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Thedailyshow.com |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2012-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U.S. Army]] recommended that Army personnel overseas not approach cinemas in which the movie is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=34008&amp;archive=true |title=Article archive |publisher=Estripes.com |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128151536/http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104 |archivedate=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an actor, not a politician." When asked about the moral and ethical implications of portraying what could be construed as an antisemitic stereotype in a foreign movie, Roberts declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395417918&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530170851/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395417918&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international relations '''violent non-state actors''' ('''VNSA''') (also known as '''non-state armed actors''' or '''non-state armed groups''') are individuals and groups that are wholly or partly independent of [[state government]]s and which threaten or use violence to achieve their goals.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}

VNSAs vary widely in their goals, size, and methods. They may include [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics cartels]], popular [[liberation movements]], religious and ideological organizations, [[corporations]] (e.g. [[Private military company|private military contractors]]), self-defence [[militia]], and [[Paramilitary|paramilitary groups]] established by state governments to further their interests.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}}{{Sfn|Chatham House|2016|p=8}}

While some VNSAs oppose governments, others are allied to them.{{Sfn|Hofmann and Schneckener|2011|p=2-3}} Some VNSAs are organized as paramilitary groups, adopting methods and structure similar to those of state [[Military|armed forces]]. Others may be informally structured and use violence in other ways, such as kidnapping, using [[improvised explosive device]]s, or [[Security hacker|hacking]] into computer systems.

==Description==
{{See also|Non-state actor}}

[[File:Mara_Salvatrucha_Graffiti.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MS-13]] gang graffiti.]]

Thomas, Kiser, and Casebeer asserted in 2005 that "VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community".{{sfn|Thomas|Kiser|Casebeer|2005|p={{page needed|date=October 2012}}}} As a new type of actor in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional [[Westphalian sovereignty]] system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance; and by challenging the state's [[monopoly of violence]].

Phil Williams stated in 2008 that in the 21st century, they "have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep4"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to the further undermining of governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are "unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations", "individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; This causes the family, tribe, clan or other group to become "the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6" /&gt; According to Williams, globalization has "not only... challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs".&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. Globalization helps VNSAs develop transnational social capital and alliances as well as funding opportunities.&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep6-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=6—7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been used in several papers published by the [[US military]].{{sfn|Casebeer|Thomas|2002}}{{sfn|Bartolomei|Casebeer|Thomas|2004}}{{sfn|Thomas|Casebeer|2004}}{{sfn|Shultz|Farah|Lochard|2004|}}

== Types ==
Some common and influential types of VNSAs include:
* Criminal organizations. [[Drug cartel]]s, for example, may carry out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions; operate protection rackets; and [[wikt:turf war|defend their ''turf'']] from rival groups and the military.
* [[Social movement|People's movements]] or sections of them that have chosen [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] (also known as [[asymmetric warfare]]) to pursue their aims. An example is the [[Naxalite–Maoist insurgency|Naxalite-Maoist insurgency]] in central India.{{Sfn|Economist|2006|p=}}
* [[Private military company|Private military companies]], and corporations that either have their own, or hire, private military services.{{Sfn|Daugaard|2012|p=}} An example is [[Floating armoury|floating armouries]] in the Indian Ocean.{{Sfn|Holtom and Chapsos|2015|p=}}
* Religious or ideological groups, such as [[Boko Haram]] in and around Nigeria, that espouse armed violence as a moral or sacred duty.{{Sfn|Drake|1998|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=30-31}}
* Citizen militia, which may form to protect a locality from (or threaten it with) attack, such as the [[Anti-balaka|anti-balaka movement]] in the Central African Republic.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016b|p=4}}
* [[Paramilitary]] groups, which make use of military methods and structures to pursue their agenda, such as the now-decommissioned Irish Republican Army.
* [[Warlord]]s, who are leaders using armed violence to exercise military, economic, and political control over territory within a sovereign state. Warlords have a long history in Afghanistan, for example.{{Sfn|Coll|2004|p=4}}
Phil Williams, in an overview article, identifies five types of VNSAs:&lt;ref name="violentnonstatep9-16"&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|2008|p=9—16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Warlord]]s
* [[Militia]]s
* [[Insurgency|Insurgencies]]
* [[List of designated terrorist organizations|Terrorist organizations]]
* [[Criminal organization]]s and gangs

== Relationship to terrorism ==
There is no commonly accepted [[Definitions of terrorism|definition of "terrorism"]],{{Sfn|Emmerson|2016|p=10-11}}{{Sfn|Halibozek et al|2008|p=4-5}}{{Sfn|Williamson|2009|p=38}} and the term is frequently used as a political tactic to denounce opponents whose status as [[Terrorism|terrorists]] is disputed.{{Sfn|Sinclair and Antonius|2012|p=14}} An attempt at a global definition appears in the working draft of Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism, which defines terrorism as a type of act, rather than as a type of group.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}} Specifically, "terrorism" in the draft refers to the threatened or actual intentional injury to others, and serious damage to property resulting in major economic loss:{{quote|when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.{{Sfn|UN General Assembly|2005|p=8-9}}}}

Since the definition encompasses the actions of some violent non-state actors (and of some state actors) and not others, disagreements remain and the treaty has yet to be agreed, {{as of|lc=yes|2015}}.{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}} For example, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] has called for acts of terrorism to be distinguished from:{{quote|the legitimate struggle of peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination in the exercise of their right to [[self-determination]] in accordance with the principles of [[international law]]".{{Sfn|European Parliament|2015|p=}}}}

== Use of children ==

{{See also|Children in the military|Child soldiers in Africa|Impact of war on children}}

Violent non-state actors have drawn international condemnation for relying heavily on children under the age of 18 as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}} (although many state armed forces also recruit children).{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2012|p=}} In 2017, for example, the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, [[Child soldiers in the Central African Republic|Central African Republic]], [[Child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of the Congo]], Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, The Philippines, [[Child soldiers in Somalia|Somalia]], South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Not all armed groups use children, and approximately 60 that used to do so have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999.{{Sfn|Child Soldiers International|2016a|p=4}} For example, by 2017 the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) in the [[Philippines]] had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks,{{Sfn|UNICEF|2017|p=}} and the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC-EP]] guerilla movement in Colombia agreed in 2016 to stop recruiting children.{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=41}} In other situations, the use of children was increasing in 2017, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them intensified efforts to recruit children.{{Sfn|Human Rights Watch|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|UN Secretary-General|2017|p=}}

==Humanitarian engagement==

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] propose that engagement with VNSAs, which they call armed non-state actors, is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts. They claim that it is often necessary to do so to facilitate access to those affected and to provide humanitarian assistance.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}} However, humanitarian agencies often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly because of the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs in counterterrorism legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion, further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs.{{sfn|Jackson|2012}}

The International Security Department and the International Law Programme at Chatham House are seeking to understand the dynamics that will determine support for a principle-based approach to engagement by humanitarian actors with VNSAs.{{sfn|''Chatham House''}}

Her research interests include [[bilingualism|bilingual language acquisition]], [[second language acquisition]], Cantonese, Chaozhou and comparative Sinitic grammar, [[psycholinguistics]], and [[cognitive science]].

==Biography==
Virginia Yip received her B.A. in [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Texas]] at Austin and her Ph.D. from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dornsife.usc.edu/ling/phdrecipients/|title=Ph.D. Recipients &gt; Department of Linguistics &gt; USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences|website=dornsife.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the author of ''Interlanguage and Learnability: from Chinese to English'' (Benjamins) and co-author of a series of works on Cantonese grammar published by Routledge: ''Cantonese: A Comprehensive Grammar'' (which has been translated into Japanese), ''Basic Cantonese'' and ''Intermediate Cantonese''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/products/search?author=Virginia%20Yip|title=Product Search - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her team have created the Hong Kong Bilingual Child Language Corpus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/lin/home/bilingual.htm|title=Link|website=www.cuhk.edu.hk|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first longitudinal bilingual corpus in which Cantonese is represented along with English, and the largest multimedia bilingual corpus in the Child Language Data Exchange System ([[CHILDES]]) based at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

Yip is married to linguist [[Stephen Matthews (linguist)|Stephen Matthews]] from the [[University of Hong Kong]]. They have  three bilingual children: a son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/special/art/20160222/19500478 【妙論粵語】英國教授唱《一生何求》學廣東話]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hong Kong Bilingual Child Language Corpus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/lin/home/bilingual.htm|title=Link|website=www.cuhk.edu.hk|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

The Hong Kong Bilingual Child Language Corpus, which is reported in 2005 as the world's largest video-linked database of children becoming bilingual, created by Yip, and her husband, [[Stephen Matthews (linguist)|Stephen Matthews]] from The [[University of Hong Kong]] — features 170 hours of audio and video files of four families raising their children bilingually in Cantonese and English. The project, which includes transcripts and searchable video and audio segments, took 10 years to compile.

This database has already been the data source for several undergraduate and graduate dissertations in Hong Kong, and it is the basis of a book, The ''Bilingual Child'', written by Yip and Matthews and published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2007. The database focuses on children who are bilingual in English and Cantonese and who learned to speak two languages through the one-parent, one-language approach. Using that method, one parent speaks to the child in one language, and the other parent speaks to the child in another.

[[File:Batenburg gevelsteen, Prinsengracht, Amsterdam.JPG|thumb|200px|Batenburg ("profit castle") gevelsteen, [[Amsterdam]]]]
A '''visual pun''' is a [[pun]] involving an [[image]] or images (in addition to or instead of [[language]]), often based on a [[rebus]].

Visual puns in which the image is at odds with the inscription are common in [[cartoon]]s such as ''Lost Consonants'' or ''[[The Far Side]]'' as well as in Dutch [[gable stone]]s. For instance the "Batenburg" stone from [[Prinsengracht]], Amsterdam, shown here, puns on the words ''baten'' (to profit) and ''burg'' (castle) which together make up the name of [[Batenburg|a village]] near [[Nijmegen]]. European [[heraldry]] contains the technique of [[canting arms]], which can be considered punning.

== Examples ==
* In ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', while Kermit and Fozzie are driving.  Kermit looks at the map and says they need to turn at the fork in the road.  At this point he lowers the map and they see a giant fork (the cutlery) in the middle of the road.
* In ''[[Spaceballs]]'', Dark Helmet tries to order his troops to comb the desert for his adversaries.  The next scene depicts troopers with giant combs, literally combing the desert.
* In ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]'', when Mario picks up a "fire flower", he becomes fiery. "Fire flower" in Japanese is literally 火花 (hi-bana; fire-flower), meaning spark, hence he is picking up a "spark".
* In ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]'' by [[Jan Švankmajer]], there are a number of visual puns, including: socks in holes (socks crawling into and out of holes, punning on "holes in socks"); Alice opens a [[sardine]] can to reveal a key, punning on the [[Church key|key]] used to open a sardine can.
* In the 1976 version of ''[[The Omen]]'', after speaking with Mr. Thorn (Gregory Peck), a [[nun]] steps into a [[paternoster]] lift - the name meaning "[[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]]".
* The [[:File:CLEP.png|logo]] of the [[Chinese Lunar Exploration Program]] is a stylized 月 (Chinese character for "moon"), but is also a pair of human feet, surrounded by a crescent moon, symbolizing "walking on the moon".
* In the 2015 film ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', Riley Andersen's [[train of thought]] is literally a train. In another scene, as Riley's dad is about to give her broccoli, Anger is reading a newspaper titled ''"The Mind Reader"''. In the film Anger is a [[wiktionary:hothead|hothead]] and has a hot head that explodes.
* In ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the final scene of [[Luke Skywalker]] standing on a cliff is a [[cliffhanger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkAPmPDb_Ss|title=An Hour with Mark Hamill Panel {{!}} Star Wars Celebration Europe 2016|publisher=StarWars.com|website=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=23 December 2016|date=16 July 2016|quote=It's really literally a cliffhanger.

He was born in [[Ukraine]] (then a part of the [[Russian Empire]]) and fled to the United States in 1913 to avoid conscription into the army. He worked in sweatshops in [[Baltimore]] before gaining employment teaching at the city's Hebrew elementary schools, using his money to fund his studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Marrying Elsie Simonofsky &amp;ndash; a native of what is present-day [[Belarus]] who grew up in the United States &amp;ndash; they moved to Philadelphia, where they both began teaching at the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel (Philadelphia)|Mikveh Israel]] religious school.  William eventually rose to the position of school principal.

In 1924, he was appointed to the faculty at the country's oldest Jewish teacher training institution, [[Gratz College]], where he became faculty president in 1932. In 1955 he also began teaching courses at [[Dropsie College]]. Independently, he was involved in researching Medieval Hebrew, eventually authoring a series of books on the language: ''How to Teach Hebrew in the Elementary Grades'' (1946), ''Hebrew, the Story of a Living Language'' (1947), ''Hebrew, the Eternal Language'' (1957), ''Teaching and Learning'' (1959), and an edited version of ''David Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. pp. 9&amp;ndash;10.&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "very warm, gentle, and engaging" individual, William Chomsky placed a great emphasis on educating people so that they would be "well integrated, free and independent in their thinking, and eager to participate in making life more meaningful and worthwhile for all", a view that would subsequently be adopted by his son.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bar97|Barsky 1997]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Chomsky was born in [[Kupil]], [[Volhynian Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (in present-day [[Ukraine]]) in 1896. He taught as a professor at [[Gratz College]]. He became the faculty president of Gratz in 1932, a position that he held for 37 years. He also taught at [[Dropsie College]], a graduate school for Jewish and [[Semitic studies]] from 1955&amp;ndash;77. He was a renowned specialist of the history of the Hebrew grammatical tradition, before and after [[David Kimhi]] (1160&amp;ndash;1235). His obituary (''[[New York Times]]'', 22 July 1977) describes him as "one of the world's foremost Hebrew grammarians".

Chomsky was married to Elsie Simonofsky. The couple had two sons: [[Noam Chomsky|Noam]], a well-known linguist and activist; and David, a physician.
