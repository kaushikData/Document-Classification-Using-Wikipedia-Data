'''Accordent Technologies''' was a company that produces software for streaming media creation and management.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pick  [http://www.masternewmedia.org/presentation/corporate-marketing-communications/rich-media-design-management-delivery-system-for-enterprise-Accordent-20070329.htm Rich-Media Presentation Design, Management And Delivery For The Enterprise: Accordent]. ''MasterNewMedia.org '', 2007-03-29.Retrieved 2007-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are located in [[El Segundo, California]] and has sales and development offices in [[Seattle]], [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]] and [[Austin]].

Accordent pioneered solutions for creating presentations that synchronize streaming video with PowerPoint slides.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Ozer [http://blog.digitalcontentproducer.com/nab/2008/04/18/accordent-the-powerpoint-and-video-folks/]. '' Digital Content Producer '', 2008-04-18. Retrieved 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordent was listed in Hoovers &lt;ref&gt;Josh Lower, [http://premium.hoovers.com/subscribe/co/factsheet.xhtml?ID=116246]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. “Hoovers '', 2008-03-15.Retrieved 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  as a private company with over 50 employees and 2007 revenues reported to be in excess of $11 million.  The company says that its products are used by more than 1500 &lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;BOOYEON LEE, {{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_23_29/ai_n19296044 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014213447/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5072/is_23_29/ai_n19296044 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }} . “Los Angeles Business Journal '', 2007-06-04.Retrieved 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; clients worldwide, including 150 of the Fortune 500 corporations – such as VeriSign,&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Robart, [http://iptv.tmcnet.com/topics/iptv-technology/articles/25923-accordent-technologies-provide-enterprise-wide-webcasting-platform-verisign.htm]. “TMCnet '', [[, 2008-04-22]].Retrieved 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Marathon Petroleum, Unisys &lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;  and JPMorgan Chase – as well as over 450 higher educational and 125 public sector institutions.

The Accordent product line included multimedia management software that enable clients to manage, search and secure online multimedia presentations created with Accordent presentation products, as well as archived versions of content from third-party sources, such as archived versions of videoconferences from TANDBERG&lt;ref&gt;Tim Siglin, [http://www.streamingmedia.com/article.asp?id=9764&amp;page=1&amp;c=17]. Streaming Media Magazine '', 2007-11-15.Retrieved 2008-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and other manufacturers, web conferences and standalone videos.

Accordent was acquired by Polycom in 2011 for $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Siglin, [http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/polycom-acquires-accordent-video-content-management-technology/46423]. ZDNet,2011-03-23. Retrieved 2012-11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==

The market for online content management and delivery has seen the entry of several competitors to Accordent. Key in this industry vertical are companies like [http://www.granicus.com Granicus], which focus on Government webcasts by delivering session notes, meeting agenda, interactive voting, and live interactive webcasts designed to bring government to the public. Other companies that compete against Accordent Technologies are those that utilize the same underlying technologies, such as Sonic Foundry's [[Sonic Foundry|MediaSite]], a webcasting tool that has video plus interactive content similar to Accordent presentations. As the market for webcasting increases, other recognized leaders in the industry, such as Adobe, Echo360, Presentations2Go, Webex and others vie for market share. Newer products that utilize cross-platform capabilities, such as [[Adobe Flash]] or Microsoft [[Silverlight]], full-motion interactivity, and enhanced forms of user interaction are being developed.

In the [[content management system]] market, derived from the need to organize and store created presentations, long standing players such as Oracle, Microsoft's [[Windows Sharepoint Services|Sharepoint]], and The Platform have a large market share. Smaller open source content management systems such as [[Joomla]], [[Moodle]] and Angel have increased market presence due to their low cost and accessibility to the education market. In this market, more colleges and universities are increasing their online presence, called a [[Virtual Campus]] also known as Learning Management Systems. In this Virtual Campus setting, some notable Learning Management Systems such as Sakai, [[Blackboard]], Desire2Learn all compete directly with Accordent Technologies Media Management System in order to manage classroom content, testing and student coursework.

S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerogels are produced by extracting the liquid component of a gel through [[supercritical drying]]. This allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from [[capillary action]], as would happen with conventional [[evaporation]]. The first aerogels were produced from [[silica gel]]s. Kistler's later work involved aerogels based on [[alumina]], [[Chromium(III) oxide|chromia]] and [[tin dioxide]]. [[Carbon]] aerogels were first developed in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pekala|first=R. W.|title=Organic aerogels from the polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01139044|journal=Journal of Materials Science|language=en|volume=24|issue=9|pages=3221–3227|doi=10.1007/BF01139044|issn=0022-2461|bibcode=1989JMatS..24.3221P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aerogel is not a single material with a set chemical formula, instead the term is used to group all materials with a certain geometric structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1989|title=Organic aerogels from the polycondensation of resorcinol with formaldehyde|journal=[[Journal of Materials Science]]|volume=24|issue=9|pages=3221–3227|bibcode=1989JMatS..24.3221P|doi=10.1007/BF01139044|author=Pekala R.

==Properties==
[[File:Aerogelflower_filtered.jpg|right|thumb|A flower is on a piece of aerogel which is suspended over a flame from a [[Bunsen burner]]. Aerogel has excellent insulating properties, and the flower is protected from the flame.]] Despite the name, aerogels are solid, rigid, and dry materials that do not resemble a gel in their physical properties: the name comes from the fact that they are made ''from'' gels. Pressing softly on an aerogel typically does not leave even a minor mark; pressing more firmly will leave a permanent depression. Pressing extremely firmly will cause a catastrophic breakdown in the sparse structure, causing it to shatter like glass (a property known as ''[[friability]]''), although more modern variations do not suffer from this. Despite the fact that it is prone to shattering, it is very strong structurally. Its impressive load-bearing abilities are due to the [[Dendrite (metal)|dendritic]] microstructure, in which [[spherical]] particles of average size (2–5&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]) are fused together into clusters. These clusters form a three-dimensional highly [[Porosity|porous]] structure of almost [[fractal]] chains, with pores just under 100&amp;nbsp;nm. The average size and density of the pores can be controlled during the manufacturing process.

Aerogel is a material that is 99.8% air. Aerogels have a porous solid network that contains air pockets, with the air pockets taking up the majority of space within the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|title=What is Aerogel? Theory, Properties and Applications|date=12 December 2013|publisher=azom.com|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209123257/http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6499|archivedate=9 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of solid material allows aerogel to be almost weightless.

Aerogels are good [[Thermal insulation|thermal insulators]] because they almost nullify two of the three methods of [[heat transfer]] – conduction (they are mostly composed of insulating gas) and convection (the microstructure prevents net gas movement). They are good [[Heat conduction|conductive]] insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gases, which are very poor heat conductors. (Silica aerogel is an especially good insulator because silica is also a poor conductor of heat; a metallic or carbon aerogel, on the other hand, would be less effective.) They are good [[Convective heat transfer|convective]] inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice. Aerogels are poor [[Thermal radiation|radiative]] insulators because infrared radiation (which transfers heat) passes through them.

Owing to its [[hygroscopic]] nature, aerogel feels dry and acts as a strong [[desiccant]]. People handling aerogel for extended periods should wear gloves to prevent the appearance of dry brittle spots on their skin.

The slight color it does have is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the shorter [[wavelength]]s of [[visible light]] by the nano-sized dendritic structure. This causes it to appear smoky blue against dark backgrounds and yellowish against bright backgrounds.

Aerogels by themselves are [[hydrophilic]], but chemical treatment can make them [[hydrophobic]]. If they absorb moisture they usually suffer a structural change, such as contraction, and deteriorate, but degradation can be prevented by making them hydrophobic. Aerogels with hydrophobic interiors are less susceptible to degradation than aerogels with only an outer hydrophobic layer, even if a crack penetrates the surface.

== Knudsen effect ==
Aerogels may have a [[thermal conductivity]] smaller than that of the gas they contain. This is caused by the  [[Knudsen number|Knudsen effect]], a reduction of thermal conductivity in gases when the size of the cavity encompassing the gas becomes comparable to the [[mean free path]]. Effectively, the cavity restricts the movement of the gas particles, decreasing the thermal conductivity in addition to eliminating convection. For example, thermal conductivity of air is about 25&amp;nbsp;mW/m·K at STP and in a large container, but decreases to about 5&amp;nbsp;mW/m·K in a pore 30 nanometers in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Berge, Axel and Johansson, Pär (2012) [http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf Literature Review of High Performance Thermal Insulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121114200/http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/local_159807.pdf |date=21 November 2014 }}. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Aerogel structure results from a [[sol-gel]] [[polymerization]], which is when [[monomers]] (simple molecules) react with other monomers to form a sol or a substance that consists of bonded, cross-linked [[macromolecules]] with deposits of liquid solution between them.  When the material is critically heated the liquid is [[evaporated]] out and the bonded, [[cross-linked]] macromolecule frame is left behind.  The result of the polymerization and critical heating is the creation of a material that has a porous strong structure classified as aerogel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html Aerogel Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225170824/https://str.llnl.gov/str/Foxhighlight.html |date=25 December 2014 }}. Str.llnl.gov. Retrieved on 31 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in synthesis can alter the surface area and pore size of the aerogel. The smaller the pore size the more susceptible the aerogel is to fracture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerogel.org/?p=16|title=Silica Aerogel|last=|first=|date=|website=Aerogel.org|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404111603/http://www.aerogel.org/?p=16|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waterproofing ==
Aerogel contains particles that are 2–5&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.  After the process of creating aerogel, it will contain a large amount of [[hydroxyl groups]] on the surface.  The hydroxyl groups can cause a strong reaction when the aerogel is placed in water, causing it to catastrophically dissolve in the water.  One way to waterproof the [[hydrophilic]] aerogel is by soaking the aerogel with some chemical base that will replace the surface hydroxyl groups (–OH) with non-polar groups (–OR), a process which is most effective when ''R'' is an [[aliphatic]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.lbl.gov/ecs/aerogels/sa-chemistry.html Surface Chemistry : Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201035010/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-chemistry.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

There are several ways to determine the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas [[adsorption]], mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent on the size of the pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its [[saturation pressure]].  The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula ([[BET theory|BET]]), which gives the specific [[surface area]] of the sample.  At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample.  In mercury porosimetry, the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force.  The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample.  The sample can be solid particles or pores.  The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network.  The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons.  Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.lbl.gov/ecs/aerogels/sa-pore.html Pore Structure : Silica Aerogels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141201064113/http://energy.lbl.gov/ECS/aerogels/sa-pore.html |date=1 December 2014 }}.

The silica solidifies into three-dimensional, intertwined clusters that make up only 3% of the volume. Conduction through the solid is therefore very low. The remaining 97% of the volume is composed of air in extremely small nanopores. The air has little room to move, inhibiting both convection and gas-phase conduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerogel.com/resources/about-aerogel/|title=About Aerogel|publisher=ASPEN AEROGELS, INC.|accessdate=12 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526131958/http://www.aerogel.com/resources/about-aerogel/|archivedate=26 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carbon ===
[[Carbon]] aerogels are composed of particles with sizes in the [[nanometer]] range, [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] together. They have very high [[porosity]] (over 50%, with pore diameter under 100&amp;nbsp;nm) and surface areas ranging between 400–1,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g. They are often manufactured as composite paper: non-woven paper made of [[carbon fiber]]s, impregnated with [[resorcinol]]–[[formaldehyde]] aerogel, and [[Pyrolisis|pyrolyzed]]. Depending on the density, carbon aerogels may be electrically conductive, making composite aerogel paper useful for electrodes in [[capacitor]]s or deionization electrodes. Due to their extremely high surface area, carbon aerogels are used to create [[supercapacitor]]s, with values ranging up to thousands of [[farad]]s based on a capacitance density of 104&amp;nbsp;F/g and 77&amp;nbsp;F/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Carbon aerogels are also extremely "black" in the infrared spectrum, reflecting only 0.3% of radiation between 250&amp;nbsp;nm and 14.3&amp;nbsp;µm, making them efficient for [[Solar thermal energy|solar energy]] collectors.

The term "aerogel" to describe airy masses of [[carbon nanotube]]s produced through certain [[chemical vapor deposition]] techniques is incorrect. Such materials can be spun into fibers with strength greater than [[Kevlar]], and unique electrical properties. These materials are not aerogels, however, since they do not have a monolithic internal structure and do not have the regular pore structure characteristic of aerogels.

=== Metal oxide ===
[[Metal oxide]] aerogels are used as catalysts in various chemical reactions/transformations or as precursors for other materials.

Aerogels made with [[aluminium oxide]] are known as alumina aerogels. These aerogels are used as catalysts, especially when "doped" with a metal other than aluminium. [[Nickel]]–alumina aerogel is the most common combination. Alumina aerogels are also being considered by [[NASA]] for capturing hypervelocity particles; a formulation doped with [[gadolinium]] and [[terbium]] could [[fluoresce]] at the particle impact site, with the amount of fluorescence dependent on impact energy.

One of the most notable differences between silica aerogels and metal oxide aerogel is that metal oxide aerogels are often variedly colored.

The precursors are a liquid [[alcohol]] such as ethanol which is mixed with a [[silicon alkoxide]], such as [[tetramethoxysilane]] (TMOS), [[tetraethoxysilane]] (TEOS), and polyethoxydisiloxane (PEDS) (earlier work used sodium silicates).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dorcheh|first=Soleimani|last2=Abbasi|first2=M.|date=2008|title=Silica Aerogel; Synthesis, Properties, and Characterization|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=199|pages=10|doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2007.10.060|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution of silica is mixed with a catalyst and allowed to gel during a [[hydrolysis]] reaction which forms particles of silicon dioxide.&lt;ref name="Making silica aerogels"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/ECS/Aerogels/sa-making.html|title=Making silica aerogels|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514144121/http://eetd.lbl.gov/ecs/aerogels/sa-making.html|archivedate=14 May 2009|df=dmy-all|access-date=28 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxide suspension begins to undergo [[condensation reaction]]s which result in the creation of metal oxide bridges (either [[Oxo ligand|M–O–M, "oxo" bridges]] or M–OH–M, "[[-ol|ol]]" bridges) linking the dispersed colloidal particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2002|title=Chemistry of Aerogels and their Applications|journal=[[Chemical Reviews]]|volume=102|issue=11|pages=4243–4265|doi=10.1021/cr0101306|pmid=12428989|author1=Pierre|first1=A. C.|last2=Pajonk|first2=G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These reactions generally have moderately slow reaction rates, and as a result either acidic or basic [[catalyst]]s are used to improve the processing speed. Basic catalysts tend to produce more transparent aerogels and minimize the shrinkage during the drying process and also strengthen it to prevent pore collapse during drying.&lt;ref name="Making silica aerogels" /&gt;

Finally, during the drying process of the aerogel, the liquid surrounding the silica network is carefully removed and replaced with air, while keeping the aerogel intact. Gels where the liquid is allowed to evaporate at a natural rate are known as [[xerogel]]s. As the liquid evaporates, forces caused by [[surface tension]]s of the liquid-solid [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] are enough to destroy the fragile gel network. As a result, xerogels cannot achieve the high porosities and instead peak at lower porosities and exhibit large amounts of shrinkage after drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1992|title=Aerogels|journal=[[Journal of the American Ceramic Society]]|volume=75|issue=8|pages=2027–2036|doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.1992.tb04461.x|last1=Fricke|first1=Jochen|last2=Emmerling|first2=Andreas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, to develop the first aerogels, Kistler used a process known as [[supercritical drying]] which avoids a direct phase change. By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a [[supercritical fluid]] state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with [[ethanol]], the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-miscible liquid such as ethanol or [[acetone]], then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.&lt;ref name="Making silica aerogels" /&gt;

[[Resorcinol]]–[[formaldehyde]] aerogel (RF aerogel) is made in a way similar to production of silica aerogel. A carbon aerogel can then be made from this resorcinol–formaldehyde aerogel by [[pyrolysis]] in an [[inert gas]] atmosphere, leaving a matrix of [[carbon]]. It is commercially available as solid shapes, powders, or composite paper. Additives have been successful in enhancing certain properties of the aerogel for the use of specific applications. Aerogel [[Composite material|composites]] have been made using a variety of continuous and discontinuous [[reinforcement]]s. The high aspect ratio of fibers such as [[fiberglass]] have been used to reinforce aerogel composites with significantly improved mechanical properties.

== Safety ==
Silica-based aerogels are not known to be [[carcinogenic]] or toxic. However, they are a mechanical [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes, skin, respiratory tract, and digestive system. Small silica particles can potentially cause [[silicosis]] when inhaled. They can also induce dryness of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Therefore, it is recommended that protective gear including respiratory protection, gloves and eye goggles be worn whenever handling or processing bare aerogels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf Cryogel® 5201, 10201 Safety Data Sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223111216/http://www.aerogel.com/products/pdf/Cryogel_5201_10201_MSDS.pdf |date=23 December 2010 }}.

'''Alfredo J. Rouillon''' (1875-1951) was an entrepreneur, businessman and politician from [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]]. He served as mayor of Rosario from 1922 to 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Revista de Indias | publisher =Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas | series = | volume = | edition = | date =1989 | location =[[Madrid]] | pages =143 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=TsVmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Alfredo+Rouillon&amp;dq=Alfredo+Rouillon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR3ZDh_K3NAhUW2mMKHePjBl8Q6AEINDAF  | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Bernardo Rouillon and Magdalena Vierci. Due to the early death of his father, he was educated in [[Switzerland]].

In 1901 he married Maria Hortensia Echesortu, with whom he had nine children: Alfredo, Armando, Hortensia, Guillermo, Fernando, Stella, Elena, Ernesto, and Jorge .

His usual residence was in Moreno and Cordoba in downtown Rosario, Villa Hortensia was the family summer residence.

He served as mayor of Rosario, councilor, president of numerous commercial companies, founder of several clubs in the city of Rosario like the Jockey Club, the Club Rosarino de pelota, pioneer of aviation and communications in Argentina. He was also president of the [[Argentine Patriotic League]], Rosario section.

During his tenure as Mayor of Rosario his friend [[Santos Dumont]] landed his airplane in the city.

[[File:Antistatic Bags.jpg|thumb|A pink static dissipative bag, and a silver conductive bag. Note the two recurring ESD symbols]]
An '''antistatic bag''' is a bag used for storing [[Electronics|electronic]] components, which are prone to damage caused by [[electrostatic discharge]] (ESD).

These bags are usually plastic [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET) and have a distinctive color (silvery for [[metallised film]], pink or black for [[polyethylene]]). The polyethylene variant may also take the form of foam or [[bubble wrap]], either as sheets or bags. Multiple layers of protection are often used to protect from both mechanical damage and electrostatic damage. A protected device can be packaged inside a metalized PET film bag, inside a pink polyethylene bubble-wrap bag, which is finally packed inside a rigid black polyethylene box lined with pink poly foam. It is important that the bags only be opened at static-free workstations.&lt;ref&gt;JESD625-A/Requirements for Handling
Electrostatic-Discharge-Sensitive
(ESDS) Devices&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissipative antistatic bags, as the name suggests, are made of standard polyethylene with a static dissipative coating or layer on the plastic. This prevents buildup of a static charge on the surface of the bag, as it dissipates the charge to ground (i.e., whatever other surface it is touching).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Choosing The Right Bag|last = |first = |publisher = Ground Zero Electrostatics|year = |isbn = |location = Bradenton, Florida|pages = 2|url = http://www.gndzero.com/techdocs/Shielding/Sheilding%20Bags/Choosing_the_Right_Bag.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anti Static Bags vs Static Shielding Bags|url = https://www.elimstat.com/2016/08/24/anti-static-bags-vs-static-shielding-bags/|website = www.elimstat.com|access-date = 2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge to ground is achieved with the inclusion of a [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine|tallow amine]] on the bags surface which attracts moisture that can conduct the charge to another surface, or to the atmosphere itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pink Poly Bags vs Shield Bags {{!}} Fisher Container Corp.|url = http://www.fishercontainer.com/pink-poly-vs-shield-bags.html|website = www.fishercontainer.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, this type is truly 'antistatic' in that it hinders the formation of static charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ESD Journal - ESD Bags|url = http://www.esdjournal.com/techpapr/ryne/esdbags.htm|website = www.esdjournal.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It, however, is not resistant to [[electrostatic discharge]]; if something else with a charge touches the bag (such as a person's hand), its charge would easily transfer through the bag and its contents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These bags are usually pink or red in color because of the dissipative chemical layer. Black bags also exist, wherein the polyethylene is manufactured containing trace amounts of carbon, forming a partial shield, though not a complete one.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Conductive antistatic bags are manufactured with a layer of conductive metal, often aluminum,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and a [[dielectric]] layer of plastic&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; covered in a static dissipative coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Static Shielding Bags|url=|journal=[[Uline]] Catalog|issue=Spring/Summer 2016|page=587|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forms both a shield and a non-conductive barrier, shielding the contents from static charge via the [[Faraday cage]] effect. These bags are preferred for more sensitive parts, but they also see use in environments where sparks would be hazardous, such as oxygen-rich areas in aircraft and hospitals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Metalized bags are more fragile than their nonmetal counterparts, however, as any puncture compromises the integrity of the shield. In addition, they have a limited shelf life, as the metal substrate can deteriorate over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antistatic Bags &amp; Conductive Bags|url = http://www.packagingknowledge.com/Anti_Static_Bags.asp|website = www.packagingknowledge.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bags are often gray or silver owing to the metal layer, while still being transparent to some degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Foam also exists in both pink (dissipative) and black (conductive) varieties, used for storing individual [[Through-hole technology|leaded components]] by piercing the leads into the foam.

An '''application-specific instruction set processor''' ('''ASIP''') is a component used in [[system-on-a-chip]] design. The [[instruction set]] of an ASIP is tailored to benefit a specific application. This specialization of the core provides a tradeoff between the flexibility of a general purpose [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the performance of an [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]].

Some ASIPs have a configurable instruction set. Usually, these cores are divided into two parts: ''static'' logic which defines a minimum ISA (instruction-set architecture) and ''configurable'' logic which can be used to design new instructions. The configurable logic can be programmed either in the field in a similar fashion to an [[FPGA]] or during the chip synthesis.

ASIPs can be used as an alternative of hardware accelerators for baseband signal processing&lt;ref&gt;Shahabuddin, Shahriar et al., "Design of a transport triggered vector processor for turbo decoding", Springer Journal of Analog Integrated Circuits and Signal Processing, March 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; or video coding.&lt;ref&gt; Hautala, Ilkka, et al. "Programmable Low-Power Multicore Coprocessor Architecture for HEVC/H.265 In-Loop Filtering" in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, November 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; Traditional hardware accelerators for these applications suffer from inflexibility. It is very difficult to reuse the hardware datapath with handwritten [[finite-state machine]]s (FSM). The retargetable compilers of ASIPs help the designer to update the program and reuse the datapath. Typically, the ASIP design is more or less dependent on the tool flow because designing a processor from scratch can be very complicated. There are some commercial tools to design ASIPs, for example Processor Designer from Synopsys. There is an open source tool as well, TTA-based codesign environment (TCE).

[[File:M38 Blackout Driving Light.jpg|thumb|Blackout driving light]]'''Blackout lights''' are [[headlamp|head]] and [[tail lamp]]s that are equipped with special lenses that are designed to cast a diffused horizontal beam of light for the driver of the [[vehicle]] to [[Navigation|navigate]] with, and drivers of other vehicles to spot the vehicle with. In the military, they are intended for use when driving a [[convoy]] at night when it is necessary for the vehicles to maintain [[:wikt:concealment|concealment]] by limiting their ability to be seen by the [[enemy]].    
&lt;!--==History==
first saw use in WW2? Etc...--&gt;

==Types==
&lt;!--American Military vehicles--&gt;

===Blackout driving lights===

Blackout Driving Lights are mounted on the driver's side of the vehicle, typically on the [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]] or [[grille (motor vehicle)|grille]]. They give off a diffused beam of white light that takes the place of regular [[headlamp|headlights]] when driving under blackout conditions. It is intended to give off enough light for the driver to make his way. The Blackout Driving Light is also hooded making the light only to be able to be seen when looking up at it. With the use of [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]] the [[effectiveness]] of the blackout driving light can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tpub.com/content/construction/14273/css/14273_78.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420040217/http://www.tpub.com/content/construction/14273/css/14273_78.htm |archivedate=2010-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackout marker lights===
[[File:M38 Rear Blackout Light.jpg|thumb|Red blackout marker (bottom) and white stop (top) lights]] 
[[File:Leitkreuz1.JPG|thumb| NATO rear convoy guidance cross]] 
[[File:M38 Front Blackout Light..jpg|thumb|Front blackout marker light]]
*Front marker lights are typically mounted below or to the side of the vehicles normal headlights.  They serve the purpose of making the vehicle visible to oncoming drivers or for a driver to see if a vehicle is following him or her.
*Rear marker lights or blackout taillights are typically housed in the same unit as the vehicles [[Automotive lighting|taillights]], and are the main tool in keeping the proper following distance in nighttime convoy driving.

Blackout Marker Lights serve the purpose of marking the position of the vehicle during blackout driving. They also are used as an aid in keeping the proper safe following distance when driving in a convoy at night. US Military marker lights are designed with a series of "cat eyes" that appear differently depending on the distance one is away from the vehicle that is equipped with the lights. When the following distance is too far the rear marker lights appear as a single red light and when too close as four separate red lights. When the correct following distance of 180 to 60 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] is maintained the taillights appear as two red lights.&lt;ref name="Field Manual 21-305"&gt;{{cite book|title= Field Manual 21-305 - Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Defense, Depts. of the Army and the Air Force|location=Washington, DC|year=1993|chapter= Chapter 23|url=http://www.enlisted.info/field-manuals/fm-21-305-manual-for-the-wheeled-vehicle-driver.shtml|accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blackout stop lights===
Blackout stop lights take the place the normal stoplight when operating in blackout conditions. In US military vehicles when the [[brake]]s are applied in blackout mode the brake light appears as a white light.  The blackout stop lights are typically in the same taillight assembly as the rear blackout marker lights.

===Blackout headlights===
Blackout headlights can refer to either front blackout marker lights or blackout driving light depending on the vehicle that is equipped with them.

==Controls==
[[File:Blackout small.jpg|thumb|Modern switch for Normal, Blackout and Convoy modes]]
[[Military]] vehicles that are equipped with blackout lights have a special [[switch]] for controlling the lights that are on the vehicle.  This switch serves the purpose of preventing the headlights or any other lights on the vehicle from being turned on by [[accident]], by means of a lock that is on the switch that must be pushed before the lights are able to be turned on.

A '''box blade''' is a type of [[Agricultural machinery|implement]] used on [[tractor]]s for [[wikt:smoothing|smoothing]] and [[Contour plowing|contouring]] land. It is almost always unpowered, though can have auxiliary [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulics]] attached in order for adjustments to be made without leaving the [[seat]] of the tractor. It is attached to the tractor via the [[Three-point hitch|three point hitch]].

==Description==
Box blades are a variation of the rear [[blade]] which has developed into its own implement, with uses that parallel that of a rear blade, but are distinct. They consist of a heavy metal 3 sided box, with the front, top and bottom open. The front has retractable [[Dethatcher|scarifiers]] which can be used to break up hard ground. The rear has a forward and reverse cutting edge mounted at the bottom, with the reverse cutting edge often gated or floating on more expensive models. Box blades are usually very heavy due to the [[force]]s placed on them - even a lightweight one will weigh 500 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]. The implement works going forward by scraping soil, carrying it forward as it rolls inside the box, and allowing some to work out as the blade passes over low spots. It works going back much like a dozer blade, pushing dirt, which can spill out the bottom or sides. Unlike a dozer blade, box blades are not adjustable relative to the tractor more than a few degrees in any direction, and generally only when the operator dismounts the tractor.

Box blades are primarily used for moving [[Soil|dirt]], smoothing [[land]], and contouring land. Most major tractor implement [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] make box blades, including Cammond, Woods, Gannon, &amp; BushHog. Commercial [[Laser guidance|laser guided]] models are coming into use which automatically level the blade via [[reference]] to an external [[laser]].

Three point [[Grader|road graders]] can be viewed as a specific type of box blade, and are used to [[Grading (engineering)|grade]] and maintain [[Dirt road|dirt]] and [[gravel road]]s. They usually have 2 parallel [[angle]]d cutting edges, and long, low sidepieces. Manufacturers include Dura-Grader, Road Boss,and RoadRunner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">A '''breathing tube''' is a flexible tube for breathing through, as part of a [[scuba set]] or other [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|breathing apparatus]] or a medical oxygen apparatus or [[anaesthetic apparatus]] (Here they are distinguished from the medium-pressure hoses which are often found as parts of modern [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|breathing apparatus]].)

They are wide, and usually corrugated to let the user's head move about without the tube pinching at kinks.

Each end usually has a screw connection. They may contain a [[one-way valve]] to keep the air or gas flowing the right way.

According to the expected usage, they may be pure rubber, or rubber reinforced with canvas (outside or embedded) or similar. If the canvas layer is outside (as in the [[Siebe Gorman Salvus]] and the [[IDA71]] and some old [[gasmask]]s, it protects the rubber from damage from scrapes but makes it harder to wash all the salt off after a saltwater dive.

Breathing tubes have to be long enough to connect the apparatus to the diver's head in all attitudes of his head, but should not loop about excessively to cause [[hydrodynamic drag]] or risk snagging snag on things, or contain excess [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. In the IDA71 the looping over-the-shoulders breathing tubes can be tethered down to the diver's shoulders. See also in [http://www.cobham.com/media/1726151/military-dive-rebreathers10.jpg this image] of a modern military rebreather. 

Some early [[rebreather]]s had one breathing tube, which the breathed gas went through both ways: this is called the [[pendulum system]]; others have two breathing tubes, with [[one-way valve]]s keeping the gas flowing the right way.

In some [[rebreather]]s, parts of the apparatus are connected to each other by lengths of breathing tube, resulting in more lengths of tube in the apparatus:
* 2 in the Salvus (mask to [[absorbent canister]], absorbent canister to [[breathing bag]]; this is a pendulum system).
* 4 lengths in the [[Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit]] (mask to exhalent bag to absorbent canister to inhalent bag to mask)

'''CD Video''' (also known as '''CDV''', '''CD-V''', or '''CD+V''') is a format of optical media disc that was introduced in 1987 that combines the technologies of standard [[compact disc]] and [[LaserDisc]]. CD-V discs are the same size as a standard 12-cm audio CD, and contain up to 20 minutes' worth of [[CD Audio]] that can be played on any audio CD player. It also contains up to 5 minutes of LaserDisc video information with digital CD-quality sound, which can be played back on a newer LaserDisc player capable of playing CD-V discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first LaserDisc players that can play CD-V discs is the [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] [[Pioneer CLD-1010|CLD-1010]] from 1987. Though it is a CD-based format, CD Video was never given a [[Rainbow Books|rainbow book]] designation; the idea of encoding [[analogue video]], which is incompatible between different regions, was poorly received by CD stakeholders other than Philips, who had not consulted them prior to demonstrating the format to the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=S0vI7Yz2550C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22problems+ahead+for+CD+video%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=C6slKvcs6s&amp;sig=PHKCiWe_3SDVUvPeFNbf4ooqsSk&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf1sDYjcjcAhVEECwKHbSdBPwQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22problems%20ahead%20for%20CD%20video%22&amp;f=false|title=Problems ahead for CD Video|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|date=1986-12-11|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CD Video discs have a distinctive gold color, to differentiate them from regular silver-colored audio CDs. This is a characteristic that would later be replicated in [[holographic versatile disc|HVD]], a more advanced disc format.

A similar version of CD Video called [[Video Single Disc]] (VSD) was also released. It is basically the same as CD Video, but it only has the analog video track (occupying the whole storage space of the disc), so it is in effect a small LaserDisc.

CD Video was targeted toward teenagers who watched [[music video]]s on [[MTV]]. However, few of them were familiar with LaserDiscs, and far fewer owned CDV-compatible players at the time. Buying a costly new player was not an option just for the minor use of playing a single music video more easily accessible through a [[VHS]] [[Videotape|videocassette]], either purchased pre-recorded or recorded off a television programme with a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]].

The term "CD Video" and its logo were also used on some full-size (8- and 12-inch) LaserDiscs with digital audio (for movies as well as for music titles), to distinguish them from the previous LaserVision format with analog audio and, presumably, to leverage the consumer recognition of the successful CD-Audio format.

Though CD Video lasted only a few years in the marketplace and began disappearing by 1991, its legacy would live on with the all-digital [[MPEG]]-based [[Video CD]] format, which came out a few years later in 1993.

A '''cable blowing machine''' (also known as a fiber blowing machine) is a machine designed to fit [[fiber optic]] cables into  telecommunication ducts and [[microducts]] with the use of compressed air or water. 

== Blowing machine design ==

[[File:Wdmuchiwarka3.PNG|300px|thumb|right|Cable blowing machine {{ordered list |1=adjustment and lubrication system |2=cable meter counter |3=compressed air connection |4=cable guidance |5=base plate |6=belt feeder |7=blowing head}}]]


A cable blowing machine (fiber blowing machine) consists of the following components:

*a head that ensures secure fitting of the duct into which the cable will be blown and supplying the medium (air or water) to the duct. The cable inserted into the duct via the head goes through a sealing system preventing the medium from getting into the machine;
*a belt feeder that moves the cable towards the head; 
*a base plate or a frame onto which the blowing machine’s subsystems are mounted; 
*cable guidance, that is a system of bushes or rolls guiding the cable towards the blowing head; 
*air or water connections that supply the medium securely to the blowing machine; 
*a meter counter that shows the length (sometimes also the velocity) of the blown cable; 
*a control unit that allows to control the speed of cable insertion and the propelling power of the feeder.

== Types of blowing machines ==
Blowing machines are classified with regard to the diameter of the cable they can handle and the type of drive system (track feeder, roller feeder, belt feeder or blowing heads without feeders). The optical fiber cable blowing machine are of 2 types.
# Hydraulically powered
# Pneumatically powered.
The hydraulically blowing machine consists of 2 parts.
# Cable feeding unit: - This is the main component of blowing machine and it pushes the cable into the HDPE duct with the help of compressed air.
# Hydraulic Power pack: - This unit provides the power to cable feeding unit and it is because of hydraulic power pack, the cable feeding unit operates.
The commonly used is hydraulically powered one.&lt;gallery&gt;

A '''carriage clock''' is a small, spring-driven [[clock]], designed for travelling, developed in the early 19th century in [[France]], where they were also known as "Officers' Clocks". The first carriage clock was invented by [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] for the [[Emperor Napoleon]] in 1812. The case, usually plain or gilt-brass, is [[rectangular]] with a carrying [[Handle (grip)|handle]] and often set with [[glass]] or more rarely [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] or [[porcelain]] panels. A feature of carriage clocks is the ''platform escapement'', sometimes visible through a glazed aperture on the top of the case. Carriage clocks use a balance and [[balance spring]] for timekeeping and replaced the larger pendulum [[bracket clock]]. 
The factory of Armand Couaillet, in [[Saint-Nicolas-d'Aliermont|Saint-Nicolas d'Aliermont]] (France) made thousands of carriage clocks between 1880 and 1920. 

A carriage clock has in the past been a traditional gift from employers to retiring or long-serving staff. However, in modern times, with changing work patterns and changing desires, this is much less the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.employeebenefits.co.uk/top-five-long-service-awards-for-employees/|title=Top five long-service awards for employees|website=www.employeebenefits.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4747372.stm|title=Time runs out for carriage clock|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3922">'''Chemical technologists''' and '''technicians''' (abbr. '''chem techs''') are workers who provide technical support or services in [[chemistry|chemical]]-related fields.  They may work under direct supervision or may work independently, depending on their specific position and duties.  Their work environments differ widely and include, but are not limited to, [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and industrial settings.  As such, it is nearly impossible to generalize the duties of chem techs as their individual jobs vary greatly.  Biochemical techs often do similar work in [[biochemistry]].  [[Image:Lab bench.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Cologne]]

==Technologists==

Chemical technologists are more likely than technicians to participate in the actual ''design'' of experiments, and may be involved in the interpretation of experimental data.  They may also be responsible for the operation of [[chemical process]]es in large [[Chemical plant|plants]], and may even assist [[chemical engineer]]s in the design of the same.

Some [[post-secondary education]] is generally required to be either a chemical technician or technologist.  Occasionally, a company may be willing to provide a high school graduate with training to become a chemical technician, but more often, a two-year degree will be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos115.htm#training |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814064732/http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos115.htm |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical technologists generally require completion of a specific college program—either two year or four year— in chemical, biochemical, or chemical engineering technology or a closely related discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemeng.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/5365/la_id/1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172753/http://www.chemeng.ca/index.cfm/ci_id/5365/la_id/1.htm |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They usually work under or with a scientist such as a [[chemist]] or [[biochemist]].

==Technicians==

Chemical or biochemical technicians often work in [[Clinical laboratory|clinical (medical) laboratories]] conducting routine [[Chemical analysis|analyses]] of [[Sampling (medicine)|medical samples]] such as blood and urine.  Industries which employ chem techs include [[Chemical industry|chemical]], [[petrochemical]], and [[pharmaceutical]] industries. Companies within these industries can be concerned with [[manufacturing]], [[research and development]] (R&amp;D), [[Consultant|consulting]], [[quality control]], and a variety of other areas.  Also, chem techs working for these companies may be used to conduct quality control and other routine analyses, or assist in chemical and biochemical [[research]] including analyses, industrial chemistry, [[environmental protection]], and even [[chemical engineering]].

==Duties==

As a general rule, chemical technologists are more likely to be provided with greater autonomy and more complex responsibilities than chemical technicians.  

===Chemical technicians===

The most common work done by chemical technicians is in [[research and development|R&amp;D]].  They often work in a [[laboratory]] environment under the supervision of a [[chemist]] or a [[chemical engineer]].

They may typically assist in setting up and conducting chemical [[experiment]]s, and may operate lab equipment under supervision.  They are expected to maintain established quality control standards.  They may also compile records for analytical studies, and sometimes are involved in writing reports on studies.

National [[certification]] for chemical technologists and technicians is required in some countries.

'''Dariole''' is a [[French language|French]] term meaning a small, [[cylindrical]] [[mold (cooking implement)|mold]]. The word also refers to the [[dessert]] that is baked in the mold. Classically, the dessert is made by lining the mold with [[puff pastry]], filling it with an [[almond]] cream and baking until golden brown. Today there are also savory darioles, usually made with vegetable [[custard]]s. These were also cooked as dessert in the Middle Ages and sometimes they included fruit, [[cheese]], bone marrow or fish inside the pastry. They were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">The '''Day of Archaeology''' is an annual, 24-hour, international online event in which archaeologists and those in related fields write [[blog]] posts about their work.  It was inspired by the Day of Digital Humanities&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/project-background/ | title=Day of Archaeology: Project Background | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, similarly, allows practitioners of many kinds, to document their work informally and 'provide a window into the daily lives of archaeologists from all over the world'.&lt;ref name="DoAAbout"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/about-the-project/ | title=Day of Archaeology: About the Project | year=2013 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it encourages diversity rather than thematic posts, the project has some similarities to [[Blog Action Day]].

==Overview==
The first event took place on 27 July 2011. The event is organised by a voluntary committee of archaeologists based in the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States of America]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd" /&gt; The main site runs a customised [[WordPress]] [[content management system]] and the event is promoted through [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] pages (see [[#External links|External links]]).

The project is supported by several British archaeological and academic organisations: server space is provided on the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]] servers&lt;ref name="PAS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://finds.org.uk/news/stories/article/id/213 | title=Portable Antiquities Scheme: Day of Archaeology 2011 | date=2011-04-28 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Pett, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and long-term [[digital preservation]] is provided by the [[Archaeology Data Service]]. [http://www.lparchaeology.com/ L-P Archaeology] and the [[UCL Centre for Digital Humanities]] provide technical and management advice.&lt;ref name="DoA Bckgrd" /&gt; In 2011 and 2013 the event was timed to coincide with the [[Festival of British Archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Festival"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeologyfestival.org.uk/events/490 | title=Festival Listing: Day of Archaeology | publisher=Council for British Archaeology | date=July 2013 | accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project covers any form of work that could be considered archaeology and encourages contributions from any level of professionalism.&lt;ref name="DoAAbout" /&gt;



==External coverage==

Several archaeologists have blogged about the project in official&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/news/day-of-archaeology-2012 | title=RCAHMS: Day of Archaeology 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal&lt;ref name="Netzschichten"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://netzschichten.de/2011/07/day-of-archaeology-2011/ | title=Netzschichten: Day of Archaeology | date=2011-07-28 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; capacities and the project committee wrote posts on various other sites,&lt;ref name="PAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLDH DoA2012" /&gt; notably the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]]&lt;ref name="SHA Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/2012/06/the-day-of-archaeology-2012 | title=Society for Historical Archaeology: The Day of Archaeology 2012 | date=2012-06-22 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name="BM Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/tag/day-of-archaeology/ | title=A day in the life of a lot of archaeologists | date=2011-07-27 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Pett, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2011 event a preliminary [[data mining]] analysis was conducted.&lt;ref name="Data Mining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://electricarchaeology.ca/2012/07/09/mining-a-day-of-archaeology/ | title=Electric Archaeology: Mining a Day of Archaeology | date=2012-07-09 | accessdate=2013-04-19 | author=Graham, Shawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, after the 2014 event a [[topic model|topic modelling]] and keyword analysis was published. &lt;ref name="Topic models"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/benmarwick/dayofarchaeology | title=A Distant Reading of the Day of Archaeology | date=2014-05-29 | accessdate=2018-02-04 | author=Marwick, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Day of Archaeology project was nominated for a British Archaeology Award in July 2011 in the 'Best Representation of Archaeology in the Media' category and was highly commended.&lt;ref name="BAA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/awards/baa2012.html#media | title=British Archaeology Awards 2012 | date=2012-07-09 | accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10393">[[Image:Circuit elements.svg|right|thumbnail|400px|Common circuit diagram symbols (US symbols)]]
An '''electronic symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] used to represent various [[electrical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] devices or functions, such as [[wire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[resistor]]s, and [[transistor]]s, in a [[schematic diagram]] of an electrical or [[electronic circuit]].  These symbols are largely standardized internationally today, but may vary from country to country, or engineering discipline, based on traditional conventions.

==Standards for symbols==
The graphic symbols used for electrical components in circuit diagrams are covered by national and international standards, in particular:
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60617 (also known as [[British Standard]] BS 3939).
* [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Y32.2-1975 (also known as IEEE Std 315-1975 or CSA Z99-1975)
* [[IEEE]] Std 91/91a: graphic symbols for logic functions (used in digital electronics). It is referenced in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std 315.
* Australian Standard AS 1102. (Withdrawn without replacement)

Symbols usage is sometimes unique to engineering disciplines and national or local variations to international standards exist. For example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics.

An excitation filter is commonly packaged with an emission filter and a dichroic beam splitter in a cube so that the group is inserted together into the microscope.

{{About||the thermal insulation material sometimes called fiberglass|glass wool|the glass fiber itself, also sometimes called fiberglass|glass fiber|similar composite materials in which the reinforcement fiber is carbon fibers|carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer}}

'''Fiberglass''' (US) or '''fibreglass''' (UK) is a common type of [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] using [[glass fiber]]. The fibers may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a chopped strand mat), or woven into a [[fabric]]. The [[plastic]] matrix may be a [[thermoset polymer matrix]]—most often based on [[thermosetting polymer]]s such as [[epoxy]], [[polyester resin]],  or [[vinylester]]—or a [[thermoplastic]].

Cheaper and more flexible than carbon fiber, it is stronger than many metals by weight, and can be molded into complex shapes. Applications include aircraft, boats, automobiles, bath tubs and enclosures, [[swimming pools]], [[hot tub]]s, [[septic tank]]s, [[water tank]]s, roofing, pipes, cladding, [[orthopedic cast|casts]], [[surfboard]]s, and external door skins.

Other common names for fiberglass are '''glass-reinforced plastic''' ('''GRP'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mayer |first= Rayner M. |title= Design with reinforced plastics |page= 7 |publisher= Springer |year= 1993 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XQFJego9nGUC&amp;pg=PA7 |isbn= 978-0-85072-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''glass-fiber reinforced plastic''' ('''GFRP''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nawy |first= Edward G. |title= Fundamentals of high-performance concrete |page= 310 |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |year= 2001 |edition= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W6BNygdZLJUC&amp;pg=PA310 |isbn= 978-0-471-38555-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''GFK''' (from {{Lang-de|Glasfaserverstärkter Kunststoff}}). Because glass fiber itself is sometimes referred to as "fiberglass", the composite is also called "fiberglass reinforced plastic". This article will adopt the convention that "fiberglass" refers to the complete glass fiber reinforced composite material, rather than only to the glass fiber within it.

== History ==
Glass fibers have been produced for centuries, but the earliest patent was awarded to the Prussian inventor [[Hermann Hammesfahr]] (1845–1914) in the U.S. in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Steve (November 1999). "The birth of fiberglass boats," The Good Ole Boat.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Entry for US 232122 A (14-Sep-1880)". US Patent Publication. Retrieved 9 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mass production]] of glass strands was [[Serendipity|accidentally discovered]] in 1932 when [[Games Slayter]], a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]], directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. A patent for this method of producing glass wool was first applied for in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Slayter, Games (11 November 1933) "Method &amp; Apparatus for Making Glass Wool" {{US Patent|2133235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owens joined with the Corning company in 1935 and the method was adapted by [[Owens Corning]] to produce its patented "Fiberglas" (spelled with one "s") in 1936. Originally, Fiberglas was a [[glass wool]] with fibers entrapping a great deal of gas, making it useful as an insulator, especially at high temperatures.

A suitable resin for combining the fiberglass with a plastic to produce a composite material was developed in 1936 by [[du Pont]]. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is [[Cyanamid]]'s resin of 1942. [[Peroxide]] curing systems were used by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Marsh |first= George |title= 50 years of reinforced plastic boats |work= reinforcedplastics|publisher= Elsevier Ltd |date= 8 Oct 2006 |url= http://www.reinforcedplastics.com/view/1461/50-years-of-reinforced-plastic-boats/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the combination of fiberglass and resin the gas content of the material was replaced by plastic. This reduced the insulation properties to values typical of the plastic, but now for the first time the composite showed great strength and promise as a structural and building material. Confusingly, many glass fiber composites continued to be called "fiberglass" (as a generic name) and the name was also used for the low-density glass wool product containing gas instead of plastic.

Ray Greene of Owens Corning is credited with producing the first composite boat in 1937, but did not proceed further at the time due to the brittle nature of the plastic used. In 1939 Russia was reported to have constructed a passenger boat of plastic materials, and the United States a fuselage and wings of an aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Notable Progress – the use of plastics, Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, Volume CXXVIII, Issue 31, 5 August 1939, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The first car to have a fiber-glass body was a 1946 prototype of the [[Stout Scarab]], but the model did not enter production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Hobart| first = Tasmania| title = Car of the future in plastics| newspaper = The Mercury| pages = 16| date = 27 May 1946}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiber==
[[File:Glass reinforcements.jpg|thumb|Glass reinforcements used for fiberglass are supplied in different physical forms, microspheres, chopped or woven.]]
Unlike glass fibers used for insulation, for the final structure to be strong, the fiber's surfaces must be almost entirely free of defects, as this permits the fibers to reach gigapascal [[tensile strength]]s. If a bulk piece of glass were defect-free, it would be equally as strong as glass fibers; however, it is generally impractical to produce and maintain bulk material in a defect-free state outside of laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=newscience&gt;{{cite book |author=Gordon, J E |title=The New Science of Strong Materials: Or Why You Don't Fall Through the Floor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axW-iYrhQ1YC|date=1991|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-192770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
The process of manufacturing fiberglass is called [[pultrusion]]. The manufacturing process for glass fibers suitable for reinforcement uses large furnaces to gradually melt the [[silica]] sand, [[limestone]], [[kaolin clay]], [[fluorspar]], [[colemanite]], [[dolomite]] and other [[minerals]] until a liquid forms. It is then extruded through bushings, which are bundles of very small orifices (typically 5–25 micrometres in diameter for E-Glass, 9 micrometres for S-Glass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qZPBCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=fiberglass+made+with+aluminosilicate+glass+fibers#v=onepage&amp;q=fiberglass%20made%20with%20aluminosilicate%20glass%20fibers&amp;f=false|title=Lightweight Ballistic Composites: Military and Law-Enforcement Applications|last=Bhatnagar|first=Ashok|date=2016-04-19|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=9780081004258|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These filaments are then ''sized'' (coated) with a chemical solution. The individual filaments are now bundled in large numbers to provide a [[roving]]. The diameter of the filaments, and the number of filaments in the roving, determine its ''weight'', typically expressed in one of two measurement systems:
*''yield'', or yards per pound (the number of yards of fiber in one pound of material; thus a smaller number means a heavier roving). Examples of standard yields are 225yield, 450yield, 675yield.
*''tex'', or grams per km (how many grams 1&amp;nbsp;km of roving weighs, inverted from yield; thus a smaller number means a lighter roving). Examples of standard tex are 750tex, 1100tex, 2200tex.

These rovings are then either used directly in a composite application such as [[pultrusion]], [[filament winding]] (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops it into a jet of resin, projected onto the surface of a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as ''chopped strand mat'' (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics.

====Chopped strand mat====
'''Chopped strand mat''' or '''CSM''' is a form of reinforcement used in fiberglass. It consists of glass fibers laid randomly across each other and held together by a binder.

It is typically processed using the hand lay-up technique, where sheets of material are placed on a mold and brushed with resin. Because the binder dissolves in resin, the material easily conforms to different shapes when wetted out. After the resin cures, the hardened product can be taken from the mold and finished.

Using chopped strand mat gives a fiberglass with [[isotropic]] in-plane material properties.

===Sizing===
A coating or primer is applied to the roving to:
* Help protect the glass filaments for processing and manipulation.
* Ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus allowing for transfer of shear loads from the glass fibers to the thermoset plastic. Without this bonding, the fibers can 'slip' in the matrix, causing localized failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamentals: Repairing Fiberglass And Ensuring Bonding|author=Reese Gibson|url=http://www.reesesfishhunt.com/how-to-repair-small-hole-fiberglass-boat/ |accessdate=28 April 2017|date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
An individual structural glass fiber is both stiff and strong in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]]—that is, ''along'' its axis. Although it might be assumed that the fiber is weak in compression, it is actually only the long [[aspect ratio]] of the fiber which makes it seem so; i.e., because a typical fiber is long and narrow, it buckles easily.&lt;ref name=newscience/&gt; On the other hand, the glass fiber is weak in shear—that is, ''across'' its axis. Therefore, if a collection of fibers can be arranged permanently in a preferred direction within a material, and if they can be prevented from [[buckling]] in compression, the material will be preferentially strong in that direction.

Furthermore, by laying multiple layers of fiber on top of one another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With chopped strand mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.

A fiberglass component is typically of a thin "shell" construction, sometimes filled on the inside with structural foam, as in the case of surfboards. The component may be of nearly arbitrary shape, limited only by the complexity and tolerances of the [[mold]] used for manufacturing the shell.

The mechanical functionality of materials is heavily relied on the combined performances of both the resin (AKA matrix) and fibers. For example, in severe temperature condition (over 180&amp;nbsp;°C)  resin component of the composite may lose its functionality partially because of bond deterioration of resin and fiber.&lt;ref name=CompositeConstruction&gt;{{cite book |author=Bank, Lawrence C.|title=Composites for construction: structural design with FRP materials| url=http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471681261.html| date=2006| publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn=978-0-471-68126-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, GFRPs can show still significant residual strength after experiencing high temperature (200&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Russo |first1= Salvatore |first2= Behzad |last2= Ghadimi |first3= Krishna |last3= Lawania|first4= Michele |last4= Rosano|title= Residual strength testing in pultruded FRP material under a variety of temperature cycles and values |journal= Composite Structures |volume= 133 |pages= 458–475 |date= December 2015 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822315005784 |doi=10.1016/j.compstruct.2015.07.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of glass fiber used ===
{{main|Glass fiber}}
Composition: the most common types of glass fiber used in fiberglass is [[E-glass]], which is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass ('''A'''lkali-lime glass with little or no boron oxide), E-CR-glass ('''E'''lectrical/'''C'''hemical '''R'''esistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low '''D'''ielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as '''R'''einforcement), and [[S-glass]] (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1= Fitzer |first1= Erich |title= Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last2= Kleinholz |first2= Rudolf |last3= Tiesler |first3= Hartmut |last4= Stacey |first4= Martyn Hugh |last5= De Bruyne |first5= Roger |last6= Lefever |first6= Ignace |last7= Foley |first7= Andrew |last8= Frohs |first8= Wilhelm |last9= Hauke |first9= Tilo |last10= Heine |first10= Michael |last11= Jäger |first11= Hubert |last12= Sitter |first12= Sandra |display-authors= 3 |publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Naming and use: pure [[silica]] (silicon dioxide), when cooled as [[fused quartz]] into a [[glass]] with no true melting point, can be used as a glass fiber for fiberglass, but has the drawback that it must be worked at very high temperatures. In order to lower the necessary work temperature, other materials are introduced as "fluxing agents" (i.e., components to lower the melting point). Ordinary A-glass ("A" for "alkali-lime") or soda lime glass, crushed and ready to be remelted, as so-called [[cullet]] glass, was the first type of glass used for fiberglass. E-glass ("E" because of initial Electrical application), is alkali free, and was the first glass formulation used for continuous filament formation. It now makes up most of the fiberglass production in the world, and also is the single largest consumer of [[boron]] minerals globally. It is susceptible to chloride ion attack and is a poor choice for marine applications. S-glass ("S" for "stiff") is used when tensile strength (high modulus) is important, and is thus an important building and aircraft epoxy composite (it is called R-glass, "R" for "reinforcement" in Europe). C-glass ("C" for "chemical resistance") and T-glass ("T" is for "thermal insulator"—a North American variant of C-glass) are resistant to chemical attack; both are often found in insulation-grades of blown fiberglass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Fiberglass |publisher= redOrbit.com |url= http://www.redorbit.com/education/reference_library/general-2/inventions/2583670/fiberglass/ |accessdate= 28 Aug 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiberglass is an immensely versatile material due to its light weight, inherent strength, weather-resistant finish and variety of surface textures.

The development of fiber-reinforced plastic for commercial use was extensively researched in the 1930s. It was of particular interest to the aviation industry. A means of mass production of glass strands was accidentally discovered in 1932 when a researcher at [[Owens-Illinois]] directed a jet of compressed air at a stream of molten glass and produced fibers. After Owens merged with the Corning company in 1935, [[Owens Corning]] adapted the method to produce its patented "Fiberglas" (one "s"). A suitable resin for combining the "Fiberglas" with a plastic was developed in 1936 by du Pont. The first ancestor of modern polyester resins is Cyanamid's of 1942. Peroxide curing systems were used by then.

During World War II, fiberglass was developed as a replacement for the molded plywood used in aircraft [[radome]]s (fiberglass being [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparent]] to [[microwaves]]). Its first main civilian application was for the building of [[boat]]s and sports car bodies, where it gained acceptance in the 1950s. Its use has broadened to the automotive and sport equipment sectors. In production of some products, such as aircraft, [[carbon fiber]] is now used instead of fiberglass, which is stronger by volume and weight.

Advanced manufacturing techniques such as [[pre-preg]]s and [[fiber]] [[roving]]s extend fiberglass's applications and the tensile strength possible with fiber-reinforced plastics.

Fiberglass is also used in the [[telecommunications]] industry for [[shroud]]ing [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]], due to its [[radio frequency|RF]] permeability and low signal [[attenuation (electromagnetic radiation)|attenuation]] properties. It may also be used to conceal other equipment where no signal permeability is required, such as equipment cabinets and [[steel]] support structures, due to the ease with which it can be molded and painted to blend with existing structures and surfaces. Other uses include sheet-form electrical insulators and structural components commonly found in power-industry products.

Because of fiberglass's light weight and durability, it is often used in protective equipment such as helmets. Many sports use fiberglass protective gear, such as goaltenders' and catchers' masks.

===Storage tanks===
[[File:Milwaukee tanks.jpg|right|thumb|Several large fiberglass tanks at an airport]]
[[Storage tank]]s can be made of fiberglass with capacities up to about 300 [[tonne]]s. Smaller tanks can be made with chopped strand mat cast over a thermoplastic inner tank which acts as a [[Optical fiber#Preform|preform]] during construction. Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the [[hoop stress]] imposed in the side wall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often [[polypropylene]]) is resistant to a wide range of corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for [[septic tank]]s.

===House building===
[[File:California-dome-house.jpg|right|thumb|A fiberglass dome house in [[Davis, California]]]]
Glass-reinforced plastics are also used to produce house building components such as roofing laminate, door surrounds, over-door canopies, window canopies and dormers, chimneys, [[coping (architecture)|coping]] systems, and heads with keystones and sills. The material's reduced weight and easier handling, compared to wood or metal, allows faster installation. Mass-produced fiberglass brick-effect panels can be used in the construction of composite housing, and can include insulation to reduce heat loss.

===Oil and Gas Artificial Lift Systems===
In Rod Pumping applications, Fiberglass rods are often used for their high tensile strength to weight ratio. Fiberglass rods provide an advantage over steel rods because they stretch more elastically (Lower Young's Modulus) than steel for a given weight, meaning more oil can be lifted from the hydrocarbon reservoir to the surface with each stroke, all while reducing the load on the pumping unit. 

Fiberglass rods must be kept in tension, however, as they frequently part if placed in even a small amount of compression. Buoyancy of the rods within a fluid amplifies this tendency. 

===Piping===
GRP and GRE pipe can be used in a variety of above- and below-ground systems, including those for:

* Desalination
* Water treatment
* Water distribution networks
* Chemical process plants
* Firewater
* Hot and Cold water
* Drinking water
* Wastewater/sewage, Municipal waste

==Construction methods==

===Filament winding===
[[Filament winding]] is a fabrication technique mainly used for manufacturing open (cylinders) or closed end structures (pressure vessels or tanks). The process involves winding filaments under tension over a male mandrel. The mandrel rotates while a wind eye on a carriage moves horizontally, laying down fibers in the desired pattern. The most common filaments are carbon or glass fiber and are coated with synthetic resin as they are wound. Once the mandrel is completely covered to the desired thickness, the resin is cured; often the mandrel is placed in an oven to achieve this, though sometimes radiant heaters are used with the mandrel still turning in the machine. Once the resin has cured, the mandrel is removed, leaving the hollow final product. For some products such as gas bottles the 'mandrel' is a permanent part of the finished product forming a liner to prevent gas leakage or as a barrier to protect the composite from the fluid to be stored.

Filament winding is well suited to automation, and there are many applications, such as pipe and small pressure vessel that are wound and cured without any human intervention. The controlled variables for winding are fiber type, resin content, wind angle, tow or bandwidth and thickness of the fiber bundle. The angle at which the fiber has an effect on the properties of the final product. A high angle "hoop" will provide circumferential or "burst" strength, while lower angle patterns (polar or helical) will provide greater longitudinal tensile strength.

Products currently being produced using this technique range from pipes, golf clubs, Reverse Osmosis Membrane Housings, oars, bicycle forks, bicycle rims, power and transmission poles, pressure vessels to missile casings, aircraft fuselages and lamp posts and yacht masts.

===Fiberglass hand lay-up operation===
A release agent, usually in either wax or liquid form, is applied to the chosen mold to allow finished product to be cleanly removed from the mold. Resin—typically a 2-part [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] polyester, vinyl or epoxy—is mixed with its hardener and applied to the surface. Sheets of fiberglass matting are laid into the mold, then more resin mixture is added using a brush or roller. The material must conform to the mold, and air must not be trapped between the fiberglass and the mold. Additional resin is applied and possibly additional sheets of fiberglass. Hand pressure, vacuum or rollers are used to be sure the resin saturates and fully wets all layers, and that any air pockets are removed. The work must be done quickly, before the resin starts to cure, unless high temperature resins are used which will not cure until the part is warmed in an oven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forbes Aird|title=Fiberglass &amp; Composite Materials: An Enthusiast's Guide to High Performance Non-Metallic Materials for Automotive Racing and Marine Use|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ileMYXGZ3OQC&amp;pg=PA86|date=1996|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-55788-239-4|pages=86–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the work is covered with plastic sheets and vacuum is drawn on the work to remove air bubbles and press the fiberglass to the shape of the mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= James |first= Mike |title= An Introduction to Vacuum Bagging Composites |publisher= Nextcraft.com |url= http://www.nextcraft.com/vacuum_bagging_01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiberglass spray lay-up operation===
The [[fiberglass spray lay-up process]] is similar to the hand lay-up process, but differs in the application of the fiber and resin to the mold. Spray-up is an open-molding composites fabrication process where resin and reinforcements are sprayed onto a mold. The resin and glass may be applied separately or simultaneously "chopped" in a combined stream from a chopper gun. Workers roll out the spray-up to compact the laminate. Wood, foam or other core material may then be added, and a secondary spray-up layer imbeds the core between the laminates. The part is then cured, cooled and removed from the reusable mold.

===Pultrusion operation===
[[Image:Pultrusion process 01.png|thumb|300px|right|Diagram of the [[pultrusion]] process.]]
Pultrusion is a manufacturing method used to make strong, lightweight composite materials. In pultrusion, material is pulled through forming machinery using either a hand-over-hand method or a continuous-roller method (as opposed to [[extrusion]], where the material is pushed through dies).
In fiberglass pultrusion, fibers (the glass material) are pulled from spools through a device that coats them with a resin. They are then typically heat-treated and cut to length. Fiberglass produced this way can be made in a variety of shapes and cross-sections, such as W or S cross-sections.

==Warping==
One notable feature of fiberglass is that the resins used are subject to contraction during the curing process. For polyester this contraction is often 5–6%; for epoxy, about 2%. Because the fibers do not contract, this differential can create changes in the shape of the part during curing. Distortions can appear hours, days or weeks after the resin has set.

While this distortion can be minimised by symmetric use of the fibers in the design, a certain amount of internal stress is created; and if it becomes too great, cracks form.

== Health hazards ==
{{anchor|Health hazards}}
In June 2011, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) removed from its Report on Carcinogens all biosoluble glass wool used in home and building insulation and for non-insulation products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 13th Report on Carcinogens |work= National Toxicology Program |publisher= [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Dept HHS]] |year= 2011 |url= http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/pubhealth/roc/roc13/index.html |accessdate= 5 Feb 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NTP considers fibrous glass dust to be "reasonably anticipated [as] a human carcinogen (Certain Glass Wool Fibers (Inhalable))".&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;{{cite web |title= Fibrous Glass Dust |work= [[Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|OSHA]] |publisher= U.S. Department of Labor |url= https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_242120.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA") published a November, 2011 modification to its Proposition 65 listing to include only "Glass wool fibers (inhalable and biopersistent)."&lt;ref&gt;46-Z California Regulatory Notice Register, P.1878 (November 18, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The actions of U.S. NTP and California's OEHHA mean that a cancer warning label for biosoluble fiber glass home and building insulation is no longer required under federal or California law. All fiberglass wools commonly used for thermal and acoustical insulation were reclassified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC") in October 2001 as Not Classifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).&lt;ref name="iarc.fr"&gt;{{cite press release |title= IARC Monographs Programme Re-evaluates Carcinogenic Risks from Airborne Man-Made Vitreous Fibres |publisher= [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] |date= 24 Oct 2001 |url= http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2001/pr137.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People can be exposed to fiberglass in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for fiberglass exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 3 fibers/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and greater than 10 micrometers in length) as a time-weighted average over an 8-hour workday, and a 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Fibrous glass dust|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0288.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union and Germany classify synthetic vitreous fibers as possibly or probably carcinogenic, but fibers can be exempt from this classification if they pass specific tests. Evidence for these classifications is primarily from studies on experimental animals and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. The glass wool epidemiology studies have been reviewed by a panel of international experts convened by the IARC. These experts concluded: "Epidemiologic studies published during the 15 years since the previous IARC monographs review of these fibers in 1988 provide no evidence of increased risks of lung cancer or mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the body cavities) from occupational exposures during the manufacture of these materials, and inadequate evidence overall of any cancer risk."&lt;ref name="iarc.fr"/&gt; Similar reviews of the epidemiology studies have been conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ("ATSDR"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp161.pdf |title= Toxicological Profile for Synthethic Vitreous Fibers |author= Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Fiberglass will irritate the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system. Potential symptoms include irritation of eyes, skin, nose, throat, [[dyspnea]] (breathing difficulty); sore throat, hoarseness and cough.&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; Scientific evidence demonstrates that fiber glass is safe to manufacture, install and use when recommended work practices are followed to reduce temporary mechanical irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insulation Facts #62 "Health and Safety Facts for Fiber Glass", Pub.

Fiberglass insulation should never be left exposed in an occupied area, according to the American Lung Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20010318/News/303189975|title=How safe is your basement?|first=Florence|last=Hannon|website=Seacoastonline.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the resins are cured, [[styrene]] vapors are released. These are irritating to mucous membranes and respiratory tract. Therefore, the Hazardous Substances Ordinance in Germany dictates a maximum occupational exposure limit of 86&amp;nbsp;mg/m³. In certain concentrations may even occur a potentially explosive mixture. Further manufacture of GRP components (grinding, cutting, sawing) creates fine dusts and chips containing glass filaments, as well as tacky dust, in quantities substantial enough to affect people's health and the functionality of machines and equipment. The installation of effective extraction and filtration equipment is required to ensure safety and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Türschmann, V.; Jakschik, C.; Rother, H.-J.

'''FirePro Systems''', is a [[Europe]]an [[active fire protection]] [[Fire protection engineering|engineering]] company specializing in the design, production and distribution of [[environmentally friendly]] [[fire suppression]] systems. It is considered the leading [[brand]] of the [[Condensed aerosol fire suppression|condensed aerosol]] technology with official representation in 75 countries and operations in more than 110. The company and its [[Research and Development|R&amp;D]] division are headquartered in [[Limassol]] along with its Manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firepro.com/en/about FirePro Global: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FirePro Systems [[automatic fire suppression|technology]] came to prominence following the [[Montreal Protocol]] treaty in the 1990s. The treaty was designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of various substances that are responsible for ozone depletion. In 1993, a cluster of [[environment, health and safety]] experts investigating fire suppression alternatives concluded that a particular [[potassium]] based technology, previously used in the [[aerospace]] industry, could be developed as a [[Sustainable business|green alternative]] to the existing Halon 1301 and other chlorofluorocarbon based systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cas-cozy.nl/building/firepro.html Space Technology for Fire Fighting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nist.gov/el/fire_research/upload/R9302953.pdf Kibert, Charles J. and Dierdorf, Douglas. 1993. Encapsulated Micron Aerosol Agents (EMMA). ''Halon Alternatives Technical Conference, 1993.'' NIST. May 11–13, 1993, pp 421–435]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Charis Economides, an [[Sustainopreneurship|ecopreneur]], recognising the potential for a viable [[environmentally friendly]] [[fire suppression system]] set out to establish the technology across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~rlipsch/EE80S/Ecopreneur.pdf Understanding the Green Entrepreneur]&lt;/ref&gt; He sought the help of Industrial [[Chemical Engineer]], Dr Gian Guido Gianfilippi De Parenti, who instrumentally expanded the [[Research and Development]] of the potassium based technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firepro.com/en/team/Gianguido-Gianfilippi-De-Parenti Dr. Gianguido Gianfilippi De Parenti]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Gianguido-De%20Parenti/-1846034132 FirePro Group: Dr. Gianguido Gianfilippi De Parenti]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.cy/books?id=NfFUCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=british+standards+institute+firepro&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Evaluation of Fire Flow Methodologies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjofartsverket.se/pages/5903/50-INF1.pdf International Maritime Organization: Sub-Committee on Fire Protection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43584380/aerosol-overview Dr. Gianguido Gianfilippi De Parenti: Aerosol Extinguishing Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.highbeam.com/411921/article-1G1-205249267/aerosol-overview-aerosol-extinguishing-technology-has Aerosol overview: Aerosol Extinguishing Technology has become a viable alternative to Gaseous Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a group of [[Principles of ecopreneurship|green investors]] led by Evelthon Avgousti together with Economides and De Parenti formed the FirePro group and commercialized the FirePro technology worldwide. Further research and testing was carried out across Europe with the [[Hellenic Organization for Standardization]] the [[Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations|General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations]], the Italian [[Ministry of Interior (Italy)|Ministry of Interior]], the [[United Kingdom|UK]]  [[Building Research Establishment|Loss Prevention Certification Board]] (LPCB), the [[Cyprus Fire Service]] and the Italian Experimental Electrotechnical Center. By 1998, the technology, know-how and all related [[Intellectual Property]] rights were granted to FirePro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firepro.com/en/trademarks/ Intellectual Property]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/ World Intellectual Property Organization: Global Brands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Green Compound==
The solid [[chemical compound|compound]] found inside the aerosol generator units uses [[environment friendly]], naturally occurring [[Potassium chloride|potassium salts]] to extinguish fire by inhibiting the chemical chain reactions in the flame on a [[Molecule|molecular]] level. On activation the compound is transformed into a condensed [[aerosol]] consisting mainly of ([[Potassium|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), ({{chem|[[hydrogen|H]]|2|[[oxygen|O]]}}) (vapor), [[Nitrogen|N2]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]]. The [[Gaseous fire suppression|gas-type]] properties of the aerosol facilitate its even distribution in the protected volume as well as its flow into the natural convection currents of combustion. The solid particles of potassium salts, which are of a few microns in size, are suspended in an [[inert gas]] that displays a high surface to reaction [[Stoichiometry|mass ratio]].  When the aerosol reacts with the [[flame]], Potassium radicals (K*) are formed mainly from the disassociation of ([[Potassium|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]). The K*s bind to other flame free radicals ([[hydroxyl]]s - OH-) forming stable products such as [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]]. This action extinguishes fire without depleting the ambient oxygen content. [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] reacts further in the presence of [[Carbon dioxide|CO2]] and forms ([[Potassium|K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]). It is a [[Sustainable development|sustainable]] approach that challenges conventional firefighting technologies of cooling, starvation or smothering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titan-fire.co.uk/services/fire-suppression/firepro/ Environmentally &amp; Ecologically Friendly Condensed Aerosol Fire Suppression Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The physical and chemical characteristics of the technology do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has listed FirePro [[technology]] in its '''Significant New Alternatives Policy''' (SNAP) under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]. The [[Ecolabel|Green Label]] scheme recommends that they are ozone-friendly and do not contain CFC’s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firepro.com/en/fire-suppression-technology Fire Suppression Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.power-technology.com/contractors/thermal_insulation/firepro-systems/ FirePro Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/introduction.html CIPO's Canadian Patent Database:FirePro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epo.org/index.html European Patent Office:FirePro]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Aerospace Laboratory]] concludes "that the Electronics Instrumentation test objects exposed to the action of the fire extinguishing agent FirePro have not been affected by their combined exposure to the condensed aerosol medium and to the exposure to a temperature/ humidity variation cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firepro-aust.com.au/sites/default/files/web/FirePro/FP_Approval_NLR_Electronics.pdf Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) carries out applied research on behalf of aviation and space]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glass Pavilion''', designed by [[Bruno Taut]] and built in 1914 , was a [[Cupola (geometry)|prismatic]] [[glass]] [[dome]] structure at the [[Cologne]] [[Werkbund Exhibition (1914)|Deutscher Werkbund Exhibition]].&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; The structure was a brightly colored landmark of the exhibition, constructed using [[concrete]] and glass.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; The dome had a double glass outer layer with colored glass prisms on the inside and reflective glass on the outside. The facade had inlaid colored glass plates that acted as mirrors.&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt; Taut described his "little temple of beauty" as "reflections of light whose colors began at the base with a dark blue and rose up through moss green and golden yellow to culminate at the top in a luminous pale yellow."&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt;

The Glass Pavilion is Taut's single best-known architectural achievement.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt; He built it for the German glass industry association specifically for the 1914 exhibition.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt; They financed the structure that was considered a ''house of art''.&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"&gt;[[#Colquhoun2002|Colquhoun]], p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the building was to demonstrate the potential of different types of glass for architecture.&lt;ref name ="weston"/&gt; It also indicated how the material might be used to orchestrate human emotions and assist in the construction of a spiritual utopia. The structure was made at the time when [[expressionism]] was most fashionable in Germany, and it is sometimes referred to as an expressionist-style building.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt; The only known photographs of the building were made in 1914, but these black-and-white images are only marginal representations of the actualities of the work.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt; The building was destroyed soon after the exhibition since it was an exhibition building only and not built for practical use.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="brent"&gt;[[#Richards2006|Richards]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glass Pavilion was a pineapple-shaped multi-faceted polygonal designed rhombic structure.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; It had a fourteen-sided base constructed of thick glass bricks used for the exterior walls devoid of rectangles. Each part of the cupola was designed to recall the complex geometry of nature.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; The Pavilion structure was on a concrete plinth, the entrance reached by two flights of steps (one on either side of the building), which gave the pavilion a temple-like quality. Taut's Glass Pavilion was the first building of importance made of glass bricks.&lt;ref name ="brent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anzovin2000|Anzovin]], p. 15, item 1198.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taut Glass Pavilion interior 1914.jpg|thumb|left|Interior staircases and waterfalls]]
There were glass-treaded metal staircases inside that led to the upper projection room that showed a [[kaleidoscope]] of colors.&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"/&gt; Between the staircases was a seven-tiered cascading waterfall with underwater lighting, this created a sensation of descending to the lower level "as if through sparkling water".&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"/&gt; The interior had prisms producing colored rays from the outside sunlight.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"/&gt; The floor-to-ceiling colored glass walls were mosaic.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"/&gt; All this had the effect of a large crystal producing a large variety of colors.&lt;ref name="weston"&gt;[[#Weston2004|Weston]], p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="colquhoun"/&gt;

The frieze of the Glass Pavilion was written with aphoristic poems of glass done by the anarcho-socialist writer [[Paul Scheerbart]].&lt;ref name="watkin"&gt;[[#Watkin2005|Watkin]], p. 590&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; Examples of these were "Colored glass destroys hatred" and "Without a glass palace, life is a conviction".&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; Scheerbart's ideas also inspired the ritualistic composition of the interior. For Scheerbart, bringing in the light of the moon and the stars brought in different positive feelings which led to a whole new culture.

[[File:Glass Pavilion c.1912.jpg|thumb|"Glass Pavilion" of Taut being built]]
[[Paul Scheerbart]] in 1914 published a book called ''Glasarchitektur'' ("Architecture in glass") and dedicated it to Taut.&lt;ref name="watkin"/&gt; Taut in 1914 founded a magazine called ''Frühlicht'' ("Dawn's Light") for his Expressionist devotees.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt; It emphasized the iconography of glass which is also represented by his Glass Pavilion.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt; This philosophy can be traced back to accounts of [[Solomon's Temple]].&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt; An early drawing of the Glass Pavilion by Taut says he made it in the spirit of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral.&lt;ref name="weston"/&gt;

== Taut's idea for "Glass Pavilion" ==

Taut called on architects to follow him into the contemporary Expressionist painters in seeking a new artistic spirit, he wanted to create a building with a different structure, and similar to Gothic Cathedrals. Bruno told that his building wasn't going to have any real function, it was more to provoke something in someone than a practical building.

The Glass Pavilion or "Glashaus" was one of the first exhibition building designed as a mechanism to create vivid experiences, where people would be able to feel, touch and primarily see.

The goal of this functionless building as that architecture would include the other arts of painting and sculpture, to achieve a new, unified expression.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The longing for purity and clarity, for glowing lightness and crystalline exactness, for immaterial lightness and infinite liveliness found a means of its fulfillment in glass—the most ineffable, most elementary, most flexible and most changeable of materials, richest in meaning and inspiration, fusing with the world like no other. This least fixed of materials transforms itself with every change of atmosphere. It is infinitely rich in elations, mirroring what is above, below, and what is below, above. It is animated, full of spirit and alive ... It is an example of a transcendent passion to build, functionless, free, satisfying no practical demands—and yet a functional building, soulful, awakening spiritual inspirations—an ethical functional building" -Behne&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This building was made into an installation, a symbol, a mystical sign and a start for a new world view and future architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33322">'''Interchangeable parts''' are parts ([[wikt:component#Noun|components]]) that are, for practical purposes, identical. They are made to [[specification]]s that ensure that they are so nearly identical that they will fit into any assembly of the same type. One such part can freely replace another, without any custom fitting, such as [[File (tool)|filing]]. This interchangeability allows easy assembly of new devices, and easier repair of existing devices, while minimizing both the time and skill required of the person doing the assembly or repair.

The concept of interchangeability was crucial to the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, and has become an important element of some modern manufacturing but is missing from other important industries.

Interchangeability of parts was achieved by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several [[machine tool]]s, such as the [[Henry Maudslay#Lathe design|slide rest lathe]], [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[turret lathe]], [[milling machine]] and [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check the accuracy of the finished parts.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Electrification]] allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating [[line shaft]] drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Edison as I Know Him |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |authorlink=Henry Ford |last2=Crowther |first2=Samuel |year=1930 |publisher= Cosmopolitan Book Company |location= New York|isbn= |pages=30 |url=http://www.atomicacreative.com/images/ACG_EdisonAsIKnowHim.pdf   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern machine tools often have [[numerical control]] (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.

Methods for industrial production of interchangeable parts in the United States were first developed in the nineteenth century. The term ''[[American system of manufacturing]]'' was sometimes applied to them at the time, in distinction from earlier methods. Within a few decades such methods were in use in various countries, so ''American system'' is now a term of historical reference rather than current industrial nomenclature.

== First use ==
Evidence of the use of interchangeable parts can be traced back over two thousand years to [[Carthage]] in the [[First Punic War]]. Carthaginian ships had standardized, interchangeable parts that even came with assembly instructions akin to "tab a into slot b" marked on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmdtkw.org/ALRIAncRomUnit4Slides.html Rome, Carthage, and the Punic Wars]&lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile Carthage was mass producing warships.  And that's not an exaggeration either about numbers or about shipbuilding methods; Carthaginian warships were built up of standard interchangeable parts.  We know this not only from contemporary accounts, but also from recovered Carthaginian ships like the half of a Carthaginian ship shown in (c), above, that was recovered off the coast of Marsala at the western tip of Sicily; it was brand new when it was sunk by the Romans, and it still retains marks giving assembly instructions ("tab a into slot b", etc.)  Other recovered ships had identical parts.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Asia]] during the [[Warring States]] period and later the [[Qin Dynasty]], bronze crossbow triggers and locking mechanisms were mass-produced and made to be interchangeable.

==Origins of the modern concept==
In the late 18th century, French General [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval]] promoted standardized weapons in what became known as the ''[[Gribeauval system|Système Gribeauval]]'' after it was issued as a royal order in 1765. (Its focus at the time was [[artillery]] more than [[musket]]s or [[handgun]]s.) One of the accomplishments of the system was that solid cast cannons were bored to precise tolerances, which allowed the walls to be thinner than cannons poured with hollow cores.  However, because cores were often off center, the wall thickness determined the size of the bore.  Standardized boring allowed cannons to be shorter without sacrificing accuracy and range because of the tighter fit of the [[shell (projectile)|shells]]. It also allowed standardization of the shells.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984/&gt;

Before the 18th century, devices such as guns were made one at a time by [[gunsmith]]s in a unique manner.  If one single component of a firearm needed a replacement, the entire firearm either had to be sent to an expert gunsmith for custom repairs, or discarded and replaced by another firearm. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of replacing these methods with a system of interchangeable manufacture was gradually developed.&lt;ref name="Fitch1882p4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitch|1882}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gtZy4zvRRi0C&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp25-46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984|pp=25–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development took decades and involved many people.&lt;ref name="Fitch1882p4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984pp25-46"/&gt;

Gribeauval provided patronage to [[Honoré Blanc]], who attempted to implement the ''[[Gribeauval system|Système Gribeauval]]'' at the musket level. By around 1778, Honoré Blanc began producing some of the first firearms with interchangeable flint locks, although they were carefully made by craftsmen. Blanc demonstrated in front of a committee of scientists that his muskets could be fitted with flint locks picked at random from a pile of parts.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984/&gt;

Muskets with interchangeable locks caught the attention of [[Thomas Jefferson]] through the efforts of Honoré Blanc when Jefferson was Ambassador to France in 1785. Jefferson tried to persuade Blanc to move to America, but was not successful, so he wrote to the American Secretary of War with the idea, and when he returned to the USA he worked to fund its development.  President [[George Washington]] approved of the idea, and by 1798 a contract was issued to [[Eli Whitney]] for 12,000 muskets built under the new system.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co.), 1978/1995 {{ISBN|0-316-11672-6}}, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis de Tousard]], who fled the French Revolution, joined the U.S. Corp of Artillerists in 1795 and wrote an influential artillerist's manual that stressed the importance of standardization.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984/&gt;

== Implementation ==
Numerous inventors began to try to implement the principle Blanc had described. The development of the machine tools and manufacturing practices required would be a great expense to the U.S. [[Ordnance Department]], and for some years while trying to achieve interchangeabililty, the firearms produced cost more to manufacture. By 1853, there was evidence that interchangeable parts, then perfected by the Federal Armories, led to savings.  The Ordnance Department freely shared the techniques used with outside suppliers.&lt;ref name =Hounshell-1984/&gt;

=== Eli Whitney and an early attempt ===
In the US, [[Eli Whitney]] saw the potential benefit of developing "interchangeable parts" for the firearms of the United States military. In July 1801 he built ten guns, all containing the same exact parts and mechanisms, then disassembled them before the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]].  He placed the parts in a mixed pile and, with help, reassembled all of the firearms right in front of Congress, much like Blanc had done some years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Dusen|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress was captivated and ordered a standard for all United States equipment.  The use of interchangeable parts removed the problems of earlier eras concerning the difficulty or impossibility of producing new parts for old equipment. If one firearm part failed, another could be ordered, and the firearm would not have to be discarded. The catch was that Whitney's guns were costly and handmade by skilled workmen.

Charles Fitch credited Whitney with successfully executing a firearms contract with interchangeable parts using the [[American system of manufacturing|American System]],&lt;ref name="Fitch1882p4"/&gt; but historians [[Merritt Roe Smith]] and [[Robert B. Gordon]] have since determined that Whitney never actually achieved interchangeable parts manufacturing. His family's arms company, however, did so after his death.

=== Brunel's sailing blocks ===
[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|A pulley block for rigging on a sailing ship]]

Mass production using interchangeable parts was first achieved in 1803 by [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] in cooperation with [[Henry Maudslay]] and Simon Goodrich, under the management of (and with contributions by) Brigadier-General Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], the Inspector General of Naval Works at [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], [[Portsmouth Dockyard]],  [[Hampshire]], England. At the time, the [[Napoleonic War]] was at its height, and the [[Royal Navy]] was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 [[Block (sailing)|pulley blocks]] to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system.

Marc Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a founding father of [[machine tool]] technology who had developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800 which standardized [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time,&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, Jr. (2005). "The Metallurgic Age: The Victorian Flowering of Invention and Industrial Science". p. 169. McFarland&lt;/ref&gt; collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery; the proposal was submitted to the [[Admiralty]] who agreed to commission his services. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made in three different sizes. The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour [[productivity]] due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel's son and engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1808, annual production had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makingthemodernworld.org.uk/stories/enlightenment_and_measurement/05.ST.02/?scene=3&amp;tv=true|title=Making the Modern World – Rational manufacture|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouthdockyard.org.uk/Page%206.htm|title=PORTSMOUTH ROYAL DOCKYARD HISTOR|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924212638/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/collections/exhiblets/block/start.asp |archivedate=2006-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert1965"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper1982"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coad1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coad|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coad2005"&gt;{{Harvnb|Coad|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkin1999"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkin|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CantrellCookson2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cantrell|Cookson|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terry's clocks: success in wood ===
[[File:Wooden Gear.jpg|thumb|A wooden gear from one of Terry's tall case clocks, showing the use of milled teeth.]]
[[Eli Terry]] was using interchangeable parts using a milling machine as early as 1800. Ward Francillon, a horologist concluded in a study that Terry had already accomplished interchangeable parts as early as 1800. The study examined several of Terry's clocks produced between 1800-1807. The parts were labeled and interchanged as needed. The study concluded that all clock pieces were interchangeable.
The very first mass production using interchangeable parts in America was [[Eli Terry]]'s 1806 Porter Contract, which called for the production of 4000 clocks in three years.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Tect&lt;/ref&gt; During this contract, Terry crafted four-thousand wooden gear tall case movements, at a time when the annual average was about a dozen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eli Terry and the Connecticut Shelf Clock; Text&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[Eli Whitney]], Terry manufactured his products without government funding. Terry saw the potential of clocks becoming a household object. With the use of a milling machine, Terry was able to mass-produce clock wheels and plates a few dozen at the same time. Jigs and templates were used to make uniform pinions, so that all parts could be assembled using an [[Assembly Line]].

.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== North and Hall: success in metal ===
The crucial step toward interchangeability in metal parts was taken by [[Simeon North]], working only a few miles from [[Eli Terry]].  North created one of the world's first true [[milling machine]]s to do metal shaping that had been done by hand with a file. Diana Muir believes that North's milling machine was online around 1816.&lt;ref name="Muir2000"&gt;{{Harvnb|Muir|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Muir, Merritt Roe Smith, and [[Robert B. Gordon]] all agree that before 1832 both Simeon North and [[John H. Hall (soldier)|John Hall]] were able to mass-produce complex machines with moving parts (guns) using a system that entailed the use of rough-forged parts, with a milling machine that milled the parts to near-correct size, and that were then "filed to gage by hand with the aid of filing jigs."&lt;ref name="Gordon1989"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians differ over the question of whether Hall or North made the crucial improvement.  Merrit Roe Smith believes that it was done by Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Muir demonstrates the close personal ties and professional alliances between Simeon North and neighboring mechanics mass-producing wooden clocks to argue that the process for manufacturing guns with interchangeable parts was most probably devised by North in emulation of the successful methods used in mass-producing clocks.&lt;ref name="Muir2000"/&gt; It may not be possible to resolve the question with absolute certainty unless documents now unknown should surface in the future.

=== Late 19th and early 20th centuries: dissemination throughout manufacturing ===
Skilled engineers and machinists, many with armory experience, spread interchangeable manufacturing techniques to other American industries including [[clockmaker]]s and sewing machine manufacturers Wilcox and Gibbs and Wheeler and Wilson, who used interchangeable parts before 1860.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; as well as locomotive makers.  Typewriters followed some years later. Then large scale production of bicycles in the 1880s began to use the interchangeable system.&lt;ref name="Hounshell-1984" /&gt;

During these decades, true interchangeability grew from a scarce and difficult achievement into an everyday capability throughout the manufacturing industries.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, [[history of technology|historians of technology]] broadened the world's understanding of the history of the development. Few people outside that academic discipline knew much about the topic until as recently as the 1980s and 1990s, when the academic knowledge began finding wider audiences. As recently as the 1960s, when [[Alfred P. Sloan]] published his famous memoir and management treatise, ''My Years with General Motors'', even the longtime president and chair of the largest manufacturing enterprise that had ever existed knew very little about the history of the development, other than to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Henry M. Leland]] was], I believe, one of those mainly responsible for bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile manufacturing. […] It has been called to my attention that Eli Whitney, long before, had started the development of interchangeable parts in connection with the manufacture of guns, a fact which suggests a line of descent from Whitney to Leland to the automobile industry.&lt;ref name="Sloan1964pp20-21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sloan|1964|pp=20–21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the better-known books on the subject, which was first published in 1984 and has enjoyed a readership beyond academia, has been [[David A. Hounshell]]'s ''From the American System to Mass Production, 1800–1932: The Development of Manufacturing Technology in the United States''.&lt;ref name="Hounshell1984"/&gt;

==Socioeconomic context==

The principle of interchangeable parts flourished and developed throughout the 19th century, and led to [[mass production]] in many industries. It was based on the use of templates and other [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], applied by semi-skilled labor using [[machine tool]]s to augment (and later largely replace) the traditional [[hand tool]]s. Throughout this century there was much development work to be done in creating [[Gauge (instrument)|gauges]], measuring tools (such as [[caliper]]s and [[micrometer]]s), standards (such as [[Screw thread#History of standardization|those for screw threads]]), and processes (such as [[scientific management]]), but the principle of interchangeability remained constant. With the introduction of the [[assembly line]] at the beginning of the 20th century, interchangeable parts became [[wikt:ubiquitous#Adjective|ubiquitous]] elements of manufacturing.

==Selective assembly==
Interchangeability relies on parts' dimensions falling within the tolerance range. The most common mode of assembly is to design and manufacture such that, as long as each part that reaches assembly is within tolerance, the mating of parts can be totally random. This has value for all the reasons already discussed earlier.

There is another mode of assembly, called "selective assembly", which gives up ''some'' of the randomness capability in trade-off for other [[value (economics)|value]]. There are two main areas of application that benefit economically from selective assembly: when tolerance ranges are so tight that they cannot quite be held reliably (making the total randomness unavailable); and when tolerance ranges can be reliably held, but the fit and finish of the final assembly is being maximized by voluntarily giving up some of the randomness (which makes it available but not ideally desirable). In either case the principle of selective assembly is the same: parts are ''selected'' for mating, rather than being mated at random. As the parts are [[inspection|inspected]], they are graded out into separate bins based on what end of the range they fall in (or violate). Falling within the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''heavy'' or ''light''; violating the high or low end of a range is usually called being ''oversize'' or ''undersize''. Examples are given below.

French and Vierck&lt;ref name="French_Vierck_1953_p374"&gt;{{Harvnb|French|Vierck|et al|1953|p=374}}.&lt;/ref&gt; provide a one-paragraph description of selective assembly that aptly summarizes the concept.

One might ask, if parts must be selected for mating, then what makes selective assembly any different from the oldest craft methods? But there is in fact a significant difference. Selective assembly merely grades the parts into several ''ranges''; within each range, there is still random interchangeability. This is quite different from the older method of fitting by a craftsman, where each mated set of parts is specifically filed to fit each part with a ''specific, unique'' counterpart.

===Random assembly not available: oversize and undersize parts===
In contexts where the application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the [[requirement]] may push slightly past the limit of the ability of the machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of ''total'' interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00&amp;nbsp;+0&amp;nbsp;−0.01&amp;nbsp;mm for the pin, and 12.00&amp;nbsp;+.01&amp;nbsp;−0 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily [[scrap]], ''but'' they can only be mated with counterparts that ''also'' came out oversize (say a hole at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching ''under''size parts with ''under''size counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12&amp;nbsp;mm dimension does not require extreme ''accuracy'', ''but'' the desired fit between the parts does require good ''precision'' (see the article on [[accuracy and precision]]). This allows the makers to "cheat a little" on ''total'' interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines for which there is no intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the [[unit cost]] of the products, and it does not impede future service work.

An example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a car transmission where there is no expectation that the field service person will repair the old transmission; instead, he will simply swap in a new one. Therefore, total interchangeability was not absolutely required for the assemblies inside the transmissions. It would have been specified anyway, simply on general principle, except for a certain shaft that required precision so high as to cause great annoyance and high scrap rates in the grinding area, but for which only decent accuracy was required, as long as the fit with its hole was good in every case. Money could be saved by saving many shafts from the scrap bin.

====Economic and commercial realities====
Examples like the one above are not as common in real commerce as they conceivably could be, mostly because of [[separation of concerns]], where each part of a complex system is expected to give performance that does not make any limiting assumptions about other parts of the system. In the car transmission example, the separation of concerns is that individual firms and customers accept no lack of freedom or options from others in the supply chain. For example, in the car buyer's view, the car manufacturer is "not within its rights" to assume that no field-service mechanic will ever repair the old transmission instead of replacing it. The customer expects that that decision will be preserved for ''him'' to make later, at the repair shop, based on which option is less expensive for him at that time (figuring that replacing one shaft is cheaper than replacing a whole transmission). This logic is not always valid in reality; it might have been better for the customer's total ownership cost to pay a lower initial price for the car (especially if the transmission service is covered under the standard warranty for 10 years, and the buyer intends to replace the car before then anyway) than to pay a higher initial price for the car but preserve the option of total interchangeability of every last nut, bolt, and shaft throughout the car (when it is not going to be taken advantage of anyway). But commerce is generally too chaotically multivariate for this logic to prevail, so total interchangeability ends up being specified and achieved even when it adds expense that was "needless" from a holistic view of the commercial system. But this may be avoided to the extent that customers experience the ''overall'' value (which their minds can detect and appreciate) without having to understand its logical analysis. Thus buyers of an amazingly affordable car (surprisingly low initial price) will probably never complain that the transmission was not field-serviceable as long as ''they themselves'' never had to pay for transmission service in the lifespan of their ownership. This analysis can be important for the manufacturer to understand (even if it is lost on the customer), because he can carve for himself a competitive advantage in the marketplace if he can accurately predict where to "cut corners" in ways that the customer will never have to pay for. Thus he could give himself lower transmission unit cost. However, he must be sure when he does so that the transmissions he's using are reliable, because their replacement, being covered under a long warranty, will be at his expense.

===Random assembly available but not ideally desirable: "light" and "heavy" parts===
The other main area of application for selective assembly is in contexts where total interchangeability is in fact achieved, but the "fit and finish" of the final products can be enhanced by minimizing the dimensional mismatch between mating parts. Consider another application similar to the one above with the 12&amp;nbsp;mm pin. But say that in this example, not only is the ''precision'' important (to produce the desired fit), but the ''accuracy'' is also important (because the 12&amp;nbsp;mm pin must interact with something else that will have to be accurately sized at 12&amp;nbsp;mm). Some of the implications of this example are that the rejection rate cannot be lowered; all parts must fall within tolerance range or be scrapped. So there are no savings to be had from salvaging oversize or undersize parts from scrap, then. However, there ''is'' still one bit of value to be had from selective assembly: having all the mated pairs have as close to identical sliding fit as possible (as opposed to some tighter fits and some looser fits—all sliding, but with varying resistance).

An example of a product that might benefit from this approach could be a [[toolroom]]-grade [[machine tool]], where not only is the accuracy highly important but also the fit and finish.

'''Aviation pioneers''' are people directly and indirectly responsible for the advancement of flight, including people who worked to achieve manned flight before the invention of aircraft, as well as others who achieved significant "firsts" in aviation after heavier-than-air flight became routine. Pioneers of aviation have contributed to the development of aeronautics in one or more ways: through science and theory, theoretical or applied design, by constructing models or experimental prototypes, the mass production of aircraft for commercial and government request, achievements in flight, and providing financial resources and publicity to expand the field of aviation.

==Table key==

===Pioneer type===
* '''Science''': Contributions to aerodynamic theory, aviation principles, discoveries advancing aircraft development, etc.
* '''Design''': Original or derivative ideas or drawings for conceptual/experimental/practical methods of air travel
* '''Construction''': Building prototypes/experimental/practical aircraft
* '''Manufacture''': Building aircraft to fill commercial or government requests
* '''Aviator''': International firsts, major records, major awards received
* '''Support''': Significant industrial endorsements, philanthropic, founding of relevant organizations, etc.
*('''†''') : A dagger following the pioneer's name indicates they died in or as a result of an aircraft accident. When available, the aircraft type/model and the place of the accident are included in the text.

===Sorting===
The table is organized by pioneer name in alphabetical order. Columns for Name, Date of birth/Date of death, Country and Achievement can be sorted in either ascending or descending order. If two pioneers are paired together, sorting by DOB or Country uses the information for the first of the pair. The Achievement column will sort according to the date of the pioneer's earliest significant contribution to aviation.

==Inclusion criteria==

At least one of the following criteria is met:
*''Scientific'' contribution to theory and principles (whether correct or not) that were used as contemporary resources, building blocks, or influenced period thought, significant scientific or theoretical achievements with model aircraft;
*''Designing'' any aircraft (pre-1910), or a distinct/innovative new design;
*''Constructing'' a prototype aircraft (pre-1910);
*''Manufacturing'' aircraft (including some direct or supervisory control over design) for commercial and/or military contracts (intended to represent founders of the aviation industry);
*''Flying'' (Aviator) solo in an aircraft and receiving a relevant flying certificate (pre-1910); or any significant national (e.g., a flight representing a country's first) or international achievement, or flight award (initial record holders or demolishing existing records, but not simply breaking established records);
*''Supporting'' aviation (e.g., positive publicity; personal, corporate and/or philanthropic sponsorship, education).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16275">In [[control theory]] and [[signal processing]], a [[LTI system theory|linear, time-invariant]] system is said to be '''minimum-phase''' if the system and its [[Inverse function|inverse]] are [[causal system|causal]] and [[BIBO stability|stable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hassibi, Babak |author2=Kailath, Thomas |author3=Sayed, Ali H. |title=Linear estimation |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2000 |pages=193 |isbn=0-13-022464-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Smith III, ''[http://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/filters/Definition_Minimum_Phase_Filters.html Introduction to Digital Filters with Audio Applications]'' (September 2007 Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contradistinction, a linear, non-minimum phase transfer function can be modeled as minimum phase transfer function in series with an all-pass-filter, the characteristic issue of that series combination will be zeroes in the right-half-plane. A consequence of zeroes in the right-half-plane, is that the inverted function is not stable. The all pass filter (can also be transport delay) inserts 'excess phase', that is why the resulting function would be non-minimum phase. 

For example, a discrete-time system with [[rational function|rational]] [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt; can only satisfy [[Causal#Engineering|causality]] and [[BIBO stability|stability]] requirements if all of its [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s are inside the [[unit circle]]. However, we are free to choose whether the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]]s of the system are inside or outside the [[unit circle]]. A system with rational transfer function is minimum-phase if all its zeros are also inside the unit circle. Insight is given below as to why this system is called minimum-phase.

== Inverse system ==

A system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; is invertible if we can uniquely determine its input from its output. I.e., we can find a system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; such that if we apply &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; followed by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the identity system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[Inverse matrix]] for a finite-dimensional analog). I.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv} \, \mathbb{H} = \mathbb{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; is input to system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; and gives output &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H} \, \tilde{x} = \tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the inverse system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt; gives the following.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv} \, \tilde{y} = \mathbb{H}_{inv} \, \mathbb{H} \, \tilde{x} = \mathbb{I} \, \tilde{x} = \tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt;

So we see that the inverse system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; allows us to determine uniquely the input &lt;math&gt;\tilde{x}&lt;/math&gt; from the output &lt;math&gt;\tilde{y}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Discrete-time example ===

Suppose that the system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete-time, [[LTI system theory|linear, time-invariant]] (LTI) system described by the [[impulse response]] &lt;math&gt;h(n)&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' in ''Z''. Additionally, suppose &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; has impulse response &lt;math&gt;h_{inv}(n)&lt;/math&gt;. The cascade of two LTI systems is a [[convolution]]. In this case, the above relation is the following:

:&lt;math&gt;(h * h_{inv}) (n) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h(k) \, h_{inv} (n-k) =  \delta (n)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta (n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] or the [[identity matrix|identity]] system in the discrete-time case. Note that this inverse system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; need not be unique.

== Minimum phase system ==

When we impose the constraints of [[causal]]ity and [[BIBO stability|stability]], the inverse system is unique; and the system &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}&lt;/math&gt; and its inverse &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}_{inv}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''minimum-phase'''. The causality and stability constraints in the discrete-time case are the following (for time-invariant systems where h is the system's impulse response):

=== Causality ===

:&lt;math&gt;h(n) = 0 \,\, \forall \, n &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;h_{inv} (n) = 0 \,\, \forall \, n &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Stability ===

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}{\left|h(n)\right|} = \| h \|_{1} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}{\left|h_{inv}(n)\right|} = \| h_{inv} \|_{1} &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

See the article on [[BIBO stability|stability]] for the analogous conditions for the continuous-time case.

== Frequency analysis ==

=== Discrete-time frequency analysis ===

Performing frequency analysis for the discrete-time case will provide some insight. The time-domain equation is the following.

:&lt;math&gt;(h * h_{inv}) (n) = \,\! \delta (n)&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Z-transform]] gives the following relation in the z-domain.

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) \, H_{inv}(z) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation, we realize that

:&lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(z) = \frac{1}{H(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

For simplicity, we consider only the case of a [[rational function|rational]] [[transfer function]] ''H'' (''z''). Causality and stability imply that all [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of ''H'' (''z'') must be strictly inside the [[unit circle]] (See [[BIBO stability#Discrete-time signals|stability]]). Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;H(z) = \frac{A(z)}{D(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' (''z'') and ''D'' (''z'') are [[polynomial]] in ''z''. Causality and stability imply that the [[zero (complex analysis)|poles]] &amp;ndash; the [[Root of a function|root]]s of ''D'' (''z'') &amp;ndash; must be strictly inside the [[unit circle]]. We also know that

:&lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(z) = \frac{D(z)}{A(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

So, causality and stability for &lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(z)&lt;/math&gt; imply that its [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] &amp;ndash; the roots of ''A'' (''z'') &amp;ndash; must be inside the [[unit circle]]. These two constraints imply that both the zeros and the poles of a minimum phase system must be strictly inside the unit circle.

=== Continuous-time frequency analysis ===

Analysis for the continuous-time case proceeds in a similar manner except that we use the [[Laplace transform]] for frequency analysis. The time-domain equation is the following.

:&lt;math&gt;(h * h_{inv}) (t) = \,\! \delta (t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The [[Dirac delta function]] is the identity operator in the continuous-time case because of the sifting property with any signal ''x'' (''t'').

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(t) * x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t - \tau) x(\tau) d \tau = x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Laplace transform]] gives the following relation in the [[s-plane]].

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) \, H_{inv}(s) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

From this relation, we realize that

:&lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(s) = \frac{1}{H(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Again, for simplicity, we consider only the case of a [[rational function|rational]] [[transfer function]] ''H''(''s''). Causality and stability imply that all [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of ''H'' (''s'') must be strictly inside the left-half [[s-plane]] (See [[BIBO stability#Continuous-time signals|stability]]). Suppose

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{A(s)}{D(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' (''s'') and ''D'' (''s'') are [[polynomial]] in ''s''. Causality and stability imply that the [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] &amp;ndash; the [[Root of a function|root]]s of ''D'' (''s'') &amp;ndash; must be inside the left-half [[s-plane]]. We also know that

:&lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(s) = \frac{D(s)}{A(s)}&lt;/math&gt;

So, causality and stability for &lt;math&gt;H_{inv}(s)&lt;/math&gt; imply that its [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] &amp;ndash; the roots of ''A'' (''s'') &amp;ndash; must be strictly inside the left-half [[s-plane]]. These two constraints imply that both the zeros and the poles of a minimum phase system must be strictly inside the left-half [[s-plane]].

=== Relationship of magnitude response to phase response ===
{{See also|Kramers–Kronig_relations#Magnitude_(gain)–phase_relation|label 1=Magnitude (gain)–phase relation}}
A minimum-phase system, whether discrete-time or continuous-time, has an additional useful property that the natural logarithm of the magnitude of the frequency response (the "gain" measured in [[neper]]s which is proportional to [[Decibel|dB]]) is related to the phase angle of the frequency response (measured in [[radian]]s) by the [[Hilbert transform]].  That is, in the continuous-time case, let

:&lt;math&gt;H(j \omega) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  H(s) \Big|_{s = j \omega}  \ &lt;/math&gt;

be the complex frequency response of system ''H''(''s'').  Then, only for a minimum-phase system, the phase response of ''H''(''s'') is related to the gain by

:&lt;math&gt; \arg \left[ H(j \omega) \right] = -\mathcal{H} \lbrace \log \left( |H(j \omega)| \right) \rbrace \ &lt;/math&gt;

and, inversely,

:&lt;math&gt; \log \left( |H(j \omega)| \right) = \log \left( |H(j \infty)| \right) + \mathcal{H} \lbrace \arg \left[H(j \omega) \right] \rbrace \ &lt;/math&gt;.

Stated more compactly, let

:&lt;math&gt;H(j \omega) = |H(j \omega)| e^{j \arg \left[H(j \omega) \right]} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  e^{\alpha(\omega)}  e^{j \phi(\omega)} = e^{\alpha(\omega) + j \phi(\omega)} \ &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; are real functions of a real variable.  Then

:&lt;math&gt; \phi(\omega) = -\mathcal{H} \lbrace \alpha(\omega) \rbrace \ &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(\omega) = \alpha(\infty) + \mathcal{H} \lbrace \phi(\omega) \rbrace \ &lt;/math&gt;.

The Hilbert transform operator is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} \lbrace x(t) \rbrace \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \widehat{x}(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{x(\tau)}{t-\tau}\, d\tau \ &lt;/math&gt; .

An equivalent corresponding relationship is also true for discrete-time minimum-phase systems.

== Minimum phase in the time domain ==

For all [[causal]] and [[BIBO stability|stable]] systems that have the same [[frequency response|magnitude response]], the minimum phase system has its energy concentrated near the start of the [[impulse response]]. i.e., it minimizes the following function which we can think of as the delay of energy in the [[impulse response]].

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n = m}^{\infty} \left| h(n) \right|^2 \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \forall \, m \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}&lt;/math&gt;

== Minimum phase as minimum group delay ==

For all [[causal]] and [[BIBO stability|stable]] systems that have the same [[frequency response|magnitude response]], the minimum phase system has the minimum [[group delay]]. The following proof illustrates this idea of minimum [[group delay]].

Suppose we consider one [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of the [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;H(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Let's place this [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; inside the [[unit circle]] (&lt;math&gt;\left| a \right| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;) and see how the [[group delay]] is affected.

:&lt;math&gt;a = \left| a \right| e^{i \theta_a} \, \mbox{ where } \, \theta_a = \mbox{Arg}(a)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; contributes the factor &lt;math&gt;1 - a z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[transfer function]], the phase contributed by this term is the following.

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_a \left(\omega \right) = \mbox{Arg} \left(1 - a e^{-i \omega} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \mbox{Arg} \left(1 - \left| a \right| e^{i \theta_a} e^{-i \omega} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \mbox{Arg} \left(1 - \left| a \right| e^{-i (\omega - \theta_a)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \mbox{Arg} \left( \left\{ 1 - \left| a \right| cos( \omega - \theta_a ) \right\} + i \left\{ \left| a \right| sin( \omega - \theta_a ) \right\}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;= \mbox{Arg} \left( \left\{ \left| a \right|^{-1} - \cos( \omega - \theta_a ) \right\} + i \left\{ \sin( \omega - \theta_a ) \right\} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi_a (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; contributes the following to the [[group delay]].

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d \phi_a (\omega)}{d \omega} = \frac{ \sin^2( \omega - \theta_a ) + \cos^2( \omega - \theta_a ) - \left| a \right|^{-1} \cos( \omega - \theta_a )

}{

\sin^2( \omega - \theta_a ) + \cos^2( \omega - \theta_a ) + \left| a \right|^{-2} - 2 \left| a \right|^{-1} \cos( \omega - \theta_a )

 }&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; -\frac{d \phi_a (\omega)}{d \omega} = \frac{ \left| a \right| - \cos( \omega - \theta_a )

}{

\left| a \right| + \left| a \right|^{-1} - 2 \cos( \omega - \theta_a )

 }&lt;/math&gt;

The denominator and &lt;math&gt;\theta_a&lt;/math&gt; are invariant to reflecting the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; outside of the [[unit circle]], i.e., replacing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;(a^{-1})^{*}&lt;/math&gt;. However, by reflecting &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; outside of the unit circle, we increase the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\left| a \right|&lt;/math&gt; in the numerator. Thus, having &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; inside the [[unit circle]] minimizes the [[group delay]] contributed by the factor &lt;math&gt;1 - a z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. We can extend this result to the general case of more than one [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] since the phase of the multiplicative factors of the form &lt;math&gt;1 - a_i z^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is additive. I.e., for a [[transfer function]] with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]]s,

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Arg}\left( \prod_{i = 1}^N  \left( 1 - a_i z^{-1} \right) \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^N \mbox{Arg}\left( 1 - a_i z^{-1} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

So, a minimum phase system with all [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]]s inside the [[unit circle]] minimizes the [[group delay]] since the [[group delay]] of each individual [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]] is minimized.


[[File:Minimum and maximum phase responses.gif|frame|center|Illustration of the calculus above. Top and bottom are filters with same gain response (on the left : the [[Nyquist diagram]]s, on the right : phase responses), but the filter on the top with &lt;math&gt;a = 0.8 &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest amplitude in phase response.]]

== Non-minimum phase ==

Systems that are causal and stable whose inverses are causal and unstable are known as ''non-minimum-phase'' systems. A given non-minimum phase system will have a greater phase contribution than the minimum-phase system with the equivalent magnitude response.

A ''maximum-phase'' system is the opposite of a minimum phase system. A causal and stable LTI system is a ''maximum-phase'' system if its inverse is causal and unstable.{{dubious|date=September 2014}} That is,
* The zeros of the discrete-time system are outside the [[unit circle]].
* The zeros of the continuous-time system are in the right-hand side of the [[complex plane]].
Such a system is called a ''maximum-phase system'' because it has the maximum [[group delay]] of the set of systems that have the same magnitude response. In this set of equal-magnitude-response systems, the maximum phase system will have maximum energy delay.

For example, the two continuous-time LTI systems described by the transfer functions
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{s + 10}{s + 5} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{s - 10}{s + 5}&lt;/math&gt;
have equivalent magnitude responses; however, the second system has a much larger contribution to the phase shift. Hence, in this set, the second system is the maximum-phase system and the first system is the minimum-phase system.

=== Mixed phase ===

A ''mixed-phase'' system has some of its [[Zero (complex analysis)|zero]]s inside the [[unit circle]] and has others outside the [[unit circle]]. Thus, its [[group delay]] is neither minimum or maximum but somewhere between the [[group delay]] of the minimum and maximum phase equivalent system.

For example, the continuous-time LTI system described by transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ (s + 1)(s - 5)(s + 10) }{ (s+2)(s+4)(s+6) }&lt;/math&gt;
is stable and causal; however, it has zeros on both the left- and right-hand sides of the [[complex plane]]. Hence, it is a ''mixed-phase'' system.

=== Linear phase ===

A [[linear phase|linear-phase]] system has constant [[group delay]]. Non-trivial linear phase or nearly linear phase systems are also mixed phase.

The '''Minkowski Prize''' is given by the [[European Association for the Study of Diabetes]] (EASD), in recognition to research which has been carried out by a person normally residing in Europe, as manifested by publications which contribute to the advancement of knowledge concerning [[diabetes mellitus]]. The Prize honors the name of [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858–1931), a [[physician]] and [[physiologist]] who was the discoverer of the role of [[pancreas]] in the control of [[glucose]] [[metabolism]]. It is awarded annually since 1966 and the winner is invited to pronounce a Minkowski Lecture during the EASD Annual Conference. It is traditionally seen as the most prestigious European prize in the field of diabetes research. 

Since 1966 the award is sponsored by a pharmaceutical company [[Sanofi-Aventis]]. The prize consists of a certificate and 20,000 euros plus travel expenses. The candidate must be less than 45 years of age on 1 January of the year of award. Self-nomination is also possible.

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2008}}
'''PLX''', or '''Picatinny Liquid Explosive''', is a liquid binary [[explosive]], a mixture of 95% [[nitromethane]] (NM) along with 5% [[ethylene diamine]] (EDA) as a sensitizer. Other [[amine]] compounds can be used instead of ethylene diamine, such as [[triethylene tetramine]] or [[ethanolamine]], but EDA has been found to be most effective. PLX is a fairly powerful [[high explosive]], marginally exceeding the destructive yield of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]].

==Properties==
PLX, when mixed, is a transparent liquid with a yellowish tint. Both ethylene diamine and nitromethane are very volatile, requiring the contents to be sealed if any storage is intended. Generally, for safety purposes, the contents are transported separately and mixed on site. PLX is known to have a [[velocity of detonation]] (VoD) of anywhere between 6,000 and 7,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, depending on diameter. Although greatly sensitized by the addition of EDA, PLX still requires a powerful [[blasting cap]] or a small booster charge to successfully detonate.

==Uses and discovery==
PLX was invented during [[World War II]] by the [[Picatinny Arsenal]] in New Jersey. It was originally designed to clear [[minefield]]s by being spread via plane over the targeted area or poured from a safe distance and detonated by troops on the ground.

This explosive can also be [[gel]]led through the addition of [[nitrocellulose]], [[erythritol tetranitrate|ETN]], or any number of soluble [[nitrate|nitrate esters]] or [[gelling agent]]s. This allows for powdered metals, such as [[aluminum]] or [[magnesium]], to be suspended in the mixture. The metal powders act as [[fuel]], increasing heat and energy output but lowering the [[brisance]] and VoD. The result is a  more sustained blast wave and a "push and heave" effect, desirable for [[thermobaric]] purposes. Trzciński{{who?|date=April 2017}} reports that 200 grams of a mixture of NM with PMMA as gelling agent and AlMg (45:55, mean particle size = 63 microns) as fuel, in a ratio of 67.2/2.8/30 by mass, has a peak overpressure of 120&amp;nbsp;kPa 2 m{{huh?|date=April 2017}}&lt;!-- is this kpa/m^2 or kpa^2/m or kpa^2*m? --&gt; from the (open air) blast site, a 1.65 TNT equivalency in peak pressure, and a 1.62 equivalency in shockwave impulse.

==Sensitizing of nitromethane==

It was the supposed explosive used in the film ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} However, the film grossly exaggerated the sensitivity of this explosive mixture. 

PLX was one of the explosives used to down [[Korean Air Flight 858]] along with [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]].

A '''powder mill''' was a [[mill (grinding)|mill]] where [[gunpowder]] is made&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Edward H.. "Powder-mill" ''Knight's new mechanical dictionary: a description of tools, instruments, machines, processes, and engineering: with indexical references to technical journals (1876-1880)''. vol. 2. Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1883. 1781. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[sulfur]], [[potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] and [[charcoal]]. Crude grinding and mixing operations like the [[Frankford Powder-Mill]] of [[Philadelphia]] were a [[cottage industry]] until the [[industrial revolution]] brought improved product quality through the following procedures:

==Milling steps==
* Charcoal was often manufactured nearby from locally available trees, but the heating retorts were typically separated from the other buildings to minimize fire danger. Trees with low value as sources of lumber were debarked, dried, and cut to uniform length to fit into iron retorts with [[cast iron]] doors. The retorts were carefully packed to leave as little air space as possible, and the retort doors were closed and sealed with clay to prevent entry of air as the retorts were heated by external fires. Volatile gas generated by the heating process was vented through a small flue at the top of each retort. After the external fires were extinguished, the retorts were allowed to cool before the doors were opened to remove the charcoal.&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitten |first=Maurice M. |authorlink = |title =The Gunpowder Mills of Gorham-Windham, Maine |publisher =Windham Historical Society |volume = |edition = |date =2012 |location =[[Windham, Maine]] |pages =15-26 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* High purity sulfur usually required little preparation other than grinding to a powder. Separate '''grinding mills''' reduced cool charcoal and sulfur to fine powders.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

* Crude saltpeter was dissolved in a pot of boiling water. After boiling, a small amount of floating glue might be added to the hot water to aid skimming off floating impurities. The hot solution was then carefully decanted to avoid suspending insoluble solid impurities settled to the bottom of the pot. The hot decanted liquid was distributed into shallow wooden vats where [[evaporative cooling]] would remove excess water. Purified potassium nitrate recrystallized while the cooling solution was gently agitated with broad hoes to prevent formation of large crystals.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

* Powdered sulfur and charcoal were combined in appropriate ratios with moist saltpeter crystals, and the moist paste was mixed and compacted by kneading beneath heavy rotating wheels in a '''press mill'''.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, John. ''A memoir on gunpowder: in which are discussed, the principles both of its manufacture and proof''.. Madras: Printed at the Church Mission Press, 1829. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The compressed cake was transferred to a '''corning mill''' or '''kernelling mill''' to be cut into pieces of approximately correct size by [[bronze]]- or [[zinc]]-toothed wheels.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

* Kernelling mill products were sorted by size using leather [[sieve]]s.  Oversize product was returned to the kernelling mill, while undersize product was returned to the press mill.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

* Sorted kernels of desired size were dried and mixed with [[graphite]] to be tumbled in '''glazing mill''' barrels. Graphite coating reduced the tendency of grains to stick together in storage.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

* Glazed product was typically packaged in wooden kegs. Filled kegs were transported away from the mill as soon as possible to a [[Gunpowder magazine|powder magazine]] for wholesale distribution. The potential for destructive energy release from powder magazine accidents required the magazines to be distant from both the powder mill and other places of business or habitation.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

==Explosions==
Gunpowder is very easily ignited by [[static electricity]] or [[lightning strike]]s, and most powder mills experienced occasional accidental [[explosion]]s. Powder mill explosions typically destroyed an entire building and killed those working in the vicinity of the building. Explosions might throw flaming debris which could ignite other buildings. Successful mills were typically built as an arrangement of separate buildings to minimize the loss from any single building explosion. Buildings were separated by enough distance to minimize the risk of being damaged by an explosion in an adjacent building. Buildings were usually built of stone with one weak wooden wall and roof to direct the force and debris from an accidental explosion toward a river or an open field.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

==Power supply==
Powder mills were originally powered by [[windmill]]s, [[water mill]]s or [[horse mill]]s. Despite later availability of [[steam engine]]s, the older power sources did not require a fire to generate steam, and avoided the possibility of sparks which might ignite the gunpowder. Some 20th-century powder mills used electric power. Before the availability of safe electrical power, some of the most successful mills were built along rivers where water could be distributed through a [[power canal]] to individual buildings and intermediate products could be floated from one building to the next. The power canal offered a supply of firefighting water, and the adjacent river was a relatively safe direction to focus explosion debris. Where water transport was impractical, intermediate products were often transported in wagons pulled by [[draft animal]]s. The wagons were often built entirely of wood held together with wooden pegs, and draft animals were usually unshod to avoid sparks from steel shoes or nails.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

==America==
The 1810 census reported 208 powder mills in the United States.&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt; In 1802, the [[DuPont]] family started their industrial enterprises in the [[United States]] by building the [[Eleutherian Mills]] on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] in [[Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;Rideal, Charles Frederick, and Freeman Morris. ''A century of success: the history of a great industry ; what it has accomplished ; a record of progress and sustained work : the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Powder Co., from its foundation to the present time''. New York, N.Y.: Business America, 19111912. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Four mills were manufacturing 69 percent of United States gunpowder when gunpowder production peaked during the [[American Civil War]]. They were the DuPont mill, the [[Hazard Powder Company]] of [[Hazardville, Connecticut]], the [[Oriental Powder Company]] of [[Windham, Maine]], and the Laflin Powder Company of [[Orange Mill Historic District|Newburgh, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Mark R. ''The business of civil war: military mobilization and the state, 1861-1865'' (2006) JHU Press p.118&lt;/ref&gt; The Laflin company merged into the [[Laflin &amp; Rand Powder Company]] after the war, and with the other three large mills formed the United States Gunpowder Trade Association in 1872 including the [[American Powder Mills]] of [[Maynard, Massachusetts]], the [[Austin Powder Company]] of [[Glenwillow, Ohio]], and the [[Miami Powder Company]] of [[Goes Station, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink = |title =Congressional Serial Set |publisher =United States Government Printing Office |volume = |edition = |date =1912 |location = |page =350 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most smaller mills were unable to compete with this trade association, popularly known as the [[Trust (monopoly)|powder trust]]; although regionally important mills including the [[California Powder Works]] of [[Santa Cruz, California]], the [[Western Cartridge Company|Equitable Powder Company]] of [[East Alton, Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://22box-id.com/Dunn/Western.pdf |title=.22 Boxes of the U.S.A. |last=Dunn |first=Tony |website= |publisher=Roger E.

As smokeless powder and [[high explosive]]s replaced gunpowder for most purposes, DuPont became the major manufacturer of United States gunpowder until discontinuing production in 1971. Subsequent production for use in pyrotechnics and antique firearms has been undertaken by smaller firms whose operations are often ended by the persistent hazard of accidental explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namlhunt.com/mlpowders8-1.html |title=Black Powder in America |last=Bridges |first=Toby |website= |publisher=North American Muzzleloader Hunting |accessdate=15 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A PLMN is identified by the [[Mobile Country Code]] (MCC) and the [[Mobile Network Code]] (MNC). Each operator providing mobile services has its own PLMN. PLMNs interconnect with other PLMNs and [[Public switched telephone network]]s (PSTN) for [[Telephone|telephone communications]] or with [[internet service provider]]s for [[data]] and [[internet]] access of which links are defined as interconnect links between providers. These links mostly incorporate [[Synchronous Digital Hierarchy|SDH]] digital transmission networks via fiber optic on land and digital microwave links.

Access to PLMN services is achieved by means of an ''[[air interface]]'' involving [[radio]] communications between [[mobile phone]]s or other [[wireless]] enabled user equipment and land-based [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] or [[base station|radio base stations]] or even fiber optic distributed SDH network

The PSTN is the world's collection of interconnected voice-oriented public telephone networks, in much the same way that the Internet is the concatenation of the world's public IP-based [[packet-switched network]]s.  It is both commercially- and government-owned.  This aggregation of [[Circuit switching|circuit-switching]] telephone networks has evolved greatly from the days of [[Alexander Graham Bell]], and in the late 20th century became almost [[Signaling System 7|entirely digital]] in nature &amp;mdash; except for the final link from the [[telephone exchange|central (local) telephone office]] to the user (the [[local loop]]).  It also extends into mobile as well as fixed telephones.

The PSTN also furnishes much of the Internet's long-distance infrastructure and, for the majority of users, the [[access network]] as well. Because [[Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs) pay the long-distance carriers for access to their infrastructure, and share the circuits among many users through [[packet switching]], the end Internet user avoids having to pay usage tolls to anyone other than their ISP.

The PSTN is largely governed by technical standards created by the [[ITU-T]], and uses E.163/E.164 addresses (usually called [[telephone number]]s) for addressing.  A number of large private telephone networks are not connected to the PSTN, and are used for military purposes (such as the [[Defense Switched Network]]). There are also private networks run by large companies that are linked to the PSTN, but only through controlled gateways such as [[private branch exchange]]s..**

==Specifications==
A [[GSM]] PLMN may be described by a limited set of access interfaces and a limited set of GSM PLMN connection types to support the telecommunication services described in the GSM 02-series of specifications.

PLMN is a network that is established and operated by an administration or by a recognized operating agency (ROA) for the specific purpose of providing land mobile telecommunications services to the public. A PLMN may be considered as an extension of a fixed network, e.g., the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or as an integral part of the PSTN. This is just one view-point on PLMN. PLMN mostly refers to the whole system of [[networking hardware]] and [[software]] that enables wireless communication, irrespective of the service area or service provider (cf. [[Internet backbone]]). Sometimes a separate PLMN is defined for each country or for each service provider. This systematic ambiguity (of terminological scope) also affects the "PSTN" term. Sometimes it refers to the whole circuit-switched system, while other times it is specific to each country.

PLMN is not a term specific to GSM. In fact, GSM can be treated as an example of a PLMN system. These days (as of January, 2006) many discussions are going on to form the structure of UMTS PLMN for the third-generation systems. Access to PLMN services is achieved by means of an air interface involving radio communications between mobile phones or other wireless-enabled user equipment and land-based radio transmitters or radio base stations. PLMNs interconnect with other PLMNs and PSTNs for telephone communications or with Internet service providers for data and internet access.

A public land mobile network may be defined as a number of mobile services switching center areas within a common numbering plan and a common routing plan. With respect to their functions, the PLMNs may be regarded as independent communications entities, even though different PLMNs may be interconnected through the PSTN/ISDN for the forwarding of calls or network information. The MSCs of a PLMN can be interconnected similarly to allow interaction. A PLMN may have several interfaces with the fixed network (e.g., one for each MSC). Inter-working between two PLMNs may be performed via an international switching center. The PLMN is connected via an NCP to the PSTN/ISDN. If there are two mobile service suppliers in the same country, they can be connected through the same PSTN/ISDN.

===Objectives of a GSM PLMN===
The general objective of a PLMN is to facilitate wireless communication and to interlink the wireless network with the fixed wired network. The PLMN was specified by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) following up with their GSM specification. Even as times changed, the GSM PLMN objectives conceptually remained the same.

*To give access to the GSM network for a mobile subscriber in a country that operates the GSM system.
*To provide facilities for automatic roaming, locating and updating of mobile subscribers.
*To provide the subscriber a wide range of services and facilities, both voice and non voice, that are compatible with those offered by existing networks like PSTN and ISDN.

==Services==
*Bearer Services : These services give the subscriber the capacity required to transmit appropriate signals between certain access points (user-network interfaces).
*Tele Services : Provide subscriber with necessary capabilities including terminal equipment function to communicate with other subscribers.
*Supplementary Services : Modify or supplement basic telecommunication services and are offered together or in association with basic communication services.

==Architecture==
{{Tone|date=March 2014}}
GSM architecture is basically the PLMN architecture itself as the subject is GSM PLMN. Various interfaces between the GSM subsystems are to be considered, along with the signaling system and the various components (both hardware and software).

==Subsystems==
The GSM PLMN is divided into signaling network and mobile network. Each of these has various subsystems, which are grouped under three major systems: the [[Network and Switching Subsystem]] (NSS), the [[Base Station Subsystem]] (BSS), and the [[operation and support system]] (OSS).

===Operation and Support System (OSS)===
The [[operations and maintenance center]] (OMC) is connected to all equipment in the switching system and to the BSC. The implementation of OMC is called the operation and support system (OSS). The OSS is the functional entity from which the network operator monitors and controls the system. The purpose of OSS is to offer the customer cost-effective support for centralized, regional, and local operational and maintenance activities that are required for a GSM network. An important function of OSS is to provide a network overview and support the maintenance activities of different operation and maintenance organizations. End.

===Additional functional elements===
Other functional elements shown are as follows:
*Message center (MXE)&amp;mdash;The MXE is a node that provides integrated voice, fax, and data messaging. Specifically, the MXE handles short message service, cell broadcast, voice mail, fax mail, email, and notification.
*Mobile Service Node (MSN)&amp;mdash;The MSN is the node that handles the mobile intelligent network (IN) services.
*Gateway Mobile services Switching Center (GMSC)&amp;mdash;A gateway is a node used to interconnect two networks. The gateway is often implemented in an MSC. The MSC is then referred to as the GMSC.
*GSM Inter-Working Unit (GIWU)&amp;mdash;The GIWU consists of both hardware and software that provides an interface to various networks for data communications. Through the GIWU, users can alternate between speech and data during the same call. The GIWU hardware equipment is physically located at the MSC/VLR.

There are three viewpoints of interoperability between PLMN and PSTN:

#PLMN can be treated as an integral part of the PSTN, extending the services offered by the PSTN to wireless networks.
#PSTN can be treated as an integral part of PLMN, through which it facilitates call routing.
#PLMN and PSTN can be treated as two separate systems, which depend on each other or connect to each other for the purpose of call routing.

==Conclusion==
A PLMN is essential for the effective working of any wireless network, just like the need for PSTN in wireline networks. PLMN facilitates interoperation with its own subsystems in order to perform operation of the GSM (3G), LTE (4G) and 5G systems and any wired network in general.

'''Scooba''' was a [[floor-scrubbing robot]] made by [[iRobot]].  It was released in limited numbers in December 2005 for the Christmas season, with full production starting in early 2006. The company introduced a lower-priced version, the Scooba 5800, in the second half of 2006. It introduced a new Scooba 450 at CES 2014 in January 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 2016, the Scooba line of floor-scrubbers were phased out in favor of the [[Braava]] line of floor-mopping robots.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/irobot-hopes-to-clean-up-in-floor-mopping-business/|title=IRobot Hopes To Clean Up In Floor-Mopping Business|website=Investors Business Daily|last1=Seitz|first1=Patrick|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The Scooba used either a special non-[[bleach]] cleaning solution named "Scooba juice" (made by the [[Clorox]] Company) formulated to clean the floors while discouraging [[rust]] or wheel slippage, or the newer Scooba Natural Enzyme cleaning solution. The robot prepared the floor by vacuuming loose debris, squirting clean solution, scrubbed the floor, and then sucked up the dirty solution leaving a nearly dry floor behind. The robot was safe to use on sealed hardwood floors and most other hard household surfaces, but could not be used on rugs. Scooba avoided cleaning rugs and stairs, and could clean about {{convert|200|sqft|m2}} on a single tank-load of solution.

Some models of the Scooba included an iRobot Virtual Wall accessory, which projected a beam of [[infrared light]], setting a boundary which the robot would not cross.

The Scooba was the second major commercial product made by iRobot, which popularized vacuum robots with the [[Roomba]]. It was available in over 40 countries.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Systems==
The Scooba used approximately {{convert|2|USfloz|ml}} of cleaning solution per cycle, mixed with {{convert|32|USfloz|ml}} of water to fill the cleaning solution tank. The Scooba came with four packets of the new "Natural Enzyme" cleaning solution, enough for about four washes. Additional Clorox cleaning solution comes in five- and nine-packs of {{convert|32|USfloz|ml}} bottles, which provided enough solution for about 16 washings per bottle. [[Polysorbate 20]] and tetrapotassium [[EDTA]] were the primary ingredients. Some Scooba models could also use [[white vinegar]] or plain water in place of the proprietary solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/165/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xMzAxNDA2ODQwL3NpZC9WTzR2Qjhxaw%3D%3D&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recharge times were typically 3 hours.

==Models==
[[File:IRobot Scooba 230.jpg|thumb|iRobot Scooba 230 floor washing robot]]

===The original Scooba===
Scooba 5900 was the first Scooba, it could be used with the Scooba Cleaning Solution, or other suitably conductive{{Elucidate|date=March 2012}} solutions, but was discontinued in favor of the Scooba 5800 version (basic floor washing model) which could also use plain water in its cleaning tank. iRobot shed several of the 5900's premium features to produce the lower-priced 5800 model. There were no changes to the basic floor cleaning machinery.

The Scooba 5800 could clean about {{convert|250|sqft|m2}} per battery charge.

===Scooba 200 series===
Introduced in 2011, the Scooba 230 was a smaller model, less than half the diameter but taller than the previous Scooba models.  The reduced diameter allowed the robot to clean more areas in small bathrooms, kitchens, and other tight spaces. In order to reduce the size, the clean water and dirty water tanks were replaced with a pair of internal bladders, allowing the dirty water storage to expand as the clean water was used up.  Only Scooba cleaning solution and water are recommended as vinegar and the original cleaning solution will damage the bladder. The initial vacuuming stage present in other Scooba models was also removed, requiring users to sweep up or vacuum loose debris ahead of time.  The Scooba 230 could clean up to {{convert|150|sqft|m2}} in one charge.

===Scooba 300 series===
The Scooba 300 series replaced the original 5000 series robots. They were similar in design and size to the original Scooba and used Scooba cleaning solution, vinegar solution, or plain water.  The robots in this series were differentiated by the size of the area they could clean on a single charge, and the accessories supplied.
:Scooba 330 (basic US version) could clean {{convert|250|sqft|m2}} per battery charge.
:Scooba 350 (intermediate floor washing model, US version) could clean about {{convert|500|sqft|m2}} per battery charge.
:Scooba 380 (premium floor washing model, US version) could clean {{convert|850|sqft|m2}} per battery charge. It also included charging base, storage mat, and an extra Virtual Wall (for a total of two). 
:Scooba 385 (European version of US 380 model) doesn't include charging base, storage mat or extra Virtual Wall (only one included).
:Scooba 390 (Longer battery life, new color scheme).

===Scooba 450===
The fourth generation Scooba 450 was introduced at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|Consumer Electronics Show 2014]]. It could mop tile, wood, linoleum, and more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Zahnzinger |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/01/07/reviewed-ces-irobot-scooba/4361483/ |title=CES 2014: IRobot's Scooba cleans up CES |newspaper=[[USA Today|date=2014-01-07]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a three-cycle cleaning process. First, Scooba sweeps and pre-soaks the floor with cleaning solution, then it scrubs the floor and squeegees the dirty solution.

== Discontinuation ==
iRobot launched the Braava line of floor mopping robots in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.irobot.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=193096&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1849275|title=iRobot: News Release|website=investor.irobot.com|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which eventually replaced the Scooba brand by 2016.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Portal|Robotics}}

[[Image:Shale Shakers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical Shale Shakers on a drilling rig]]

'''Shale shakers''' are components of [[drilling]] equipment used in many industries, such as [[coal]] cleaning, [[mining]], oil and gas drilling.&lt;ref&gt;http://sorogo.com/products/vibrating-screen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.appshakerscreen.com|title=High quality shaker screens|publisher=Aipu shaker screen |date=Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the first phase of a [[solids control]] system on a [[drilling rig]], and are used to remove large solids ([[Drill cuttings|cuttings]]) from the [[drilling fluid]] ("mud").

Drilling fluids are integral to the drilling process and, among other functions, serve to lubricate and cool the drill bit as well as convey the drilled cuttings away from the bore hole. These fluids are a mixture of various chemicals in a water or oil based solution and can be very expensive to make. For both environmental reasons and to reduce the cost of drilling operations, drilling fluid losses are minimized by stripping them away from the drilled cuttings before the cuttings are disposed of. This is done using a multitude of specialized machines and tanks.

Shale shakers are the primary solids separation tool on a rig. After returning to the surface of the well the used drilling fluid flows directly to the shale shakers where it begins to be processed. Once processed by the shale shakers the drilling fluid is deposited into the mud tanks where other solid control equipment begin to remove the finer solids from it. The solids removed by the shale shaker are discharged out of the discharge port into a separate holding tank where they await further treatment or disposal.

Shale shakers are considered by most of the drilling industry to be the most important device in the solid control system as the performance of the successive equipment directly relates to the cleanliness of the treated drilling fluid.

[[Mudlogger]]s usually go out and check the shakers for rock samples that have circulated from bottom.  They separate the rock from the drilling fluid and take it into an onsite lab where they dry out the samples and label them according to depth.  They then look at the samples and analyze what kind of rock they have at a certain depth.  This helps determines what depth that type of rock was encountered.

==Structure==
Shale shakers consist of the following parts:

*'''Hopper''' - The Hopper, commonly called the "base" serves as both a platform for the shaker and collection pan for the fluid processed by the shaker screens, also known as "underflow". The hopper can be ordered according to the needs of the drilling fluid, aka "mud" system. It can come in different depths to accommodate larger quantities of drilling fluid as well as have different ports for returning the underflow to the mud system.

[[File:Oil well Shaker.JPG|thumb|Oil well Shaker]]

*'''Feeder'''- The Feeder is essentially a collection pan for the drilling fluid before it is processed by the shaker, it can come in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate the needs of the mud system. The most commonly used feeder is known as the weir feeder, the drilling fluid enters the feeder usually through a pipe welded to the outside wall near the bottom of the feeder tank, it fills the feeder to a predetermined point and like water flowing over a dam the mud (drilling fluid) spills over the weir and onto the screening area of the shaker. This method of feeding the shaker is most widely used due to its ability to evenly distribute the mud along the entire width of the shaker allowing for maximum use of the shaker's screening deck area.
:Some feeders can be equipped with a bypass valve at the bottom of the feeder which allows the drilling fluid to bypass the shaker basket and go directly into the hopper and back into the mud system without being processed by the shaker screens.

*'''Screen Basket'''- Also known as the screen "bed" it is the most important part of the machine, it is responsible for transferring the shaking intensity of the machine, measured in "G's", while keeping the "shaking" motion even throughout the entire basket. It must do all that while holding the screens securely in place, eliminating drilled solids bypass to the hopper and allowing for easy operation and maintenance of the machine. Different brands of shakers have different methods of fulfilling these demands by using specialized screen tensioning apparatus, rubber seals around the screens, basket reinforcement to limit flex, rubber Float Mounts rather than springs, rubber Deck seals and selective vibrator placement.

[[File:New Shale Shakers.JPG|thumb|New Shale Shakers]]
*'''Basket Angling Mechanism'''- The shaker basket must be capable of changing its angle to accommodate various flow rates of drilling fluids and to maximize the use of the shaker bed, this is where the angling mechanism plays an important part. The drilling fluid flowing over the shaker bed is designated into two categories: 
**''Pool:'' Which is the area of the screening deck that consists mostly of drilling fluid with drilled cuttings suspended within it. 
**''Beach:'' Is the area where the fluid has been mostly removed from the cuttings and they begin to look like a pile of solids.
:As a rule of thumb the Beach and pool are maintained at a ratio of 80% pool and 20% beach, this of course can change depending on the requirements of cutting dryness and flow rates.

:There are various angling mechanisms currently in use which vary from hydraulic to pneumatic and mechanical, they can be controlled from either one side of the shaker or must be adjusted individually per side. Mechanical angling mechanisms can be very dependable often requiring less maintenance but usually take more time to operate than their hydraulic or pneumatic counterparts whereas the hydraulic/pneumatic angling mechanisms are much faster to operate and require less a physical means of operation.

*'''Vibrator'''- This is the device which applies the vibratory force and motion type to the shaker bed. A vibrator is a specialized motor built for the purpose of vibrating, While containing an electric motor to provide the rotary motion it uses a set of eccentric weights to provide an omnidirectional force. To produce the proper Linear motion a second, counter rotating, vibrator is added in parallel to the first. This is what gives us the linear motion, "high G" shaking of the basket.

[[File:Mudloggers collecting samples out of the shakers.JPG|thumb|Mudloggers collecting samples out of the shakers]]

:Some shakers come with an optional third motor on the shaker bed, this motor is most often used to modify the elliptical motion of the basket making it more circular therefore "soften" the motion, but comes at a cost of decreased G's and slower conveyance of the cuttings. This motion is usually used for sticky solids.NOV Brandt VSM 300 shale shaker is the world’s first balanced elliptical motion shaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/shale-shaker.html|title=High quality shale shaker|publisher=Aipu solids control}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shaker screen panels==

A shaker screen consists of the following parts:
[[File:Oil Rig Shaker.JPG|thumb|Oil Rig Shaker]]

*'''Screen Frame''' - Much like a canvas for painting a screen has to be supported on a frame in order to do its job, this frame differs between manufacturers in both material and shape. Screen frames can be made from materials such as, square steel tubing, flat steel sheets, plastic type composites or they can just be supported on the ends with strips of steel (similar idea to a scroll). These frames consist of a rectangular shaped outer perimeter which is divided into small individual inner panels. These smaller panels differ in shape from manufacturer to manufacturer and have been known to come in shapes such as square, hexagonal, rectangular and even triangular.

:These differing panel shapes are used in an attempt to reduce the quantity of panels on each frame but still provide maximum rigidity and support for the mesh attached to them. The purpose of reducing these panels is to maximize usable screening area as the walls of each panel get in the way of the mesh and prevent it from being used, this is known as "blanking". The non-blanked screening area of a shaker screen is widely used as a selling feature, the more screen surface you have available to work the more efficient your shaker becomes and therefore can handle a higher quantity of fluid.

*'''Screen Mesh''' - Just like thread is woven together to create cloth, metal wire can be woven to create a metal cloth. Screen Mesh has evolved over many years of competitive screen manufacturing resulting in very thin yet strong cloth designed to maximize screen life and conductance as well as to provide a consistent cut point. To increase the conductance of a mesh screen you have to minimize the amount of material in the way, this is done by either reducing the wire diameter or weaving the cloth to produce rectangular openings. Rectangular openings increase the screens conductance while minimizing the effect on its cut point where as square openings provide a more consistent cut point but offer a lower conductance.

:To maximize screen life most manufacturers build their screens with multiple layers of mesh over a very sturdy backing cloth to further protect the cloth against solids loading and wear. The multiple layers of mesh act as a de-blinding mechanism pushing near sized particles, which may get stuck in the openings, out of the mesh reducing blinding issues and keeping the screen surface available for use.

*'''Binding Agent''' - The binding agent is the material used to bind the mesh to the screen frame, it is designed to maximize adhesion to both materials while being able to handle high heat, strong vibration, abrasive cuttings and corrosive drilling fluids.

:Plastic composite screens tend not to use adhesives but rather heat the mesh and melt it into the screen frame to form a bond.

*'''3D Screen Technology''' - One of the more recent advances in oilfield screen technology has brought us the "3D screen", this technology is an innovative method for increasing the screening area of a shale shaker without the need to build larger machines. When seen from the side these screens look like corrugated cardboard, having a flat bottom and wave like shapes on top. These waves are designed to increase the surface area of the screen panel by building up instead of out, thereby maximizing the surface area of the screen without the need to build larger shaker screens and in turn larger, heavier and more expensive shakers.

:There are many claims in regards to the reason for the improved performance of these 3D screens such as:
:*Increasing the screening area of each panel transfers the load across more surface area and therefore the wear tends to be decreased in comparison to other screens. 
:*The corrugated shape of the screens encourages solids to settle in the valleys of the screen, keeping the peaks of the screen available to process drilling fluid. 
:*The tapered valleys, while moving under high G's, apply a compression force on the solids similar to wringing out a cloth to draw out liquid.
:*Increasing the surface area of the shaker allows the use of finer screens earlier in the drilling process while maintaining acceptable flow rates and penetration rate. Effectively removing harmful drilled solids before they can begin to wear out the solids control equipment.

Although the performance of these screens is quite impressive the only way to truly gauge the performance of any screen is to try it out and collect comparative data of your own.

==Causes of screen failure==
The causes of premature screen failure are:

The [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) Screen Designation is the customary identification for screen panels. This includes:
* '''API Number''': the sieve equivalent as per API RP 13C
* '''Conductance''': the ease with which a liquid can flow through the screen, with larger values representing higher volume handling
* '''Microns''': a unit of length equal to one-thousandth of a millimeter
* '''Non-blanked area''': an evaluation of the surface area available for liquid transmission through the screen

'''Speedpass''' is a [[keychain]] [[RFID]] device introduced in 1997 by [[Mobil]] Oil Corp. (which merged with [[Exxon]] to become [[ExxonMobil]] in 1999) for [[electronic payment]].  It was originally developed by [[Verifone]].  As of 2004, more than seven million people possess Speedpass tags, which can be used at approximately 10,000 [[Exxon]], [[Mobil]] and [[Esso]] [[filling station|gas station]]s worldwide.  At one point, Speedpass was deployed experimentally in [[fast-food restaurant]]s and [[supermarket]]s in select markets.  [[McDonald's]] alone deployed Speedpass in over 400 [[Chicago area]] restaurants.  The test was deemed a failure and McDonald's removed the scanners from all their restaurants in mid-2004.  Additionally, the New England grocery chain [[Stop &amp; Shop]] tested Speedpass at their Boston area stores; the units were removed in early 2005.   Speedpass has also been previously available through a Speedpass Car Tag and a Speedpass-enabled [[Timex Group|Timex]] watch.

Speedpass was one of the first widely deployed consumer RFID payment systems of its kind, debuting nationwide in 1997 far ahead of today's [[VISA (credit card)|VISA]] and [[MasterCard]] RFID trials, and the RFID/[[Electronic Product Code|EPC]] (Electronic Product Code) privacy controversy.

==Technology behind the Mobil Speedpass==
The ExxonMobil Speedpass is based on the [[Texas Instruments]] TIRIS RFID platform.  It was originally designed by [[Verifone]] in two configurations; one intended for installation inside the fuel dispensing "pump", and a convenience store model known as the Verifone RF250 (which was a redesign of the iSC250 reader for [[smart cards]]).

==Security of the Mobil Speedpass==
[[Image:Speedpassinternals.jpg|150px|left]]
The ExxonMobil Speedpass uses a cryptographically-enabled tag with a [[Digital Signature Transponder]] (DST) which incorporates a weak, proprietary [[encryption]] scheme to perform a [[challenge-response]] protocol. On January 29, 2005, [[RSA Security]] and a group of students from [[Johns Hopkins University]] broke the proprietary encryption algorithm used by the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass. [http://www.rfidanalysis.org] They were able to successfully copy a Speedpass and use the copied RFID tag to purchase gas.

In an attempt to prevent fraud, Speedpass users are now required to enter their [[zip code]] into scanners at some gas stations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedpass.com/forms/frmDynPage.aspx?pPg=ZipVerification.htm&amp;pgType=N|title=Speedpass|website=Speedpass.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project history==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
During the 1998 development of the RF250 convenience store reader, some prototype units were shipped from Verifone in [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]], California, to a Verifone office in Florida.  The units did not arrive on time and were thought to have been lost in transit.  They were later found, and despite each unit having a Verifone logo and being encased in boxes showing the Verifone logo; the shipping company had nothing in their lost goods database showing that name.  Rather, the units turned up via a query for "flying red horse", apparently since the units displayed a small [[Mobil]] logo—and the Mobil logo was and is a red [[Pegasus]].  The internal codename for the project was thus changed to "Flying Red Horse" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w6dtw.blogspot.com/2014/05/flying-red-horse.html|title=W6DTW : Flying Red Horse|date=7 May 2014|website=W6dtw.blogspot.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=October 2017}}

'''Stilts''' are poles, posts or [[column|pillars]] used to allow a structure or building to stand at a distance above the ground. In flood plains, and on beaches or unstable ground, buildings are often constructed on stilts to protect them from damage by water, waves or shifting soil or sand.

== Stilt house ==
{{main|Stilt house}}
Stilts are common architectural element in tropical architecture, especially in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South America]].  The length of stilts may vary widely; stilts of traditional houses can be measured half meter to 5 or 6 meters.  In Indonesia, the construction of the house symbolizes the division of the macrocosm into three regions: the upper world; the seat of deities and ancestors, the middle world; the realm of human, and lower world; the realm of demon and malevolent spirit. The typical way of buildings in Southeast Asia is to build on stilts, an architectural form usually combined with a saddle roof.&lt;ref name="Traditional Houses"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artasia.www2.50megs.com/Indonesia/houses.htm |title=Traditional Houses |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Art Asia |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stilts can be found in [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]] such as [[Dayak people|Dayak]] [[Long house#Borneo longhouse|long house]]s,&lt;ref name="Traditional Houses"/&gt; [[Toraja]]n [[Tongkonan]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] [[Rumah Gadang]], and [[Malay houses]]. The construction is known locally as ''Rumah Panggung'' (lit: "stage house") houses built on stilts. This was to avoid wild animals and floods, to deter thieves, and for added ventilation. In Sumatra, traditionally stilted houses are designed in order to avoid dangerous wild animals, such as snakes and tigers. While in areas located close to big rivers of Sumatra and Borneo, the stilts help to elevated house above flood surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}[[Image:Windtunnel2.JPG|thumb|450px|Floor plan of Eiffel's 1912 laboratory at Auteuil, Paris, with two open-return wind tunnels]]
==Subsonic tunnel==
Low-speed wind tunnels are used for operations at very low [[Mach number]], with speeds in the test section up to 480 km/h (~ 134 [[Metre per second|m/s]], [[Mach number|M]] = 0.4) (Barlow, Rae, Pope; 1999). They may be of open-return type (also known as the [[Gustave Eiffel|Eiffel]] type, [[:Image:Windtunnel1-en.svg|see figure]]), or closed-return flow (also known as the [[Prandtl]] type, [[:Image:Windtunnel3-en.svg|see figure]]) with air moved by a propulsion system usually consisting of large axial fans that increase the dynamic pressure to overcome the [[viscosity|viscous]] losses. 

===Open wind tunnel===

[[Image:Windtunnel1-en.svg|450px|thumb|Schematic of an open wind tunnel with a closed test section]]

The working principle is based on the continuity and [[Bernoulli's equation]]:

The continuity equation is given by:

&lt;math&gt;A V = constant \Rightarrow \frac{dA}{A}=-\frac{dV}{V} &lt;/math&gt; 

The Bernoulli equation states:-

&lt;math&gt;P_{total}=P_{static} + P_{dynamic} = P_s + \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2&lt;/math&gt;

Putting Bernoulli into the continuity equation gives:

&lt;math&gt;V_m^2=2 \frac{C^2}{C^2-1} \frac{P_{settl}-p_m}{\rho} \approx 2 \frac{\Delta p}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

The contraction ratio of a windtunnel can now be calculated by:
&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{A_{settl}}{A_m}&lt;/math&gt;

===Closed wind tunnel===

[[Image:Windtunnel3-en.svg|450px|thumb|Schematic of a closed (return-flow) wind tunnel]]

In a return-flow wind tunnel the return duct must be properly designed to reduce the pressure losses and to ensure smooth flow in the test section.
The compressible flow regime:
Again with the continuity law, but now for isentropic flow gives:

&lt;math&gt;- \frac{d \rho}{\rho} = -\frac{1}{a^2} \frac{dp}{\rho} = -\frac{1}{a^2} \frac{-\rho V d V}{\rho} = \frac{V}{a^2}d V&lt;/math&gt;

The 1-D area-velocity is known as:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d A}{A} = (M^2 - 1) \frac{d V}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The minimal area A where M=1, also known as the ''sonic throat'' area is than given for a perfect gas:

&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{A}{A_{throat}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{M^2} \left( \frac{2}{\gamma +1} \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M^2 \right) \right)^{\frac{\gamma +1}{\gamma-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Transonic tunnel==

High subsonic wind tunnels (0.4 &lt; M &lt; 0.75) and transonic wind tunnels (0.75 &lt; M &lt; 1.2) are designed on the same principles as the subsonic wind tunnels. The highest speed is reached in the test section. The Mach number is approximately 1 with combined subsonic and supersonic flow regions. Testing at transonic speeds presents additional problems, mainly due to the reflection of the shock waves from the walls of the test section (see figure below or enlarge the thumb picture at the right). Therefore, perforated or slotted walls are required to reduce shock reflection from the walls. Since important viscous or inviscid interactions occur (such as shock waves or boundary layer interaction) both Mach and Reynolds number are important and must be properly simulated.
Large-scale facilities and/or pressurized or cryogenic wind tunnels are used.

[[Image:Tunnelreflection-en.svg|500px|Experimental rhombus variation with the mach number]]

== de Laval nozzle ==
{{main article|de Laval nozzle}}

With a sonic throat, the flow can be accelerated or slowed down. This follows from the 1D area–velocity equation. If an acceleration to supersonic flow is required, a convergent-divergent [[nozzle]] is required.
Otherwise:
*Subsonic (M &lt; 1) then &lt;math&gt;\frac{d A}{d x}&lt; 0\Rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; converging
*Sonic throat (M = 1) where &lt;math&gt;\frac{d A}{d x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
*Supersonic (M &gt;1 ) then &lt;math&gt;\frac{d A}{d x}&gt;0 \Rightarrow &lt;/math&gt; diverging

Conclusion: The Mach number is controlled by the expansion ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{A_{throat}}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''sundial''' is a device that tells the [[time of day]] when there is sunlight by the apparent [[position of the Sun]] in the [[sky]]. In the narrowest sense of the word, it consists of a flat plate (the ''dial'') and a ''[[gnomon]]'', which casts a [[shadow]] onto the dial. As the [[Sun]] appears to [[diurnal motion|move]] across the sky, the shadow aligns with different ''hour-lines'', which are marked on the dial to indicate the time of day. The ''style'' is the time-telling edge of the gnomon, though a single point or ''nodus'' may be used. The gnomon casts a broad shadow; the shadow of the style shows the time. The gnomon may be a rod, wire, or elaborately decorated metal casting. The style must be parallel to the axis of the [[Earth's rotation]] for the sundial to be accurate throughout the year. The style's angle from horizontal is equal to the sundial's geographical [[latitude]].

In a broader sense, a sundial is any device that uses the Sun's [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] or [[azimuth]] (or both) to show the time. In addition to their time-telling function, sundials are valued as decorative objects, literary metaphors, and objects of mathematical study.

It is common for inexpensive, mass-produced decorative sundials to have incorrectly aligned gnomons and hour-lines, which cannot be adjusted to tell correct time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Tony |title=How do sundials work |url=http://www.sundialsoc.org.uk/HDSW.php |publisher=British Sundial society |accessdate=21 September 2013 |quote=This ugly plastic ‘non-dial’ does nothing at all except display the ‘designer’s ignorance and persuade the general public that ‘real’ sundials don’t work. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802033857/http://www.sundialsoc.org.uk/HDSW.php |archivedate=August 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Introduction ==

There are several different types of sundials. Some sundials use a shadow or the edge of a shadow while others use a line or spot of light to indicate the time.

The shadow-casting object, known as a ''gnomon'', may be a long thin rod or other object with a sharp tip or a straight edge. Sundials employ many types of gnomon. The gnomon may be fixed or moved according to the season. It may be oriented vertically, horizontally, aligned with the Earth's axis, or oriented in an altogether different direction determined by mathematics.

Given that sundials use light to indicate time, a line of light may be formed by allowing the sun's rays through a thin slit or focusing them through a [[cylindrical lens]]. A spot of light may be formed by allowing the sun's rays to pass through a small hole or by reflecting them from a small circular mirror.

Sundials also may use many types of surfaces to receive the light or shadow. [[Plane (mathematics)|Planes]] are the most common surface, but partial [[sphere]]s, [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[cone (geometry)|cones]] and other shapes have been used for greater accuracy or beauty.

Sundials differ in their portability and their need for orientation. The installation of many dials requires knowing the local [[latitude]], the precise vertical direction (e.g., by a level or plumb-bob), and the direction to [[true North]]. Portable dials are self-aligning: for example, it may have two dials that operate on different principles, such as a horizontal and [[Analemmatic sundial|analemmatic]] dial, mounted together on one plate.  In these designs, their times agree only when the plate is aligned properly.

Sundials may indicate the [[solar time|local solar time]] only. To obtain the national clock time, three corrections are required:
# the orbit of the Earth is not perfectly circular and its rotational axis is not perpendicular to its orbit.  The sundial's indicated solar time thus varies from clock time by small amounts that change throughout the year. This correction&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; which may be as great as 15 minutes &amp;ndash; is described by the [[equation of time]]. A sophisticated sundial, with a curved style or hour lines, may incorporate this correction. The more usual simpler sundials sometimes have a small plaque that gives the offsets at various times of the year.
# the solar time must be corrected for the [[longitude]] of the sundial relative to the longitude of the official time zone. For example, a sundial located ''west'' of [[Greenwich]], England but within the same time-zone, shows an ''earlier'' time than the official time. For example, it will show "noon" before the official noon.  This correction can easily be made by rotating the hour-lines by a constant angle equal to the difference in longitudes, which makes this is a commonly possible design option.
# to adjust for [[daylight saving time]], if applicable, the solar time must additionally be shifted for the official difference (usually one hour). This is also a correction that can be done on the dial, i.e. by numbering the hour-lines with two sets of numbers, or even by swapping the numbering in some designs. More often this is simply ignored, or mentioned on the plaque with the other corrections, if there is one.

==Apparent motion of the Sun==
[[File:Equatorial sundial topview.gif|thumb|upright|Top view of an equatorial sundial. The hour lines are spaced equally about the circle, and the shadow of the gnomon (a thin cylindrical rod) rotates uniformly. The height of the gnomon is {{frac|5|12}} the outer radius of the dial. This animation depicts the motion of the shadow from 3 a.m. to 9 p.m. (not accounting for Daylight Saving Time) on or around Solstice, when the sun is at its highest declination (roughly 23.5°). Sunrise and sunset occur at 3am and 9pm, respectively, on that day at geographical latitudes near 57.05°, roughly the latitude of [[Aberdeen, Scotland]] or [[Sitka, Alaska]].]]The principles of sundials are understood most easily from the [[Sun]]'s apparent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAFEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=The+principles+of+sundials+are+understood+most+easily+from+the+Sun's+apparent+motion.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiooSIqOjUAhVW0mMKHdhACFIQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20principles%20of%20sundials%20are%20understood%20most%20easily%20from%20the%20Sun's%20apparent%20motion.&amp;f=false|title=Using Network and Mobile Technology to Bridge Formal and Informal Learning|last=Trentin|first=Guglielmo|last2=Repetto|first2=Manuela|date=2013-02-08|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9781780633626|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth rotates on its axis, and revolves in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. An excellent approximation assumes that the Sun revolves around a stationary Earth on the [[celestial sphere]], which rotates every 24 hours about its celestial axis.  The celestial axis is the line connecting the [[celestial pole]]s. Since the celestial axis is aligned with the axis about which the Earth rotates, the angle of the axis with the local horizontal is the local geographical [[latitude]].

Unlike the [[fixed stars]], the Sun changes its position on the celestial sphere, being - on north hemisphere - at a positive [[declination]] in spring and summer, and at a negative declination in autumn and winter, and having exactly zero declination (i.e., being on the [[celestial equator]]) at the [[equinox]]es. The Sun's [[celestial longitude]] also varies, changing by one complete revolution per year. The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is called the [[ecliptic]].  The ecliptic passes through the twelve constellations of the [[zodiac]] in the course of a year.

[[File:Sundial, Singapore Botanic Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Sundial in [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]]. The fact that [[Singapore]] is located almost at the [[equator]] is reflected in its design.]]

This model of the Sun's motion helps to understand sundials. If the shadow-casting gnomon is aligned with the [[celestial pole]]s, its shadow will revolve at a constant rate, and this rotation will not change with the seasons. This is the most common design.  In such cases, the same hour lines may be used throughout the year. The hour-lines will be spaced uniformly if the surface receiving the shadow is either perpendicular (as in the equatorial sundial) or circular about the gnomon (as in the [[armillary sphere]]).

In other cases, the hour-lines are not spaced evenly, even though the shadow rotates uniformly. If the gnomon is ''not'' aligned with the celestial poles, even its shadow will not rotate uniformly, and the hour lines must be corrected accordingly. The rays of light that graze the tip of a gnomon, or which pass through a small hole, or reflect from a small mirror, trace out a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] aligned with the celestial poles. The corresponding light-spot or shadow-tip, if it falls onto a flat surface, will trace out a [[conic section]], such as a [[hyperbola]], [[ellipse]] or (at the North or South Poles) a [[circle]].

This conic section is the intersection of the cone of light rays with the flat surface. This cone and its conic section change with the seasons, as the Sun's declination changes; hence, sundials that follow the motion of such light-spots or shadow-tips often have different hour-lines for different times of the year.  This is seen in shepherd's dials, sundial rings, and vertical gnomons such as obelisks. Alternatively, sundials may change the angle or position (or both) of the gnomon relative to the hour lines, as in the analemmatic dial or the Lambert dial.

==History==
{{details|History of sundials}}
[[File:Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumb|World's oldest sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC)]]
The earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are shadow clocks (1500 [[Anno Domini|BC]] or [[Common Era|BCE]]) from ancient [[Egyptian astronomy]] and [[Babylonian astronomy]].  Presumably, humans were telling time from shadow-lengths at an even earlier date, but this is hard to verify.  In roughly 700 BC, the [[Old Testament]] describes a sundial — the "dial of Ahaz" mentioned in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|38:8|NKJ}} and {{bibleverse|2 Kings|20:11|NKJ}}. The Roman writer Vitruvius lists dials and shadow clocks known at that time.  A [[canonical sundial]] is one that indicates the canonical hours of liturgical acts. Such sundials were used from the 7th to the 14th centuries by the members of religious communities.  Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Padovani]] published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. [[Giuseppe Biancani]]'s ''Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria'' (ca. 1620) discusses how to make a perfect sundial. They have been commonly used since the 16th century.

==Terminology==
[[File:London dial.svg|thumb|left|A [[London dial|London type horizontal dial]]. The western edge of the gnomon is used as the style before noon, the eastern edge after that time. The changeover causes a discontinuity, the noon gap, in the time scale.]]
In general, sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow or throwing light onto a surface known as a ''dial face'' or ''dial plate''.  Although usually a flat plane, the dial face may also be the inner or outer surface of a sphere, cylinder, cone, helix, and various other shapes.

The time is indicated where a shadow or light falls on the dial face, which is usually inscribed with hour lines.  Although usually straight, these hour lines may also be curved, depending on the design of the sundial (see below).  In some designs, it is possible to determine the date of the year, or it may be required to know the date to find the correct time.  In such cases, there may be multiple sets of hour lines for different months, or there may be mechanisms for setting/calculating the month.  In addition to the hour lines, the dial face may offer other data—such as the horizon, the equator and the tropics—which are referred to collectively as the dial furniture.

The entire object that casts a shadow or light onto the dial face is known as the sundial's ''gnomon''.&lt;ref name="B.S.S."/&gt;  However, it is usually only an edge of the gnomon (or another linear feature) that casts the shadow used to determine the time; this linear feature is known as the sundial's ''style''.  The style is usually aligned parallel to the axis of the celestial sphere, and therefore is aligned with the local geographical meridian.  In some sundial designs, only a point-like feature, such as the tip of the style, is used to determine the time and date; this point-like feature is known as the sundial's ''nodus''.&lt;ref name="B.S.S."&gt;{{cite web

The point where the style intersects the dial plate is called the ''gnomon root''.}}
Some sundials use both a style and a nodus to determine the time and date.

The gnomon is usually fixed relative to the dial face, but not always; in some designs such as the analemmatic sundial, the style is moved according to the month. If the style is fixed, the line on the dial plate perpendicularly beneath the style is called the ''substyle'',&lt;ref name="B.S.S."/&gt; meaning "below the style".  The angle the style makes with the plane of the dial plate is called the substyle height, an unusual use of the word ''height'' to mean an ''angle''. On many wall dials, the substyle is not the same as the noon line (see below). The angle on the dial plate between the noon line and the substyle is called the ''substyle distance'', an unusual use of the word ''distance'' to mean an ''angle''.

By tradition, many sundials have a [[motto]].  The motto is usually in the form of an epigram: sometimes sombre reflections on the passing of time and the brevity of life, but equally often humorous witticisms of the dial maker.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=126–129}}{{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp=124–125}}

A dial is said to be ''equiangular'' if its hour-lines are straight and spaced equally.  Most equiangular sundials have a fixed gnomon style aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, as well as a shadow-receiving surface that is symmetrical about that axis; examples include the equatorial dial, the equatorial bow, the armillary sphere, the cylindrical dial and the conical dial.  However, other designs are equiangular, such as the Lambert dial, a version of the analemmatic dial with a moveable style.

==Sundials in the Southern Hemisphere==

Sundials which are designed to be used with their plates horizontal in one hemisphere can be used with their plates vertical at the complementary latitude in the other hemisphere. For example, the illustrated sundial in [[Perth]], [[Australia]], which is at latitude 32 degrees South, would function properly if it were mounted on a south-facing vertical wall at latitude 58 (i.e. 90&amp;ndash;32) degrees North, which is slightly further North than [[Perth, Scotland]]. The surface of the wall in Scotland would be parallel with the horizontal ground in Australia (ignoring the difference of longitude), so the sundial would work identically on both surfaces. Correspondingly, the hour marks, which run counterclockwise on a horizontal sundial in the southern hemisphere, also do so on a vertical sundial in the northern hemisphere. (See the first two illustrations at the top of this article.) On horizontal northern-hemisphere sundials, and on vertical southern-hemisphere ones, the hour marks run clockwise.

==Adjustments to calculate clock time from a sundial reading==
The most common reason for a sundial to differ greatly from clock time is that the sundial has not been oriented correctly or its hour lines have not been drawn correctly.  For example, most commercial sundials are designed as ''horizontal sundials'' as described above.  To be accurate, such a sundial must have been designed for the local geographical latitude and its style must be parallel to the Earth's rotational axis; the style must be aligned with [[true North]] and its ''height'' (its angle with the horizontal) must equal the local latitude.  To adjust the style height, the sundial can often be tilted slightly "up" or "down" while maintaining the style's north-south alignment.{{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 48–50}}

===Summer (daylight saving) time correction===
Some areas of the world practice [[daylight saving time]], which changes the official time, usually by one hour.  This shift must be added to the sundial's time to make it agree with the official time.

===Time-zone (longitude) correction===
A standard [[time zone]] covers roughly 15° of longitude, so any point within that zone which is not on the reference longitude (generally a multiple of 15°) will experience a difference from standard time equal to 4 minutes of time per degree.  For illustration, sunsets and sunrises are at a much later "official" time at the western edge of a time-zone, compared to sunrise and sunset times at the eastern edge.  If a sundial is located at, say, a longitude 5° west of the reference longitude, its time will read 20 minutes slow, since the sun appears to revolve around the Earth at 15° per hour.  This is a constant correction throughout the year.  For equiangular dials such as equatorial, spherical or Lambert dials, this correction can be made by rotating the dial surface by an angle equaling the difference in longitude, without changing the gnomon position or orientation.  However, this method does not work for other dials, such as a horizontal dial; the correction must be applied by the viewer.

At its most extreme, time zones can cause official noon, including daylight savings, to occur up to three hours early (the sun is actually on the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] at official clock time of 3 pm). This occurs in the far west of [[Alaska]], [[China]], and [[Spain]]. For more details and examples, see [[Skewing of time zones]].

=== Equation of time correction ===
[[File:Equation of time.svg|thumb|The Equation of Time - above the axis the equation of time is positive, and a sundial will appear ''fast'' relative to a clock showing local mean time. The opposites are true below the axis.]]
{{main|Equation of time}}
[[File:Derby Sundial C 5810.JPG|thumb|170px|The [[Whitehurst &amp; Son sundial (1812)|Whitehurst &amp; Son]]  sundial made in 1812, with a circular scale showing the equation of time correction. This is now on display in the [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery|Derby Museum.]] ]]

Although the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about the Earth, in reality this motion is not perfectly uniform. This is due to the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth's orbit (the fact that the Earth's orbit about the Sun is not perfectly circular, but slightly [[ellipse|elliptical]]) and the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth's rotational axis relative to the plane of its orbit. Therefore, sundial time varies from [[Local mean time|standard clock time]]. On four days of the year, the correction is effectively zero. However, on others, it can be as much as a quarter-hour early or late. The amount of correction is described by the [[equation of time]]. This correction is equal worldwide: it does not depend on the local [[latitude]] or [[longitude]] of the observer's position. It does, however, change over long periods of time, (centuries or more,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 | first= Kevin
 | last= Karney
 | title= Variation in the Equation of Time

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;)
because of slow variations in the Earth's orbital and rotational motions. Therefore, tables and graphs of the equation of time that were made centuries ago are now significantly incorrect. The reading of an old sundial should be corrected by applying the present-day equation of time, not one from the period when the dial was made.

In some sundials, the equation of time correction is provided as an informational plaque affixed to the sundial, for the  observer to calculate. In more sophisticated sundials the equation can be incorporated automatically. For example, some equatorial bow sundials are supplied with a small wheel that sets the time of year; this wheel in turn rotates the equatorial bow, offsetting its time measurement. In other cases, the hour lines may be curved, or the equatorial bow may be shaped like a vase, which exploits the changing altitude of the sun over the year to effect the proper offset in time.&lt;ref&gt;

A ''heliochronometer'' is a precision sundial first devised in about 1763 by [[Philipp Matthäus Hahn|Philipp Hahn]] and improved by [[Abbé Guyoux]] in about 1827.&lt;ref name=Daniel2008&gt;

[[File:ROE-2012-05-07-0010.jpg|thumb|Sunquest sundial, designed by Richard L. Schmoyer, at the Mount Cuba Observatory in Greenville, Delaware]]

The [[Sunquest sundial]], designed by Richard L. Schmoyer in the 1950s, uses an analemmic inspired gnomon to cast a shaft of light onto an equatorial time-scale crescent. Sunquest is adjustable for latitude and longitude, automatically correcting for the equation of time, rendering it "as accurate as most pocket watches".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmoyer|first1=Richard L.|title=Designed for Accuracy|url=http://sunquestsundial.org/index.php/designed-for-accuracy/|website=Sunquest Sundial|publisher=Richard L.

[[File:Sundial with Equation of Time correction.jpg|thumb|Sundial on the Orihuela Campus of Miguel Hernández University, Spain, which uses a projected graph of the equation of time within the shadow to indicate clock time.]]

An analemma may be added to many types of sundials to correct apparent solar time to [[mean solar time]] or another [[standard time]]. These usually have hour lines shaped like "figure eights" ([[analemma]]s) according to the [[equation of time]]. This compensates for the slight eccentricity in the Earth's orbit and the tilt of the Earth's axis that causes up to a 15-minute variation from mean solar time. This is a type of dial furniture seen on more complicated horizontal and vertical dials.

Prior to the invention of accurate clocks, in the mid-17th Century, sundials were the only timepieces in common use, and were considered to tell the "right" time. The Equation of Time was not used. After the invention of good clocks, sundials were still considered to be correct, and clocks usually incorrect. The Equation of Time was used in the opposite direction from today, to apply a correction to the time shown by a clock to make it agree with sundial time. Some elaborate "[[equation clock]]s", such as one made by Joseph Williamson in 1720, incorporated mechanisms to do this correction automatically. (Williamson's clock may have been the first-ever device to use a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear.) Only after about 1800 was uncorrected clock time considered to be "right", and sundial time usually "wrong", so the Equation of Time became used as it is today.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Sundials with fixed axial gnomon==
[[File:Carefree-Carefree Sundial-1959-2.JPG|thumb|The 1959 [[Carefree sundial]] in [[Carefree, Arizona]] has a {{convert|62|ft|adj=on}} gnomon, possibly the largest sundial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/sundials/temp/its-about-time/FS_SundialAndGeometry.pdf The Sundial and Geometry p 38.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092945/http://www.wsanford.com/~wsanford/sundials/temp/its-about-time/FS_SundialAndGeometry.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The most commonly observed sundials are those in which the shadow-casting style is fixed in position and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, being oriented with [[true North]] and South, and making an angle with the horizontal equal to the geographical latitude.  This axis is aligned with the [[celestial pole]]s, which is closely, but not perfectly, aligned with the (present) [[pole star]] [[Polaris]].  For illustration, the celestial axis points vertically at the true [[North Pole]], where it points horizontally on the [[equator]].  At [[Jaipur]], home of the world's largest sundial, gnomons are raised 26°55" above horizontal, reflecting the local latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The world’s largest sundial, Jantar Mantar, Jaipur|url=https://www.bordersundials.co.uk/the-worlds-largest-sundial-jantar-mantar-jaipur/|website=Border Sundials|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On any given day, the Sun appears to rotate uniformly about this axis, at about 15° per hour, making a full circuit (360°) in 24 hours.  A linear gnomon aligned with this axis will cast a sheet of shadow (a half-plane) that, falling opposite to the Sun, likewise rotates about the celestial axis at 15° per hour.  The shadow is seen by falling on a receiving surface that is usually flat, but which may be spherical, cylindrical, conical or of other shapes.  If the shadow falls on a surface that is symmetrical about the celestial axis (as in an armillary sphere, or an equatorial dial), the surface-shadow likewise moves uniformly; the hour-lines on the sundial are equally spaced.  However, if the receiving surface is not symmetrical (as in most horizontal sundials), the surface shadow generally moves non-uniformly and the hour-lines are not equally spaced; one exception is the Lambert dial described below.

Some types of sundials are designed with a fixed gnomon that is not aligned with the celestial poles like a vertical obelisk. Such sundials are covered below under the section, "Nodus-based sundials".

===Empirical hour-line marking===
{{see also|Schema for horizontal dials|Equation of time}}
The formulas shown in the paragraphs below allow the positions of the hour-lines to be calculated for various types of sundial. In some cases, the calculations are simple; in others they are extremely complicated. There is an alternative, simple method of finding the positions of the hour-lines which can be used for many types of sundial, and saves a lot of work in cases where the calculations are complex.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=106–107}} This is an empirical procedure in which the position of the shadow of the gnomon of a real sundial is marked at hourly intervals. The [[equation of time]] must be taken into account to ensure that the positions of the hour-lines are independent of the time of year when they are marked. An easy way to do this is to set a clock or watch so it shows "sundial time"{{efn|A clock showing sundial time always agrees with a sundial in the same locality.}} which is [[standard time]],{{efn|Strictly, [[local mean time]] rather than standard time should be used. However, using standard time makes the sundial more useful, since it does not have to be corrected for time zone or longitude.}} plus the equation of time on the day in question.{{efn|The equation of time is considered to be positive when "sundial time" is ahead of "clock time", negative otherwise. See the graph shown in the section [[#Equation of time correction]], above. For example, if the equation of time is -5 minutes and the standard time is 9:40, the sundial time is 9:35.}}{{sfn|Waugh|1973| p= 205}} The hour-lines on the sundial are marked to show the positions of the shadow of the style when this clock shows whole numbers of hours, and are labelled with these numbers of hours. For example, when the clock reads 5:00, the shadow of the style is marked, and labelled "5" (or "V" in [[Roman numerals]]). If the hour-lines are not all marked in a single day, the clock must be adjusted every day or two to take account of the variation of the equation of time.

===Equatorial sundials===

Closer inspection of the [[:File:beijing sundial.jpg|full-size image]] reveals the "spider-web" of date rings and hour-lines.]]

{{anchor|equinoctial sundial}}The distinguishing characteristic of the ''equatorial dial'' (also called the ''equinoctial dial'')  is the planar surface that receives the shadow, which is exactly perpendicular to the gnomon's style.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=46–49}}{{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 55–56, 96–98, 138–141}}{{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 29–34}}  This plane is called equatorial, because it is parallel to the equator of the Earth and of the celestial sphere.  If the gnomon is fixed and aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the sun's apparent rotation about the Earth casts a uniformly rotating sheet of shadow from the gnomon; this produces a uniformly rotating line of shadow on the equatorial plane.  Since the sun rotates 360° in 24 hours, the hour-lines on an equatorial dial are all spaced 15° apart (360/24).

:&lt;math&gt;   H_E = 15^{\circ}\times t\text{ (hours)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The uniformity of their spacing makes this type of sundial easy to construct.  If the dial plate material is opaque, both sides of the equatorial dial must be marked, since the shadow will be cast from below in winter and from above in summer. With translucent dial plates (e.g. glass) the hour angles need only be marked on the sun-facing side, although the hour numberings (if used) need be made on both sides of the dial, owing to the differing hour schema on the sun-facing and sun-backing sides.

Another major advantage of this dial is that equation of time (EoT) and daylight saving time (DST) corrections can be made by simply rotating the dial plate by the appropriate angle each day. This is because the hour angles are equally spaced around the dial. For this reason, an equatorial dial is often a useful choice when the dial is for public display and it is desirable to have it show the true local time to reasonable accuracy.The EoT correction is made via the relation

: &lt;math&gt; \text{Correction}^{\circ} = \frac{\text{EoT (minutes)} + 60 \times \Delta \text{DST (hours)}}{4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Near the [[equinox]]es in spring and autumn, the sun moves on a circle that is nearly the same as the equatorial plane; hence, no clear shadow is produced on the equatorial dial at those times of year, a drawback of the design.

A ''nodus'' is sometimes added to equatorial sundials, which allows the sundial to tell the time of year.  On any given day, the shadow of the nodus moves on a circle on the equatorial plane, and the radius of the circle measures the [[declination]] of the sun. The ends of the gnomon bar may be used as the nodus, or some feature along its length. An ancient variant of the equatorial sundial has only a nodus (no style) and the concentric circular hour-lines are arranged to resemble a spider-web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schaldach K | date = 2004 | title = The arachne of the Amphiareion and the origin of gnomonics in Greece | journal = Journal for the History of Astronomy | volume = 35 | pages = 435–445 | issn = 0021-8286 | doi=10.1177/002182860403500404| bibcode = 2004JHA....35..435S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''horizontal sundial'' (also called a ''garden sundial''), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally, rather than being perpendicular to the style as in the equatorial dial.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=49–53}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 56–99, 101–143, 138–141}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 35–51}} Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face; rather, the hour lines are spaced according to the rule {{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=52}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| p= 45}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_H = \sin L  \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

Or in other terms:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ H_H = \tan^{-1}[\sin L \times \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)]
&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the sundial's geographical [[latitude]] (and the angle the gnomon makes with the dial plate), &lt;math&gt; H_H &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards [[true North]]) on the plane, and ''t'' is the number of hours before or after noon.  For example, the angle &lt;math&gt; H_H &lt;/math&gt; of the 3pm hour-line would equal the [[inverse trigonometric function|arctangent]] of [[trigonometric function|sin]] L, since tan 45° = 1.  When L equals 90° (at the [[North Pole]]), the horizontal sundial becomes an equatorial sundial; the style points straight up (vertically), and the horizontal plane is aligned with the equatorial plane; the hour-line formula becomes &lt;math&gt; H_H &lt;/math&gt; = 15° × t, as for an equatorial dial.  A horizontal sundial at the Earth's [[equator]], where L equals 0°, would require a (raised) horizontal style and would be an example of a polar sundial (see below).

[[File:Kew Gardens 0502.JPG|thumb|Detail of horizontal sundial outside [[Kew Palace]] in London, United Kingdom]]
The chief advantages of the horizontal sundial are that it is easy to read, and the sun lights the face throughout the year.  All the hour-lines intersect at the point where the gnomon's style crosses the horizontal plane.  Since the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, the style points [[true North]] and its angle with the horizontal equals the sundial's geographical latitude L.  A sundial designed for one [[latitude]] can be adjusted for use at another latitude by tilting its base upwards or downwards by an angle equal to the difference in latitude.  For example, a sundial designed for a latitude of 40° can be used at a latitude of 45°, if the sundial plane is tilted upwards by 5°, thus aligning the style with the Earth's rotational axis. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Many ornamental sundials are designed to be used at 45 degrees north. Some mass-produced garden sundials fail to correctly calculate the ''hourlines'' and so can never be corrected.  A local standard [[time zone]] is nominally 15 degrees wide, but may be modified to follow geographic or political boundaries.  A sundial can be rotated around its style (which must remain pointed at the celestial pole) to adjust to the local time zone. In most cases, a rotation in the range of 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees west suffices. This will introduce error in sundials that do not have equal hour angles.  To correct for [[daylight saving time]], a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table.  An informal standard is to have numerals in hot colors for summer, and in cool colors for winter. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
Since the hour angles are not evenly spaced, the equation of time corrections cannot be made via rotating the dial plate about the gnomon axis. These types of dials usually have an equation of time correction tabulation engraved on their pedestals or close by.
Horizontal dials are commonly seen in gardens, churchyards and in public areas.

===Vertical sundials===

The East-facing dial is a polar dial with parallel hour-lines, the dial-face being parallel to the style.]]

In the common ''vertical dial'', the shadow-receiving plane is aligned vertically; as usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's axis of rotation.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=46–49}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 557–58, 102–107, 141–143}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 52–99}}  As in the horizontal dial, the line of shadow does not move uniformly on the face; the sundial is not ''equiangular''.  If the face of the vertical dial points directly south, the angle of the hour-lines is instead described by the formula{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=65}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| p=52}}
:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_V = \cos L \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the sundial's geographical [[latitude]], &lt;math&gt; H_V &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and ''t'' is the number of hours before or after noon.  For example, the angle &lt;math&gt; H_V &lt;/math&gt; of the 3pm hour-line would equal the [[inverse trigonometric function|arctangent]] of [[trigonometric function|cos]] L, since tan 45° = 1.  The shadow moves ''counter-clockwise'' on a south-facing vertical dial, whereas it runs clockwise on horizontal and equatorial north-facing dials.

Dials with faces perpendicular to the ground and which face directly South, North, East, or West are called ''vertical direct dials''.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=54–55}}  {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 52–69}}  It is widely believed, and stated in respectable publications, that a vertical dial cannot receive more than twelve hours of sunlight a day, no matter how many hours of daylight there are.{{sfn|Waugh|1973| p=83}} However, there is an exception. Vertical sundials in the tropics which face the nearer pole (e.g. north facing in the zone between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer) can actually receive sunlight for more than 12 hours from sunrise to sunset for a short period around the time of the summer solstice. For example, at latitude 20 degrees North, on June 21, the sun shines on a north-facing vertical wall for 13&amp;nbsp;hours, 21&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="Sunrise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunrisesunsetmap.com/|title=Worldwide Sunrise and Sunset map|last=Morrissey|first=David |accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical sundials which do ''not'' face directly South (in the northern hemisphere) may receive significantly less than twelve hours of sunlight per day, depending on the direction they do face, and on the time of year.  For example, a vertical dial that faces due East can tell time only in the morning hours; in the afternoon, the sun does not shine on its face.  Vertical dials that face due East or West are ''polar dials'', which will be described below.  Vertical dials that face North are uncommon, because they tell time only during the spring and summer, and do not show the midday hours except in tropical latitudes (and even there, only around midsummer).  For non-direct vertical dials — those that face in non-cardinal directions — the mathematics of arranging the style and the hour-lines becomes more complicated; it may be easier to mark the hour lines by observation, but the placement of the style, at least, must be calculated first; such dials are said to be ''declining dials''.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=55–69}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|p=58}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 74–99}}

[[File:Nové Město nad Metují sundials 2011 3.jpg|thumb|170px|"Double" sundials in [[Nové Město nad Metují]], Czech Republic; the observer is facing almost due north.]]

Vertical dials are commonly mounted on the walls of buildings, such as town-halls, [[cupola]]s and church-towers, where they are easy to see from far away. In some cases, vertical dials are placed on all four sides of a rectangular tower, providing the time throughout the day.  The face may be painted on the wall, or displayed in inlaid stone; the gnomon is often a single metal bar, or a tripod of metal bars for rigidity.  If the wall of the building faces ''toward'' the South, but does not face due South, the gnomon will not lie along the noon line, and the hour lines must be corrected.  Since the gnomon's style must be parallel to the Earth's axis, it always "points" [[true North]] and its angle with the horizontal will equal the sundial's geographical latitude; on a direct south dial, its angle with the vertical face of the dial will equal the [[colatitude]], or 90° minus the latitude.{{sfn|Waugh|1973| p=55}}

===Polar dials===
[[File:Sundial - Melbourne Planetarium.jpg|thumb|Polar sundial at [[Scienceworks (Melbourne)|Melbourne Planetarium]]]]
In ''polar dials'', the shadow-receiving plane is aligned ''parallel'' to the gnomon-style.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=72}}{{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 58, 107–112}}{{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 70–73}}
Thus, the shadow slides sideways over the surface, moving perpendicularly to itself as the sun rotates about the style.  As with the gnomon, the hour-lines are all aligned with the Earth's rotational axis.  When the sun's rays are nearly parallel to the plane, the shadow moves very quickly and the hour lines are spaced far apart.  The direct East- and West-facing dials are examples of a polar dial.  However, the face of a polar dial need not be vertical; it need only be parallel to the gnomon.  Thus, a plane inclined at the angle of latitude (relative to horizontal) under the similarly inclined gnomon will be a polar dial.  The perpendicular spacing ''X'' of the hour-lines in the plane is described by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
X = H \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the height of the style above the plane, and ''t'' is the time (in hours) before or after the center-time for the polar dial.  The center time is the time when the style's shadow falls directly down on the plane; for an East-facing dial, the center time will be 6am, for a West-facing dial, this will be 6pm, and for the inclined dial described above, it will be noon.  When ''t'' approaches ±6 hours away from the center time, the spacing ''X'' diverges to [[Extended real number line|+∞]]; this occurs when the sun's rays become parallel to the plane.

===Vertical declining dials===
[[File:Verticalezonnewijzers-en.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Effect of declining on a sundial's hour-lines.  A vertical dial, at a latitude of 51° N, designed to face due South (far left) shows all the hours from 6am to 6pm, and has converging hour-lines symmetrical about the noon hour-line.  By contrast, a West-facing dial (far right) is polar, with parallel hour lines, and shows only hours after noon.  At the intermediate orientations of [[Boxing the compass|South-Southwest, Southwest, and West-Southwest]], the hour lines are asymmetrical about noon, with the morning hour-lines ever more widely spaced.]]

A ''declining dial'' is any non-horizontal, planar dial that does not face in a cardinal direction, such as (true) [[North]], [[South]], [[East]] or [[West]]. {{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=55–69}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 58–112, 101–117, 1458–146}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 74–99}}  As usual, the gnomon's style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, but the hour-lines are not symmetrical about the noon hour-line.  For a vertical dial, the angle &lt;math&gt; H_\text{VD} &lt;/math&gt; between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that &lt;math&gt; H_\text{VD} &lt;/math&gt;  is defined positive in the clockwise sense w.r.t. the upper vertical hour angle; and that its conversion to the equivalent solar hour requires careful consideration of which quadrant of the sundial that it belongs in.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=79}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_\text{VD} = \frac{\cos L}{\cos D \cot(15^{\circ} \times t) - s_o \sin L \sin D }
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;  is the sundial's geographical [[latitude]]; ''t'' is the time before or after noon; &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;  is the angle of declination from true [[south]], defined as positive when east of south; and &lt;math&gt;s_o&lt;/math&gt; is a switch integer for the dial orientation. A partly south-facing dial has an &lt;math&gt;s_o&lt;/math&gt; value of + 1; those partly north-facing, a value of -1. When such a dial faces South (&lt;math&gt; D  = 0^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt;), this formula reduces to the formula given above for vertical south-facing dials, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_\text{V}  = \cos L \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

When a sundial is not aligned with a cardinal direction, the substyle of its gnomon is not aligned with the noon hour-line.  The angle &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; between the substyle and the noon hour-line is given by the formula{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=79}}

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan B = \sin D  \cot L
&lt;/math&gt;

If a vertical sundial faces true South or North (&lt;math&gt; D = 0^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; D  = 180^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt;, respectively), the angle &lt;math&gt; B  = 0^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt; and the substyle is aligned with the noon hour-line.

The height of the gnomon, that is the angle the style makes to the plate, &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;, is given by :
:&lt;math&gt;
\sin G = \cos D  \cos L
 &lt;/math&gt;
{{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|p= 138}}

===Reclining dials===
[[File:RelSolValongo.jpg|thumb|right|Vertical reclining dial in the Southern Hemisphere, facing due north, with hyperbolic declination lines and hour lines. Ordinary vertical sundial at this latitude (between tropics) could not produce a declination line for the summer solstice. This particular sundial is located at the Valongo Observatory of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.]]
The sundials described above have gnomons that are aligned with the Earth's rotational axis and cast their shadow onto a plane.  If the plane is neither vertical nor horizontal nor equatorial, the sundial is said to be ''reclining'' or ''inclining''.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), pp. 70–81; Waugh (1973), pp. 100–107; Mayall and Mayall (1994), pp. 59–60, 117–122, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a sundial might be located on a South-facing roof, for example.  The hour-lines for such a sundial can be calculated by slightly correcting the horizontal formula above&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 77; Waugh (1973), pp. 101–103; {{cite book | author = Capt. Samuel Sturmy | date = 1683 | title = The Art of Dialling | publisher = Unknown publisher | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_{RV} = \cos(L + R) \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is the desired angle of reclining relative to the local vertical, L is the sundial's geographical latitude, &lt;math&gt; H_{RV} &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points due north) on the plane, and ''t'' is the number of hours before or after noon.  For example, the angle &lt;math&gt; H_{RV} &lt;/math&gt; of the 3pm hour-line would equal the [[inverse trigonometric function|arctangent]] of [[trigonometric function|cos]](L + R), since tan 45° = 1.  When R equals 0° (in other words, a South-facing vertical dial), we obtain the vertical dial formula above.

Some authors use a more specific nomenclature to describe the orientation of the shadow-receiving plane.  If the plane's face points downwards towards the ground, it is said to be ''proclining'' or ''inclining'', whereas a dial is said to be ''reclining'' when the dial face is pointing away from the ground. Many authors also often refer to reclined, proclined and inclined sundials in general as inclined sundials. It is also common in the latter case to measure the angle of inclination relative to the horizontal plane on the sun side of the dial.
In such texts, since I = 90° + R, the hour angle formula will often be seen written as :

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_{RV}  = \sin(L + I) \tan(15^{\circ} \times t)
&lt;/math&gt;

The angle between the gnomon style and the dial plate, B, in this type of sundial is :

:&lt;math&gt;
B = 90^{\circ} - (L + R)
&lt;/math&gt;

Or :

:&lt;math&gt;
B = 180^{\circ} - (L + I)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Declining-reclining dials/ Declining-inclining dials===

Some sundials both decline and recline, in that their shadow-receiving plane is not oriented with a cardinal direction (such as [[true North]] or true South) and is neither horizontal nor vertical nor equatorial.  For example, such a sundial might be found on a roof that was not oriented in a cardinal direction.

The formulae describing the spacing of the hour-lines on such dials are rather more complicated than those for simpler dials.

There are various solution approaches, including some using the methods of rotation matrices, and some making a 3D model of the reclined-declined plane and its vertical declined counterpart plane, extracting the geometrical relationships between the hour angle components on both these planes and then reducing the trigonometric algebra.{{sfn|''Sundial Design Using Matrices.'' H. Brandmaier, NASS Compendium, Vol 12, No. 1, pp.16-23, Mar 2005.}} {{sfn|''[http://dls-website.com/documents/SundialDesignConsiderations.pdf Sundial Design Considerations.]'' Donald L. Snyder, NASS Compendium, Vol 22, No. 1,  Mar 2015.}}

One system of formulas for Reclining-Declining sundials: (as stated by Fennewick)&lt;ref name=Fennewick&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fennerwick|first1=Armyan|title=, the Netherlands, Revision of Chapter 5 of Sundials by René R.J. Rohr, New York 1996 declining inclined dials part D Declining and Inclined Dials by Mathematics using a new figure|url=http://lester.demon.nl/mywww/rohr/|website=unknown|publisher=user on demon.nl|accessdate=1 May 2015|location=Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Description of the problem --&gt;

The angle &lt;math&gt; H_\text{RD} &lt;/math&gt; between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that &lt;math&gt; H_\text{RD} &lt;/math&gt; advances counterclockwise with respect to the zero hour angle for those dials that are partly south-facing and clockwise for those that are north-facing.

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan H_\text{RD} = \frac{\cos R \cos L  - \sin R \sin L \cos D - s_o  \sin R \sin D \cot(15^{\circ} \times t)}{\cos D \cot(15^{\circ} \times t) - s_o  \sin D \sin L }
&lt;/math&gt;

within the parameter ranges :  &lt;math&gt; D &lt; D_c &lt;/math&gt;   and   &lt;math&gt; -90^{\circ} &lt; R &lt; (90^{\circ} - L) &lt;/math&gt;.

Or, if preferring to use inclination angle, &lt;math&gt; I &lt;/math&gt;, rather than the reclination, &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; I = (90^{\circ} + R) &lt;/math&gt; :

:&lt;math&gt;  \tan H_\text{RD} = \frac{\sin I \cos L  + \cos I \sin L \cos D + s_o  \cos I \sin D \cot(15^{\circ} \times t)}{\cos D \cot(15^{\circ} \times t) - s_o  \sin D \sin L }
&lt;/math&gt;

within the parameter ranges :  &lt;math&gt; D &lt; D_c &lt;/math&gt;   and   &lt;math&gt; 0^{\circ} &lt; I &lt; (180^{\circ} - L) &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the sundial's geographical latitude; &lt;math&gt;s_o&lt;/math&gt; is the orientation switch integer; ''t'' is the time in hours before or after noon; and &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively.
Note that &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the sun's side. Declination angle &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is defined as positive when moving east of true south.
Dials facing fully or partly south have &lt;math&gt;s_o&lt;/math&gt; = +1, while those partly or fully north-facing have an &lt;math&gt;s_o&lt;/math&gt; value of -1.
Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctan function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle.

Unlike the simpler vertical declining sundial, this type of dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing.
Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west.
In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value.
The critical declination &lt;math&gt; D_c &lt;/math&gt; is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value of both the dial's reclination and its latitude :

:&lt;math&gt;
\cos D_c  = \tan R \tan L = - \tan L \cot I
&lt;/math&gt;

As with the vertical declined dial, the gnomon's substyle is not aligned with the noon hour-line. The general formula for the angle &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, between the substyle and the noon-line is given by :

:&lt;math&gt;
\tan B = \frac {\sin D}{\sin R \cos D + \cos R \tan L} = \frac {\sin D}{\cos I \cos D - \sin I \tan L}
&lt;/math&gt;

The angle &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;, between the style and the plate is given by :

:&lt;math&gt; \sin G = \cos L \cos D \cos R - \sin L \sin R = - \cos L \cos D \sin I + \sin L \cos I
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that for &lt;math&gt; G = 0^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. when the gnomon is coplanar with the dial plate, we have :

:&lt;math&gt; \cos D = \tan L \tan R = - \tan L \cot I &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. when  &lt;math&gt; D = D_c &lt;/math&gt;, the critical declination value.&lt;ref name=Fennewick/&gt;

====Empirical method====
Because of the complexity of the above calculations, using them for the practical purpose of designing a dial of this type is difficult and prone to error. It has been suggested that it is better to locate the hour lines empirically, marking the positions of the shadow of a style on a real sundial at hourly intervals as shown by a clock.{{sfn|Waugh|1973|pp=106–107}} See [[#Empirical hour-line marking|Empirical hour-line marking]], above.

===Spherical sundials===
[[File:Zw stelling.jpg|thumb|170px|upright|Equatorial bow sundial in [[Hasselt]], [[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]] {{Coord|50|55|47|N|5|20|31|E|type:landmark|name=Hasselt equatorial bow sundial}}.  The rays pass through the narrow slot, forming a uniformly rotating sheet of light that falls on the circular bow.  The hour-lines are equally spaced; in this image, the local solar time is roughly 15:00 hours (3 p.m.). On September 10, a small ball, welded into the slot casts a shadow on centre of the hour band.]]

The surface receiving the shadow need not be a plane, but can have any shape, provided that the sundial maker is willing to mark the hour-lines.  If the style is aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, a spherical shape is convenient since the hour-lines are equally spaced, as they are on the equatorial dial above; the sundial is ''equiangular''.  This is the principle behind the armillary sphere and the equatorial bow sundial.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=114, 1214–125}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 60, 126–129, 151–115}} {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 174–180}}  However, some equiangular sundials — such as the Lambert dial described below — are based on other principles.

In the ''equatorial bow sundial'', the gnomon is a bar, slot or stretched wire parallel to the celestial axis.  The face is a semicircle, corresponding to the equator of the sphere, with markings on the inner surface.  This pattern, built a couple of meters wide out of temperature-invariant steel [[invar]], was used to keep the trains running on time in France before World War I.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=17}}

Among the most precise sundials ever made are two equatorial bows constructed of [[marble]] found in [[Yantra mandir (Jaipur)|Yantra mandir]].{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=118–119}} {{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp=215–216}} This collection of sundials and other astronomical instruments was built by Maharaja [[Jai Singh II]] at his then-new capital of [[Jaipur]], India between 1727 and 1733.  The larger equatorial bow is called the ''Samrat Yantra'' (The Supreme Instrument); standing at 27&amp;nbsp;meters, its shadow moves visibly at 1&amp;nbsp;mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6&amp;nbsp;cm) every minute.

===Cylindrical, conical, and other non-planar sundials===
[[File:Precision sundial in Bütgenbach-Belgium.jpg|left|upright|thumb|170px|Precision sundial in Bütgenbach, Belgium.

Other non-planar surfaces may be used to receive the shadow of the gnomon.

As an elegant alternative, the style (which could be created by a hole or slit in the circumference) may be located on the circumference of a cylinder or sphere, rather than at its central axis of symmetry.

In that case, the hour lines are again spaced equally, but at ''twice'' the usual angle, due to the geometrical [[inscribed angle]] theorem.  This is the basis of some modern sundials, but it was also used in ancient times; {{efn|An example of such a half-cylindrical dial may be found at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Mayall|Mayall|p=94}} }}

In another variation of the polar-axis-aligned cylindrical, a cylindrical dial could be rendered as a helical ribbon-like surface, with a thin gnomon located either along its center or at its periphery.

==Movable-gnomon sundials==
Sundials can be designed with a gnomon that is placed in a different position each day throughout the year.  In other words, the position of the gnomon relative to the centre of the hour lines varies.  The gnomon need not be aligned with the celestial poles and may even be perfectly vertical (the analemmatic dial). These dials, when combined with fixed-gnomon sundials, allow the user to determine [[true North]] with no other aid; the two sundials are correctly aligned if and only if they both show the same time. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Universal equinoctial ring dial===
{{Main|Astronomical rings}}
[[File:Ringsundial open.jpg|thumb|170px|upright|left|Universal ring dial. The dial is suspended from the cord shown in the upper left; the suspension point on the vertical meridian ring can be changed to match the local latitude. The center bar is twisted until a sunray passes through the small hole and falls on the horizontal equatorial ring. See [[:Commons:File:Ringsundial_open.jpg|Commons annotations]] for labels.]]

A ''universal equinoctial ring dial'' (sometimes called a ''ring dial'' for brevity, although the term is ambiguous), is a portable version of an armillary sundial,{{sfn|Waugh|1973|p= 157}} or was inspired by the [[mariner's astrolabe]].&lt;ref name="swanick"&gt;Swanick, Lois Ann. ''An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th Century'', MA Thesis, Texas A&amp;M University, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  It was likely invented by [[William Oughtred]] around 1600 and became common throughout Europe.{{sfn|Turner|1980|p= 25}}

In its simplest form, the style is a thin slit that allows the sun's rays to fall on the hour-lines of an equatorial ring.  As usual, the style is aligned with the Earth's axis; to do this, the user may orient the dial towards [[true North]] and suspend the ring dial vertically from the appropriate point on the meridian ring.  Such dials may be made self-aligning with the addition of a more complicated central bar, instead of a simple slit-style.  These bars are sometimes an addition to a set of [[Gemma's rings]].  This bar could pivot about its end points and held a perforated slider that was positioned to the month and day according to a scale scribed on the bar.  The time was determined by rotating the bar towards the sun so that the light shining through the hole fell on the equatorial ring.  This forced the user to rotate the instrument, which had the effect of aligning the instrument's vertical ring with the meridian.

When not in use, the equatorial and meridian rings can be folded together into a small disk.

In 1610, [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] created the '''sea ring''', which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass.  This permitted mariners to determine the time and [[magnetic variation]] in a single step.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analemmatic sundials===
{{Main|Analemmatic sundial}}
[[File:Zonnewijzerherkenrode.jpg|upright|thumb|170px|Analemmatic sundial on a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] line in the garden of the abbey of Herkenrode in [[Hasselt]] ([[Flanders]] in [[Belgium]])]]

'''Analemmatic sundials''' are a type of horizontal sundial that has a vertical gnomon and hour markers positioned in an elliptical pattern.  There are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read on the ellipse.  The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day.
Analemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon.  Human gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months.  A 66 inch tall person casts a 4-inch shadow at 27 deg latitude on the summer solstice.&lt;ref&gt;Analemmatic sundials: How to build one and why they work by C.J. Budd and C.J. Sangwin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foster-Lambert dials===
The Foster-Lambert dial is another movable-gnomon sundial.{{sfn|Mayall| Mayall|1938|pp= 190–192}} In contrast to the elliptical analemmatic dial, the Lambert dial is circular with evenly spaced hour lines, making it an ''equiangular sundial'', similar to the equatorial, spherical, cylindrical and conical dials described above.  The gnomon of a Foster-Lambert dial is neither vertical nor aligned with the Earth's rotational axis; rather, it is tilted northwards by an angle α = 45° - (Φ/2), where Φ is the geographical [[latitude]].  Thus, a Foster-Lambert dial located at latitude 40° would have a gnomon tilted away from vertical by 25° in a northerly direction.  To read the correct time, the gnomon must also be moved northwards by a distance

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = R \tan \alpha   \tan \delta \,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the radius of the Foster-Lambert dial and δ again indicates the Sun's declination for that time of year.

==Altitude-based sundials==
Altitude dials measure the height of the sun in the sky, rather than directly measuring its hour-angle about the Earth's axis.  They are not oriented towards [[true North]], but rather towards the sun and generally held vertically. The sun's elevation is indicated by the position of a nodus, either the shadow-tip of a gnomon, or a spot of light.

In altitude dials, the time is read from where the nodus falls on a set of hour-curves that vary with the time of year. Many such altitude-dials' construction is calculation-intensive, as also the case with many azimuth dials. But the capuchin dials (described below) are constructed and used graphically.

Altitude dials' disadvantages:

Since the sun's altitude is the same at times equally spaced about noon (e.g., 9am and 3pm), the user had to know whether it was morning or afternoon.  At, say, 3:00 pm, that isn't a problem. But when the dial indicates a time 15 minutes from noon, the user likely won't have a way of distinguishing 11:45 from 12:15.

Additionally, altitude dials are less accurate near noon, because the sun's altitude isn't changing rapidly then.

Many of these dials are portable and simple to use. As is often the case with other sundials, many altitude dials are designed for only one latitude. But the capuchin dial (described below) has a version that's adjustable for latitude.{{sfn|Mayall|Mayall|1965|p=169}}

The book on sundials by Mayall &amp; Mayall describes the Universal Capuchin sundial.

===Human shadows===
The length of a human shadow (or of any vertical object) can be used to measure the sun's elevation and, thence, the time.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 15; Waugh (1973), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Venerable Bede]] gave a table for estimating the time from the length of one's shadow in feet, on the assumption that a monk's height is six times the length of his foot.  Such shadow lengths will vary with the geographical [[latitude]] and with the time of year.  For example, the shadow length at noon is short in summer months, and long in winter months.

[[Chaucer]] evokes this method a few times in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', as in his ''Parson's Tale''.
{{efn|
[[Chaucer]]:as in his ''Parson's Tale''. It was four o'clock according to my guess,&lt;br /&gt;Since eleven feet, a little more or less,&lt;br /&gt;my shadow at the time did fall,&lt;br /&gt;Considering that I myself am six feet tall.}}

An equivalent type of sundial using a vertical rod of fixed length is known as a ''[[backstaff|backstaff dial]]''.

===Shepherd's dial – timesticks===
{{Main|Diurnal motion}}
[[File:Tibetan Timestick.jpg|thumb|19th century Tibetan Shepherd's Timestick]]
A [[shepherd's dial]] — also known as a ''shepherd's column dial'',&lt;ref name="story of time"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Maritime Museum|author2=Lippincott, Kristen|author3=Eco, Umberto|author4=Gombrich, E.

The gnomon can be twisted to be above a month or day indication on the face of the cylinder.  This corrects the sundial for the equation of time.  The entire sundial is then twisted on its string so that the gnomon aims toward the sun, while the cylinder remains vertical.  The tip of the shadow indicates the time on the cylinder.  The hour curves inscribed on the cylinder permit one to read the time.  Shepherd's dials are sometimes hollow, so that the gnomon can fold within when not in use.

The shepherd's dial is evoked in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', {{efn|[[Henry VI, Part 3]]:O God! methinks it were a happy life&lt;br /&gt;To be no better than a homely swain;&lt;br /&gt;To sit upon a hill, as I do now,&lt;br /&gt;To carve out dials, quaintly, point by point,&lt;br /&gt;Thereby to see the minutes, how they run--&lt;br /&gt;How many makes the hour full complete,&lt;br /&gt;How many hours brings about the day,&lt;br /&gt;How many days will finish up the year,&lt;br /&gt;How many years a mortal man may live.}} among other works of literature. {{efn|For example, in the [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', the monk says, "Goth now your wey," quod he, "al stille and softe,&lt;br /&gt;And lat us dyne as sone as that ye may;&lt;br /&gt;for by my chilindre it is pryme of day."}}

The cylindrical shepherd's dial can be unrolled into a flat plate.  In one simple version,&lt;ref&gt;Waugh (1973), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; the front and back of the plate each have three columns, corresponding to pairs of months with roughly the same solar declination (June–July, May–August, April–September, March–October, February–November, and January–December).  The top of each column has a hole for inserting the shadow-casting gnomon, a peg.  Often only two times are marked on the column below, one for noon and the other for mid-morning/mid-afternoon.

Timesticks, ''clock spear'',&lt;ref name="story of time"/&gt; or ''shepherds' time stick'',&lt;ref name="story of time"/&gt; are based on the same principles as dials.&lt;ref name="story of time"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beginnings"/&gt; The time stick is carved with eight vertical time scales for a different period of the year, each bearing a time scale calculated according to the relative amount of daylight during the different months of the year. Any reading depends not only on the time of day but also on the latitude and time of year.&lt;ref name="beginnings"/&gt;
A peg gnomon is inserted at the top in the appropriate hole or face for the season of the year, and turned to the Sun so that the shadow falls directly down the scale. Its end displays the time.&lt;ref name="story of time"/&gt;

===Ring dials===
In a ring dial (also known as an ''Aquitaine'' or a ''perforated ring dial''), the ring is hung vertically and oriented sideways towards the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 111; Waugh (1973), pp. 158–160; Mayall and Mayall (1994), pp. 159–162.&lt;/ref&gt;  A beam of light passes through a small hole in the ring and falls on hour-curves that are inscribed on the inside of the ring. To adjust for the equation of time, the hole is usually on a loose ring within the ring so that the hole can be adjusted to reflect the current month.

===Card dials (Capuchin dials)===
Card dials are another form of altitude dial.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 110; Waugh (1973), pp. 161–165; Mayall and Mayall (1994), p. 166–185.&lt;/ref&gt;  A card is aligned edge-on with the sun and tilted so that a ray of light passes through an aperture onto a specified spot, thus determining the sun's altitude.  A weighted string hangs vertically downwards from a hole in the card, and carries a bead or knot.  The position of the bead on the hour-lines of the card gives the time.  In more sophisticated versions such as the Capuchin dial, there is only one set of hour-lines, i.e., the hour lines do not vary with the seasons.  Instead, the position of the hole from which the weighted string hangs is varied according to the season.

The Capuchin sundials are constructed and used graphically, as opposed the direct hour-angle measurements of horizontal or equatorial dials; or the calculated hour angle lines of some altitude and azimuth dials.

In addition to the ordinary Capuchin dial, there is a universal Capuchin dial, adjustable for latitude.

===Navicula===
[[File:Navicula de Venetiis-MHS 2139-P7220157-gradient.jpg|thumb|[[Navicula de Venetiis]] on display at [[Musée d'histoire des sciences de la Ville de Genève]].]]
A [[navicula de Venetiis]] or "little ship of Venice" was an altitude dial used to tell time and which was shaped like a little ship. The cursor (with a plumb line attached) was slid up/down the mast to the correct latitude.  The user then sighted the sun through the pair of sighting holes at either end of the "ship's deck". The plumb line then marked what hour of the day it was.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Nodus-based sundials==
[[File:057Cracow.JPG|thumb|170px|upright| Kraków. {{Coord|50.0614|19.9400|type:landmark|format=dms|name=Kraków sundial}} The shadow of the cross-shaped nodus moves along a [[hyperbola]] which shows the time of the year,indicated here by the zodiac figures. It is 1:50 p.m. on 16 July, 25 days after the [[summer solstice]].]]

Another type of sundial follows the motion of a single point of light or shadow, which may be called the ''nodus''.  For example, the sundial may follow the sharp tip of a gnomon's shadow, e.g., the shadow-tip of a vertical [[obelisk]] (e.g., the ''[[Solarium Augusti]]'') or the tip of the horizontal marker in a shepherd's dial.  Alternatively, sunlight may be allowed to pass through a small hole or reflected from a small (e.g., coin-sized) circular mirror, forming a small spot of light whose position may be followed.  In such cases, the rays of light trace out a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] over the course of a day; when the rays fall on a surface, the path followed is the intersection of the cone with that surface.  Most commonly, the receiving surface is a geometrical [[plane (geometry)|plane]], so that the path of the shadow-tip or light-spot (called ''declination line'') traces out a [[conic section]] such as a [[hyperbola]] or an [[ellipse]].  The collection of hyperbolae was called a ''pelekonon'' (axe) by the Greeks, because it resembles a double-bladed ax, narrow in the center (near the noonline) and flaring out at the ends (early morning and late evening hours).
[[File:Sundial solstice declination lines for different latitudes - slow.gif|thumb|left|Declination lines at solstices and equinox for sundials, located at different latitudes]]
There is a simple verification of hyperbolic declination lines on a sundial: the distance from the origin to the equinox line should be equal to [[harmonic mean]] of distances from the origin to summer and winter solstice lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Belk T | date = September 2007 | title = Declination Lines Detailed | journal = BSS Bulletin | volume = 19(iii) | pages = 137–140 | url = http://www.sundialsoc.org.uk/Bulletin/Bulletin-19iii-Belk.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018080432/http://sundialsoc.org.uk/Bulletin/Bulletin-19iii-Belk.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nodus-based sundials may use a small hole or mirror to isolate a single ray of light; the former are sometimes called ''aperture dials''.  The oldest example is perhaps the antiborean sundial (''antiboreum''), a spherical nodus-based sundial that faces [[true North]]; a ray of sunlight enters from the South through a small hole located at the sphere's pole and falls on the hour and date lines inscribed within the sphere, which resemble lines of longitude and latitude, respectively, on a globe.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|p=14}}

===Reflection sundials===
[[Isaac Newton]] developed a convenient and inexpensive sundial, in which a small mirror is placed on the sill of a south-facing window.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh (1973), pp. 116–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mirror acts like a nodus, casting a single spot of light on the ceiling.  Depending on the geographical [[latitude]] and time of year, the light-spot follows a conic section, such as the hyperbolae of the pelikonon. If the mirror is parallel to the Earth's equator, and the ceiling is horizontal, then the resulting angles are those of a conventional horizontal sundial.  Using the ceiling as a sundial surface exploits unused space, and the dial may be large enough to be very accurate.

==Multiple dials==
Sundials are sometimes combined into multiple dials. If two or more dials that operate on different principles — say, such as an analemmatic dial and a horizontal or vertical dial — are combined, the resulting multiple dial becomes self-aligning, most of the time. Both dials need to output both time and declination.  In other words, the direction of [[true North]] need not be determined; the dials are oriented correctly when they read the same time and declination.  However, the most common forms combine dials are based on the same principle and the analemmatic does not normally output the declination of the sun, thus are not self-aligning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Roger|title=1  Conference Retrospective: Victoria BC 2015|url=http://www.sundials.org/attachments/article/289/2015%20NASS%20Conference%20Victoria.pdf|website=NASS Conferences|publisher=North American Sundial Society|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diptych (tablet) sundial===
[[File:Sundial in the form of a mandolin - Project Gutenberg eText 15050.png|thumb|170px|upright|Diptych sundial in the form of a [[lute]], c. 1612.  The gnomons-style is a string stretched between a horizontal and vertical face.  This sundial also has a small nodus (a bead on the string) that tells time on the hyperbolic ''pelikinon'', just above the date on the vertical face.]]

The '''[[diptych]]''' consisted of two small flat faces, joined by a hinge.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965), p. 112; Waugh (1973), pp. 154–155; Mayall and Mayall, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diptychs usually folded into little flat boxes suitable for a pocket. The gnomon was a string between the two faces.  When the string was tight, the two faces formed both a vertical and horizontal sundial.  These were made of white ivory, inlaid with black lacquer markings.  The gnomons were black braided silk, linen or hemp string. With a knot or bead on the string as a nodus, and the correct markings, a diptych (really any sundial large enough) can keep a calendar well-enough to plant crops. A common error describes the diptych dial as self-aligning.  This is not correct for diptych dials consisting of a horizontal and vertical dial using a string gnomon between faces, no matter the orientation of the dial faces.  Since the string gnomon is continuous, the shadows must meet at the hinge; hence, ''any'' orientation of the dial will show the same time on both dials.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh (1973), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiface dials===

A common type of multiple dial has sundials on every face of a [[Platonic solid]] (regular polyhedron), usually a [[cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohr (1965),, p. 118; Waugh (1973), pp. 155–156; Mayall and Mayall, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremely ornate sundials can be composed in this way, by applying a sundial to every surface of a solid object.

In some cases, the sundials are formed as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a cylindrical hollow aligned with the Earth's rotational axis (in which the edges play the role of styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the ''hemisphaerium'' or the ''antiboreum''. (See the History section above.)  In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to sit on a desk, whereas in others, they are large stone monuments.

A Polyhedral's dial faces can be designed to give the time for different time-zones simultaneously.

===Prismatic dials===
Prismatic dials are a special case of polar dials, in which the sharp edges of a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] of a concave [[polygon]] serve as the styles and the sides of the prism receive the shadow.{{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp= 181–190}}  Examples include a three-dimensional cross or star of David on gravestones.

==Unusual sundials==

===Benoy dials===
[[File:Benoy sun clock.jpg|upright|thumb|170px|left|Benoy Sun Clock showing 6:00 p.m.]]
The Benoy Dial was invented by Walter Gordon Benoy of Collingham in Nottinghamshire. Light is used to replace the shadow-edge of a gnomon. Whereas a gnomon casts a sheet of shadow, an equivalent sheet of light can be created by allowing the Sun's rays through a thin slit, reflecting them from a long, slim mirror (usually half-cylindrical), or focusing them through a [[cylindrical lens]]. For illustration, the Benoy Dial uses a cylindrical lens to create a sheet of light, which falls as a line on the dial surface. Benoy dials can be seen throughout Great Britain, such as&lt;ref name="BSSRegister"&gt;List correct as of British Sundial Register 2000. {{cite web

===Bifilar sundial===
[[File:Bifilaire.png|thumb|A bifilar dial showing the two wires]]
{{main|Bifilar sundial}}
Invented by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922, the [[bifilar sundial]] has two non-intersecting threads parallel to the dial.  Usually the second thread is [[orthogonal]] to the first.&lt;ref name="1922AN....217...81M  "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Michnik|first=H|date=1922|title=Title: Theorie einer Bifilar-Sonnenuhr|journal=Astronomische Nachrichten|volume=217|issue=5190|pages=81–90|language=German|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1922AN....217...81M/0000045.000.html|accessdate=17 December 2013|bibcode = 1922AN....217...81M|doi=10.1002/asna.19222170602}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the local solar time.

===Digital sundial===
{{Main|Digital sundial}}
A digital sundial indicates the current time with numerals formed by the sunlight striking it. Sundials of this type are installed in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich and in the Sundial Park in [[Genk]] (Belgium), and a small version is available commercially. There is a patent for this type of sundial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalsundial.com/patent.html Digital sundial]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globe dial===
The globe dial is a sphere aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, and equipped with a spherical vane.{{sfn|Rohr|1965|pp=114–115}}  Similar to sundials with a fixed axial style, a globe dial determines the time from the Sun's azimuthal angle in its apparent rotation about the earth.  This angle can be determined by rotating the vane to give the smallest shadow.

===Noon marks===
[[File:Greenwich Royal Observatory Noon Mark.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Noon mark]] from the [[Greenwich Royal Observatory]]. The analemma is the narrow figure-8 shape, which plots the [[equation of time]] (in degrees, not time, 1°=4 minutes) versus the altitude of the sun at noon at the sundial's location.  The altitude is measured vertically, the equation of time horizontally.]]

The simplest sundials do not give the hours, but rather note the exact moment of 12:00 noon. {{sfn|Waugh|1973| pp=18–28}}  In centuries past, such dials were used to correct mechanical clocks, which were sometimes so inaccurate as to lose or gain significant time in a single day.

In some U.S. colonial-era houses, a noon-mark can often be found carved into a floor or windowsill.{{sfn|Mayall|Mayall|1938|p=26}}  Such marks indicate local noon, and provide a simple and accurate time reference for households that do not possess accurate clocks. In modern times, in some Asian countries,&lt;!-- Date and location needed--&gt; post offices set their clocks from a precision noon-mark.  These in turn provide the times for the rest of the society.  The typical noon-mark sundial was a lens set above an [[analemma]]tic plate.  The plate has an engraved figure-eight shape, which corresponds to plotting the [[equation of time]] (described above) versus the solar declination.  When the edge of the sun's image touches the part of the shape for the current month, this indicates that it is 12:00 noon.

===Sundial cannon===
{{main|Sundial cannon}}
A [[sundial cannon]], sometimes called a 'meridian cannon', is a specialized sundial that is designed to create an 'audible noonmark', by automatically igniting a quantity of gunpowder at noon.  These were novelties rather than precision sundials, sometimes installed in parks in Europe mainly in the late 18th or early 19th century. They typically consist of a horizontal sundial, which has in addition to a [[gnomon]] a suitably mounted [[lens (optics)|lens]], set to focus the rays of the sun at exactly noon on the firing pan of a miniature [[cannon]] loaded with [[gunpowder]] (but no [[round shot|ball]]).  To function properly the position and angle of the lens must be adjusted seasonally.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Meridian lines==
A horizontal line aligned on a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] with a [[gnomon]] facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the [[Tropical year|solar year]]. Examples are the [[Francesco Bianchini|Bianchini]] meridian line in [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]] in [[Rome]], and the [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] line in [[San Petronio Basilica#Cassini's Meridian Line|San Petronio Basilica]] at [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="AO-merid"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manaugh|first1=Geoff|title=Why Catholics Built Secret Astronomical Features Into Churches to Help Save Souls|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/catholics-built-secret-astronomical-features-into-churches-to-help-save-souls|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=23 November 2016|date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundial mottoes==
{{Further|List of sundial mottoes}}
The association of sundials with time has inspired their designers over the centuries to display mottoes as part of the design. Often these cast the device in the role of ''[[memento mori]]'', inviting the observer to reflect on the transience of the world and the inevitability of death. "Do not kill time, for it will surely kill thee." Other mottoes are more whimsical: "I count only the sunny hours," and "I am a sundial and I make a botch / of what is done far better by a watch." Collections of sundial mottoes have often been published through the centuries.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Using a sundial as a compass==
{{see also|Compass#Sun compass}}
If a horizontal-plate sundial is made for the latitude in which it is being used, and if it is mounted with its plate horizontal and its gnomon pointing to the [[celestial pole]] that is above the horizon, then it shows the correct time in [[apparent solar time]]. Conversely, if the directions of the [[cardinal point]]s are initially unknown, but the sundial is aligned so it shows the correct apparent solar time as calculated from the reading of a [[clock]], its gnomon shows the direction of [[True North]] or South, allowing the sundial to be used as a compass. The sundial can be placed on a horizontal surface, and rotated about a vertical axis until it shows the correct time. The gnomon will then be pointing to the North, in the [[northern hemisphere]], or to the South in the southern hemisphere. This method is much more accurate than using a watch as a compass (see [[Cardinal direction#Watch face]]) and can be used in places where the [[magnetic declination]] is large, making a [[magnetic compass]] unreliable. An alternative method uses two sundials of different designs. (See [[#Multiple dials]], above.) The dials are attached to and aligned with each other, and are oriented so they show the same time. This allows the directions of the cardinal points and the apparent solar time to be determined simultaneously, without requiring a clock.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

[[File:Water spigot.jpg|right|thumb|Exterior spigot (also known as a "shut-off valve", "hose hydrant", "hose bib", or "silcock")]]

[[File:Water tap two way.jpg|thumb|Two way water tap used in bathrooms]]
A '''tap''' (also '''spigot''' or '''faucet''': see [[#Nomenclature|usage variations]]) is a [[valve]] controlling the release of a [[liquid]] or [[gas]].

==Nomenclature==

===British Isles===
* '''Tap''' is used in the [[British Isles]] and most of the [[Commonwealth]] for any everyday type of valve, particularly the fittings that control water supply to [[bathtub]]s and [[sink]]s.

===United States===
* '''Faucet''' is the most common term in the US, similar in use to "tap" in British English.
* '''Spigot''' is used by professionals in the trade (such as plumbers), and typically refers to an outdoor fixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spigot|title=Spigot - Definition of spigot by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Silcock''' (and '''sillcock'''), same as "spigot", referring to a "cock" (as in [[stopcock]] and [[petcock]]) that penetrates a foundation [[sill plate|sill]].
* '''Bib''' ('''bibcock''', and '''hose bib'''), same as "spigot".
* '''Wall hydrant''', same as "spigot"{{cn|date=May 2018}}
* '''Tap''' generally refers to a  [[beer tap]], though also appears as a descriptor in "[[tap water]]" (i.e. water purified for domestic use).

==Types==

===Liquid===
[[File:Plastic_Tap_Valve.JPG|thumb|right|Plastic taps are widely used in India for their low cost.]]

Water for baths, sinks and basins can be provided by separate hot and cold taps; this arrangement is common in older installations, particularly in public washrooms/lavatories and utility rooms/laundries. In kitchens and bathrooms, '''mixer taps''' are commonly used. In this case, hot and cold water from the two valves is mixed before reaching the outlet, allowing the water to emerge at any temperature between that of the hot and cold water supplies. Mixer taps were invented by Thomas Campbell of [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], and patented in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Theriault, ''Great Maritime Inventions 1833–1950'', Goose Lane, 2001, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:American Water Tap.jpg|thumb|A North American style [[thermostatic mixing valve|mixing valve]] uses a center handle to control both water flow and temperature (increased by clockwise rotation).  Below it is a lever controlling a diverter, sending flow to the [[bathtub]] when positioned to the left, the [[shower]] to the right.]]
For baths and showers, mixer taps frequently incorporate some sort of [[Pressure balanced valve|pressure balancing]] feature so that the hot/cold mixture ratio will not be affected by transient changes in the pressure of one or other of the supplies. This helps avoid [[Burn (injury)#Scald|scalding]] or uncomfortable chilling as other water loads occur (such as the flushing of a toilet).
{{anchor|immutable link from Valve}}Rather than two separate valves, mixer taps frequently use a single, more complex, valve controlled by a single handle ('''single handle mixer'''). The handle moves up and down to control the amount of water flow and from side to side to control the temperature of the water. Especially for baths and showers, the latest designs are [[thermostatic mixing valve]]s that do this using a built-in [[thermostat]], and can be mechanical or electronic. There are also faucets with color LEDs to show the temperature of the water.

If separate taps are fitted, it may not be immediately clear which tap is hot and which is cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kitchenote.com/kitchen-faucet-functions/|title=Kitchen Faucet Functions By Kitchen Note}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hot tap generally has a red indicator while the cold tap generally has a blue or green indicator. In the United States, the taps are frequently also labeled with an "H" or "C". In countries with [[Romance languages]], the letters "C" for hot and "F" for cold are used (from French "chaud"/Italian "caldo"/Spanish "caliente" (hot) and French "froid"/Italian "freddo"/Spanish "frio" (cold)). This can create confusion for English-speaking visitors. Mixer taps may have a red-blue stripe or arrows indicating which side will give hot and which cold.

In most countries, there is a standard arrangement of hot/cold taps. For example, in the United States and many other countries, the hot tap is on the left by [[building code]] requirements. Many installations exist where this standard has been ignored (called "crossed connections" by plumbers). Mis-assembly of some single-valve mixer taps will exchange hot and cold even if the fixture has been plumbed correctly.

[[File:Tap in Fužine castles yard.jpg|thumb|right|Old metal taps were often part of decoration as this one in Fužine castle backyard, [[Slovenia]].]]
Most handles in homes are fastened to the valve shafts with screws, but on many commercial and industrial applications they are fitted with a removable key called a "loose key", "water key", or "[[wrench#sillcock key|sillcock key]]", which has a square peg and a square-ended key to turn off and on the water; the "loose key" can be removed to prevent vandals from turning on the water.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Before the "loose key" was invented it was common for some landlords or caretakers to take off the handle of a tap, which had teeth that would meet up with the [[gears]] on the valve shaft. This tooth and cog system is still used on most modern taps. "Loose keys" may also be found outside homes to prevent passers-by from using them.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Taps are normally connected to the water supply by means of a "swivel tap connector", which is attached to the end of the water pipe using a soldered or compression fitting, and has a large nut to screw onto the threaded "tail" of the tap, which hangs down underneath the bath, basin or sink.  A fibre washer (which expands when wet, aiding the seal) is used between the connector and the tap tail.  Tap tails are normally {{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;" or 12&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter for sinks and {{frac|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;" or 19&amp;nbsp;mm for baths, although continental Europe sometimes uses a {{frac|3|8}}&amp;nbsp;" (still imperial) size.  The same connection method is used for a [[ballcock]].

The term ''tap'' is widely used to describe the valve used to dispense [[draft beer]] from a [[keg]], whether gravity feed or pressurized.

===Gas===
[[File:Gas taps.jpg|thumb|Gas taps]]
A '''gas tap''' is a specific form of [[ball valve]] used in residential, commercial, and laboratory applications for coarse control of the release of [[fuel gas]]es (such as [[natural gas]], [[coal gas]], and [[syngas]]). Like all ball valves its handle will parallel the gas line when open and be perpendicular when closed, making for easy visual identification of its status.

==Physics==
Water and gas taps have adjustable flow: [[gate valve]]s are more progressive; [[ball valve]]s more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a valve knob or lever adjusts flow by varying the [[aperture]] of the control device in the valve assembly.  The result when opened in any degree is a [[choked flow]].  Its rate is independent of the [[viscosity]] or [[temperature]] of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on the supply [[pressure]], so that flow rate is stable at a given setting.  At intermediate flow settings the pressure at the valve restriction drops nearly to zero from the [[Venturi effect]]; in water taps, this causes the water to [[boiling point|boil]] momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction.  Bubbles of cool [[water vapor]] form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound.  At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, [[parasitic drag]] in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes quiet.

==Mechanisms==
[[Image:tap.png|thumb|Tap mechanism]]
The first screw-down tap mechanism was patented and manufactured by the [[Rotherham]] brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845.  Most older taps use a soft [[rubber]] or [[neoprene]] [[Washer (mechanical)|washer]] which is screwed down onto a valve seat in order to stop the flow. This is called a "[[globe valve]]" in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the valve seat are subject to wear (and for the seat, also [[corrosion]]) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the valve seat resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.

Also, the tortuous S-shaped path the water is forced to follow offers a significant obstruction to the flow. For high pressure domestic water systems this does not matter, but for low pressure systems where flow rate is important, such as a shower fed by a storage tank, a "stop tap" or, in engineering terms, a "[[gate valve]]" is preferred.

Gate valves use a metal disc the same diameter as the pipe which is screwed into place perpendicularly to the flow, cutting it off.  There is no resistance to flow when the tap is fully open, but this type of tap rarely gives a perfect seal when closed.  In the UK this type of tap normally has a wheel-shaped handle rather than a crutch or capstan handle.

Cone valves or [[ball valve]]s are another alternative. These are commonly found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They can be identified by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle is in line with the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A cone valve consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a ''taper-plug cock''. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.

Hands free [[infrared]] proximity sensors are replacing the standard valve. Thermostatically controlled electronic dual-purpose mixing or diverting valves are used within industrial applications to automatically provide liquids as required.

Foot controlled valves are installed within laboratory and healthcare/hospitals, as well as in industrial settings where extremely dirty hands operating taps might leave residues on them.

Modern taps often have [[faucet aerator|aerators]] at the tip to help save water and reduce splashes.  Without an aerator, water usually flows out of the tap in one big stream.  An aerator spreads the water flow into many small droplets.

[[File:Undercut Sand Cast Shower Mixer for a shower or bath Tap.jpg|thumb|Cross section of a shower tap]]Modern bathroom and kitchen taps often use [[ceramic]] or [[plastic]] surfaces sliding against other [[Spring (device)|spring]]-loaded ceramic surfaces or plastic washers. These tend to require far less maintenance than traditional globe valves and when maintenance is required, the entire interior of the valve is usually replaced, often as a single pre-assembled ''cartridge''.

Of three manufacturers in North America, [[Moen (company)|Moen]] and [[American Standard Brands|American Standard]] use cartridges (Moen's being O-ring based, American Standard's being ceramic), while [[Delta Faucet|Delta]] uses rubber seats facing the cartridges. Each design has its advantages: Moen cartridges tend to be easiest to find, American Standard cartridges have nearly infinite lifespan in sediment-free municipal water, and Delta's rubber seats tend to be most forgiving of sediment in well water.

===Backflow prevention===
Most US jurisdictions now require bibcocks to have a [[vacuum breaker]] or [[Backflow prevention device|backflow preventer]], so that water cannot return through the bibcock from the hose. This prevents contamination of the building or public water system should there be a pressure drop. In the UK, water regulations require a [[double check valve]]; this is often incorporated within the body of the tap itself.

'''The Hillside Group''' is an educational [[nonprofit organization]] founded in August 1993&lt;ref&gt;http://hillside.net/home/history&lt;/ref&gt; to help [[software developer]]s  analyze and document common development and design problems as [[software design pattern]]s. The Hillside Group supports the patterns community through sponsorship of the [[Pattern Languages of Programs]] conferences.&lt;ref&gt;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HillsideGroup&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In August 1993, Kent Beck and Grady Booch sponsored a mountain retreat in Colorado where a group converged on foundations for software patterns. Ward Cunningham, Ralph Johnson, Ken Auer, Hal Hildebrand, Grady Booch, Kent Beck and Jim Coplien struggled with Alexander's ideas and our own experiences to forge a marriage of objects and patterns. The Group agreed that we were ready to build on Erich Gamma's foundation work studying object-oriented patterns, to use patterns in a generative way in the sense that Christopher Alexander uses patterns for urban planning and building architecture. We then used the term ''generative'' to mean ''creational'' to distinguish them from ''Gamma patterns'' that captured observations. The Group was meeting on the side of a hill when all this occurred, hence the name.&lt;ref&gt;http://hillside.net/home/history&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the Hillside Group has been incorporated as an educational non-profit. It currently sponsors and helps run various PLoP ([[Pattern Languages of Programming]]) conferences&lt;ref&gt;http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/patterns.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as [http://www.hillside.net/guruplop/ GuruPLoP], [http://www.hillside.net/plop/ PLoP], [http://www.europlop.net/ EuroPlop], [http://hillside.net/chiliplop/ ChiliPlop], [http://www.hillside.net/guruplop/ GuruPLoP], [http://patterns-wg.fuka.info.waseda.ac.jp/asianplop/ Asian PLoP], [http://www.scrumplop.org/ Scrum PLoP], [http://www.vikingplop.org/ Viking PLoP] and [http://www.dimap.ufrn.br/sugarloafplop2012/ Sugarloaf PLoP].

The [[United States Armed Forces]] uses a number of terms to define the magnitude and extent of nuclear incidents.

==Origin==
[[United States Department of Defense]] directive 5230.16, ''Nuclear Accident and Incident Public Affairs (PA) Guidance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/523016.htm|title=DoD Directive 5230.16, "Nuclear Accident and Incident Public Affairs (PA) Guidance", 12/20/1993|publisher=www.dtic.mil|accessdate=2010-02-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107104453/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/html/523016.htm|archivedate=7 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Manual 3150.03B ''Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident Reporting'', and the [[United States Air Force]] Operation Reporting System, as set out in Air Force Instruction 10-206&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/|title=Air Force E-Publishing - Home|publisher=www.e-publishing.af.mil|accessdate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; detail a number of terms for reporting nuclear incidents internally and externally (including in press releases). They are used by the United States of America, and are neither NATO nor global standards.

==Terminology==

===Pinnacle===
''Pinnacle'' is a [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] OPREP-3 (Operational Event/Incident Report) reporting flagword used in the United States [[National Command Authority]] structure. The term "Pinnacle" denotes an incident of interest to the [[Major Command]]s, Department of Defense and National Command Authority, in that it:
* Generates a higher level of military action
* Causes a national reaction
* Affects international relationships
* Causes immediate widespread coverage in news media
* Is clearly against the national interest
* Affects current national policy

All of the following reporting terms are classified ''Pinnacle'', with the exception of ''Bent Spear'', ''Faded Giant'' and ''Dull Sword''. AFI 10-206 notes that the flagword ''Pinnacle'' may be added to ''Bent Spear'' or ''Faded Giant'' to expedite reporting to the [[National Military Command Center]] (NMCC).&lt;ref name="afi10206"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/afmc/publication/afi10-206_afmcsup/afi10-206_afmcsup.pdf|title=Air Force Instruction 10-206|date=11 June 2014|publisher=United States Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bent Spear===
''Bent Spear'' refers to incidents involving nuclear weapons, warheads, components or vehicles transporting nuclear material that are of significant interest but are not categorized as ''Pinnacle - Nucflash'' or ''Pinnacle - Broken Arrow''. ''Bent Spear'' incidents include violations or breaches of handling and security regulations.

An example of a ''Bent Spear'' incident occurred on [[2007 United States Air Force nuclear weapons incident|the August 2007 flight]] of a B-52 bomber from [[Minot Air Force Base|Minot AFB]] to [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale AFB]] which mistakenly carried six cruise missiles with live nuclear warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2007/09/23/ST2007092300048.html|title=Missteps in the Bunker - washingtonpost.com|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2010-02-05| first1=Joby|last1=Warrick|first2=Walter|last2=Pincus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broken Arrow===
''Broken Arrow'' refers to an accidental event that involves nuclear weapons, warheads or components that does not create a risk of nuclear war. These include:
* Accidental or unexplained [[nuclear detonation]]
* Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon
* [[Radioactive contamination]]
* Loss in transit of nuclear asset with or without its carrying vehicle
* Jettisoning of a nuclear weapon or nuclear component
* Public hazard, actual or implied

==== Broken Arrow incidents ====
{{Main|List of military nuclear accidents}}
{{As of|2013|September}}, the US Department of Defense has officially recognized 32 "Broken Arrow" incidents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/14/nuclear-weapons-accident-waiting-to-happen Nuclear weapons: an accident waiting to happen] 2013Sep14&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of these events include:

*[[1950 British Columbia B-36 crash]]
*[[1956 B-47 disappearance]]
*[[1958 Mars Bluff B-47 nuclear weapon loss incident]]
*[[1958 Tybee Island mid-air collision]]
*[[1961 Yuba City B-52 crash]]
*[[1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash]]
*[[1964 Savage Mountain B-52 crash]]
*[[1964 Bunker Hill AFB runway accident]]
*[[1965 Philippine Sea A-4 incident]]
*[[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author=|title=Palomares Nuclear Weapons Accident: Revised Dose Evaluation Report|date=April 2001|publisher=Office of the Surgeon General, United States Air Force|location=Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C.|url=http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/latestnews/palomares_body.pdf|accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]]
*[[1980 Damascus Titan missile explosion]], Arkansas

===Nucflash===
''Nucflash'' refers to detonation or possible detonation of a nuclear weapon which creates a risk of an outbreak of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Events which may be classified ''Pinnacle - Nucflash'' include:
* Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained nuclear detonation or possible detonation.
* Accidental or unauthorized launch of a nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable missile in the direction of, or having the capability to reach, another nuclear-capable country.
* Unauthorized flight of, or deviation from an approved flight plan by, a nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of another nuclear-capable country.
* Detection of unidentified objects by a missile warning system or interference (experienced by such a system or related communications) that appears threatening and could create a risk of nuclear war.

This term is a report that has the highest precedence in the OPREP-3 reporting structure. All other reporting terms such as ''Broken Arrow'', ''Empty Quiver'', etc., while very important, are secondary to this report.&lt;ref name="afi10206"/&gt;

===Emergency Disablement===
''Emergency Disablement'' refers to operations involving the emergency destruction of nuclear weapons.

===Emergency Evacuation===
''Emergency Evacuation'' refers to operations involving the emergency evacuation of nuclear weapons.

===Empty Quiver===
''Empty Quiver'' refers to the seizure, theft, or loss of a functioning nuclear weapon.

===Faded Giant===
''Faded Giant'' refers to an event involving a military [[Nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]] or other radiological accident not involving nuclear weapons.

===Dull Sword===
''Dull Sword'' is the term that describes reports of minor incidents involving nuclear weapons, components or systems, or which could impair their deployments. This could include actions involving vehicles capable of carrying nuclear weapons but with no nuclear weapons on board at the time of the accident. This also is used to report damage or deficiencies with equipment, tools, or diagnostic testers that are designed for use on nuclear weapons or the nuclear weapon release systems of nuclear-capable aircraft.

[[File:USRP1.jpg|thumb|A rev 3 USRP1 platform, serial #140, with an attached TVRX daughterboard]]

'''Universal Software Radio Peripheral''' ('''USRP''') is a range of [[software-defined radio]]s designed and sold by Ettus Research and its parent company, [[National Instruments]]. Developed by a team led by [[Matt Ettus]], the USRP product family is intended to be a comparatively inexpensive hardware platform for software radio, and is commonly used by research labs, universities, and hobbyists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Quinn Norton |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/06/70933 |title=GNU Radio Opens an Unseen World |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most USRPs connect to a host computer through a high-speed link, which the host-based software uses to control the USRP hardware and transmit/receive data. Some USRP models also integrate the general functionality of a host computer with an [[embedded processor]] that allows the USRP device to operate in a stand-alone fashion.

The USRP family was designed for accessibility, and many of the products are [[open source hardware]]. The board schematics for select USRP models are freely available for download; all USRP products are controlled with the open source UHD driver, which is [[free and open source software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ettus.com/sdr-software/detail/usrp-hardware-driver |title=UHD Start |publisher=Ettus Research LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; USRPs are commonly used with the [[GNU Radio]] software suite to create complex software-defined radio systems.

== Design ==

The USRP product family includes a variety of models that use a similar architecture. A motherboard provides the following subsystems: clock generation and synchronization, [[FPGA]], [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADCs]], [[Digital-to-analog converter|DACs]], host processor interface, and power regulation. These are the basic components that are required for baseband processing of signals. A modular front-end, called a daughterboard, is used for analog operations such as up/down-conversion, filtering, and other signal conditioning. This modularity permits the USRP to serve applications that operate between DC and 6&amp;nbsp;GHz.

In stock configuration the [[FPGA]] performs several [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] operations, which ultimately provide translation from real signals in the analog domain to lower-rate, complex, baseband signals in the digital domain. In most use-cases, these complex samples are transferred to/from applications running on a host processor, which perform DSP operations. The code for the FPGA is open-source and can be modified to allow high-speed, low-latency operations to occur in the FPGA.

== Software ==

The USRP hardware driver (UHD) is the device driver provided by Ettus Research for use with the USRP product family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ettus.com/downloads&lt;/ref&gt; It supports Linux, MacOS, and Windows platforms. Several frameworks including GNU Radio, LabVIEW, [[MATLAB]] and Simulink use UHD. The functionality provided by UHD can also be accessed directly with the UHD API, which provides native support for C++. Any other language that can import C++ functions can also use UHD. This is accomplished in Python through SWIG, for example.

UHD provides portability across the USRP product family. Applications developed for a specific USRP model will support other USRP models if proper consideration is given to sample rates and other parameters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ettus.com/sdr-software/detail/usrp-hardware-driver]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several software frameworks support UHD:

* [[GNU Radio]] is a Free/Libre toolkit that can be used to develop software-defined radios. This framework uses a combination of C++ and Python to optimize DSP performance while providing an easy-to-use application programming environment. [http://www.joshknows.com/grc GNU Radio Companion] is a graphical programming environment provided with GNU Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.ettus.com/redmine/ettus/projects/uhd/wiki/GNU_Radio_UHD GNU Radio + UHD]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Instruments sells the [http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/211405 NI USRP 292x] series, which is functionally equivalent to the Ettus Research USRP N210. NI also offers LabVIEW support for this device with the NI-USRP Driver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joule.ni.com/nidu/cds/view/p/id/2679/lang/en NI-USRP Driver]&lt;/ref&gt;
* USRP N210 and USRP2 are supported by [[MATLAB]] and [[Simulink]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/sdr/usrp.html MATLAB and Simulink]&lt;/ref&gt; This package includes plug-ins and several examples for use with both the devices.
* [[OpenLTE]] is an open source implementation of the 3GPP LTE specifications as a [[Software-defined radio|SDR]].&lt;ref&gt;[[OpenLTE]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}
* Many users develop with their own, custom frameworks. In this case, the USRP device can be accessed with the UHD API.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.ettus.com/uhd_docs/doxygen/html/namespaces.html UHD API]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples provided with UHD that show how to use the API.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.ettus.com/redmine/ettus/projects/uhd/repository/revisions/master/show/host/examples&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

=== Networked series ===

The USRP N200 and USRP N210 are high-performance USRP devices that provide higher dynamic range and higher bandwidth than the bus series. Using a [[Gigabit Ethernet]] interface, the devices in the Networked Series can transfer up to 50 MS/s of complex, baseband samples to/from the host. This series uses a dual, 14-bit, 100 MS/s ADC and dual 16-bit, 400 MS/s DAC. This series also provides a [[MIMO]] expansion port which can be used to synchronize two devices from this series. This is the recommended solution for MIMO systems.

=== Bus series ===

All products in Ettus Research Bus Series use a [[USB 2.0]] or [[USB 3.0]] interface to transfer samples to and from the host computer. These are designed for applications that do not require the higher bandwidth and dynamic range provided by the Network Series(USRP N200 and USRP N210).

=== Embedded series ===

The Embedded Series combines the same functionality of other USRP devices with an [[OMAP 3]] embedded processor. The E310, released in November 2014, utilizes the [[Zynq]] [[System on a chip|SoC]] platform and the Analog Devices AD9361 RFIC for a very compact, embedded USRP. The devices in this family do not need to be connected to an external PC for operation. The Embedded Series is designed for applications that require stand-alone operation.

=== Discontinued models ===

The USRP2 was developed after the USRP and was first made available in September 2008. It has reached end of life and has been replaced by the USRP N200 and USRP N210. The USRP2 was not intended to replace the original USRP, which continued to be sold in parallel to the USRP2.

== Daughterboard modules ==
[[File:Simple RXTX daughterboards.JPG|thumb|Basic RX and Basic TX daughterboards]]

The USRP family features a modular architecture with interchangeable daughterboard modules that serve as the RF front end. Several classes of daughterboard modules exist: Receivers, Transmitters and Transceivers.
* Transmitter daughterboard modules can modulate an output signal to a higher frequency.
* Receiver daughterboard modules can acquire an RF signal and convert it to baseband.
* Transceiver daughterboard modules combine the functionality of a Transmitter and Receiver.

== Applications ==

The '''universal nut sheller''' ('''UNS'''; formerly called the '''Malian peanut sheller''') is a simple hand-operated machine capable of [[wikt:shelling|shelling]] {{convert|50|kg}} of raw, sun-dried [[peanut]]s per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

It requires less than $10 USD in materials to make, and is made of [[concrete]] poured into two simple [[fibreglass]] molds, some metal parts, one wrench, and any piece of rock or wood that can serve as a hammer. It accepts a wide range of nut sizes without adjustment. Operators can make necessary adjustments quickly and easily. It is estimated that one Universal Nut Sheller will serve the needs of a village of 2,000 people. The life expectancy of the machine is around 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coastal Carolina Returned Peace Corps Volunteers promote Malian Peanut Sheller|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/2629/1009178.html|website=Peace Corps Online|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Full Belly Project]] is working to establish local, sustainable businesses that manufacture and distribute [[Appropriate technology|appropriate technologies]] such as the Universal Nut Sheller.

== History ==

In 2001 [[Jock Brandis]] traveled to [[Mali]] to fix a small village's water treatment system. While there he &lt;!--came across--&gt;met a woman who informed him that it would be of great service to her village if he could find an affordable [[peanut]] sheller for them. Upon returning to the [[United States]] he contacted peanut authority Dr. Tim Williams of UGA, who told Brandis of a Bulgarian peanut shelling design. Jock adapted the design with help from a friend, Wes Perry. Jock went through several iterations of a redesign and one year later he completed the  machine which is now called the Universal Nut Sheller.

In 2003 Brandis teamed up with a group of returned [[Peace Corps]] volunteers from Wilmington, NC to form the Full Belly Project, dedicated to designing and distributing unique appropriate technologies in developing countries.

== Operation ==
[[Image:Peanut sheller.png|thumb|Diagram of the shelling machine]]

The user loads the desired crop in the space at the top. The user turns the handle, which rotates the rotor continuously.  This movement facilitates the nuts falling down the gradually narrowing gap. The shell of each nut is broken at the point where the gap is sufficiently narrow and the rotor motion causes sufficient friction to crack open the shell.  The adjustable minimum width of the gap allows a range of nut sizes to be shelled. The kernels and shell fragments fall into a basket and are later separated by [[winnowing]].  The device works best for ''[[Jatropha curcas]]'', [[shea tree|shea]], dried [[coffee]], and [[peanut]]s (ground nuts).{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Full Belly Project]] has developed a pedal powered agricultural processor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullbellyproject.org/gallery.php?id=10 |title=Pedal Powered Agricultural Processor |publisher=Fullbellyproject.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; which places the universal nut sheller onto a pedaling chassis. In addition to the shelling method described, the pedaling apparatus is connected to a fan. The fan automatically winnows the harvest (separates the shells from the nuts).  The pedal powered versions are capable of shelling the same variety of crops as the hand crank powered versions.  The processor also provides access for the winnowing section to be used independently from the sheller.  This allows winnowing of crops that are not shelled, including [[rice]], [[maize]], and [[sorghum]].

== Problems ==

The universal nut sheller has been less than successful in [[Ghana]]. First hand accounts relate almost universal breakage. Users can mitigate this breakage by pouring the nuts through initially at very broad settings and only later at finer settings, this practice does not eliminate the breakage and destroys the efficiency aspect. Groundnut shelling tends to be a social activity everyone engages in during their down time and there is rarely a need for a peanut sheller.

The Universal Nut Sheller proved incapable of shelling shea nuts in a manner useful for shea butter extraction for the shea nuts of Ghana.  However, there are reports that it works for shea nuts from trees in [[Uganda]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The cost also proved a significant barrier.  It simply cost far more to produce (even excepting the cost of the mold, transport of materials to the village, travel to the nearest town to find someone capable of welding the metal parts, etc.) than individual growers were able to pay. However, growers unions who made the investment have been successful. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The '''VideoNow''' is a portable video player produced by [[Hasbro]] and released by their subsidiary [[Tiger Electronics]] in 2003. The systems use discs called PVDs (which stands for Personal Video Disc), which can store about 30 minutes (half an hour) of video, the length of an average TV show with commercials (a typical TV episode is about 20–23 minutes without them), so each PVD contains only one episode, with trailers at the end to use the leftover time on most PVDs, including Nickelodeon PVDs. Video data is stored on the left audio channel with audio on the right channel, thus making it impossible to achieve stereo sound on the system, which only plays mono. The video plays at about 15 frames per second. Most of the shows were from [[Nickelodeon]], such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'',&lt;ref name="ForgottenMedia"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=8nP1ud6YLaI |title=Forgotten Media: VideoNow |date=2011-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later they released shows from [[Cartoon Network]], such as ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' and ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]''. A small handful of movies were also released on the system, but due to the limited space on a PVD, said movies would have to be released on at least three discs, depending on the length of said film. 
 
[[Hasbro]] also produced editing software for creating custom VideoNow Color PVDs called the VideoNow Media Wizard in 2005, which came with blank PVD media.
A number of unofficial solutions are available for creating the oddly-formatted VideoNow files, including a [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] for the popular video processing program [[Virtual Dub]]. The files can then be burned to a CD-R using standard CD burning software, and the disc cut down to the required size.

As the VideoNow Color does not accept standard 8&amp;nbsp;cm mini-CDs, some creative users have resorted to cutting down standard 12&amp;nbsp;cm CD-R discs, though not without problems. [[Hasbro]] made recordable PVDs available without the Media Wizard from their online store.
However, at least one video has been posted on [[YouTube]] showing how VideoNow Color players can be easily modified to accept standard-sized CDs with a bit of cutting and gluing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMufTJyMLJ8 |title=VideoNow Color Mod Uncut Cdr |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Full-sized CDs can hold roughly 42&amp;nbsp;minutes of total video, and play with no difference in the modified player.

Because VideoNow uses video discs, and that has very little if any [[skip protection]], it is more prone to skipping if the VideoNow is touched, bumped, or shaken while playing a PVD.

==Types==


* ''VideoNow'' - The original version. Plays only black and white PVDs, and lacks a backlight,&lt;ref name="ForgottenMedia"/&gt; though a light (which is simply called the VideoNow Light) is available to make up for the lack of a backlight. The laser is, when the system is off, hidden from sight, most likely to discourage children from touching it, and moved to where it can read a disc when the system is turned on. If no disc was recognized, the laser would return. This was never done since, and a sticker saying "Never touch the lens" was put on the later models instead. Was made and released in 2003.
* ''VideoNow Color'' - The second version, the VideoNow Color is a major upgrade. It has, as the name suggests, color. It also has a backlight, Fast Forward and rewind (achieved by holding the Next and Previous Respectively), and backwards compatibility with the PVDs for the original, albeit noticeably cropped. This backwards compatibility (complete with cropping issue) was on every VideoNow afterwards. It's also worth noting that it has bigger PVDs than the original. Was released in 2004.
* ''VideoNow Jr.'' - The third version, this time released by [[Playskool]] around the same time of the release of the VideoNow Color in 2004. As the name suggests, it is a variation of the VideoNow Color and was designed for preschoolers. A notable feature is that the PVDs for this system are flexible. This was done to prevent small children from bending—and thus breaking—the discs, as it is aimed at them. 
* ''VideoNow XP'' - The fourth version. Plays in color, backlit, has a larger screen and includes game playing capabilities and controls. However, the games were either quizzes or games similar to [[Dragon's Lair]] and [[Space Ace]], suggesting that no actual gaming components, such as a CPU, essential to make other types of games (except the controls) were put into the system. Was made and released in 2005.
* ''VideoNow Color FX'' - It is simply a translucent variation of the VideoNow Color and was released in 2006. Other differences are all in the design, and include:
** The previously silver circle where the screen and buttons (excluding the eject button) were now matches the color of the body of the unit.
** Said buttons, also previously silver (again excluding the eject button), match the color of said body as well.
** The logo was slightly changed, with Color being replaced with "Color FX".

== Accessories ==
* VideoNow light: A light accessory made for the original VideoNow, as it didn’t have a backlight or its own. As the only port on the VideoNow was the headphone jack, it requires a separate AA battery, along with the two AA batteries required for the VideoNow itself. Starting with the VideoNow Color, all VideoNow models had an internal backlight, making the creation of versions of the light for them unnecessary.
* Carrying case: A specialized case made to store VideoNow and 5 PVDs in. There are 4 types, one each model. It’s worth mentioning that the carrying case for the Color has two variants, though the only difference is that the first has the VideoNow Color logo and the second had the VideoNow Color fx logo on it, since it was made for that model.
* Headphones: VideoNow-branded [[headphones]] with a standard 3.5mm audio jack. 
* VideoNow Media Wizard: Basic editing software used to make custom PVDs to play on a Color/fx, XP, and Jr.
* [[VCamNow]]: VideoNow-branded camcorder that came with a copy of the Media Wizard.
