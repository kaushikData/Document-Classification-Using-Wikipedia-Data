      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5508">[[File:ScagnosticsBase.svg|thumb|400px|Convex hull, alpha shape and minimal spanning tree of a bivariate data set.]]

In [[computational geometry]], an '''alpha shape''', or '''α-shape''', is a family of piecewise linear simple curves in the [[Euclidean plane]] associated with the shape of a finite set of points.  They were first defined by {{harvtxt|Edelsbrunner|Kirkpatrick|Seidel|1983}}.  The alpha-shape associated with a set of points is a generalization of the concept of the [[convex hull]], i.e. every convex hull is an alpha-shape but not every alpha shape is a convex hull.

== Characterization ==
For each [[real number]] ''α'', define the concept of a ''generalized disk of radius''&amp;nbsp;1/''α'' as follows:
* If ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, it is a closed [[half-plane]];
* If ''α''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, it is closed disk of radius&amp;nbsp;1/''α'';
* If ''α''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, it is the closure of the complement of a disk of radius&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1/''α''.
Then an edge of the alpha-shape is drawn between two members of the finite point set whenever there exists a generalized disk of radius&amp;nbsp;1/''α'' containing the entire point set and which has the property that the two points lie on its boundary.

If ''α''&amp;nbsp;= 0, then the alpha-shape associated with the finite point set is its ordinary convex hull.

== Alpha complex ==
Alpha shapes are closely related to alpha complexes, subcomplexes of the [[Delaunay triangulation]] of the point set.

Each edge or triangle of the [[Delaunay triangulation]] may be associated with a characteristic radius, the radius of the smallest empty circle containing the edge or triangle. For each [[real number]] ''α'', the  ''α''-complex of the given set of points is the [[simplicial complex]] formed by the set of edges and triangles whose radii are at most 1/''α''.

The union of the edges and triangles in the ''α''-complex forms a shape closely resembling the ''α''-shape; however it differs in that it has polygonal edges rather than edges formed from arcs of circles. More specifically, {{harvtxt|Edelsbrunner|1995}} showed that the two shapes are [[homotopy equivalent]]. (In this later work, Edelsbrunner used the name "''α''-shape" to refer to the union of the cells in the ''α''-complex, and instead called the related curvilinear shape an ''α''-body.)

== Examples ==
This technique can be employed to reconstruct a [[Fermi surface]] from the electronic Bloch spectral function evaluated at the [[Fermi level]], as obtained from the [[Green's function|Green function]] in a generalised ab-initio study of the problem. The Fermi surface is then defined as the set of reciprocal space points within the first [[Brillouin zone]], where the signal is highest. 
The definition has the advantage of covering also cases of various forms of disorder.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46574">In [[differential geometry]], the '''Atiyah–Singer index theorem''', proved by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Michael Atiyah|first1=Michael|last1= Atiyah|author2-link=Isadore Singer|first2=Isadore |last2=Singer|year=1963}}, states that for an [[elliptic operator|elliptic differential operator]] on a [[compact manifold]], the '''analytical index''' (related to the dimension of the space of solutions) is equal to the '''topological index''' (defined in terms of some topological data).  It includes many other theorems, such as the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], as special cases, and has applications in [[theoretical physics]].

== History ==
The index problem for elliptic differential operators was posed  by {{harvs|txt|first=Israel |last=Gel'fand|authorlink=Israel Gelfand|year=1960}}. He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of [[topological invariant]]s. Some of the motivating examples included the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] and its generalization the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], and the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]]. [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]] and [[Armand Borel|Borel]] had proved the integrality of the [[Â genus]] of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the [[Dirac operator]] (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).

The Atiyah–Singer theorem was announced by {{harvtxt|Atiyah|Singer|1963}}. The proof sketched in this announcement was never published by them, though it appears in the book {{harv|Palais|1965}}. It appears also in the "Séminaire Cartan-Schwartz 1963/64" {{harv|Cartan-Schwartz|1965}} that was held in Paris simultaneously with the seminar led by Palais at Princeton. The last talk in Paris was by Atiyah on manifolds with boundary. Their first published proof {{harv|Atiyah|Singer|1968a}} replaced the [[cobordism]] theory of the first proof with [[K-theory]], and they used this to give proofs of various generalizations in the papers {{harvs|txt|last=Atiyah|last2=Singer|year1=1968a|year2=1968b|year3=1971a|year4=1971b}}.

== Notation ==
*''X'' is  a [[Compact space|compact]] smooth [[manifold]]  (without boundary).
*''E'' and ''F'' are smooth [[vector bundle]]s over ''X''.
*''D'' is an elliptic differential operator from ''E'' to ''F''. So in local coordinates it acts as a differential operator, taking smooth sections of ''E'' to smooth sections of ''F''.

==Symbol of a differential operator==
If ''D'' is a differential operator on a Euclidean space of order ''n'' in ''k'' variables

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,

then its [[Symbol of a differential operator|symbol]] is the function of 2''k'' variables

:''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,

given by dropping all terms of order less than ''n'' and replacing ∂/∂''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. So the symbol is homogeneous in the variables ''y'', of degree ''n''. The symbol is well defined even though ∂/∂''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' does not commute with ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' because we keep only the highest order terms and differential operators commute "up to lower-order terms".  The operator is called '''elliptic''' if the symbol is nonzero whenever at least one ''y'' is nonzero.

Example: The Laplace operator in ''k'' variables has symbol ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so is elliptic as this is nonzero whenever any of the ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are nonzero. The wave operator has symbol −''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is not elliptic if ''k'' ≥ 2, as the symbol vanishes for some non-zero values of the ''y''s.

The symbol of a differential operator  of order ''n'' on a smooth manifold ''X'' is defined in much the same way using local coordinate charts, and is a function on the [[cotangent bundle]] of ''X'', homogeneous of degree ''n'' on each cotangent space. (In general, differential operators transform in a rather complicated way under coordinate transforms (see [[jet bundle]]); however, the highest order terms transform like tensors so we get well defined homogeneous functions on the cotangent spaces that are independent of the choice of local charts.) More generally, the symbol of a differential operator between two vector bundles ''E'' and ''F'' is a section of the pullback of the bundle Hom(''E'', ''F'') to the cotangent space of ''X''. The differential operator is called ''elliptic'' if the element of Hom(''E&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'') is invertible for all non-zero cotangent vectors at any point ''x'' of ''X''.

A key property of elliptic operators is that they are almost invertible; this is closely related to the fact that their symbols are almost invertible.  More precisely, an elliptic operator ''D'' on a compact manifold has a (non-unique) '''[[parametrix]]''' (or '''pseudoinverse''') ''D''′ such that  ''DD′''−1 and ''D′D''−1 are both compact operators.  An important consequence is  that the kernel of ''D'' is finite-dimensional, because all eigenspaces of compact operators, other than the kernel, are finite-dimensional.  (The pseudoinverse of an elliptic differential operator is almost never a differential operator. However, it is an elliptic [[pseudodifferential operator]].)

==Analytical index==
As the elliptic differential operator ''D'' has a pseudoinverse, it is a [[Fredholm operator]]. Any Fredholm operator has an ''index'', defined as the difference between the (finite) dimension of the  [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''D'' (solutions of ''Df'' = 0), and the (finite) dimension of the [[cokernel]] of ''D'' (the constraints on the right-hand-side of an inhomogeneous equation like ''Df'' = ''g'', or equivalently the kernel of the adjoint operator). In other words,
:Index(''D'') = dim Ker(D) − dim Coker(''D'') = dim Ker(D) − dim Ker(''D*'').
This is sometimes called the '''analytical index''' of ''D''.

'''Example:''' Suppose that the manifold is the circle (thought of as '''R'''/'''Z'''), and ''D'' is the operator d/dx − λ for some complex constant λ. (This is the simplest example of an elliptic operator.) Then the kernel is the space of multiples of exp(λ''x'') if λ is an integral multiple of 2π''i'' and is 0 otherwise, and the kernel of the adjoint is a similar space with λ replaced by its complex conjugate.  So ''D'' has index 0. This example shows that the kernel and cokernel of elliptic operators can jump discontinuously as the elliptic operator varies, so there is no nice formula for their dimensions in terms of continuous topological data. However the jumps in the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel are the same, so the index, given by the difference of their dimensions, does indeed vary continuously, and can be given in terms of topological data by the index theorem.

==Topological index==
The '''topological index''' of an elliptic differential operator &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; between smooth vector bundles &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional compact manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\text{ch}(D)\text{Td}(X)[X] = \int_X \text{ch}(D)\text{Td}(X)&lt;/math&gt;

in other words the value of the top dimensional component of the mixed [[cohomology class]] &lt;math&gt;\text{ch}(D)\text{Td}(X)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[fundamental homology class]] of the manifold &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
Here,

*&lt;math&gt;\text{Td}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Todd class]] of the complexified tangent bundle of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\text{ch}(D)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1}(\text{ch}(d(p^*E,p^*F, \sigma(D)))) &lt;/math&gt;, where
**&lt;math&gt;\varphi: H^k(X;\mathbb{Q}) \to H^{n+k}(B(X)/S(X);\mathbb{Q})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Thom isomorphism]] for the sphere bundle &lt;math&gt;p:B(X)/S(X) \to X&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;\text{ch}:K(X)\otimes\mathbb{Q} \to H^*(X;\mathbb{Q})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Chern character]]
**&lt;math&gt;d(p^*E,p^*F,\sigma(D))&lt;/math&gt; is the "difference element" in &lt;math&gt;K(B(X)/S(X))&lt;/math&gt; associated to two vector bundles &lt;math&gt;p^*E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p^*F&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;B(X)&lt;/math&gt; and an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma(D)&lt;/math&gt; between them on the subspace &lt;math&gt;S(X)&lt;/math&gt;.
**&lt;math&gt;\sigma(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the symbol of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;

One can also define the topological index using only K-theory (and this alternative definition is compatible in a certain sense with the Chern-character construction above). If ''X'' is a compact submanifold of a manifold ''Y'' then there is a pushforward (or "shriek") map from K(''TX'') to K(''TY''). The topological index of an element of 
K(''TX'') is defined to be the image of this operation with ''Y'' some Euclidean space, for which K(''TY'') can be naturally identified with the integers '''Z''' (as a consequence of Bott-periodicity). This map is independent of the embedding of ''X'' in Euclidean space. Now a differential operator as above naturally defines an element of K(''TX''), and the image in '''Z''' under this map "is" the topological index.

As usual, ''D'' is an elliptic differential operator between vector bundles ''E'' and ''F'' over a compact manifold ''X''.

The ''index problem'' is the following: compute the (analytical) index of ''D'' using only the symbol ''s'' and ''topological'' data derived from the manifold and the vector bundle. The Atiyah–Singer index theorem solves this problem, and states:

:'''The analytical index of ''D'' is equal to its topological index.'''

In spite of its formidable definition, the topological index is usually straightforward to evaluate explicitly. So this makes it possible to evaluate the analytical index. (The cokernel and kernel of an elliptic operator are in general extremely hard to evaluate individually; the index theorem shows that we can usually at least evaluate their '''difference'''.) Many important invariants of a manifold (such as the signature) can be given as the index of suitable differential operators, so the index theorem allows us to evaluate these invariants in terms of topological data.

Although the analytical index is usually hard to evaluate directly, it is at least obviously an integer. The topological index is by definition a rational number, but it is usually not at all obvious from the definition that it is also integral. So the Atiyah–Singer index theorem implies some deep integrality properties, as it implies that the topological index is integral.

The index of an elliptic differential operator obviously vanishes if the operator is self adjoint. It also vanishes if the manifold ''X'' has odd dimension, though there are '''pseudodifferential''' elliptic operators whose index does not vanish in odd dimensions.

==Extensions of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem==

===Teleman index theorem {{harv|Teleman|1983}}, {{harv|Teleman|1984}}===
:'''For any abstract elliptic operator {{harv|Atiyah|1970}} on a closed, oriented, topological manifold, the analytical index equals the topological index.'''
The proof of this result goes through specific considerations, including the extension of Hodge theory on combinatorial and Lipschitz manifolds {{harv|Teleman|1980}}, {{harv|Teleman|1983}}, the extension of Atiyah–Singer's signature operator to Lipschitz manifolds {{harv|Teleman|1983}}, Kasparov's K-homology {{harv|Kasparov|1972}} and topological cobordism {{harv|Kirby|Siebenmann|1977}}.

This result shows that the index theorem is not merely a differentiable statement, but rather a topological statement.

===Connes–Donaldson–Sullivan–Teleman index theorem {{harv|Donaldson|Sullivan|1989}}, {{harv|Connes|Sullivan|Teleman|1994}}===
:'''For any quasiconformal manifold there exists a local construction of the Hirzebruch–Thom characteristic classes.'''

This theory is based on a signature  operator ''S'', defined on middle degree differential forms on even-dimensional quasiconformal manifolds (compare {{harv|Donaldson|Sullivan|1989}}).

Using topological cobordism and K-homology one may provide a full statement of an index theorem on quasiconformal manifolds (see page 678 of {{harv|Connes|Sullivan|Teleman|1994}}). The work {{harv|Connes|Sullivan|Teleman|1994}} "provides local constructions for characteristic classes based on higher dimensional relatives of the measurable Riemann mapping in dimension two and the Yang–Mills theory in dimension four."

These results constitute significant advances along the lines of Singer's program ''Prospects in Mathematics'' {{harv|Singer|1971}}. At the same time, they provide, also, an effective construction of the rational Pontrjagin classes on topological manifolds. The paper {{harv|Teleman|1985}} provides a link between Thom's original construction of the rational Pontrjagin classes {{harv|Thom|1956}} and index theory.

It is important to mention that the index formula is  a topological statement. The obstruction theories  due to Milnor, Kervaire, Kirby, Siebenmann, Sullivan, Donaldson show that only a minority of topological manifolds possess differentiable structures and these are not necessarily unique. Sullivan's result on Lipschitz and quasiconformal structures {{harv|Sullivan|1979}} shows that any topological manifold in dimension different from 4 possesses such a structure which is unique (up to isotopy close to identity).

The quasiconformal structures {{harv|Connes|Sullivan|Teleman|1994}} and more generally the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;-structures, 
''p'' &gt; ''n(n+1)/2'', 
introduced by M. Hilsum {{harv|Hilsum|1999}}, are the weakest analytical structures on topological manifolds of dimension ''n'' for which the 
index theorem is known to hold.

==Examples==

===Euler characteristic===
Suppose that ''M'' is a compact oriented manifold. If we take ''E'' to be the sum of the even exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, and ''F'' to be the sum of the odd powers, define ''D'' = ''d'' + ''d*'', considered as a map from ''E'' to ''F''.  Then the topological index of ''D'' is the [[Euler characteristic]] of the [[Hodge cohomology]] of ''M'', and the analytical index is the [[Euler class]] of the manifold. The index formula for this operator yields the [[Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem]].

===Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem===
Take ''X'' to be a [[complex manifold]] with a holomorphic vector bundle ''V''. We let the vector bundles ''E'' and ''F'' be the sums of the bundles of differential forms with coefficients in ''V'' of type (0,''i'') with ''i'' even or odd, and we let the differential operator ''D'' be the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\overline\partial + \overline\partial^*&lt;/math&gt;

restricted to ''E''. Then the analytical index of ''D'' is the [[holomorphic Euler characteristic]] of ''V'':

:index(''D'') = Σ(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; dim ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'',''V'').

The topological index of ''D'' is given by

:index(''D'') = ch(''V'')Td(''X'')[''X''],

the product of the Chern character of ''V'' and the Todd class of ''X'' evaluated on the fundamental class of ''X''.
By equating the topological and analytical indices we get the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]]. In fact we get a generalization of it to all complex manifolds: Hirzebruch's proof only worked for '''projective''' complex manifolds ''X''.

This derivation of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is more natural if we use the index theorem for elliptic complexes rather than elliptic operators. 
We can take the complex to be

:0 → ''V'' → ''V'' ⊗ Λ&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;''T*''(''X'') → ''V'' ⊗ Λ&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;''T*''(''X'')...

with the differential given by &lt;math&gt;\overline\partial&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''i'''th cohomology group is just the coherent cohomology group H&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', ''V''), so the analytical index of this complex is the holomorphic Euler characteristic Σ  (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; dim(H&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', ''V'')). As before, the topological index is ch(''V'')Td(''X'')[''X''].

===Hirzebruch signature theorem===
The [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]] states that the signature of a compact oriented manifold ''X'' of dimension 4''k'' is given by the [[L genus]] of the manifold. This follows from the Atiyah–Singer index theorem applied to the following [[signature operator]].

The bundles ''E'' and ''F'' are given by the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of the operator on the bundle of differential forms of ''X'', that acts on ''k''-forms as

:''i'' &lt;sup&gt;''k''(''k''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;

times the [[Hodge dual|Hodge * operator]]. The operator ''D'' is  the [[Hodge Laplacian]]

:&lt;math&gt;D\equiv \Delta :=(\mathbf d + \mathbf{d^*})^2&lt;/math&gt;

restricted to ''E'', where '''d''' is the Cartan [[exterior derivative]] and '''d'''* is its adjoint.

The analytic index of ''D'' is the signature of the manifold ''X'', and its topological index is the L genus of ''X'', so these are equal.

===Â genus and Rochlin's theorem===
The [[Â genus]] is a rational number defined for any manifold, but is in general not an integer. Borel and Hirzebruch showed that it is integral for spin manifolds,  and an even integer if in addition the dimension is 4 mod 8. This can be deduced from the index theorem, which implies that the Â genus for spin manifolds is the index of a Dirac operator. The extra factor of 2 in dimensions 4 mod 8 comes from the fact that in this case the kernel and cokernel of the Dirac operator have a quaternionic structure, so as complex vector spaces they have even dimensions, so the index is even.

In dimension 4 this result implies [[Rochlin's theorem]] that the signature of a 4-dimensional spin manifold is divisible by 16: this follows because in dimension 4 the Â genus is minus one eighth of the signature.

==Proof techniques==

===Pseudodifferential operators===
{{main|pseudodifferential operator}}
Pseudodifferential operators can be explained easily in the case of constant coefficient operators on Euclidean space. In this case, constant coefficient differential operators are just the Fourier transforms of multiplication by polynomials, and constant coefficient pseudodifferential operators are just the Fourier transforms of multiplication by more general functions.

Many proofs of the index theorem use pseudodifferential operators rather than differential operators. The reason for this is that for many purposes there are not enough differential operators. For example, a pseudoinverse of an elliptic differential operator of positive order is not a differential operator, but is a pseudodifferential operator. 
Also, there is a direct correspondence between data representing elements of K(B(''X''), ''S''(''X'')) (clutching functions) and symbols of elliptic pseudodifferential operators.

Pseudodifferential operators have an order, which can be any real number or even −∞, and have symbols (which are no longer polynomials on the cotangent space), and elliptic differential operators are those whose symbols are invertible for sufficiently large cotangent vectors. Most version of the index theorem can be extended from elliptic differential operators to elliptic pseudodifferential  operators.

===Cobordism===
The initial proof was based on that of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] (1954), and involved [[cobordism theory]] and [[pseudo-differential operator|pseudodifferential operator]]s.

The idea of this first proof is roughly as follows. Consider the ring generated by pairs (''X'', ''V'') where ''V'' is a smooth vector bundle on the compact smooth oriented manifold ''X'', with relations that  the sum and product of the ring on these generators are given by disjoint union and product of manifolds (with the obvious operations on the vector bundles), and any boundary of a manifold with vector bundle is 0. This is similar to the cobordism ring of oriented manifolds, except that the manifolds also have a vector bundle. The topological and analytical indices are both reinterpreted as functions from this ring to the integers. Then one checks that these two functions  are in fact both ring homomorphisms. In order to prove they are the same, it is then only necessary to check they are the same on a set of generators of this ring. Thom's cobordism theory gives a set of generators; for example, complex vector spaces with the trivial bundle together with certain bundles over even dimensional spheres. So the index theorem can be proved by checking it on these particularly simple cases.

===K-theory===
Atiyah and Singer's first published proof used [[K-theory]] rather than cobordism. If ''i'' is any inclusion of compact manifolds from ''X'' to ''Y'', they defined a 'pushforward' operation ''i''&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; on elliptic operators of ''X'' to elliptic operators of ''Y'' that preserves the index. By taking ''Y'' to be some sphere that ''X'' embeds in, this reduces the index theorem to the case of spheres. If ''Y'' is a sphere and ''X'' is some point embedded in ''Y'', then any elliptic operator on ''Y'' is the image under ''i''&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; of some elliptic operator on the point. This reduces the index theorem to the case of a point, where it is trivial.

===Heat equation===
{{harvs|txt=yes|last=Atiyah |author2-link=Raoul Bott|last2=Bott|author3-link=Vijay Kumar Patodi|last3=Patodi|year=1973}} gave a new proof of the index theorem using the [[heat equation]], see e.g. {{harvtxt|Berline|Getzler|Vergne|1992}}. 
The proof is also published in {{harv|Melrose|1993}} and {{harv|Gilkey|1994}}.

If ''D'' is a differential operator with adjoint ''D*'', then ''D*D'' and ''DD*'' are self adjoint operators whose non-zero eigenvalues have the same  multiplicities. However their zero eigenspaces may have different multiplicities, as these multiplicities are the dimensions of the kernels of ''D'' and ''D*''. Therefore, the index of ''D'' is given by 
:Index(''D'') = dim Ker(''D'') − dim Ker(''D*'') = Tr(e&lt;sup&gt;−''tD*D''&lt;/sup&gt;)  − Tr(e&lt;sup&gt;−''tDD*''&lt;/sup&gt;)
for any positive ''t''. The right hand side is given by the trace of the difference of the kernels of two heat operators. These have an asymptotic expansion for small positive ''t'', which can be used to evaluate the limit as ''t'' tends to 0, giving a proof of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.  The asymptotic expansions for small ''t'' appear very complicated, but invariant theory shows that there are huge cancellations between the terms, which makes it possible to find the leading terms explicitly. These cancellations were later explained using supersymmetry.

==Generalizations==
*The Atiyah–Singer theorem applies to elliptic [[pseudodifferential operator]]s in much the same way as for elliptic differential operators. In fact, for technical reasons most of the early proofs worked with pseudodifferential rather than differential operators: their extra flexibility made some steps of the proofs easier.
*Instead of working with an elliptic operator between two vector bundles, it is sometimes more convenient to work with an ''[[elliptic complex]]''

::0 → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ...  → ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; →0

:of vector bundles. The difference is that the symbols now form an exact sequence (off the zero section). In the case when there are just two non-zero bundles in the complex this implies that the symbol is an isomorphism off the zero section, so an elliptic complex with 2 terms is essentially the same as an elliptic operator between two vector bundles. Conversely the index theorem for an elliptic complex can easily be reduced to the case of an elliptic operator: the two vector bundles are given by the  sums of the even or odd terms of the complex, and the elliptic operator is the sum of the operators of the elliptic complex and their adjoints, restricted to the sum of the even bundles.

*If the [[manifold]] is allowed to have boundary, then some restrictions must be put on the domain of the elliptic operator in order to ensure a finite index. These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the [[signature operator]]) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, [[Michael Atiyah|Atiyah]], [[Vijay Kumar Patodi|Patodi]] and [[Isadore Singer|Singer]] introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder. This point of view is adopted in the proof of {{harvtxt|Melrose|1993}} of the [[Atiyah–Patodi–Singer index theorem]].
*Instead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space ''Y''. In this case the index is an element of the K-theory of ''Y'', rather than an integer. If the operators in the family are real, then the index lies in the real K-theory of ''Y''. This gives a little extra information, as the map from the real K-theory of ''Y'' to the complex K-theory is not always injective.
*If there is a [[group action]] of a group ''G'' on the compact manifold ''X'', commuting with the elliptic operator, then one replaces ordinary K-theory with [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].  Moreover, one gets generalizations of the [[Lefschetz fixed point theorem]], with terms coming from fixed point submanifolds of the group ''G''. See also: [[equivariant index theorem]].
*{{harvtxt|Atiyah|1976}} showed how to extend the index theorem to some non-compact manifolds, acted on by a discrete group with compact quotient. The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a [[von Neumann algebra]]; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the '''''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; index theorem''', and was used by {{harvtxt|Atiyah|Schmid|1977}} to rederive properties of the [[discrete series representation]]s of [[semisimple Lie group]]s.
*The [[Callias index theorem]] is an index theorem for a Dirac operator on a noncompact odd-dimensional space.  The Atiyah–Singer index is only defined on compact spaces, and vanishes when their dimension is odd. In 1978 [[Constantine Callias]], at the suggestion of his Ph.D. advisor [[Roman Jackiw]], used the [[chiral anomaly|axial anomaly]] to derive this index theorem on spaces equipped with a [[Hermitian matrix]] called the [[Higgs field]].  As presented in his paper [https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.cmp/1103904395  Index Theorems on Open Spaces] the index of the Dirac operator is a topological invariant which measures the winding of the Higgs field on a sphere at infinity.  If ''U'' is the unit matrix in the direction of the Higgs field, then the index is proportional to the integral of ''U''(''dU'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; over the (''n''−1)-sphere at infinity.  If ''n'' is even, it is always zero.  The topological interpretation of this invariant and its relation to the [[Hörmander index]] proposed by [[Boris Fedosov]], as generalized by [[Lars Hörmander]], was published by [[Raoul Bott]] and [[Robert Thomas Seeley]] in the article [https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.cmp/1103904396  Some Remarks on the Paper of Callias] in the same issue of [[Communications in Mathematical Physics]] as Callias' article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4246">In [[mathematics]], the '''Aubin–Lions lemma''' (or theorem) is the result in the theory of [[Sobolev space]]s of [[Banach space]]-valued functions, which provides a [[compact space|compactness]] criterion that is useful in the study of nonlinear evolutionary [[partial differential equation]]s. Typically, to prove the existence of solutions one first constructs approximate solutions (for example, by a [[Galerkin method]] or by [[Mollifiers|mollification]] of the equation), then uses the compactness lemma to show that there is a convergent subsequence of approximate solutions whose limit is a solution.

The result is named after the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]s [[Jean-Pierre Aubin]] and [[Jacques-Louis Lions]]. In the original proof by Aubin,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Aubin|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; the spaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in the statement of the lemma were assumed to be [[reflexive space|reflexive]], but this assumption was removed by Simon,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Simon|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the result is also referred to as the '''Aubin–Lions–Simon  lemma'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Boyer|Fabrie|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the lemma==

Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X'' and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be three Banach spaces with ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  Suppose that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[compactly embedded]] in ''X'' and that ''X'' is [[continuously embedded]] in ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  For 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;''p'',&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;+∞, let

:&lt;math&gt;W = \{ u \in L^p ([0, T]; X_0) | \dot{u} \in L^q ([0, T]; X_1) \}.&lt;/math&gt;

(i) If ''p'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;+∞, then the embedding of ''W'' into ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;''X'') is compact.

(ii) If ''p'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞ and ''q'' &amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp; 1, then the embedding of ''W'' into ''C''([0,&amp;nbsp;''T''];&amp;nbsp;''X'') is compact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20427">In [[transcendental number theory]], a mathematical discipline,  '''Baker's theorem''' gives a lower bound for the absolute value of linear combinations  of [[logarithm]]s of [[algebraic number]]s.  The result, proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alan Baker (mathematician)|first=Alan|last= Baker|year1=1966|year2=1967a|year3=1967b}}, subsumed many earlier results in transcendental number theory and solved a problem posed by [[Alexander Gelfond]] nearly fifteen years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;See the final paragraph of Gelfond (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;
Baker  used this to prove the transcendence of many numbers, to derive effective bounds for the solutions of some Diophantine equations, and to solve the [[class number problem]] of finding all imaginary [[quadratic field]]s with [[Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields|class number]] 1.

==History==
To simplify notation, we introduce the set ''L'' of logarithms of nonzero algebraic numbers, that is
:&lt;math&gt;L = \left \{\lambda \in \mathbf{C} : \ e^\lambda \in {\overline{\mathbf{Q}}} \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using this notation, several results in transcendental number theory become much easier to state. For example the [[Hermite–Lindemann theorem]] becomes the statement that any nonzero element of ''L'' is transcendental.

In 1934, Alexander Gelfond and [[Theodor Schneider]] independently proved the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]].  This result is usually stated as: if ''a'' is algebraic and not equal to 0 or 1, and if ''b'' is algebraic and irrational, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; is transcendental.  Equivalently, though, it says that if λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''L'' that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers.  So if λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''L'' and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; isn't zero, then the quotient λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is either a rational number or transcendental.  It can't be an algebraic irrational number like {{radic|2}}.

Although proving this result of "rational linear independence implies algebraic linear independence" for two elements of ''L'' was sufficient for his and Schneider's result, Gelfond felt that it was crucial to extend this result  to arbitrarily many elements of ''L''.  Indeed, from {{harvtxt|Gel'fond|1960|p= 177}}:
{{Quotation|&amp;hellip;one may assume &amp;hellip; that the most pressing problem in the theory of transcendental numbers is the investigation of the measures of transcendence of finite sets of logarithms of algebraic numbers.}}

This problem was solved fourteen years later by Alan Baker and has since had numerous applications not only to transcendence theory but in [[algebraic number theory]] and the study of [[Diophantine equations]] as well.  Baker received the [[Fields medal]] in 1970 for both this work and his applications of it to Diophantine equations.

==Statement==
With the above notation, Baker's theorem is a nonhomogeneous generalisation of the Gelfond–Schneider theorem.  Specifically it states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Baker's Theorem.''' If λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''L'' that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then for any algebraic numbers β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., β&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, not all zero, we have
:&lt;math&gt;|\beta_0+\beta_1\lambda_1+\cdots+\beta_n\lambda_n|&gt;H^{-C}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' is the maximum of the [[height function|heights]] of the β's and ''C'' is an [[Effective results in number theory|effectively computable]] number depending on ''n'', the λ's, and the maximum ''d'' of the degrees of the β's. (If β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero then the assumption that the λ's are linearly independent can be dropped.)  In particular this number is nonzero, so 1 and the λ's are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just as the Gelfond–Schneider theorem is equivalent to the statement about the transcendence of numbers of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, so too  Baker's theorem implies the transcendence of numbers of the form
:&lt;math&gt;a_1^{b_1}\cdots a_n^{b_n},&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are all algebraic, irrational, and 1, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent over the rationals, and the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are all algebraic and not 0 or 1.

{{harvtxt|Baker|1977}} also gave several versions with explicit constants. For example, if e&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = α&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has height at most ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 4 and all the numbers β&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; have height at most ''B'' ≥ 4 then the linear form
:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda=\beta_0+\beta_1\lambda_1+\cdots+\beta_n\lambda_n&lt;/math&gt;
is either 0 or satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; \log|\Lambda|&gt;(16nd)^{200n}\Omega(\log\Omega-\log\log A_n)(\log B+\log\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega=\log A_1 \log A_2 \cdots \log A_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the field generated by all the α's and β's over the rationals has degree at most ''d''. In the special case when β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=0 and all the β&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are rational integers, the rightmost term log Ω can be deleted.

An explicit result by Baker and [[Gisbert Wüstholz|Wüstholz]] for a linear form Λ with integer coefficients yields a lower bound of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\log\vert\Lambda\vert&gt;-C h(\alpha_1)h(\alpha_2)\cdots h(\alpha_n) \log \left (\max\{\vert\beta_1\vert,\ldots,\vert\beta_n\vert\} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

with a constant ''C''

:&lt;math&gt;C = 18(n + 1)!\cdot n^{n+1}\cdot (32d)^{n+2}\log(2nd),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is the degree of the [[number field]] generated by the α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Baker's method==
Baker's proof of his theorem is an extension of the argument given by {{harvtxt|Gel'fond|1960|loc=chapter III, section 4}}.
The main ideas of the proof are illustrated by the proof of the following qualitative version of the theorem of {{harvtxt|Baker|1966}} described by {{harvtxt|Serre|1971}}: if the numbers 2π''i'' and log ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., log ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly independent over the rational numbers, for nonzero algebraic numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then they are linearly independent over the algebraic numbers. The precise quantitative version of Bakers theory can be proved by replacing the conditions that things are zero by conditions that things are sufficiently small throughout the proof.

The main idea of Bakers proof is to construct an [[auxiliary function]] Φ(''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;) of several variables that vanishes to high order at many points of the form Φ(l,l,...,l), then repeatedly show that it vanishes to lower order at even more points of this form. Finally the fact that it vanishes (to order 1) at enough points of this form implies using [[Vandermonde determinant]]s that there is a multiplicative relation between the numbers ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Construction of the function &amp;Phi;===
Assume there is a relation
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_1\log \alpha_1+\cdots+\beta_{n-1}\log\alpha_{n-1}=\log \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;
for algebraic numbers α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., β&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; The function Φ is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1}) = \sum_{\lambda_1=0}^L\cdots \sum_{\lambda_n=0}^L p(\lambda_1\ldots,\lambda_n) \alpha_1^{(\lambda_1+\lambda_n\beta_1)z_1} \cdots\alpha_{n-1}^{(\lambda_{n-1}+\lambda_n\beta_{n-1})z_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
The integer coefficients ''p'' are chosen so that they are not all zero and Φ and  its derivatives of order at most some constant ''M'' vanish at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= ... =''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''l'', for integers ''l'' with 0≤''l''≤''h'' for some constant ''h''. This is possible because these conditions are homogeneous linear equations in the coefficients ''p'', which have a non-zero solution provided the number of unknown variables ''p'' is larger than the number of equations. The linear relation between the logs of the α's is needed to cut down the number of linear equations that have to be satisfied. Moreover, using [[Siegel's lemma]], the sizes of the coefficients ''p'' can be chosen to be not too large. The constants ''L'', ''h'', and ''M'' have to be carefully adjusted to that the next part of the proof works, and are subject to some constraints, which are roughly:
*''L'' must be somewhat smaller than ''M'' to make the argument about extra zeros below work.
*A small power of ''h'' must be larger than ''L'' to make the final step of the proof work.
*''L''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; must be larger than  about ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n−1''&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' in order that it is possible to solve for the coefficients ''p''.
The constraints can be satisfied by taking ''h'' to be sufficiently large, ''M'' to be some fixed power of ''h'', and ''L'' to be a slightly smaller power of ''h''. Baker took ''M'' to be about ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''L'' to be about ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2−1/2''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The linear relation between the logarithms of the α's is used to reduce ''L'' slightly; roughly speaking, without it the condition ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; must be larger than  about ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n−1''&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' would become ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; must be larger than  about ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''h'', which is incompatible with the condition that ''L'' is somewhat smaller than ''M''.

===Zeros of &amp;Phi;(l, ..., l)===
The next step is to show that  Φ vanishes to slightly smaller order at many more points of the form ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; =''l'' for integers ''l''. This idea was Baker's key innovation: previous work on this problem involved trying to increase the number of derivatives that vanish while keeping the number of points fixed, which does not seem to work in the multivariable case.  This is done by combining two ideas; First one shows that the derivatives at these points are quite small, by using the fact that many derivatives of Φ vanish at many nearby points. Then one shows that derivatives of Φ at this point are given by algebraic integers times known constants. If an algebraic integer has all its conjugates bounded by a known constant, then it cannot be too small unless it is zero, because the product of all conjugates of a nonzero algebraic integer is at least 1 in absolute value. Combining these two ideas implies that Φ vanishes to slightly smaller order at many more points ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ... = ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; =''l''. This part of the argument requires that Φ does not increase too rapidly; the growth of Φ depends on the size of ''L'', so requires a bound on the size of ''L'', which turns out to be roughly that ''L'' must be somewhat smaller than ''M''. More precisely, Baker showed that since Φ vanishes to order ''M'' at ''h'' consecutive integers, it also vanishes to order ''M''/2 at ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1+1/8''n''&lt;/sup&gt; consecutive integers 1, 2, 3, .... Repeating this argument ''J'' times shows that Φ vanishes to order ''M''/2&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; at ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1+''J''/8''n''&lt;/sup&gt; points, provided that ''h'' is sufficiently large and ''L'' is somewhat smaller than ''M''/2&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;.

One then takes ''J'' large enough that  ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1+''J''/8''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (''J'' larger than about 16''n'' will do if ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''L'') so that  that Φ(''l'', ..., ''l'') = 0 for all integers ''l'' with 1 ≤ ''l'' ≤ (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Completion of the proof===
The condition that Φ(''l'', ..., ''l'')=0 for all integers ''l'' with 1≤ ''l''≤ (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be written as 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{\lambda_1=0}^L\cdots \sum_{\lambda_n=0}^Lp(\lambda_1\ldots,\lambda_n)\alpha_1^{\lambda_1l}\cdots\alpha_{n}^{\lambda_{n}l} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
This consists of (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; homogeneous linear equations in the (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; unknowns ''p'', and by assumption has a non-zero solution ''p'', so the determinant of the matrix of coefficients must vanish. However this matrix is a [[Vandermonde matrix]], so  the formula for the determinant of such a matrix forces an equality two of the values
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_1^{\lambda_1}\cdots\alpha_{n}^{\lambda_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
so the numbers α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are multiplicatively dependent. Taking logs then shows that 2π''i'', log α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,log α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly dependent over the rationals.

===Extensions and generalizations===
{{harvtxt|Baker|1966}} in fact gave a quantitative version of the theorem, giving effective lower bounds for the linear form in logarithms. This is done by a similar argument, except  statements about something being zero are replaced by statements giving a small upper bound for it, and so on.

{{harvtxt|Baker|1967a}} showed how to eliminate the assumption about 2π''i'' in the theorem. This requires a modification of the final step of the proof. One shows that many derivatives of the function φ(''z'') = Φ(''z'', ..., ''z'') vanish at ''z''=0, by an argument similar to the one above. But these equations for the first (''L''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; derivatives again give a homogeneous set of linear equations for the coefficients ''p'',  so the determinant is zero, and is again a Vandermonde determinant, this time for the numbers λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;log α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;log α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. So two of these expressions must be the same which shows that log α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,log α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly dependent over the rationals.

{{harvtxt|Baker|1967b}} gave an inhomogeneous version of the theorem, showing that β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;log(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) + ... + β&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; log(α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is nonzero for nonzero algebraic numbers β&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., β&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and moreover giving an effective lower bound for it. The proof is similar to the homogeneous case: one can assume that 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta_0+\beta_1\log \alpha_1+\cdots+\beta_{n-1}\log\alpha_{n-1}=\log \alpha_n&lt;/math&gt;
and one inserts an extra variable ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; into Φ as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(z_0,\ldots,z_{n-1}) = \sum_{\lambda_0=0}^L\cdots \sum_{\lambda_n=0}^Lp(\lambda_0\ldots,\lambda_n)z_0^{\lambda_0}e^{\lambda_n\beta_0z_0}\alpha_1^{(\lambda_1+\lambda_n\beta_1)z_1}\cdots\alpha_{n-1}^{(\lambda_{n-1}+\lambda_n\beta_{n-1})z_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Corollaries==
As mentioned above, the theorem includes numerous earlier transcendence results concerning the exponential function, such as the Hermite–Lindemann theorem and Gelfond–Schneider theorem.  It is not quite as encompassing as the still unproven [[Schanuel's conjecture]], and does not imply the [[six exponentials theorem]] nor, clearly, the still open [[four exponentials conjecture]].

The main reason Gelfond desired an extension of his result was not just for a slew of new transcendental numbers.  In 1935 he used the tools he had developed to prove the [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] to derive a lower bound for the quantity
:&lt;math&gt;|\beta_1\lambda_1+\beta_2\lambda_2|&lt;/math&gt;
where β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are algebraic and λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in ''L''.&lt;ref&gt;See Gelfond (1952) and Sprindžuk (1993) for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Baker's proof gave lower bounds for quantities like the above but with arbitrarily many terms, and he could use these bounds to develop effective means of tackling Diophantine equations and to solve Gauss' [[class number problem]].

==Extensions==
Baker's theorem grants us the linear independence over the algebraic numbers of logarithms of algebraic numbers.  This is weaker than proving their [[Algebraic independence|''algebraic'' independence]].  So far no progress has been made on this problem at all.  It has been conjectured&lt;ref&gt;Waldschmidt, conjecture 1.15.&lt;/ref&gt; that if λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of ''L'' that are linearly independent over the rational numbers, then they are algebraically independent too. This is a special case of Schanuel's conjecture, but so far it remains to be proved that there even exist two algebraic numbers whose logarithms are algebraically independent.  Indeed, Baker's theorem rules out linear relations between logarithms of algebraic numbers unless there are trivial reasons for them; the next most simple case, that of ruling out [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] quadratic relations, is the still open [[four exponentials conjecture]].

Similarly, extending the result to algebraic independence but in the [[p-adic]] setting, and using the [[P-adic exponential function|''p''-adic logarithm function]], remains an open problem.  It is known that proving algebraic independence of linearly independent ''p''-adic logarithms of algebraic ''p''-adic numbers would prove [[Leopoldt's conjecture]] on the ''p''-adic ranks of units of a number field.

[[Combinatorial number theory]] deals with [[number theory|number theoretic]] problems which involve [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] ideas in their formulations or solutions. [[Paul Erdős]] is the main founder of this branch of number theory. Typical topics include [[covering system]], [[zero-sum problem]]s, various [[restricted sumset]]s, and [[arithmetic progression]]s in a set of integers. Algebraic or analytic methods are powerful in this field.

In combinatorial number theory, the '''barycentric-sum problems''' are questions that can be answered using combinatorial techniques. The context of barycentric-sum problems are the barycentric sequences.

==Example==

Let &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt; be the cyclic group of integers modulo ''n''. Let ''S'' be a sequence of elements of &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt;, where the repetition of elements is allowed. Let &lt;math&gt;|S|&lt;/math&gt; be the length of ''S''. A sequence &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq Z_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|S| \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; is barycentric or has a
barycentric-sum if it contains one element &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_ {a_i \in S} a_i=|S|a_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Informally, if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; contains one element &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt;, which is the ”average” of its terms. A barycentric sequence of length &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is called a t-barycentric sequence. Moreover, when ''S'' is a set, the term barycentric set is used instead of barycentric sequence. For example, the set {0,1,2,3,4}  &lt;math&gt;\subseteq Z_8&lt;/math&gt; is 5-barycentric with barycenter 2, however the set  {0,2,3,4,5} &lt;math&gt;\subseteq Z_8&lt;/math&gt; is not 5-barycentric. The barycentric-sum problem consist in finding the smallest integer ''t'' such that any sequence of length ''t'' contains   a ''k''-barycentric sequence for some given ''k''.The study of the existence of such t related with k and the study of barycentric constants are part of the barycentric-sum problems. It has been introduced by Ordaz,&lt;ref&gt;C. Delorme, S. González, O. Ordaz and M.T. Varela. Barycentric sequences and barycentric Ramsey numbers stars, Discrete Math. 277(2004)45–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Delorme, I. Márquez, O. Ordaz and A. Ortuño. Existence condition

On weighted sequences sums, [[Combinatorics, Probability and Computing]] 4(1995) 363–367.&lt;/ref&gt; every sequence of length &lt;math&gt;n + k - 1 &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt; contains a k-barycentric sequence. Notice that a ''k''-barycentric sequence in &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt;, with k a multiple of n, is a sequence with zero-sum. The [[zero-sum problem]] on sequences started in 1961 with the Erdős, Ginzburg and Ziv theorem: every sequence of length &lt;math&gt;2n-1&lt;/math&gt; in an [[abelian group]] of order ''n'', contains an ''n''-subsequence with zero-sum.&lt;ref&gt;Y.

Barycentric-sum problems have been defined in general for finite abelian groups. However, most of the main results obtained up to now are in &lt;math&gt;Z_n&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">'''Blanche Descartes''' was a collaborative [[pseudonym]] used by the [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]]s [[R. Leonard Brooks]], [[Arthur Harold Stone]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|Cedric Smith]], and [[W. T. Tutte]]. The four mathematicians met in 1935 as undergraduate students at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where they joined the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]] and began meeting together to work on mathematical problems. The pseudonym originated by combining the initials of the mathematicians' given names (Bill, Leonard, Arthur, and Cedric) to form ''BLAC''. This was extended to ''BLAnChe''. The surname ''Descartes'' was chosen as a play on the common phrase ''carte blanche''.&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = Cedric A.

Over 30 works were published under the name, including whimsical poetry and [[mathematical humour]], but some serious mathematical results as well. Notably, the foursome [[Mathematical proof|proved]] several [[theorem]]s in mathematical [[tessellation]]. In particular, they solved the problem of [[squaring the square]], showing that a square can be divided into smaller squares, no two of which are the same. They also discovered "Blanche's Dissection", a method of dividing a square into rectangles of equal area but different dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Blanche's Dissection|urlname=BlanchesDissection}}&lt;/ref&gt; They modelled these using abstract [[electrical network]]s, an approach that yielded not only solutions to the original problem,
but techniques with wider applications to the field of electrical networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.squaring.net/history_theory/brooks_smith_stone_tutte.html | title =

"Descartes" also published on [[graph colouring]], and Tutte used the pseudonym to publish the fourth known [[Snark (graph theory)|snark]], now called the [[Descartes snark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Descartes | first = Blanche | title = Network-colourings | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | issn = 0025-5572 | volume = 32 | issue = 299 |date=May 1948 | pages = 67–69 | jstor = 3610702}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also published the poem "Hymne to Hymen"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Descartes | first = Blanche |author2=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="720">'''Composite bar charts''' are [[bar chart]]s where each bar displays multiple data points stacked in a single row or column.  This may, for instance, take the form of uniform height bars charting a [[time series]] with internal stacked colours indicating the percentage participation of a sub-type of data.  Another example would be a time series displaying total numbers, with internal colors indicating participation in the total by sub-types.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1930">'''Computational chemical methods in [[solid-state physics]]''' follow the same approach as they do for molecules, but with two differences. First, the translational symmetry of the solid has to be utilised, and second, it is possible to use completely delocalised basis functions such as [[plane waves]] as an alternative to the molecular atom-centered [[basis set (chemistry)|basis functions]].  The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies, therefore they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

Calculations can use the [[Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] method, some [[post-Hartree&amp;ndash;Fock]] methods, particularly [[Møller&amp;ndash;Plesset perturbation theory]] to second order (MP2) and [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

:O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(n+1,1)/''P''

==Normal Cartan connection==
Any manifold equipped with a [[conformal structure]] has a canonical conformal connection called the '''normal Cartan connection'''.

==Formal definition==

A conformal connection on an ''n''-manifold ''M'' is a [[Cartan geometry]] modelled on the conformal sphere, where the latter is viewed as a homogeneous space for O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(n+1,1). In other words it is an O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(n+1,1)-bundle equipped with

* a [[reduction of structure group]] to the stabilizer of a point in the conformal sphere (a null line in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1,1&lt;/sup&gt;)
such that the [[solder form]] induced by these data is an isomorphism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6170">In [[mathematical physics]], the '''conformal symmetry''' of [[spacetime]] is expressed by an extension of the [[Poincaré group]]. The extension includes [[special conformal transformation]]s and [[dilation (affine geometry)|dilation]]s. In three spatial plus one time dimensions, conformal symmetry has 15 [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]: ten for the Poincaré group, four for special conformal transformations, and one for a dilation.

[[Harry Bateman]] and [[Ebenezer Cunningham]] were the first to study the conformal symmetry of [[Maxwell's equations]]. They called a generic expression of conformal symmetry a [[spherical wave transformation]].
 
==Generators==

The [[conformal group]] has the following [[group representation|representation]]:&lt;ref name="difrancesco"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Di Francesco |author2=Mathieu, Sénéchal |title= Conformal field theory |series= Graduate texts in contemporary physics |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-94785-3 |page= 98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp; M_{\mu\nu} \equiv i(x_\mu\partial_\nu-x_\nu\partial_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;P_\mu \equiv-i\partial_\mu \,, \\
&amp;D \equiv-ix_\mu\partial^\mu \,, \\
&amp;K_\mu \equiv i(x^2\partial_\mu-2x_\mu x_\nu\partial^\nu) \,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Lorentz group|Lorentz]] [[generating set of a group|generators]], &lt;math&gt;P_\mu&lt;/math&gt; generates [[translation (physics)|translation]]s, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; generates scaling transformations (also known as dilatations or dilations) and &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; generates the [[special conformal transformation]]s.

==Commutation relations==

The [[Commutator|commutation]] relations are as follows:&lt;ref name="difrancesco"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} &amp;[D,K_\mu]=-iK_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[D,P_\mu]=iP_\mu \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu,P_\nu]=2i (\eta_{\mu\nu}D-M_{\mu\nu}) \,, \\
&amp;[K_\mu, M_{\nu\rho}] = i ( \eta_{\mu\nu} K_{\rho} - \eta_{\mu \rho} K_\nu ) \,, \\
&amp;[P_\rho,M_{\mu\nu}] = i(\eta_{\rho\mu}P_\nu - \eta_{\rho\nu}P_\mu) \,, \\
&amp;[M_{\mu\nu},M_{\rho\sigma}] = i (\eta_{\nu\rho}M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\mu\sigma}M_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\mu\rho}M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\nu\sigma}M_{\mu\rho})\,, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
other commutators vanish. Here &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor.

Additionally, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar and &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a covariant vector under the [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

The special  conformal transformations are given by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Di Francesco |author2=Mathieu, Sénéchal |title= Conformal field theory |series= Graduate texts in contemporary physics |year= 1997 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-0-387-94785-3 |page= 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
   x^\mu \to \frac{x^\mu-a^\mu x^2}{1 - 2a\cdot x + a^2 x^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is a parameter describing the transformation.  This special conformal transformation can also be written as &lt;math&gt; x^\mu  \to x'^\mu &lt;/math&gt;, where
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{{x}'^\mu}{{x'}^2}= \frac{x^\mu}{x^2} - a^\mu,
&lt;/math&gt; 
which shows that it consists of an inversion, followed by a translation, followed by a second  inversion.

In two dimensional [[spacetime]], the transformations of the conformal group are the [[conformal geometry|conformal transformations]]. There are [[Conformal_field_theory#Two_dimensions|infinitely many]] of them.

In more than two dimensions, [[Euclidean conformal transformations]] map circles to circles, and hyperspheres to hyperspheres with a straight line considered a degenerate circle and a hyperplane a degenerate hypercircle.

In more than two [[Lorentzian dimension]]s, conformal transformations map null rays to null rays and light cones to light cones with a null hyperplane being a [[degenerate light cone]].

==Applications==

===Conformal field theory===

The largest possible{{why|date=March 2017}} global [[symmetry group]] of a non-[[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[interaction|interacting]] [[quantum field theory|field theory]] is a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of the conformal group with an [[internal group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Second-order phase transitions===
{{main|phase transitions}}

One particular application is to [[critical phenomena]] in systems with local [[interaction]]s. Fluctuations{{clarify|of what?|date=March 2017}} in such systems are conformally invariant at the critical point. That allows for classification of universality classes of phase transitions in terms of [[Conformal field theory|conformal field theories]]

{{expand section|date=March 2017}}

Conformal invariance is also present in two-dimensional turbulence at high [[Reynolds number]].

===High-energy physics===

Many theories studied in [[high-energy physics]] admit the conformal symmetry{{why|date=March 2017}}. A famous{{why|date=March 2017}} example is the [[N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory]]. Also, the [[worldsheet]] in [[string theory]] is described by a [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] coupled to the two-dimensional gravity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6374">In [[mathematical analysis]], and especially [[functional analysis]], a fundamental role is played by the space of [[continuous functions]] on a [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] with values in the [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex numbers]].  This space, denoted by ''C''(''X''), is a [[vector space]] with respect to the pointwise addition of functions and scalar multiplication by constants.  It is, moreover, a [[normed space]] with norm defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\| = \sup_{x\in X} |f(x)|,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[uniform norm]].  The uniform norm defines the [[topology]] of [[uniform convergence]] of functions on ''X''.  The space ''C''(''X'') is a [[Banach algebra]] with respect to this norm. {{harv|Rudin|1973|loc=§11.3}}

== Properties ==

* By [[Urysohn's lemma]], ''C''(''X'') [[separating set|separates points]] of ''X'': If ''x'', ''y'' &amp;isin; ''X'' and ''x'' ≠ ''y'', then there is an ''f'' &amp;isin; ''C''(''X'') such that ''f''(''x'') ≠ ''f''(''y'').
* The space ''C''(''X'') is infinite-dimensional whenever ''X'' is an infinite space (since it separates points).  Hence, in particular, it is generally not [[locally compact]].
* The [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]] gives a characterization of the [[continuous dual space]] of ''C''(''X'').  Specifically, this dual space is the space of [[Radon measure]]s on ''X'' (regular [[Borel measure]]s), denoted by ''rca''(''X'').  This space, with the norm given by the [[total variation]] of a measure, is also a Banach space belonging to the class of [[ba space]]s. {{harv|Dunford|Schwartz|1958|loc=§IV.6.3}}
* [[Positive linear functional]]s on ''C''(''X'') correspond to (positive) [[regular measure|regular]] [[Borel measure]]s on ''X'', by a different form of the Riesz representation theorem. {{harv|Rudin|1966|loc=Chapter 2}}
* If ''X'' is infinite, then ''C''(''X'') is not [[reflexive space|reflexive]], nor is it [[weak topology|weakly]] [[complete space|complete]].
* The [[Arzelà-Ascoli theorem]] holds: A subset ''K'' of ''C''(''X'') is [[relatively compact]] if and only if it is [[bounded set|bounded]] in the norm of ''C''(''X''), and [[equicontinuous]].
* The [[Stone-Weierstrass theorem]] holds for ''C''(''X'').  In the case of real functions, if ''A'' is a [[subring]] of ''C''(''X'') that contains all constants and separates points, then the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''A'' is ''C''(''X'').  In the case of complex functions, the statement holds with the additional hypothesis that ''A'' is closed under [[complex conjugation]].
* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are two compact Hausdorff spaces, and ''F'' : ''C''(''X'') &amp;rarr; ''C''(''Y'') is a [[homomorphism]] of algebras which commutes with complex conjugation, then ''F'' is continuous.  Furthermore, ''F'' has the form ''F''(''h'')(''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''(''f''(''y'')) for some continuous function ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''Y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;''X''.  In particular, if ''C''(''X'') and ''C''(''Y'') are isomorphic as algebras, then ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] topological spaces.
* Let &amp;Delta; be the space of [[maximal ideal]]s in ''C''(''X'').  Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between &amp;Delta; and the points of ''X''.  Furthermore, &amp;Delta; can be identified with the collection of all complex homomorphisms ''C''(''X'') &amp;rarr; '''C'''.  Equip &amp;Delta; with the [[initial topology]] with respect to this pairing with ''C''(''X'') (i.e., the [[Gelfand transform]]).  Then ''X'' is homeomorphic to &amp;Delta; equipped with this topology. {{harv|Rudin|1973|loc=§11.13}}
* A sequence in ''C''(''X'') is [[weak topology|weakly]] [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]] if and only if it is (uniformly) bounded in ''C''(''X'') and pointwise convergent.  In particular, ''C''(''X'') is only weakly complete for ''X'' a finite set.
* The [[vague topology]] is the [[weak* topology]] on the dual of ''C''(''X'').
* The [[Banach–Alaoglu theorem]] implies that any normed space is isometrically isomorphic to a subspace of ''C''(''X'') for some ''X''.

== Generalizations ==
The space ''C''(''X'') of real or complex-valued continuous functions can be defined on any topological space ''X''.  In the non-compact case, however, ''C''(''X'') is not in general a Banach space with respect to the uniform norm since it may contain unbounded functions.  Hence it is more typical to consider the space, denoted here ''C''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') of bounded continuous functions on ''X''.  This is a Banach space (in fact a commutative Banach algebra with identity) with respect to the uniform norm. {{harv|Hewitt|Stromberg|1965|loc=Theorem 7.9}}

It is sometimes desirable, particularly in [[measure theory]], to further refine this general definition by considering the special case when ''X'' is a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space.  In this case, it is possible to identify a pair of distinguished subsets of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''): {{harv|Hewitt|Stromberg|1965|loc=§II.7}}

* ''C''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), the subset of ''C''(''X'') consisting of functions with [[compact support]].  This is called the space of functions '''vanishing in a neighborhood of infinity'''.
* ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), the subset of ''C''(''X'') consisting of functions such that for every &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there is a compact set ''K''&amp;sub;''X'' such that |''f''(''x'')|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon; for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''X''\''K''.  This is called the space of functions '''[[vanish at infinity|vanishing at infinity]]'''.

The closure of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') is precisely ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').  In particular, the latter is a Banach space.

In [[geometry]], a '''cross-polytope''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = [[E. L. Elte|Elte]] | first = E. L. | title = The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces | publisher = University of Groningen | location = Groningen | year = 1912}} Chapter IV, five dimensional semiregular polytope [https://www.amazon.com/Semiregular-Polytopes-Hyperspaces-Emanuel-Lodewijk/dp/141817968X]&lt;/ref&gt; '''orthoplex''',&lt;ref&gt;[[John Horton Conway|Conway]] calls it an n-'''orthoplex''' for ''[[orthant]] complex''.
&lt;/ref&gt; '''hyperoctahedron''', or '''cocube''' is a [[regular polytope|regular]], [[Convex polytope|convex]] [[polytope]] that exists in ''n''-[[dimensions]]. A 2-orthoplex is a square, a 3-orthoplex is a regular [[octahedron]], and a 4-orthoplex is a [[16-cell]]. Its facets are [[simplex]]es of the previous dimension, while the cross-polytope's [[vertex figure]] is another cross-polytope from the previous dimension.

The vertices of a cross-polytope can be chosen as the unit vectors pointing along each co-ordinate axis - i.e. all the permutations of {{nowrap|(±1, 0, 0, …, 0)}}. The cross-polytope is the [[convex hull]] of its vertices. 
The ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope can also be defined as the closed [[unit ball]] (or, according to some authors, its boundary) in the [[L1-norm|&amp;#x2113;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-norm]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x\in\mathbb R^n : \|x\|_1 \le 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1 dimension the cross-polytope is simply the [[line segment]] [&amp;minus;1, +1], in 2 dimensions it is a [[Square (geometry)|square]] (or diamond) with vertices {(±1, 0), (0, ±1)}. In 3 dimensions it is an [[octahedron]]&amp;mdash;one of the five convex regular [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] known as the [[Platonic solid]]s. This can be generalised to higher dimensions with an n-orthoplex being constructed as a [[bipyramid#Higher dimensions|bipyramid]] with an (n-1)-orthoplex base.

The cross-polytope is the [[dual polytope]] of the [[hypercube]]. The 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope is a [[Turán graph]] ''T''(2''n'',''n'').

== 4 dimensions ==

The 4-dimensional cross-polytope also goes by the name '''hexadecachoron''' or '''[[16-cell]]'''. It is one of six [[convex regular 4-polytope]]s. These [[4-polytope]]s were first described by the Swiss mathematician [[Ludwig Schläfli]] in the mid-19th century.

== Higher dimensions ==

The '''cross polytope''' family is one of three [[regular polytope]] families, labeled by [[Coxeter]] as ''β&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the other two being the [[hypercube]] family, labeled as ''γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the [[simplex|simplices]], labeled as ''α&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. A fourth family, the [[hypercubic honeycomb|infinite tessellations of hypercubes]], he labeled as ''δ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope has 2''n'' vertices, and 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; facets (''n''&amp;minus;1 dimensional components) all of which are ''n''&amp;minus;1 [[Simplex|simplices]]. The [[vertex figure]]s are all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 cross-polytopes. The [[Schläfli symbol]] of the cross-polytope is {3,3,…,3,4}. 

The [[Dihedral_angle#Dihedral_angles_in_polyhedra|dihedral angle]] of the ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope is &lt;math&gt;\delta_n = \arccos\left(\frac{2-n}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This gives: &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = arccos(0/2) = 90°, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = arccos(-1/3) = 109.47°, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = arccos(-2/4) = 120°, &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = arccos(-3/5) = 126.87°, ... &amp;delta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;infin;&lt;/sub&gt; = arccos(-1) = 180°.

The volume of the ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

For each pair of non-opposite vertices, there is an edge joining them. More generally, each set of ''k+1'' orthogonal vertices corresponds to a distinct ''k''-dimensional component which contains them. The number of ''k''-dimensional components (vertices, edges, faces, …, facets) in an ''n''-dimensional cross-polytope is thus given by (see [[binomial coefficient]]):
:&lt;math&gt;2^{k+1}{n \choose {k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, ''Regular polytopes'', p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many possible [[orthographic projection]]s that can show the cross-polytopes as 2-dimensional graphs. [[Petrie polygon]] projections map the points into a regular ''2n''-gon or lower order regular polygons. A second projection takes the ''2(n-1)''-gon petrie polygon of the lower dimension, seen as a [[bipyramid]], projected down the axis, with 2 vertices mapped into the center.

The vertices of an axis-aligned cross polytope are all at equal distance from each other in the [[taxicab geometry|Manhattan distance]] ([[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm]]). [[Kusner's conjecture]] states that this set of 2''d'' points is the largest possible [[equidistant set]] for this distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Generalized orthoplex ==
Regular [[Complex polytope#Regular_complex_polytopes|complex polytopes]] can be defined in [[Complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] called ''generalized orthoplexes'' (or cross polytopes), &amp;beta;{{supsub|''p''|''n''}} = &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{4}&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, or {{CDD|node_1|3|node|3}}..{{CDD|3|node|4|pnode}}. Real solutions exist with ''p''=2, i.e. &amp;beta;{{supsub|2|''n''}} = &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{3}...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{4}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = {3,3,..,4}. For ''p''&gt;2, they exist in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;. A ''p''-generalized ''n''-orthoplex has ''pn'' vertices. ''Generalized orthoplexes'' have regular [[simplex]]es (real) as [[Facet (geometry)|facets]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, Regular Complex Polytopes, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Generalized orthoplexes make [[complete multipartite graph]]s, &amp;beta;{{supsub|''p''|2}} make K&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for [[complete bipartite graph]], &amp;beta;{{supsub|''p''|3}} make K&lt;sub&gt;''p'',''p'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt; for complete tripartite graphs. &amp;beta;{{supsub|''p''|''n''}} creates K&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. An [[orthogonal projection]] can be defined that maps all the vertices equally-spaced on a circle, with all pairs of vertices connected, except multiples of ''n''. The [[regular polygon]] perimeter in these orthogonal projections is called a [[petrie polygon]].

'''Dephasing''' is a mechanism that recovers [[classical physics|classical]] behavior from a [[quantum physics|quantum]] system. It refers to the ways in which [[coherence (physics)|coherence]] caused by perturbation decays over time, and the system returns to the state before perturbation. It is an important effect in molecular and atomic [[spectroscopy]], and in the [[condensed matter physics]] of [[mesoscopic]] devices.

The reason can be understood easily if we can see conduction in metals as a typical classical phenomenon with quantum effects all embedded into an effective mass that can be computed quantum mechanically as also happens to resistance that can be seen as a scattering effect of conduction electrons. When the temperature is lowered and the dimensions of the device are meaningfully reduced, this classical behavior should disappear and the laws of quantum mechanics should govern the behavior of conducting electrons seen as waves that ballistically move inside the conductor without any kind of dissipation. Most of the time this is what one observes. But it appeared as a surprise to uncover that the so-called '''dephasing time''', that is the time it takes for the conducting electrons to lose their quantum behavior, becomes finite rather than infinite when the temperature approaches zero in mesoscopic devices violating the expectations of the theory of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii (see citation below). This kind of saturation of the dephasing time at low temperatures is an open problem even as several proposals have been put forward.

The coherence of a sample is explained by the off-diagonal elements of a [[density state|density matrix]]. An external [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]] can create coherence between two [[quantum state]]s in a sample if the [[frequency]] corresponds to the energy gap between the two states. The coherence terms decay with the dephasing time, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

After coherence is created in a sample by light, the sample emits a [[Polarization (waves)|polarization wave]], the frequency of which is equal to and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of which is inverted from the incident light. In addition, the sample is excited by the incident light and a population of molecules in the excited state is generated. The light passing through the sample is absorbed because of these two processes, and it is expressed by an [[absorption spectrum]]. The coherence decays with the time constant, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the intensity of the polarization wave is reduced. The population of the excited state also decays with the time constant of the [[vibrational energy relaxation|longitudinal relaxation]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The time constant ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is usually much smaller than T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the bandwidth of the absorption spectrum is related to these time constants by the [[Fourier transform]], so the time constant T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a main contributor to the bandwidth. The time constant ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been measured with ultrafast [[time-resolved spectroscopy]] directly, such as in photon echo experiments.

What is the dephasing rate of a particle that has an energy E if it is subject to a fluctuating  environment that has a temperature T? In particular what is the dephasing rate close to equilibrium (E~T), and what happens in the zero temperature limit? This question has fascinated the mesoscopic community during the last two decades (see references below).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23411">A '''discrete Hartley transform (DHT)''' is a [[Fourier-related transform]] of discrete, periodic data similar to the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT), with analogous applications in signal processing and related fields. Its main distinction from the DFT is that it transforms real inputs to real outputs, with no intrinsic involvement of [[complex number]]s. Just as the DFT is the discrete analogue of the continuous [[Fourier transform]] (FT), the DHT is the discrete analogue of the continuous [[Hartley transform]] (HT), introduced by [[Ralph V. L. Hartley]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="Hartley_1942"/&gt;

Because there are fast algorithms for the DHT analogous to the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT), the DHT was originally proposed by [[Ronald N. Bracewell]] in 1983&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1983"/&gt; as a more efficient computational tool in the common case where the data are purely real. It was subsequently argued, however, that specialized FFT algorithms for real inputs or outputs can ordinarily be found with slightly fewer operations than any corresponding algorithm for the DHT.

== Definition ==
Formally, the discrete Hartley transform is a linear, invertible [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''H'': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where '''R''' denotes the set of [[real number]]s). The ''N'' real numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sub&gt; are transformed into the ''N'' real numbers ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sub&gt; according to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;H_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \operatorname{cas} \left( \frac{2 \pi}{N} n k \right) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \left[ \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{N} n k \right) + \sin \left( \frac{2 \pi}{N} n k \right) \right]
\quad \quad
 k = 0, \dots, N-1 &lt;/math&gt;.

The combination &lt;math&gt;\cos(z) + \sin(z) \!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \sqrt{2} \cos(z-\frac{\pi}{4})&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes denoted [[cas (mathematics)|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cas}(z) \!&lt;/math&gt;]], and should be contrasted with the &lt;math&gt;e^{-iz} = \cos(z) - i \sin(z) \!&lt;/math&gt; that appears in the DFT definition (where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]).

As with the DFT, the overall scale factor in front of the transform and the sign of the sine term are a matter of convention. Although these conventions occasionally vary between authors, they do not affect the essential properties of the transform.

== Properties ==
The transform can be interpreted as the multiplication of the vector (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) by an ''N''-by-''N'' [[matrix (math)|matrix]]; therefore, the discrete Hartley transform is a [[linear operator]]. The matrix is invertible; the inverse transformation, which allows one to recover the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; from the ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, is simply the DHT of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by 1/''N''.  That is, the DHT is its own inverse ([[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]]), up to an overall scale factor.

The DHT can be used to compute the DFT, and vice versa. For real inputs ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the DFT output ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has a real part (''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''N-k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 and an imaginary part (''H''&lt;sub&gt;''N-k''&lt;/sub&gt; – ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)/2. Conversely, the DHT is equivalent to computing the DFT of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by 1+''i'', then taking the real part of the result.

As with the DFT, a cyclic [[convolution]] '''z''' = '''x'''*'''y''' of two vectors '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''y''' = (''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) to produce a vector '''z''' = (''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), all of length ''N'', becomes a simple operation after the DHT.  In particular, suppose that the vectors '''X''', '''Y''', and '''Z''' denote the DHT of '''x''', '''y''', and '''z''' respectively. Then the elements of '''Z''' are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix}
Z_k &amp; = &amp; \left[ X_k \left( Y_k + Y_{N-k} \right)
                         + X_{N-k} \left( Y_k - Y_{N-k} \right) \right] / 2
\\
Z_{N-k} &amp; = &amp; \left[ X_{N-k} \left( Y_k + Y_{N-k} \right)
                         - X_k \left( Y_k - Y_{N-k} \right) \right] / 2

\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we take all of the vectors to be periodic in ''N'' (''X''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, etcetera). Thus, just as the DFT transforms a convolution into a pointwise multiplication of complex numbers (''pairs'' of real and imaginary parts), the DHT transforms a convolution into a simple combination of ''pairs'' of real frequency components. The inverse DHT then yields the desired vector '''z'''. In this way, a fast algorithm for the DHT (see below) yields a fast algorithm for convolution. (This is slightly more expensive than the corresponding procedure for the DFT, not including the costs of the transforms below, because the pairwise operation above requires 8 real-arithmetic operations compared to the 6 of a complex multiplication. This count doesn't include the division by 2, which can be absorbed e.g. into the 1/''N'' normalization of the inverse DHT.)

== Fast algorithms ==
Just as for the DFT, evaluating the DHT definition directly would require O(''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) arithmetical operations (see [[Big O notation]]). There are fast algorithms similar to the FFT, however, that compute the same result in only O(''N'' log ''N'') operations. Nearly every FFT algorithm, from [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooley–Tukey]] to [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] to Winograd (1985)&lt;ref name="Sorensen_1985"/&gt; to [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's]] (1993),&lt;ref name="Bini-Bozzo_1993"/&gt; has a direct analogue for the discrete Hartley transform. (However, a few of the more exotic FFT algorithms, such as the QFT, have not yet been investigated in the context of the DHT.)

In particular, the DHT analogue of the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is commonly known as the '''fast Hartley transform''' (FHT) algorithm, and was first described by Bracewell in 1984.&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1984"/&gt; This FHT algorithm, at least when applied to [[power of two|power-of-two]] sizes ''N'', is the subject of the United States [[software patent|patent]] number 4,646,256, issued in 1987 to [[Stanford University]]. Stanford placed this patent in the public domain in 1994 (Bracewell, 1995).&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1995"/&gt;

As mentioned above, DHT algorithms are typically slightly less efficient (in terms of the number of [[floating-point]] operations) than the corresponding DFT algorithm (FFT) specialized for real inputs (or outputs). This was first argued by Sorensen et al. (1987)&lt;ref name="Sorensen_1987"/&gt; and Duhamel &amp; [[Martin Vetterli|Vetterli]] (1987).&lt;ref name="Duhamel-Vetterli_1987"/&gt; The latter authors obtained what appears to be the lowest published operation count for the DHT of power-of-two sizes, employing a split-radix algorithm (similar to the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix FFT]]) that breaks a DHT of length ''N'' into a DHT of length ''N''/2 and two real-input DFTs (''not'' DHTs) of length ''N''/4. In this way, they argued that a DHT of power-of-two length can be computed with, at best, 2 more additions than the corresponding number of arithmetic operations for the real-input DFT.

On present-day computers, performance is determined more by [[CPU cache|cache]] and [[CPU pipeline]] considerations than by strict operation counts, and a slight difference in arithmetic cost is unlikely to be significant.  Since FHT and real-input FFT algorithms have similar computational structures, neither appears to have a substantial ''a priori'' speed advantage ({{ill|Miodrag Popović (engineer){{!}}Popović|sr|Миодраг Поповић (електротехничар)}} and Šević, 1994).&lt;ref name="Popović-Šević_1994"/&gt; As a practical matter, highly optimized real-input FFT libraries are available from many sources (e.g. from CPU vendors such as [[Intel]]), whereas highly optimized DHT libraries are less common.

On the other hand, the redundant computations in FFTs due to real inputs are more difficult to eliminate for large [[prime number|prime]] ''N'', despite the existence of O(''N'' log ''N'') complex-data algorithms for such cases, because the redundancies are hidden behind intricate permutations and/or phase rotations in those algorithms. In contrast, a standard prime-size FFT algorithm, [[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], can be directly applied to the DHT of real data for roughly a factor of two less computation than that of the equivalent complex FFT (Frigo and Johnson, 2005).&lt;ref name="Frigo-Johnson_2005"/&gt; On the other hand, a non-DHT-based adaptation of Rader's algorithm for real-input DFTs is also possible (Chu &amp; [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1982).&lt;ref name="Chu-Burrus_1982"/&gt;

== Multi-Dimensional Discrete Hartley Transform (MD-DHT) ==
The rD-DHT (MD-DHT with "r" dimensions) is given by

&lt;math&gt;X(k_1,k_2,...,k_r)=\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} \dots \sum_{n_r=0}^{N_r-1} x(n_1,n_2,...,n_r){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi n_1 k_1}{N_1}+\dots +\frac{2\pi n_r k_r}{N_r}),&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;k_i = 0,1,\ldots, N_i-1&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;{\rm cas}(x)=\cos(x)+\sin(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the 1-D case, as a real and symmetric transform, the MD-DHT is simpler than the MD-DFT. For one, the inverse DHT is identical to the forward transform, with the addition of a scaling factor;
[[File:Img DHT prop2.png|centre|frameless|400x400px]]
and second, since the kernel is real, it avoids the computational complexity of [[complex number]]s. Additionally, the DFT is directly obtainable from the DHT by a simple additive operation (Bracewell, 1983).&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1983"/&gt;

The MD-DHT is widely used in areas like image and optical signal processing. Specific applications include computer vision, high-definition television, and teleconferencing, areas that process or analyze motion images (Zeng, 2000).&lt;ref name="Zeng-Bi-Leyman_2000"/&gt;

=== Fast algorithms for the MD-DHT ===
As computing speed keeps increasing, bigger multidimensional problems become computationally feasible, requiring the need for fast multidimensional algorithms. Three such algorithms follow.

In pursuit of separability for efficiency, we consider the following transform (Bracewell, 1983),&lt;ref name="Bracewell_1983"/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\hat{X}(k_1,k_2,...,k_r)=\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} \dots \sum_{n_r=0}^{N_r-1} x(n_1,n_2,...,n_r){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi n_1 k_1}{N_1}) \dots {\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi n_r k_r}{N_r}).&lt;/math&gt;

It was shown in Bortfeld (1995),&lt;ref name="Bortfeld-Dinter_1995"/&gt; that the two can be related by a few additions. For example, in 3-D,

&lt;math&gt;X(k_1,k_2,k_3) = \frac{1}{2} [\hat{X}(k_1,k_2,-k_3)+\hat{X}(k_1,-k_2,k_3)+\hat{X}(-k_1,k_2,k_3)-\hat{X}(-k_1,-k_2,-k_3)].&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}&lt;/math&gt;, row-column algorithms can then be implemented. This technique is commonly used due to the simplicity of such R-C algorithms, but they are not optimized for general M-D spaces.

Other fast algorithms have been developed, such as radix-2, radix-4, and split radix. For example, Boussakta (2000)&lt;ref name="Boussakta_2000"/&gt; developed the 3-D vector radix,

&lt;math&gt;X(k_1,k_2,...,k_r)=\sum_{n_1=0}^{N-1} \sum_{n_2=0}^{N-1}\sum_{n_r=0}^{N-1} x(n_1,n_2,n_3){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi}{N}(n_1 k_1+n_2 k_2 +n_3 k_3))&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\sum_{n_1:even}\sum_{n_2:even}\sum_{n_3:even}+\sum_{n_1:even}\sum_{n_2:even}\sum_{n_3:odd}+\sum_{n_1:even}\sum_{n_2:odd}\sum_{n_3:even}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;+\sum_{n_1:even}\sum_{n_2:odd}\sum_{n_3:odd}+\sum_{n_1:odd}\sum_{n_2:even}\sum_{n_3:even}+\sum_{n_1:odd}\sum_{n_2:even}\sum_{n_3:odd}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;+\sum_{n_1:odd}\sum_{n_2:odd}\sum_{n_3:even}+\sum_{n_1:odd}\sum_{n_2:odd}\sum_{n_3:odd}.&lt;/math&gt;

It was also presented in Boussakta (2000)&lt;ref name="Boussakta_2000"/&gt; that this 3D-vector radix algorithm takes &lt;math&gt;(\frac{7}{4})N^3 \log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; multiplications and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{31}{8})N^3 \log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; additions compared to &lt;math&gt;3N^3 \log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; multiplications and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{9}{2})N^3 \log_2 N+3N^2&lt;/math&gt; additions from the row-column approach. The drawback is that the implementation of these radix-type of algorithms is hard to generalize for signals of arbitrary dimensions.

Number theoretic transforms have also been used for solving the MD-DHT, since they perform extremely fast convolutions. In Boussakta (1988),&lt;ref name="Boussakta_1988"/&gt; it was shown how to decompose the MD-DHT transform into a form consisting of convolutions:

For the 2-D case (the 3-D case is also covered in the stated reference),

&lt;math&gt;X(k,l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(n,m){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N}+\frac{2\pi ml}{M}),\;&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\ldots ,N-1&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;l=0,1,\ldots,M-1&lt;/math&gt;

can be decomposed into 1-D and 2-D circular convolutions as follows,

&lt;math&gt;X(k,l)=\begin{cases} X_1(k,0) \\ X_2(0,l) \\ X_3(k,l)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;X_1(k,0)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(n,m)){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N}),\;&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\ldots,N-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_2(0,l)=\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} (\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n,m)){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi ml}{M}),\;&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;l=1,2,\dots, M-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X_3(k,l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(n,m){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N}+\frac{2\pi ml}{M})\;,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots, N-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;l=1,2,\ldots,M-1.&lt;/math&gt;

Developing &lt;math&gt;X_3&lt;/math&gt; further,

&lt;math&gt;X_3(k,l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x(n,0){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N})+\sum_{m=1}^{M-1} x(0,m){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi ml}{M})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;+\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{m=1}^{M-1}x(n,m){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N}+\frac{2\pi ml}{M}).&lt;/math&gt;

At this point we present the Fermat number transform (FNT). The t&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Fermat number]] is given by &lt;math&gt;F_t=2^b+1&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;b=2^t&lt;/math&gt;. The well known Fermat numbers are for &lt;math&gt;t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is prime for &lt;math&gt;0\le t \le 4&lt;/math&gt;), (Boussakta, 1988).&lt;ref name="Boussakta_1988"/&gt; The Fermat number transform is given by

&lt;math&gt;X(k,l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(n,m)\alpha_{1}^{nk}\alpha_{2}^{ml} \mod F_t&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;k=0,\ldots, N-1, l=0,\ldots,M-1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; are roots of unity of order &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; respectively &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_{1}^{N}=\alpha_{2}^{M}=1 \mod F_t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Going back to the decomposition, the last term for &lt;math&gt;X_3(k,l)&lt;/math&gt; will be denoted as &lt;math&gt;X_4(k,l)&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;X_4(k,l)=\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \sum_{m=1}^{M-1}x(n,m){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi nk}{N}+\frac{2\pi ml}{M}),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k=1,2,\ldots,N-1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;l=1,2,\ldots,M-1.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive roots]] of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (which are guaranteed to exist if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are [[Prime number|prime]]) then &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt; map &lt;math&gt;(n,m)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(g_1^{n}\mod N, g_2^m\mod M).&lt;/math&gt; So, mapping &lt;math&gt;n,m,k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;g_1^{-n},g_2^{-m}, g_1^k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2^l&lt;/math&gt;, one gets the following,

&lt;math&gt;X_4(g_1^k,g_2^l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-2} \sum_{m=0}^{M-2}x(g_1^{-n},g_2^{-m}){\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi g_1^{ (-n+k)}}{N}+\frac{2\pi g_2^{(-m+l)}}{M}),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k=0,1,\ldots,N-2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;l=0,1,\ldots,M-2&lt;/math&gt;.

Which is now a [[circular convolution]]. With &lt;math&gt;Y(k,l)=X_4(g_1^k,g_2^l)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y(n,m)=x(g_1^{-n},g_2^{-m})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h(n,m)={\rm cas}(\frac{2\pi g_1^n}{N}+\frac{2\pi g_2^m}{M})&lt;/math&gt;, one has

&lt;math&gt;Y(k,l)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-2} \sum_{m=0}^{M-2}y(n,m)h(&lt;k-n&gt;_N,&lt;l-m&gt;_M)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Y(k,l)=FNT^{-1} \{FNT[y(n,m)]\otimes FNT[h(n,m)]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes term by term multiplication. It was also stated in (Boussakta, 1988)&lt;ref name="Boussakta_1988"/&gt; that this algorithm reduces the number of multiplications by a factor of 8–20 over other DHT algorithms at a cost of a slight increase in the number of shift and add operations, which are assumed to be simpler than multiplications. The drawback of this algorithm is the constraint that each dimension of the transform has a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7582">In [[mathematics]], '''Dvoretzky's theorem''' is an important structural theorem about [[normed vector space]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s proved by [[Aryeh Dvoretzky]] in the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=A. |last=Dvoretzky |chapter=Some results on convex bodies and Banach spaces |year=1961 |title=Proc. Internat. Sympos. Linear Spaces (Jerusalem, 1960) |pages=123–160 |publisher=Jerusalem Academic Press |location=Jerusalem |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; answering a question of [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. In essence, it says that every sufficiently high-dimensional normed vector space will have low-dimensional subspaces that are approximately [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. Equivalently, every high-dimensional bounded symmetric [[convex set]] has low-dimensional sections that are approximately [[ellipsoid]]s.

A new proof found by [[Vitali Milman]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=V. D. |last=Milman |title=A new proof of A. Dvoretzky's theorem on cross-sections of convex bodies |language=Russian |journal=Funkcional. Anal. i Prilozhen. |volume=5 |year=1971 |issue=4 |pages=28–37 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the starting points for the development of [[asymptotic geometric analysis]] (also called ''asymptotic functional analysis'' or the ''local theory of Banach spaces'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |quote=The full significance of measure concentration was first realized by Vitali Milman in his revolutionary proof [Mil1971] of the theorem of Dvoretzky ... Dvoretzky's theorem, especially as proved by Milman, is a milestone in the local (that is, finite-dimensional) theory of Banach spaces.  While I feel sorry for a mathematician who cannot see its intrinsic appeal, this appeal on its own does not explain the enormous influence that the proof has had, well beyond Banach space theory, as a result of planting the idea of measure concentration in the minds of many mathematicians.  Huge numbers of papers have now been published exploiting this idea or giving new techniques for showing that it holds. |first=W. T. |last=Gowers |chapter=The two cultures of mathematics |title=Mathematics: frontiers and perspectives |pages=65–78 |publisher=Amer. Math. Soc. |location=Providence, RI |year=2000 |isbn=0-8218-2070-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original formulations==
For every natural number ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''N''' and every ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists a natural number ''N''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''N''' such that if (''X'',&amp;nbsp;‖·‖) is any normed space of dimension ''N''(''k'',&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;''), there exists a subspace ''E''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''X'' of dimension ''k'' and a positive [[quadratic form]] ''Q'' on ''E'' such that the corresponding Euclidean norm

:&lt;math&gt;| \cdot | = \sqrt{Q(\cdot)} &lt;/math&gt;

on ''E'' satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt; |x| \leq \|x\| \leq (1+\varepsilon)|x| \quad \text{for every} \ x \in E.&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the [[Banach–Mazur compactum|multiplicative Banach-Mazur distance ''d'']] the theorem's conclusion can be formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;d(E,\ \ell_k^2)\leq 1+\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ell_k^2&lt;/math&gt; denotes the standard ''k''-dimensional Euclidean space.

Since the [[Unit sphere|unit ball]] of every normed vector space is a bounded, symmetric, convex set and the unit ball of every Euclidean space is an ellipsoid, the theorem may also be formulated as a statement about ellipsoid sections of convex sets.

==Further developments==

In 1971, [[Vitali Milman]] gave a new proof of Dvoretzky's theorem, making use of the [[concentration of measure]] on the sphere to show that a random ''k''-dimensional subspace satisfies the above inequality with probability very close to 1. The proof gives the sharp dependence on ''k'':

:&lt;math&gt;N(k,\varepsilon)\leq\exp(C(\varepsilon)k)&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''C''(''&amp;epsilon;'') only depends on ''&amp;epsilon;''.

We can thus state: for every ''&amp;epsilon;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 and every normed space (''X'',&amp;nbsp;‖·‖) of dimension ''N'', there exists a subspace ''E''&amp;nbsp;&amp;sub;&amp;nbsp;''X'' of dimension
''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''C''(''&amp;epsilon;'')&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N'' and a Euclidean norm |&amp;middot;| on ''E'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt; |x| \leq \|x\| \leq (1+\varepsilon)|x| \quad \text{for every} \ x \in E.&lt;/math&gt;

More precisely, let ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; denote the unit sphere with respect to some Euclidean structure ''Q'' on ''X'', and let ''&amp;sigma;'' be the invariant probability measure on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then:
* there exists such a subspace ''E'' with

:: &lt;math&gt;k = \dim E \geq C(\varepsilon) \, \left(\frac{\int_{S^{N-1}} \| \xi \| \, d\sigma(\xi)}{\max_{\xi \in S^{N-1}} \| \xi \|}\right)^2 \, N.  &lt;/math&gt;

* For any ''X'' one may choose ''Q'' so that the term in the brackets will be at most

:: &lt;math&gt; c_1 \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a universal constant. For given ''X'' and ''&amp;epsilon;'', the largest possible ''k'' is denoted ''k''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') and called the [[Dvoretzky dimension]] of ''X''.

The dependence on ''&amp;epsilon;'' was studied by [[Yehoram Gordon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Y. |last=Gordon |title=Some inequalities for Gaussian processes and applications |journal=Israel J. Math. |volume=50 |year=1985 |issue=4 |pages=265–289 |doi= 10.1007/bf02759761}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Y. |last=Gordon |title=Gaussian processes and almost spherical sections of convex bodies |journal=Annals of Probability |volume=16 |year=1988 |issue=1 |pages=180–188 |doi= 10.1214/aop/1176991893}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that ''k''&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''N''. Another proof of this result was given by [[Gideon Schechtman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=G. |last=Schechtman |chapter=A remark concerning the dependence on ε in Dvoretzky's theorem |title=Geometric aspects of functional analysis (1987–88) |pages=274–277 |series=Lecture Notes in Math. |volume=1376 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1989 |isbn=0-387-51303-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noga Alon]] and [[Vitali Milman]] showed that the logarithmic bound on the dimension of the subspace in Dvoretzky's theorem can be significantly improved, if one is willing to accept a subspace that is close either to a Euclidean space or to a [[Chebyshev distance|Chebyshev space]]. Specifically, for some constant ''c'', every ''n''-dimensional space has a subspace of dimension ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;exp(''c''{{radic|log&amp;nbsp;''N''}}) that is close either to ''ℓ''{{su|b=2|p=''k''}} or to ''ℓ''{{su|b=&amp;infin;|p=''k''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Biography==
Florian Cajori was born in Switzerland, and was the son of Georg Cajori and Catherine Camenisch.  He attended schools first in [[Zillis-Reischen|Zillis]] and later in [[Chur]].  In 1875, Florian Cajori emigrated to the United States at the age of sixteen, and attended the [[Wisconsin State College of Milwaukee|State Normal school]] in [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]].  After graduating in 1878, he taught in a country school, and then later began studying Mathematics at [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson" /&gt;

In 1883, Cajori received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, briefly attended Johns Hopkins University for 8 months in between degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/UW/UW-idx?type=div&amp;did=UW.ClassAlbum1883.i0037&amp;isize=M UW Madison class album, 1883]&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught for a few years at [[Tulane University]], before being appointed as professor of applied mathematics there in 1887. He was then driven north by tuberculosis.  He founded the Colorado College Scientific Society and taught at [[Colorado College]] where he held the chair in physics from 1889-1898 and the chair in mathematics from 1898-1918.  He was the position Dean of the engineering department.&lt;ref name="writer"&gt;{{cite web|last=writer|first=staff|title=Florian Cajori, 1917 MAA President|url=http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/cajori.html|publisher=MAA Mathematical Association of America|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While at Colorado, he received his doctorate from Tulane in 1894, and married Elizabeth G. Edwards in 1890 and had one son.&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson" /&gt;

Cajori's ''A History of Mathematics'' (1894) was the first popular presentation of the history of mathematics in the United States.&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor and  Robertson|first=J.

Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based upon his reputation in the history of mathematics (even today his 1928–1929 ''History of Mathematical Notations'' has been described as "unsurpassed")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ma/history/Faculty/Cajori.html Colorado College page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204043525/http://www.coloradocollege.edu/dept/ma/history/Faculty/Cajori.html |date=2010-12-04 }} on Florian Cajori.&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed in 1918 to the first history of mathematics chair in the U.S,  created especially for him, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He remained in Berkeley, California until his death in 1930.  Cajori did no original mathematical research unrelated to the history of mathematics.&lt;ref name="O'Connor and Robertson"/&gt; In addition to his numerous books, he also contributed highly recognized and popular historical articles to the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="writer"/&gt; His last work was a revision of Andrew Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], vol.1 The Motion of Bodies, but he died before it was completed. The work was finished by R.T. Crawford of Berkeley, California.

In [[mathematics]], '''Green's theorem''' gives the relationship between a [[line integral]] around a [[Curve#Definition|simple closed curve]] ''C'' and a [[double integral]] over the plane region ''D'' bounded by ''C''. It is named after [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]], though its first proof is due to [[Bernhard Riemann]]&lt;ref&gt;George Green, ''An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism'' (Nottingham, England:  T. Wheelhouse, 1828).  Green did not actually derive the form of "Green's theorem" which appears in this article; rather, he derived a form of the "divergence theorem", which appears on [https://books.google.com/books?id=GwYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 10–12] of his ''Essay''.&lt;br&gt;
In 1846, the form of "Green's theorem" which appears in this article was first published, without proof, in an article by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Augustin Cauchy]]:  A. Cauchy (1846) [https://archive.org/stream/ComptesRendusAcademieDesSciences0023/ComptesRendusAcadmieDesSciences-Tome023-Juillet-dcembre1846#page/n254/mode/1up "Sur les intégrales qui s'étendent à tous les points d'une courbe fermée"]  (On integrals that extend over all of the points of a closed curve), ''Comptes rendus'', '''23''': 251–255.  (The equation appears at the bottom of page 254, where (''S'') denotes the line integral of a function ''k''  along the curve ''s''  that encloses the area ''S''.)&lt;br&gt;
A proof of the theorem was finally provided in 1851 by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in his inaugural dissertation:  Bernhard Riemann (1851) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PpALAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false''Grundlagen für eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer veränderlichen complexen Grösse''] (Basis for a general theory of functions of a variable complex quantity), (Göttingen, (Germany):  Adalbert Rente, 1867); see pages 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the two-dimensional special case of the more general [[Kelvin–Stokes theorem]].

==Theorem==
Let ''C'' be a positively [[Curve orientation|oriented]], [[piecewise]] [[Smoothness|smooth]], [[simple closed curve]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], and let ''D'' be the region bounded by ''C''. If ''L'' and ''M'' are functions of (''x'', ''y'') defined on an [[Open set|open region]] containing ''D'' and have [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[partial derivatives]] there, then

:{{intorient|
| preintegral =
| symbol = ointctr
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle C}&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(L\, dx + M\, dy) = \iint_{D} \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right)\, dx\, dy&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where the path of integration along ''C'' is [[anticlockwise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering |first=K. F. |last=Riley |first2=M.

In physics, Green's theorem finds many applications.  One of which is solving two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflows from a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In [[Euclidean plane geometry|plane geometry]], and in particular, area [[surveying]], Green's theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter.

==Proof when ''D'' is a simple region==
[[Image:Green's-theorem-simple-region.svg|thumb|300px|right|If ''D'' is a simple region with its boundary consisting of the curves ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, half of Green's theorem can be demonstrated.]]

The following is a proof of half of the theorem for the simplified area ''D'', a type I region where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are curves connected by vertical lines (possibly of zero length). A similar proof exists for the other half of the theorem when ''D'' is a type II region where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are curves connected by horizontal lines (again, possibly of zero length). Putting these two parts together, the theorem is thus proven for regions of type III (defined as regions which are both type I and type II). The general case can then be deduced from this special case by decomposing ''D'' into a set of type III regions.

If it can be shown that if

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} L\, dx = \iint_{D} \left(- \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right)\, dA\qquad\mathrm{(1)}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_{C} M\, dy = \iint_{D} \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x}\right)\, dA\qquad\mathrm{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

are true, then Green's theorem follows immediately for the region D. We can prove (1) easily for regions of type I, and (2) for regions of type II. Green's theorem then follows for regions of type III.

Assume region ''D'' is a type I region and can thus be characterized, as pictured on the right, by

:&lt;math&gt;D = \{(x,y)\mid a\le x\le b, g_1(x) \le y \le g_2(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are [[continuous function]]s on [''a'', ''b'']. Compute the double integral in (1):

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\iint_D \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\, dA
&amp; =\int_a^b\,\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} (x,y)\,dy\,dx \\
&amp; = \int_a^b \Big\{L(x,g_2(x)) - L(x,g_1(x)) \Big\} \, dx.\qquad\mathrm{(3)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now compute the line integral in (1). ''C'' can be rewritten as the union of four curves: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

With ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, use the [[parametric equation]]s: ''x'' = ''x'', ''y'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{C_1} L(x,y)\, dx = \int_a^b L(x,g_1(x))\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

With ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, use the parametric equations: ''x'' = ''x'', ''y'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), ''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b''. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{C_3} L(x,y)\, dx = -\int_{-C_3} L(x,y)\, dx = - \int_a^b L(x,g_2(x))\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral over ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is negated because it goes in the negative direction from ''b'' to ''a'', as ''C'' is oriented positively (anticlockwise). On ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x'' remains constant, meaning

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{C_4} L(x,y)\, dx = \int_{C_2} L(x,y)\, dx = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_{C} L\, dx &amp; = \int_{C_1} L(x,y)\, dx + \int_{C_2} L(x,y)\, dx + \int_{C_3} L(x,y)\, dx + \int_{C_4} L(x,y)\, dx \\
&amp; = -\int_a^b L(x,g_2(x))\, dx + \int_a^b L(x,g_1(x))\, dx.\qquad\mathrm{(4)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining (3) with (4), we get (1) for regions of type I. A similar treatment yields (2) for regions of type II. Putting the two together, we get the result for regions of type III.

== Proof for rectifiable Jordan curves ==
We are going to prove the following

'''Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a rectifiable, positively oriented [[Jordan curve theorem|Jordan curve]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote its inner region. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;A, B:\overline{R}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions with the property that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has second partial derivative at every point of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has first partial derivative at every point of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and that the functions &lt;math&gt;D_{1}B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;D_{2}A:R\longrightarrow \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are Riemann-integrable over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Then

&lt;math display="block"&gt;\int_{\Gamma}A\,dx+B\,dy=\int_{R}\,\,\left(D_{1}B(x,y)-D_{2}A(x,y)\right)\,d(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;

We need the following lemmas:

'''Lemma 1 (Decomposition Lemma).''' Assume &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a rectifiable, positively oriented Jordan curve in the plane and let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; be its inner region. For every positive real &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; denote the collection of squares in the plane bounded by the lines &lt;math&gt;x=m\delta, y=m\delta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; runs through the set of integers. Then, for this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\overline{R}&lt;/math&gt; into a finite number of non-overlapping subregions in such a manner that

(i) Each one of the subregions contained in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, say &lt;math&gt;R_{1}, R_2,\ldots, R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, is a square from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;.

(ii) Each one of the remaining subregions, say &lt;math&gt;R_{k+1},\ldots,R_s&lt;/math&gt;, has as boundary a rectifiable Jordan curve formed by a finite number of arcs of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and parts of the sides of some square from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;.

(iii) Each one of the border regions &lt;math&gt;R_{k+1},\ldots,R_s&lt;/math&gt; can be enclosed in a square of edge-length &lt;math&gt;2\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

(iv) If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the positively oriented boundary curve of &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2+\cdots+\Gamma_s.&lt;/math&gt;

(v) The number &lt;math&gt;s-k &lt;/math&gt; of border regions is no greater than &lt;math&gt;4\!\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\delta} + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the length of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma 2.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a rectifiable curve in the plane and let &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\Gamma(h)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of points in the plane whose distance from (the range of) &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is at most &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. The outer Jordan content of this set satisfies &lt;math&gt;\overline{c}\,\,\Delta_\Gamma(h)\le2h\Lambda +\pi h^2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Lemma 3.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a rectifiable curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;f:\text{range of }\Gamma\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous function. Then

: &lt;math&gt;\left\vert\int_\Gamma f(x,y)\,dy\right\vert&lt;/math&gt; and
: &lt;math&gt;\left\vert\int_\Gamma f(x,y)\,dx\right\vert&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\le\frac{1}{2} \Lambda\Omega_f,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\Omega_f&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillation of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the range of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we are in position to prove the Theorem:

'''Proof of Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary positive real number. By continuity of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and compactness of &lt;math&gt;\overline{R}&lt;/math&gt;, given &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\delta&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; such that whenever two points of &lt;math&gt;\overline{R}&lt;/math&gt; are less than &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{2}\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; apart, their images under &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are less than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; apart. For this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, consider the decomposition given by the previous Lemma. We have

: &lt;math&gt;\int_\Gamma A\,dx+B\,dy=\sum_{i=1}^k \int_{\Gamma_i} A\,dx+B\,dy\quad +\sum_{i=k+1}^s \int_{\Gamma_i}A\,dx+B\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

Put &lt;math&gt;\varphi:=D_1 B-D_2 A&lt;/math&gt;.

For each &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;, the curve &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is a positively oriented square, for which Green's formula holds. Hence

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k \int_{\Gamma_i}A\,dx + B\,dy =\sum_{i=1}^k \int_{R_i} \,\, \varphi = \int_{\bigcup_{i=1}^k R_i}\,\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Every point of a border region is at a distance no greater than &lt;math&gt;2\sqrt{2}\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the union of all border regions, then &lt;math&gt;K\subset \Delta_{\Gamma}(2\sqrt{2}\,\delta)&lt;/math&gt;; hence &lt;math&gt;c(K)\le\overline{c}\,\Delta_{\Gamma}(2\sqrt{2}\,\delta)\le 4\sqrt{2}\,\delta+8\pi\delta^2&lt;/math&gt;, by Lemma 2. Notice that

: &lt;math&gt;\int_R \varphi\,\,-\int_{\bigcup_{i=1}^k R_i} \varphi=\int_K \varphi.&lt;/math&gt; This yields

: &lt;math&gt;\left\vert\sum_{i=1}^k \int_{\Gamma_i} A\,dx+B\,dy\quad-\int_R\varphi \right\vert \le M \delta(1+\pi\sqrt{2}\,\delta) \text{ for some } M&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

We may as well choose &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; so that the RHS of the last inequality is &lt;math&gt;&lt;\varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The remark in the beginning of this proof implies that the oscillations of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; on every border region is at most &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. We have

: &lt;math&gt;\left\vert\sum_{i=k+1}^s \int_{\Gamma_i}A\,dx+B\,dy\right\vert\le\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon\sum_{i=k+1}^s \Lambda_i.&lt;/math&gt;

By Lemma 1(iii),

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=k+1}^s \Lambda_i \le\Lambda + (4\delta)\,4\!\left(\frac{\Lambda}{\delta}+1\right)\le17\Lambda+16.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these, we finally get

: &lt;math&gt;\left\vert\int_\Gamma A\,dx+B\,dy\quad-\int_R \varphi\right\vert&lt; C \varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

for some &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is true for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we are done.

== Validity under different hypothesis ==
The hypothesis of the last theorem are not the only ones under which Green's formula is true. Another common set of conditions is the following:

The functions &lt;math&gt;A, B:\overline{R}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are still assumed to be continuous. However, we now require them to be Fréchet-differentiable at every point of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This implies the existence of all directional derivatives, in particular &lt;math&gt;D_{e_i}A=:D_i A, D_{e_i}B=:D_i B, \,i=1,2&lt;/math&gt;, where, as usual, &lt;math&gt;(e_1,e_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the canonical ordered basis of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we require the function &lt;math&gt;D_1 B-D_2 A&lt;/math&gt; to be Riemann-integrable over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

It suffices to prove this for squares which are contained in &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and have sides parallel to the axes. The proof then follows the lines of the method employed to prove the Cauchy-Goursat Theorem for triangles.

As a corollary of this, we get the Cauchy Integral Theorem for rectifiable Jordan curves:

'''Theorem (Cauchy).''' If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a rectifiable Jordan curve in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;f:\text{closure of inner region of } \Gamma \longrightarrow \mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous mapping holomorphic throughout the inner region of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;\int_\Gamma f=0,&lt;/math&gt;

the integral being a complex contour integral.

'''Proof.''' We regard the complex plane as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, define &lt;math&gt;u,v:\overline{R}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; to be such that &lt;math&gt;f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y).&lt;/math&gt; These functions are clearly continuous. It is well-known that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are Fréchet-differentiable and that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations: &lt;math&gt;D_1 v+D_2 u=D_1 u-D_2 v =\text{zero function}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, analysing the sums used to define the complex contour integral in question, it is easy to realize that

: &lt;math&gt;\int_\Gamma f=\int_\Gamma u\,dx-v\,dy\quad+i\int_\Gamma v\,dx+u\,dy,&lt;/math&gt;

the integrals on the RHS being usual line integrals. These remarks allow us to apply Green's Theorem to each one of these line integrals, finishing the proof.

=== Measure-theoretic assumptions ===
Green's formula also holds when, besides continuity assumptions,

(i) The functions &lt;math&gt;D_i A, D_i B, \,i=1,2&lt;/math&gt;, are defined at every point of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, with the exception of a countable subset.

(ii) The function &lt;math&gt;D_1 B-D_2 A&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue-integrable over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Multiply-connected regions ==
'''Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0,\Gamma_1,\ldots,\Gamma_n&lt;/math&gt; be positively oriented rectifiable Jordan curves in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_i \subset R_0,&amp;&amp;\text{if } 1\le i\le n\\
\Gamma_i \subset \mathbf{R}^2\smallsetminus \overline{R}_j,&amp;&amp;\text{if }1\le i,j \le n\text{ and }i\ne j,
\end{aligned}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is the inner region of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;. Let

: &lt;math&gt;D=R_0 \smallsetminus (\overline{R}_1 \cup \overline{R}_2 \cup \cdots \cup \overline{R}_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose &lt;math&gt;p:\overline{D}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q:\overline{D}\longrightarrow\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; are continuous functions whose restriction to &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is Fréchet-differentiable. If the function

: &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\longmapsto\frac{\partial q}{\partial e_1}(x,y)-\frac{\partial p}{\partial e_2}(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

is Riemann-integrable over &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \int_{\Gamma_0} p(x,y)\,dx+q(x,y)\,dy-\sum_{i=1}^n \int_{\Gamma_i} p(x,y)\,dx + q(x,y)\,dy \\[5pt]

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to Stokes' theorem==
Green's theorem is a special case of the [[Stokes' theorem#Kelvin–Stokes theorem|Kelvin–Stokes theorem]], when applied to a region in the ''xy''-plane:

We can augment the two-dimensional field into a three-dimensional field with a ''z'' component that is always 0. Write '''F''' for the [[Euclidean vector|vector]]-valued function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=(L,M,0)&lt;/math&gt;. Start with the left side of Green's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C (L\, dx + M\, dy) = \oint_C (L, M, 0) \cdot (dx, dy, dz) = \oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The Kelvin–Stokes theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\hat n} \, dS. &lt;/math&gt;

The surface &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is just the region in the plane &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, with the unit normals &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}&lt;/math&gt; pointing up (in the positive ''z'' direction) to match the "positive orientation" definitions for both theorems.

The expression inside the integral becomes 
: &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\hat n} = \left[ \left(\frac{\partial 0}{\partial y}  - \frac{\partial M}{\partial z}\right) \mathbf{i} + \left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial 0}{\partial x}\right) \mathbf{j} + \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right) \mathbf{k} \right] \cdot \mathbf{k} = \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we get the right side of Green's theorem

:&lt;math&gt;\iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{\hat n} \, dS = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right) \, dA. &lt;/math&gt;

Green's theorem is also a straightforward result of the general Stokes' theorem using [[differential form]]s and [[exterior derivative]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \oint_C L \,dx + M \,dy = \oint_{\partial D} \omega = \int_D \,d\omega \\[5pt]
= {} &amp; \int_D \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \,dy \wedge \,dx + \frac{\partial M}{\partial x} \,dx \wedge \,dy = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \right) \,dx \,dy.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to the divergence theorem==
Considering only two-dimensional vector fields, Green's theorem is equivalent to the two-dimensional version of the [[divergence theorem]]:

:{{oiint
| preintegral = &lt;math&gt;\iiint_V\left(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{F}\right)\,dV=&lt;/math&gt;
| intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;\partial \scriptstyle V&lt;/math&gt;
| integrand = &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{n})\,dS .&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the divergence on the two-dimensional vector field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}&lt;/math&gt; is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary.

To see this, consider the unit normal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat n}&lt;/math&gt; in the right side of the equation. Since in Green's theorem &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r} = (dx, dy)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector pointing tangential along the curve, and the curve ''C'' is the positively oriented (i.e. anticlockwise) curve along the boundary, an outward normal would be a vector which points 90° to the right of this; one choice would be &lt;math&gt;(dy, -dx)&lt;/math&gt;. The length of this vector is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2} = ds.&lt;/math&gt; So &lt;math&gt;(dy, -dx) = \mathbf{\hat n}\,ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Start with the left side of Green's theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C (L\, dx + M\, dy) = \oint_C (M, -L) \cdot (dy, -dx) = \oint_C (M, -L) \cdot \mathbf{\hat n}\,ds.&lt;/math&gt;
Applying the two-dimensional divergence theorem with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = (M, -L)&lt;/math&gt;, we get the right side of Green's theorem:
:&lt;math&gt;\oint_C (M, -L) \cdot \mathbf{\hat n}\,ds = \iint_D\left(\nabla \cdot (M, -L) \right) \, dA = \iint_D \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y}\right) \, dA.&lt;/math&gt;

==Area calculation==
Green's theorem can be used to compute area by line integral.&lt;ref name="stuart"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=James|title=Calculus|publisher=Thomson, Brooks/Cole|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of ''D'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;A = \iint_D dA.&lt;/math&gt;

Then if we choose ''L'' and ''M'' such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial M}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the area is given by

:&lt;math&gt;A = \oint_{C} (L\, dx + M\, dy).&lt;/math&gt;

Possible formulas for the area of ''D'' include&lt;ref name="stuart" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A=\oint_C x\, dy = -\oint_C y\, dx = \tfrac 12 \oint_C (-y\, dx + x\, dy).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[graph theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''Herschel graph''' is a [[bipartite graph|bipartite]] [[undirected graph]] with 11 vertices and 18 edges, the smallest [[Hamiltonian graph|non-Hamiltonian]] [[polyhedral graph|polyhedral]] graph. It is named after British astronomer [[Alexander Stewart Herschel]], who wrote an early paper concerning [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s [[icosian game]]: the Herschel graph describes the smallest [[convex polyhedron]] for which this game has no solution. However, Herschel's paper described solutions for the Icosian game only on the graphs of the [[regular tetrahedron]] and [[regular icosahedron]]; it did not describe the Herschel graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Herschel|first=A. S.|authorlink=Alexander Stewart Herschel|title=Sir Wm. Hamilton's Icosian Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA305|journal=[[The Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics]]|volume=5|page=305|year=1862}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The Herschel graph is a [[planar graph]]: it can be drawn in the plane with none of its edges crossing. It is also [[vertex connectivity|3-vertex-connected]]: the removal of any two of its vertices leaves a connected [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]]. Therefore, by [[Steinitz's theorem]], the Herschel graph is a [[polyhedral graph]]: there exists a convex polyhedron (an [[enneahedron]]) having the Herschel graph as its [[skeleton (topology)|skeleton]].&lt;ref name="Coxeter"&gt;{{citation|title=[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|publisher=Dover|year=1973|page=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Herschel graph is also a [[bipartite graph]]: its vertices can be separated into two subsets of five and six vertices respectively, such that every edge has an endpoint in each subset (the red and blue subsets in the picture).

As with any bipartite graph, the Herschel graph is a [[perfect graph]] : the [[chromatic number]] of every [[induced subgraph]] equals the size of the largest [[Glossary of graph theory#Cliques|clique]] of that subgraph. It has also [[chromatic index]] 4, girth 4, radius 3 and diameter 4.

==Hamiltonicity==
Because it is a bipartite graph that has an odd number of vertices, the Herschel graph does not contain a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] (a cycle of edges that passes through each vertex exactly once). For, in any bipartite graph, any cycle must alternate between the vertices on either side of the bipartition, and therefore must contain equal numbers of both types of vertex and must have an even length. Thus, a cycle passing once through each of the eleven vertices cannot exist in the Herschel graph. It is the smallest non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph, whether the size of the graph is measured in terms of its number of vertices, edges, or faces;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hamiltonian circuits on 3-polytopes|first1=David|last1=Barnette|first2=Ernest|last2=Jucovič|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory|volume=9|issue=1|year=1970|pages=54–59|doi=10.1016/S0021-9800(70)80054-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there exist other polyhedral graphs with 11 vertices and no Hamiltonian cycles (notably the [[Goldner–Harary graph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{mathworld|title=Goldner-Harary Graph|urlname=Goldner-HararyGraph}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) but none with fewer edges.&lt;ref name="Coxeter"/&gt;

All but three of the vertices of the Herschel graph have degree three; [[Tait's conjecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P. G.|last=Tait|authorlink=P. G. Tait|title=Listing's ''Topologie''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VMwAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=5th Series|volume=17|year=1884|pages=30–46}}. Reprinted in ''Scientific Papers'', Vol. II, pp. 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt; states that a polyhedral graph in which [[cubic graph|every vertex has degree three]] must be Hamiltonian, but this was disproved when [[W. T. Tutte]] provided a counterexample, the much larger [[Tutte graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=W. T.|last=Tutte|authorlink=W. T. Tutte|title=On Hamiltonian circuits|year=1946|url=http://jlms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s1-21/2/98.pdf | doi = 10.1112/jlms/s1-21.2.98|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=21|issue=2|pages=98–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A refinement of Tait's conjecture, [[Barnette's conjecture]] that every bipartite 3-regular polyhedral graph is Hamiltonian, remains open.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/?q=op/barnettes_conjecture |title=Barnette's conjecture|publisher=the Open Problem Garden|first=Robert |last=Samal
|date=11 June 2007| accessdate=24 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herschel graph also provides an example of a polyhedral graph for which the [[medial graph]] cannot be decomposed into two edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. The medial graph of the Herschel graph is a 4-[[regular graph]] with 18 vertices, one for each edge of the Herschel graph; two vertices are adjacent in the medial graph whenever the corresponding edges of the Herschel graph are consecutive on one of its faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in 4-regular planar graphs|first1=J.

The '''Hosoya index''', also known as the '''Z index''', of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the total number of [[Matching (graph theory)|matchings]] in it. The Hosoya index is always at least one, because the [[empty set]] of edges is counted as a matching for this purpose. Equivalently, the Hosoya index is the number of non-empty matchings plus one.

==History==
This [[graph invariant]] was introduced by [[Haruo Hosoya]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochempress.com/iejmd_ji.html Internet Electronic Journal of Molecular Design], special issues dedicated to Professor Haruo Hosoya on the occasion of the 65th birthday: Volume 1 (2002), Number 9 — Volume 2 (2003), Number 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article  "The Topological Index Z Before and After 1971" on the history of the notion and the associated inside stories, Hosoya writes that he introduced the Z index to report a good correlation of the [[boiling point]]s of [[alkane]] [[isomers]] and their Z indices, basing on his unpublished 1957 work carried out while he was an undergraduate student at the [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=before/&gt;

==Example==
A linear [[alkane]], for the purposes of the Hosoya index, may be represented as a [[path graph]] without any branching. A path with one vertex and no edges (corresponding to the [[methane]] molecule) has one (empty) matching, so its Hosoya index is one; a path with one edge ([[ethane]]) has two matchings (one with zero edges and one with one edges), so its Hosoya index is two. [[Propane]] (a length-two path) has three matchings: either of its edges, or the empty matching. ''n''-[[butane]] (a length-three path) has five matchings, distinguishing it from [[isobutane]] which has four. More generally, a matching in a path with ''k'' edges either forms a matching in the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 edges, or it forms a matching in the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 edges together with the final edge of the path. Thus, the Hosoya indices of linear alkanes obey the recurrence governing the [[Fibonacci number]]s. The structure of the matchings in these graphs may be visualized using a [[Fibonacci cube]].

The largest possible value of the Hosoya index, on a graph with ''n'' vertices, is given by the [[complete graph]], and the Hosoya indices for the complete graphs are the [[Telephone number (mathematics)|telephone numbers]]

Ibn al-Banna' (lit. the son of the architect) was born in [[Marrakesh]] in 1256; he is named al‐Marrākushī after that city.&lt;ref name=sarton&gt;G. Sarton: Introduction to the History of Science; The Carnegie Institution; Washington; 1927; vol 2; p. 998.&lt;/ref&gt; Having learned basic mathematical and geometrical skills, he translated [[Euclid's Elements]] into [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name="sarton"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Banna|title=al-Marrakushi ibn Al-Banna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jabbar&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jabbar, Ahmed |author2=Ablagh, Mohammed |title=Life and Works of Ibn al-Banaa al-Murrakushi |publisher=Faculty of Letters |location=Rabat |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Hockey, Thomas | display-editors=etal | last=Samsó | first=Julio | title=Ibn al‐Bannāʾ: Abū al‐ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿUthmān al‐Azdī al‐Marrākushī | encyclopedia=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers | publisher=Springer | date=2007 | location=New York | pages=551–2 | url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_al-Banna%27_BEA.htm | isbn=978-0-387-31022-0}} ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Ibn_al-Banna%27_BEA.pdf PDF version])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vernet&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Vernet | first=J. | title=Ibn Al-Bannā Al Marrākushī  | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830900255.html | encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography|Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography]] | publisher=[[Encyclopedia.com]] | origyear=1970–1980 | date=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Ibn al-Banna' wrote between 51 and 74 treatises, encompassing such varied topics as  [[Algebra]], [[Astronomy]], [[Linguistics]], [[Rhetoric]], and [[Logic]]. One of his works, called ''Talkhīṣ ʿamal al-ḥisāb ([[Arabic]], '''تلخيص أعمال الحساب''' ) (Summary of arithmetical operations)'', includes topics such as fractions, sums of squares and cubes etc. Another, called ''Tanbīh al-Albāb'',&lt;ref&gt;A Djebbar: Mathematics in medieval Maghreb; AMUCHMA-Newsletter 15; Universidade Pedagógico (UP), Maputo (Mozambique), 15.9.1995.&lt;/ref&gt; covers topics  related to:

* calculations regarding the drop in irrigation canal levels,
* arithmetical explanation of the [[Muslim]] laws of inheritance
* determination of the hour of the [[Asr]] prayer,
* explanation of frauds linked to instruments of measurement,
* enumeration of delayed prayers which have to be said in a precise order, and
* calculation of legal tax in the case of a delayed payment

He also wrote ''Rafʿ al-Ḥijāb (Lifting the Veil)'' which covered topics such as computing [[square roots]] of a number and the theory of [[continued fractions]].&lt;ref name="sarton"/&gt; This was the first mathematical work since [[Brahmagupta]] to use an algebraic notation, further developed by [[Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī]] two centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Banna|title=al-Marrakushi ibn Al-Banna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The crater [[Al-Marrakushi (crater)|Al-Marrakushi]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5883">In [[mathematics]], an '''integer-valued polynomial''' (also known as a '''numerical polynomial''') ''P''(''t'') is a [[polynomial]] whose value ''P''(''n'') is an [[integer]] for every integer ''n''. Every polynomial with integer [[coefficient]]s is integer-valued, but the converse is not true. For example, the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} t^2 + \frac{1}{2} t=\frac{1}{2}t(t+1)&lt;/math&gt;

takes on integer values whenever ''t'' is an integer.  That is because one of ''t'' and ''t'' + 1 must be an [[even number]]. (The values this polynomial takes are the [[triangular number]]s.)

Integer-valued polynomials are objects of study in their own right in algebra, and frequently appear in [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Commutative Algebra: Recent Advances in Commutative Rings, Integer-Valued Polynomials, and Polynomial Functions|editor1-first=Marco|editor1-last=Fontana|editor2-first=Sophie|editor2-last=Frisch|editor3-first=Sarah|editor3-last=Glaz|editor3-link=Sarah Glaz|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781493909254|contribution=Stable homotopy theory, formal group laws, and integer-valued polynomials|first=Keith|last=Johnson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZZEpBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213|pages=213–224}}. See in particular pp.&amp;nbsp;213–214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The class of integer-valued polynomials was described fully by {{harvtxt|Pólya|1915}}. Inside the [[polynomial ring]] '''Q'''[''t''] of polynomials with [[rational number]] coefficients, the [[subring]] of integer-valued polynomials is a [[free abelian group]]. It has as [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] the polynomials

:''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') = ''t''(''t'' &amp;minus; 1)...(''t'' &amp;minus; ''k'' + 1)/''k''!

for ''k'' = 0,1,2, ..., i.e., the [[binomial coefficient]]s.  In other words, every integer-valued polynomial can be written as an integer [[linear combination]] of binomial coefficients in exactly one way.  The proof is by the method of [[Difference operator|discrete Taylor series]]: binomial coefficients are integer-valued polynomials, and conversely, the discrete difference of an integer series is an integer series, so the discrete Taylor series of an integer series generated by a polynomial has integer coefficients (and is a finite series).

==Fixed prime divisors==
Integer-valued polynomials may be used effectively to solve questions about fixed divisors of polynomials. For example, the polynomials ''P'' with integer coefficients that always take on even number values are just those such that ''P''/2 is integer valued. Those in turn are the polynomials that may be expressed as a linear combination with even integer coefficients of the binomial coefficients.

In questions of prime number theory, such as [[Schinzel's hypothesis H]] and the [[Bateman–Horn conjecture]], it is a matter of basic importance to understand the case when ''P'' has no fixed prime divisor (this has been called ''Bunyakovsky's property''{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}, after [[Viktor Bunyakovsky]]). By writing ''P'' in terms of the binomial coefficients, we see the highest fixed prime divisor is also the highest prime [[common factor]] of the coefficients in such a representation. So Bunyakovsky's property is equivalent to coprime coefficients.

As an example, the pair of polynomials ''n'' and ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 violates this condition at ''p'' = 3: for every ''n'' the product

:''n''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2)

is divisible by 3. Consequently, there cannot be infinitely many prime pairs ''n'' and ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2. The divisibility is attributable to the alternate representation

:''n''(''n'' + 1)(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) + 3''n''.

==Other rings==
Numerical polynomials can be defined over other rings and fields, in which case the integer-valued polynomials above are referred to as '''classical numerical polynomials'''.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Applications==
The [[topological K-theory|K-theory]] of [[Classifying space for U(n)|BU(''n'')]] is numerical (symmetric) polynomials.

The [[Hilbert polynomial]] of a polynomial ring in ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 variables is the numerical polynomial &lt;math&gt;\binom{t+k}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Legendre transformation.png|thumb|256px|right|The function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is defined on the interval {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}}. The difference {{math|''px'' − ''f''(''x'')}} takes a maximum at {{math|''x'''}}. Thus, {{math|''f''*(''p'') {{=}} ''px' − f(x')''}}.]]
In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Legendre transformation''', named after [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]], is an [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[List of transforms|transformation]] on the [[real number|real]]-valued [[convex function]]s of one real variable. It is commonly used in [[classical mechanics]] to derive the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism out of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] formalism and in [[thermodynamics]] to derive the [[thermodynamic potential]]s, as well as in the solution of [[differential equation]]s of several variables.

For sufficiently smooth functions on the real line, the Legendre transform {{mvar|''f*''}} of a function {{mvar|f}} can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions' first derivatives are inverse functions of each other.  This can be expressed in [[Notation for differentiation#Euler.27s notation|Euler's derivative notation]] as
:&lt;math&gt;Df = \left( D f^* \right)^{-1}~,&lt;/math&gt;
or, equivalently, as &lt;math&gt;f'(f^{*\prime}(x^*)) = x^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{*\prime}(f'(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt; in [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange.27s notation|Lagrange's notation]].

The generalization of the Legendre transformation to affine spaces and non-convex functions is known as the [[convex conjugate]] (also called the Legendre–Fenchel transformation), which can be used to construct a function's [[convex hull]].

==Definition==

Let {{math|''I'' ⊂ ℝ}} be an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]], and {{math|''f'' : ''I'' → ℝ}} a [[convex function]]; then its ''Legendre transform'' is the function {{math|''f*'' : ''I*'' → ℝ}} defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x\in I}(x^*x-f(x)),\quad x^*\in I^*&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], and the [[Domain of a function|domain]] &lt;math&gt;I^*&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;I^*= \left \{x^*\in \R:\sup_{x\in I}(x^*x-f(x))&lt;\infty \right \} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The transform is always well-defined when {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is [[convex function|convex]].

The generalization to convex functions {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ℝ}} on a convex set {{math|''X'' ⊂ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is straightforward: {{math|''f *'' : ''X*'' → ℝ}} has domain
:&lt;math&gt;X^*= \left \{x^* \in \R^n:\sup_{x\in X}(\langle x^*,x\rangle-f(x))&lt;\infty \right \}&lt;/math&gt;
and is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(x^*) = \sup_{x\in X}(\langle x^*,x\rangle-f(x)),\quad x^*\in X^*   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\langle x^*,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[dot product]] of {{math|''x''*}} and {{mvar|x}}.

The function {{math|''f'' *}} is called the [[convex conjugate]] function of {{mvar|f}}. For historical reasons (rooted in analytic mechanics), the conjugate variable is often denoted {{mvar|p}}, instead of {{math|''x''*}}.  If the convex function {{mvar|f}} is defined on the whole line and is everywhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], then
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(p)=\sup_{x\in I}(px-f(x))&lt;/math&gt;
can be interpreted as the negative of the [[y-intercept|{{math|''y''}}-intercept]] of the [[tangent line]] to the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of {{mvar|f}} that has slope {{mvar|p}}.

The Legendre transformation is an application of the [[Duality (projective geometry)|duality]] relationship between points and lines. The functional relationship specified by {{mvar|f}} can be represented equally well as a set of {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} points, or as a set of tangent lines specified by their slope and intercept values.

===Understanding the transform in terms of derivatives===

For differentiable convex functions &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;
on the real line with an invertible first derivative, the Legendre transform &lt;math&gt; f^*&lt;/math&gt;
can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions' first 
derivatives are inverse functions of each other.

To see this, first note that if  &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable and &lt;math&gt; \overline{x} &lt;/math&gt; is a critical point
of the function of &lt;math&gt; x \mapsto p \cdot x -f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, then the
supremum is achieved at &lt;math&gt; \overline{x}&lt;/math&gt; (by convexity). 
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; f^*(p)= p \cdot \overline{x} - f(\overline{x})&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is invertible and let &lt;math&gt; h &lt;/math&gt; denote its inverse.
Then for each &lt;math&gt; p&lt;/math&gt;, the point &lt;math&gt; h(p)&lt;/math&gt;  is the unique critical point of
&lt;math&gt; x \mapsto px -f(x) &lt;/math&gt;.  Indeed,  &lt;math&gt; f'(h(p))=p &lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt; p-f'(h(p))=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Hence we have &lt;math&gt; f^*(p) = p \cdot h(p) - f(h(p))&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt; p&lt;/math&gt;. 
By differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt; p&lt;/math&gt; we find 
:&lt;math&gt;(f^*)'(p) =  h(p)+ p \cdot h'(p) - f'(h(p)) \cdot h'(p).&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; f'(h(p))=p&lt;/math&gt; this simplifies to  &lt;math&gt;(f^*)'(p) =  h(p)&lt;/math&gt;.
In other words,  &lt;math&gt;(f^*)'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; are inverses.

In general, if &lt;math&gt; g' &lt;/math&gt; is an inverse of &lt;math&gt; f' &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; g' = (f^*)' &lt;/math&gt; 
and so integration provides a constant &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; so that  &lt;math&gt; f^* = g +c &lt;/math&gt;.

In practical terms, given {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, the parametric plot of {{math|''xf'' '(''x'') − ''f''(''x'')}} versus {{math|''f'' '(''x'')}} amounts to the graph of  {{math| ''g''(''p'')}} versus {{mvar|p}}.

In some cases (e.g. thermodynamic potentials, below), a non-standard requirement is used, amounting to an alternative definition of {{math|''f'' *}} with a ''minus sign'',
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) - f^*(p) = xp.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*The Legendre transform of a convex function is convex.

: Let us show this for the case of a doubly differentiable {{mvar|f}} with a non zero (and hence positive, due to convexity) double derivative.

: For a fixed {{mvar|p}}, let {{mvar|x}} maximize {{math|''px'' − ''f''(''x'')}}. Then {{math|''f'' *(''p'') {{=}} ''px'' − ''f''(''x'')}}, noting that {{mvar|x}} depends on {{mvar|p}}.  Thus,

:: &lt;math&gt;f^\prime(x) = p ~.&lt;/math&gt;

: The derivative of {{mvar|f}} is itself differentiable with a positive derivative and hence strictly monotonic and invertible.

: Thus {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''g''(''p'')}} where &lt;math&gt;g \equiv (f^{\prime})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that {{math|''g''}} is defined so that &lt;math&gt;f'(g(p))= p&lt;/math&gt;.

: Note that {{mvar|g}} is also differentiable with the following derivative,

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dg(p)}{dp} = \frac{1}{f''(g(p))} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

: Thus {{math|''f'' *(''p'') {{=}} ''pg''(''p'') − ''f''(''g''(''p''))}} is the composition of differentiable functions, hence differentiable.

: Applying the [[product rule]] and the [[chain rule]] yields

:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d(f^{*})}{dp} &amp;= g(p) +  \left(p - f'(g(p))\right)\cdot \frac{dg(p)}{dp}\\[4pt]
&amp; =  g(p),
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

: giving

:: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^2(f^{*})}{dp^2} = \frac{dg(p)}{dp} = \frac{1}{f''(g(p))} &gt; 0,
&lt;/math&gt;

: so {{math|''f'' *}} is convex.

*It follows that the Legendre transformation is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], i.e., {{math|''f'' ** {{=}} ''f''}}:

: By using the above equalities for {{math|''g''(''p'')}}, {{math|''f'' *(''p'')}} and its derivative,

:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f^{**}(x) &amp;{} = \left(x\cdot p_s - f^{*}(p_s)\right)_{|\frac{d}{dp}f^{*}(p=p_s) = x} \\[5pt]
&amp;{} = g(p_s)\cdot p_s - f^{*}(p_s) \\[5pt]
&amp;{} = f(g(p_s)) \\[5pt]
&amp;{} =  f(x)~.
\end{align}  &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Example 1===
[[Image:LegendreExample.svg|right|thumb|200px|e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is plotted in red and its Legendre transform in dashed blue.]]
The [[exponential function]]
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = e^x &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;  has &lt;math&gt;\qquad  f^*(p) = p ( \ln p - 1 ) &lt;/math&gt;
as a Legendre transform, since their respective first derivatives {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|ln ''p''}} are inverse functions of each other.

This example illustrates how the respective [[domain (mathematics)|domain]]s of a function and its Legendre transform need not agree.

===Example 2===
Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''cx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} defined on ℝ, where {{math|''c'' &gt; 0}} is a fixed constant.

For {{math|''x''*}} fixed, the function of {{mvar|x}}, {{math|''x''*''x'' – ''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''*''x'' – ''cx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} has the first derivative {{math|''x''* – 2''cx''}} and second derivative {{math|−2''c''}}; there is one stationary point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''*/2''c''}}, which is always a maximum.

Thus, {{math|''I''* {{=}} ℝ}} and
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(x^*)=\frac{{x^*}^2}{4c}  ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The first derivatives of  {{math|''f''}},  2{{math|''cx''}}, and of {{math|''f'' *}},  {{math|''x''*/(2''c'')}}, are inverse functions to each other. Clearly, furthermore,
:&lt;math&gt;f^{**}(x)=\frac{1}{4 (1/4c)}x^2=cx^2~,&lt;/math&gt;
namely {{math|''f'' ** {{=}} ''f''}}.

===Example 3===
Let {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''x'' ∈ ''I'' {{=}} [2, 3]}}.

For {{math|''x''*}} fixed, {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''(''x'')}} is continuous on {{mvar|I}} [[compact space|compact]], hence it always takes a finite maximum on it; it follows that {{math|''I''* {{=}} ℝ}}.

The stationary point at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''*/2}} is in the domain {{math|[2, 3]}} if and only if {{math|4 ≤ ''x''* ≤ 6}}, otherwise the maximum is taken either at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2}}, or {{math|''x'' {{=}} 3}}. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(x^*)=\begin{cases}2x^*-4, &amp; x^*&lt;4\\ \frac{{x^*}^2}{4}, &amp; 4\leqslant x^*\leqslant 6,\\3x^*-9, &amp; x^*&gt;6.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 4===
The function {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''cx''}} is convex, for every {{mvar|x}} (strict convexity is not required for the Legendre transformation to be well defined). Clearly {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''(''x'') {{=}} (''x''* − ''c'')''x''}} is never bounded from above as a function of {{mvar|x}}, unless {{math|''x''* − ''c'' {{=}} 0}}. Hence {{math|''f''*}} is defined on {{math|''I''* {{=}} {''c''}}} and {{math|''f''*(''c'') {{=}} 0}}.

One may check involutivity: of course {{math|''x''*''x'' − ''f''*(''x''*)}} is always bounded as a function of {{math|''x''* ∈ {''c''}}}, hence  {{math|''I'' ** {{=}} ℝ}}. Then, for all {{mvar|x}} one has
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x^*\in\{c\}}(xx^*-f^*(x^*))=xc,&lt;/math&gt;
and hence {{math|''f'' **(''x'') {{=}} ''cx'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}}.

===Example 5: several variables===
Let
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\langle x,Ax\rangle+c&lt;/math&gt;
be defined on {{math|''X'' {{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|A}} is a real, positive definite matrix.

Then {{mvar|f}} is convex, and
:&lt;math&gt;\langle p,x\rangle-f(x)=\langle p,x \rangle-\langle x,Ax\rangle-c,&lt;/math&gt;
has gradient {{math|''p'' − 2''Ax''}} and [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] {{math|−2''A''}}, which is negative; hence the stationary point {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''p''/2}} is a maximum.

We have {{math|''X''* {{=}} ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and
:&lt;math&gt;f^*(p)=\frac14\langle p,A^{-1}p\rangle-c.&lt;/math&gt;

==Behavior of differentials under Legendre transforms==
The Legendre transform is linked to [[integration by parts]], &amp;nbsp;  {{math|''pdx'' {{=}} ''d''(''px'') − ''xdp''}}.

Let {{mvar|f}} be a function of two independent variables {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, with the differential
:&lt;math&gt;df = {\partial f \over \partial x}\,dx + {\partial f \over \partial y}\,dy = p\,dx + v\,dy.&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that it is convex in {{mvar|x}} for all {{mvar|y}}, so that one may perform the Legendre transform in {{mvar|x}}, with {{mvar|p}} the variable conjugate to {{mvar|x}}. Since the new independent variable is {{mvar|p}}, the differentials {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}}  devolve to {{math|''dp''}} and {{math|''dy''}}, i.e., we build another function with its differential expressed in terms of the new basis {{math|''dp''}} and {{math|''dy''}}.

We thus consider the function {{math|''g''(''p'', ''y'') {{=}} ''f'' − ''px''}}  so that
:&lt;math&gt;dg = df - p\,dx - x\,dp = -x\,dp + v\,dy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x = -\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function {{math|''-g''(''p'', ''y'')}} is the Legendre transform of {{math|''f''(''x'', ''y'')}}, where only the independent variable {{mvar|x}} has been supplanted by {{mvar|p}}. This is widely used in thermodynamics, as illustrated below.

==Applications==

===Hamilton–Lagrange mechanics===
A Legendre transform is used in [[classical mechanics]] to derive the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formulation]] from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian formulation]], and conversely. A typical Lagrangian has the form

:&lt;math&gt;L(v,q)=\tfrac{1}2\langle v,Mv\rangle-V(q),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(v,q)&lt;/math&gt;  are coordinates on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|M}} is a positive real matrix, and

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x,y\rangle=\sum_jx_jy_j.&lt;/math&gt;

For every {{mvar|q}} fixed, &lt;math&gt;L(v, q)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex function of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;V(q)&lt;/math&gt; plays the role of a constant.

Hence the Legendre transform of &lt;math&gt;L(v, q)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of {{mvar|v}}  is the Hamiltonian function,

:&lt;math&gt;H(p,q)=\tfrac 12\langle p,M^{-1}p\rangle+V(q)&lt;/math&gt;.

In a more general setting, &lt;math&gt;(v, q)&lt;/math&gt; are local coordinates on the tangent bundle &lt;math&gt;T\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt; of a manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;. For each {{mvar|q}}, &lt;math&gt;L(v, q)&lt;/math&gt; is a convex function of the tangent space {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The Legendre transform gives the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H(p, q)&lt;/math&gt; as a function of the coordinates {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} of the cotangent bundle &lt;math&gt;T^*\mathcal M&lt;/math&gt;; the inner product used to define the Legendre transform is inherited from the pertinent canonical [[symplectic vector space|symplectic structure]].

===Thermodynamics===
The strategy behind the use of Legendre transforms in thermodynamics is to shift from a function that depends on a variable to a new (conjugate) function that depends on a new variable, the conjugate of the original one. The new variable is the partial derivative of the original function with respect to the original variable. The new function is the difference between the original function and the product of the old and new variables. Typically, this transformation is useful because it shifts the dependence of, e.g., the energy from an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variable]] to its conjugate intensive variable, which can usually be controlled more easily in a physical experiment.

For example, the [[internal energy]] is an explicit function of the ''[[extensive quantity|extensive variables]]'' [[entropy]], [[volume]], and [[chemical composition]]

:&lt;math&gt; U = U \left (S,V,\{N_i\} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

which has a total differential

:&lt;math&gt; dU = T\,dS - P\,dV + \sum \mu_i \,dN _i.&lt;/math&gt;

By using the (non-standard) Legendre transform of the internal energy, {{mvar|U}}, with respect to volume, {{mvar|V}}, it is possible to define the [[enthalpy]] as

:&lt;math&gt; H = U + PV \, = H \left (S,P,\{N_i\} \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

which is an explicit function of the pressure, {{mvar|P}}. The enthalpy contains all of the same information as the internal energy, but is often easier to work with in situations where the pressure is constant.

It is likewise possible to shift the dependence of the energy from the extensive variable of entropy, {{mvar|S}}, to the (often more convenient) intensive variable {{mvar|T}}, resulting in the [[Helmholtz energy|Helmholtz]] and [[Gibbs energy|Gibbs]] [[thermodynamic free energy|free energies]]. The Helmholtz free energy, {{mvar|A}}, and Gibbs energy, {{mvar|G}}, are obtained by performing Legendre transforms of the internal energy and enthalpy, respectively,

:&lt;math&gt; A = U - TS ~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; G = H - TS = U + PV - TS ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The Helmholtz free energy is often the most useful thermodynamic potential when temperature and volume are held constant, while the Gibbs energy is often the most useful when temperature and pressure are held constant.

===An example – variable capacitor===
As another example from [[physics]], consider a parallel-plate [[capacitor]], in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the [[force]] acting on the plates. One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the "charge" of a [[gas]] in a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], with the resulting mechanical [[force]] exerted on a [[piston]].

Compute the force on the plates as a function of {{math|'''x'''}}, the distance which separates them. To find the force, compute the potential energy, and then apply the definition of force as the gradient of the potential energy function.

The energy stored in a capacitor of [[capacitance]] {{math|''C''('''x''')}} and charge {{math|''Q''}} is

:&lt;math&gt; U (Q, \mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} QV = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C(\mathbf{x})},~&lt;/math&gt;

where the dependence on the area of the plates, the dielectric constant of the material between the plates, and the separation {{math|'''x'''}} are abstracted away as the [[capacitance]] {{math|''C''('''x''')}}. (For a parallel plate capacitor, this is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the separation.)

The force {{math|'''F'''}} between the plates due to the electric field is then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{dU}{d\mathbf{x}} ~. &lt;/math&gt;

If the capacitor is not connected to any circuit, then the ''[[electric charge|charges]]'' on the plates remain constant as they move, and the force is the negative [[gradient]] of the [[electrostatics|electrostatic]] energy

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dC}{d\mathbf{x}} \frac{Q^2}{C^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

However, suppose, instead, that the ''[[volt]]age'' between the plates {{math|''V''}} is maintained constant by connection to a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], which is a reservoir for charge at constant potential difference; now the ''charge is variable'' instead of the voltage, its Legendre conjugate. To find the force, first compute the non-standard Legendre transform,

:&lt;math&gt;U^*  = U - \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial Q} \right)\bigg|_\mathbf{x} \cdot Q =U - \frac{1}{2C(\mathbf{x})} \left( \frac{\partial Q^2}{\partial Q} \right)\bigg|_\mathbf{x} \cdot Q = U - QV = \frac{1}{2} QV - QV = -\frac{1}{2} QV= - \tfrac{1}{2} V^2 C(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

The force now becomes the negative gradient of this Legendre transform, still pointing in the same direction,

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{dU^*}{d\mathbf{x}}~.&lt;/math&gt;

The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the [[linear]]ity of the [[capacitance]]—except now {{math|''Q''}} is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same "pull" between a capacitor's plates.

===Probability theory===
In [[large deviations theory]], the ''rate function'' is defined as the Legendre transformation of the logarithm of the [[moment generating function]] of a random variable. An important application of the rate function is in the calculation of tail probabilities of sums of i.i.d. random variables.

===Microeconomics===
Legendre transformation arises naturally in [[microeconomics]] in the process of finding the ''[[supply (economics)|supply]]'' {{math|''S''(''P'')}} of some product given a fixed price {{math|''P''}} on the market knowing the [[cost curve|cost function]] {{math|''C''(''Q'')}}, i.e. the cost for the producer to make/mine/etc. {{math|''Q''}} units of the given product.

A simple theory explains the shape of the supply curve based solely on the cost function. Let us suppose the market price for a one unit of our product is {{math|''P''}}. For a company selling this good, the best strategy is to adjust the production {{math|''Q''}} so that its profit is maximize. We can maximize the profit

:&lt;math&gt;\text{profit} = \text{revenue} - \text{costs} =  PQ - C(Q)&lt;/math&gt;

by differentiating with respect to {{math|''Q''}} and solving

:&lt;math&gt;P - C'(Q_{opt}) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

{{math|''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''opt''&lt;/sub&gt;}} represents the optimal quantity {{math|''Q''}} of goods that the producer is willing to supply, which is indeed the supply itself:
:&lt;math&gt;S(P) = Q_{opt}(P) = (C^')^{-1}(P)&lt;/math&gt;.
The functional forms of the profit as a function of quantity and as a function of price are therefore Legendre transformations of each other.

==Geometric interpretation==
For a [[strictly convex function]], the Legendre transformation can be interpreted as a mapping between the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the function and the family of [[tangent]]s of the graph. (For a function of one variable, the tangents are well-defined at all but at most [[countable set|countably many]] points, since a convex function is [[derivative|differentiable]] at all but at most countably many points.)

The equation of a line with [[slope]] {{math|''p''}} and [[y-intercept|{{math|''y''}}-intercept]] {{math|''b''}} is given by {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''px'' + ''b''}}. For this line to be tangent to the graph of a function {{mvar|f}} at the point {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;))}} requires
:&lt;math&gt;f\left(x_0\right) = p x_0 + b&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;p = f'(x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt;is strictly monotone as the derivative of a strictly convex function. The second equation can be solved for &lt;math&gt;x_0 = f^{\prime-1}(p)&lt;/math&gt;, allowing elimination of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} from the first, and solving for the {{math|''y''}}-intercept {{math|''b''}} of the tangent as a function of its slope {{math|''p''}},
:&lt;math&gt;b = f\left(f^{\prime-1}\left(p\right)\right) - p \cdot f^{\prime-1}\left(p\right) = -f^\star(p).&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;f^\star&lt;/math&gt; denotes the Legendre transform of {{mvar|f}}.

The [[indexed family|family]] of tangents of the graph of {{mvar|f}} parameterized by {{mvar|p}} is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;y = px - f^\star(p),&lt;/math&gt;
or, written implicitly, by the solutions of the equation
:&lt;math&gt;F(x,y,p) = y + f^\star(p) - px = 0~.&lt;/math&gt;

The graph of the original function can be reconstructed from this family of lines as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of this family by demanding
: &lt;math&gt;{\partial F(x,y,p)\over\partial p} = f^{\star\prime}(p) - x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Eliminating {{math|''p''}} from these two equations gives
: &lt;math&gt;y = x \cdot f^{\star\prime-1}(x) - f^\star\left(f^{\star\prime-1}(x)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Identifying {{math|''y''}} with {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and recognizing the right side of the preceding equation as the Legendre transform of {{math|''f''*}},  yields
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = f^{\star\star}(x) ~.&lt;/math&gt;

==Legendre transformation in more than one dimension==
For a differentiable real-valued function on an [[open set|open]] subset {{mvar|U}} of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} the Legendre conjugate of the pair {{math|(''U'', ''f'')}} is defined to be the pair {{math|(''V'', ''g'')}}, where {{mvar|V}} is the image of {{mvar|U}} under the [[gradient]] mapping {{math|''Df''}}, and {{mvar|g}} is the function on {{mvar|V}} given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;g(y) = \left\langle y, x \right\rangle - f(x), \qquad x = \left(Df\right)^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle u,v\right\rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n u_k \cdot v_k&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[scalar product]] on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The multidimensional transform can be interpreted as an encoding of the [[convex hull]] of the function's [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] in terms of its [[supporting hyperplane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://maze5.net/?page_id=733&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, if {{mvar|X}} is a [[vector space]] and {{math|''Y''}} is its [[dual space|dual vector space]], then for each point {{mvar|x}} of {{math|''X''}} and {{math|''y''}} of {{math|''Y''}}, there is a natural identification of the [[cotangent space]]s {{math|T*''X&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with {{math|''Y''}} and {{math|T*''Y&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with {{math|''X''}}. If {{mvar|f}} is a real differentiable function over {{math|''X''}}, then its [[exterior derivative]], {{math|''df''}}, is a section of the [[cotangent bundle]] {{math|T*''X''}} and as such, we can construct a map from {{math|''X''}} to {{math|''Y''}}. Similarly, if {{mvar|g}} is a real differentiable function over {{math|''Y''}}, then {{math|''dg''}} defines a map from {{math|''Y''}} to {{math|''X''}}. If both maps happen to be inverses of each other, we say we have a Legendre transform.

When the function is not differentiable, the Legendre transform can still be extended, and is known as the [[Legendre-Fenchel transformation]]. In this more general setting, a few properties are lost: for example, the Legendre transform is no longer its own inverse (unless there are extra assumptions, like [[convex function|convexity]]).

==Further properties==

===Scaling properties===
The Legendre transformation has the following scaling properties: For {{math|''a'' &gt; 0}},

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a \cdot g(x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = a \cdot g^\star\left(\frac{p}{a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(a \cdot x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star\left(\frac{p}{a}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that if a function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree {{mvar|r}}]] then its image under the Legendre transformation is a homogeneous function of degree {{mvar|s}}, where {{math|1/''r'' + 1/''s'' {{=}} 1}}. (Since {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''x&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''/''r''}}, with {{math|''r'' &gt; 1}}, implies {{math|''f''*(''p'') {{=}} ''p&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''/''s''}}.)  Thus, the only monomial whose degree is invariant under Legendre transform is the quadratic.

===Behavior under translation===
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = g(x) + b \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star(p) - b&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = g(x + y) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = g^\star(p) - p \cdot y &lt;/math&gt;

===Behavior under inversion===
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = g^{-1}(x) \Rightarrow f^\star(p) = - p \cdot g^\star\left(\frac{1}{p} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Behavior under linear transformations===
Let {{math|''A'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a [[linear transformation]]. For any convex function {{mvar|f}} on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one has

:&lt;math&gt; (A f)^\star = f^\star A^\star &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''A''*}} is the [[adjoint operator]] of {{mvar|A}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \left \langle Ax, y^\star \right \rangle = \left \langle x, A^\star y^\star \right \rangle, &lt;/math&gt;

and {{math|''Af''}} is the ''push-forward'' of {{mvar|f}} along {{mvar|A}}

:&lt;math&gt; (A f)(y) = \inf\{ f(x) : x \in X , A x = y \}. &lt;/math&gt;

A closed convex function {{mvar|f}} is symmetric with respect to a given set {{mvar|G}} of [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal linear transformation]]s,
:&lt;math&gt;f(A x) = f(x), \; \forall x, \; \forall A \in G &lt;/math&gt;
[[if and only if]] {{math|''f''*}} is symmetric with respect to {{mvar|G}}.

===Infimal convolution===
The '''infimal convolution''' of two functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \left(f \star_\inf  g\right)(x) = \inf \left \{ f(x-y) + g(y) \, | \, y \in \mathbf{R}^n \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be proper convex functions on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Then

:&lt;math&gt; \left( f_1 \star_\inf \cdots \star_\inf f_m \right)^\star = f_1^\star + \cdots + f_m^\star. &lt;/math&gt;

===Fenchel's inequality===
For any function {{mvar|f}} and its convex conjugate {{math|''f'' *}} ''Fenchel's inequality'' (also known as the ''Fenchel–Young inequality'') holds for every {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}  and {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X''*}}, i.e., ''independent'' {{math|''x'', ''p''}} pairs,
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle p,x \right\rangle \le f(x) + f^\star(p).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a [[function (mathematics)|function]] is '''locally bounded''' if it is [[bounded function|bounded]] around every point. A [[Family (disambiguation)#Mathematics|family]] of functions is '''locally bounded''' if for any point in their [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] all the functions are bounded around that point and by the same number.

==Locally bounded function==

A [[real-valued function|real-valued]] or [[complex-valued function|complex-valued]] function ''f'' defined on some [[topological space]] ''X'' is called '''locally bounded''' 
if for any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' there exists a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] ''A'' of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that
''f''&amp;nbsp;(''A'') is a [[bounded set]], that is, for some number ''M''&gt;0 one has
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' in ''A''.

That is to say, for each ''x'' one can find a constant, depending on ''x'', which is larger than all the values of the function in the neighborhood of ''x''. Compare this with a bounded function, for which the constant does not depend on ''x''. Obviously, if a function is bounded then it is locally bounded. The converse is not true in general.

This definition can be extended to the case when ''f'' takes values in some [[metric space]]. Then the inequality above needs to be replaced with
:&lt;math&gt;d\left(f(x), a\right)\le M&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' in ''A'', where ''d'' is the distance function in the metric space, and ''a'' is some point in the metric space. The choice of ''a'' does not affect the definition. Choosing a different ''a'' will at most increase the constant ''M'' for which this inequality is true.

== Examples ==

* The function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;
is bounded, because 0≤ ''f''&amp;nbsp;(''x'') ≤ 1 for all ''x''. Therefore, it is also locally bounded.

*  The function ''f'': '''R''' → '''R''' defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=2x+3&lt;/math&gt;
is ''not'' bounded, as it becomes arbitrarily large. However, it ''is'' locally bounded because for each ''a'', |''f''(''x'')| ≤ ''M'' in the neighborhood (''a'' - 1,''a'' + 1), where ''M'' = 2|''a''|+5.

* The function ''f'':'''R''' → '''R''' defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
for ''x'' ≠ 0 and taking the value 0 for ''x''=0 is ''not'' locally bounded. In any neighborhood of 0 this function takes values of arbitrarily large magnitude.

== Locally bounded family ==

A set (also called a [[Index set|family]]) ''U'' of real-valued or complex-valued functions defined on some topological space ''X'' is called '''locally bounded''' if for any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' there exists a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''A'' of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and a positive number ''M'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' in ''A'' and ''f'' in ''U''. In other words, all the functions in the family must be locally bounded, and around each point they need to be bounded by the same constant.

This definition can also be extended to the case when the functions in the family ''U''  take values in some metric space, by again replacing the absolute value with the distance function.

== Examples ==

* The family of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:'''R'''→'''R'''
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=\frac{x}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''n'' = 1, 2, ... is locally bounded. Indeed, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a real number, one can choose the neighborhood ''A'' to be the interval (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-1,  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1). Then for all ''x'' in this interval and for all ''n''≥1 one has
:&lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
with ''M''=|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|+1. Moreover, the family is uniformly bounded, because neither the neighborhood ''A'' nor the constant ''M'' depend on the index ''n''.

* The family of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:'''R'''→'''R'''
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
is locally bounded, if n is greater than zero. For any  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; one can choose the neighborhood ''A'' to be '''R''' itself. Then we have 
:&lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)|\le M&lt;/math&gt;
with ''M''=1. Note that the value of ''M'' does not depend on the choice of x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or its neighborhood ''A''. This family is then not only locally bounded, it is also [[uniformly bounded]].

* The family of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:'''R'''→'''R'''
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x)=x+n&lt;/math&gt;
is ''not'' locally bounded. Indeed, for any ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the values ''f''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) cannot be bounded as ''n'' tends toward infinity.

==Topological vector spaces==
Local boundedness may also refer to a property of [[topological vector space]]s, or of functions from a [[topological space]] into a topological vector space.

===Locally bounded topological vector spaces===
Let ''X'' be a topological vector space.  Then a subset ''B'' ⊂ ''X'' is '''bounded''' if for each neighborhood ''U'' of 0 in ''X'' there exists a number ''s'' &gt; 0 such that
:''B'' &amp;sub; ''tU'' for all ''t'' &gt; ''s''.
A topological vector space is said to be '''locally bounded''' if ''X'' admits a bounded neighborhood of 0.

===Locally bounded functions===
Let ''X'' be a topological space, ''Y'' a topological vector space, and ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' a function.  Then ''f'' is '''locally bounded''' if each point of ''X'' has a neighborhood whose image under ''f'' is bounded.

The following theorem relates local boundedness of functions with the local boundedness of topological vector spaces:
:'''Theorem.''' A topological vector space ''X'' is locally bounded if and only if the identity mapping '''1''' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X'' is locally bounded.

Golumbic is the founder and director emeritus of the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Institute for Interdisciplinary Applications of Computer Science at the [[University of Haifa]]. He was elected a fellow of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications (1995), fellow of the [[European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence]] ECCAI (2005) and member of the Academia Europaea, honoris causa (2013). 
Golumbic also served as chairman of the Israeli Association of Artificial Intelligence 
(1998–2004), and founded and chaired numerous international symposia in 
[[discrete mathematics]] and in the foundations of [[artificial intelligence]].

He is the author of several books including ''Algorithmic Graph Theory and Perfect Graphs'', ''Tolerance Graphs'' (with Ann N. Trenk) and ''Fighting Terror Online: The Convergence of Security, Technology, and the Law''.

==Scientific Contributions==

Golumbic's work in [[graph theory]] lead to the study of new [[perfect graph]] families such as tolerance graphs, which generalize the classical graph notions of [[interval graph]] and [[comparability graph]]. He is credited with introducing the systematic study of algorithmic aspects in [[intersection graph]] theory, and initiated research on new structured families of graphs including the edge intersection graphs of paths in trees (EPT), tolerance graphs, chordal probe graphs and [[trivially perfect graph]]s.  Golumbic, Kaplan and Shamir introduced the study
of [[graph sandwich problem]]s.

In the area of [[compiler optimization]], Golumbic holds a joint patent with Vladimir Rainish, ''Instruction Scheduler for a Computer'', (UK9-90-035/IS), an invention based on their technique called SHACOOF (ScHeduling Across COntrOl Flow) which in Hebrew means "transparent".
He has contributed to the development of fundamental research in [[artificial intelligence]] in the area of complexity and [[spatial-temporal reasoning]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6350">In [[combinatorial optimization]], the '''matroid intersection''' problem is to find a largest common independent set in two [[matroid]]s over the same ground set. If the elements of the matroid are assigned real weights, the weighted matroid intersection problem is to find a common independent set with the maximum possible weight. These problems generalize many problems in combinatorial optimization including finding [[maximum matching]]s and [[maximum weight matching]]s in [[bipartite graph]]s and finding [[Arborescence (graph theory)|arborescence]]s in [[directed graph]]s.

The '''matroid intersection theorem''', due to [[Jack Edmonds]], says that there is always a simple upper bound certificate, consisting of a partitioning of the ground set amongst the two matroids, whose value (sum of respective [[Matroid rank|ranks]]) equals the size of a maximum common independent set. Based on this theorem, the matroid intersection problem for two matroids can be solved in polynomial time using [[matroid partitioning]] algorithms.

==Example==
Let ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''U'',''V'',''E'') be a [[bipartite graph]]. One may define a [[partition matroid]] ''M&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the ground set ''E'', in which a set of edges is independent if no two of the edges have the same endpoint in ''U''. Similarly one may define a matroid ''M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' in which a set of edges is independent if no two of the edges have the same endpoint in ''V''. Any set of edges that is independent in both ''M&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' has the property that no two of its edges share an endpoint; that is, it is a [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]. Thus, the largest common independent set of ''M&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[maximum matching]] in ''G''.

==Extension==

The matroid intersection problem becomes [[NP-hard]] when three matroids are involved, instead of only two.

One proof of this hardness result uses a [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from the [[Hamiltonian path]] problem in [[directed graph]]s. Given a directed graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices, and specified nodes ''s'' and ''t'', the Hamiltonian path problem is the problem of determining whether there exists a simple path of length ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 that starts at ''s'' and ends at ''t''. It may be assumed without loss of generality that ''s'' has no incoming edges and ''t'' has no outgoing edges. Then, a Hamiltonian path exists if and only if there is a set of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 elements in the intersection of three matroids on the edge set of the graph: two partition matroids ensuring that the in-degree and out-degree of the selected edge set are both at most one, and the [[graphic matroid]] of the [[undirected graph]] formed by forgetting the edge orientations in ''G'', ensuring that the selected edge set has no cycles {{harv|Welsh|2010}}.

Another computational problem on matroids, the [[matroid parity problem]], was formulated by {{harvtxt|Lawler|1976}} as a common generalization of matroid intersection and non-bipartite graph matching.
However, although it can be solved in polynomial time for [[linear matroid]]s, it is NP-hard for other matroids, and requires exponential time in the [[matroid oracle]] model {{harv|Jensen|Korte|1982}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">'''The North East Asian Mathematics Competition (NEAMC)''' is a three-day mathematics competition held in a predesignated location in North East Asia.

It is a qualifying competition by Competition Academy for invitation to the World Mathematics Championships.

==General information==


===Location===

The location of the NEAMC changes annually. There are now at least two venues held annually and any institution may host it (with significant discounted perks).

===Eligibility===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Academy|first1=Competition|title=Qualifying competitions|url=http://maths.competition.ac/|website=Competition Academy|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Senior level is open to all youths in Grade 12 (Year 13) or below during the month of the event.

The Junior level is open to all youths in Grade 9 (Year 10) or below during the month of the event.

The Prime Plus level is open to all youths in Grade 7 (Year 8) or below during the month of the event.

==The competition==

===History===
SEAMC and NEAMC are three-day events for school students located in South East and North East Asia, respectively. Participants work alone and in teams, as well as listen to mathematician guest speakers.

SEAMC was conceived at the turn of the millennium by Steve Warry, a teacher at [[Alice Smith School]] in Kuala Lumpur who believed that mathematics could be a spectator sport. In pursuit of this, he organised the South East Asian Mathematics Competition (SEAMC) for March 2001, although he died a week prior to the competition. NEAMC was organised in February 2014 by Malcolm Coad of [[Nanjing International School]], China as a parallel event to SEAMC. Haese Mathematics are proud partners of the event since conception&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haesemathematics.com.au/news_items/neamc-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Format===
SEAMC, NEAMC and all other WMC qualifying competitions have:
* Three days of engagement
* Six skills categories for prizes
* The best sum ranking across all rounds win

School teams engage within the '''Communication''' skills rounds.

The '''Collaboration''' skills rounds are in buddy teams of three (the Open round involves 2 buddy teams working together).
The '''Challenge''' are skills rounds undertaken as individuals.

Three skills rounds are (subject specific skills and procedures) '''knowledge''' based,
three are (plan and execute) '''strategy''' focused and three depend upon (new and imaginative ideas) '''creativity'''.

So each strategy, creative and knowledge skill category is engaged in alone, in school teams and in buddy teams.

===Prizes===

* All participants receive a transcript of relative attainment in each of the rounds.
* The highest ranked individuals in each category receive medals.
* The highest ranked individuals across all rounds receive medals.
* The best ranked school team across all rounds receive the NEAMC Senior Cup or NEAMC Junior Cup respectively.

In [[mathematics]] and its applications, a '''parametric family''' or a '''parameterized family''' is a [[indexed family|family]] of objects (a set of related objects) whose differences depend only on the chosen values for a set of [[parameter]]s.

Common examples are parametrized (families of) [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[probability  distribution]]s, curves, shapes, etc.

==In probability and its applications==
{{main|Statistical model}}
For example, the probability density function &lt;math&gt; f_X &lt;/math&gt; of a random variable ''X'' may depend on a parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. In that case, the function may be denoted &lt;math&gt; f_X( \cdot \, ; \theta) &lt;/math&gt; to indicate the dependence on the parameter &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is not a formal argument of the function as it is considered to be fixed. However, each different value of the parameter gives a different probability density function. Then the ''parametric family'' of densities is the set of functions &lt;math&gt; \{ f_X( \cdot \, ; \theta) \mid \theta \in \Theta \} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \Theta&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of all possible values that the parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can take. As an example, the [[normal distribution]] is a family of similarly-shaped distributions parametrized by their [[mean]] and their [[variance]].

In [[decision theory]], [[two-moment decision model]]s can be applied when the decision-maker is faced with random variables drawn from a [[location-scale family]] of probability distributions.

==In algebra and its applications==

In [[economics]], the [[Cobb–Douglas production function]] is a family of [[production function]]s parametrized by the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticities]] of output with respect to the various [[factors of production]].

In [[algebra]], the [[quadratic equation]], for example, is actually a family of equations parametrized by the [[coefficient]]s of the variable and of its square and by the [[constant term]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1734">In [[graph theory]], '''path coloring''' usually refers to one of two problems:
* The problem of coloring a [[multiset|(multi)set]] of [[path (graph theory)|paths]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, in such a way that any two paths of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which share an edge in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; receive different colors. Set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are provided at input. This formulation is equivalent to [[Graph coloring|vertex coloring]] the ''conflict graph'' of set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. a graph with vertex set &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and edges connecting all pairs of paths of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; which are not edge-disjoint with respect to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.
* The problem of coloring (in accordance with the above definition) any chosen [[multiset|(multi)set]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of paths in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, such that the set of pairs of end-vertices of paths from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is equal to some set or multiset &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''set of requests''. Set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are provided at input. This problem is a special case of a more general class of graph routing problems, known as [[call scheduling]].
In both the above problems, the goal is usually to minimise the number of colors used in the coloring. In different variants of path coloring, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; may be a [[simple graph]], [[directed graph|digraph]] or [[multigraph]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9763">In [[mathematical analysis]] a '''pseudo-differential operator'''  is an extension of the concept of [[differential operator]]. Pseudo-differential operators are used extensively in the theory of [[partial differential equations]] and [[quantum field theory]].

==History==
The study of pseudo-differential operators began in the mid 1960s with the work of [[Joseph J. Kohn|Kohn]], [[Louis Nirenberg|Nirenberg]], [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]], Unterberger and Bokobza.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1993|loc=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They played an influential role in the first proof of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]].  Atiyah and Singer thanked [[Lars Hörmander|Hörmander]] for assistance with understanding the theory of Pseudo-differential operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1968|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

===Linear differential operators with constant coefficients===
Consider a linear [[differential operator]] with constant coefficients,

:&lt;math&gt; P(D) := \sum_\alpha a_\alpha \, D^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

which acts on smooth functions &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; with compact support in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
This operator can be written as a composition of a [[Fourier transform]], a simple ''multiplication'' by the
polynomial function (called the '''[[Fourier multiplier|symbol]]''')

:&lt;math&gt;  P(\xi) = \sum_\alpha a_\alpha \, \xi^\alpha, &lt;/math&gt;

and an inverse Fourier transform, in the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \quad P(D) u (x) = 
\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{i (x - y) \xi} P(\xi) u(y)\, dy \, d\xi &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here, &lt;math&gt;\alpha = (\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[multi-index]], &lt;math&gt;a_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are complex numbers, and

:&lt;math&gt;D^\alpha=(-i \partial_1)^{\alpha_1} \cdots (-i \partial_n)^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;

is an iterated partial derivative, where ∂&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; means differentiation with respect to the ''j''-th variable.  We introduce the constants &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; to facilitate the calculation of Fourier transforms.

;Derivation of formula ({{EquationNote|1}})
The Fourier transform of a smooth function ''u'', [[compact support|compactly supported]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;\hat u (\xi) := \int e^{- i y \xi} u(y) \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

and [[Fourier's inversion formula]] gives

:&lt;math&gt;u (x) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \int e^{i x \xi} \hat u (\xi) d\xi = 
\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \iint e^{i (x - y) \xi} u (y) \, dy \, d\xi &lt;/math&gt;

By applying ''P''(''D'') to this representation of ''u'' and using

:&lt;math&gt;P(D_x) \, e^{i (x - y) \xi} = e^{i (x - y) \xi} \, P(\xi) &lt;/math&gt;

one obtains formula ({{EquationNote|1}}).

===Representation of solutions to partial differential equations===

To solve the partial differential equation

:&lt;math&gt; P(D) \, u = f &lt;/math&gt;

we (formally) apply the Fourier transform on both sides and obtain the ''algebraic'' equation

:&lt;math&gt; P(\xi) \, \hat u (\xi) = \hat f(\xi). &lt;/math&gt;

If the symbol ''P''(&amp;xi;) is never zero when &amp;xi;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then it is possible to divide by ''P''(&amp;xi;):

:&lt;math&gt; \hat u(\xi) = \frac{1}{P(\xi)} \hat f(\xi) &lt;/math&gt;

By Fourier's inversion formula, a solution is

:&lt;math&gt;  u (x) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \int e^{i x \xi} \frac{1}{P(\xi)} \hat f (\xi) \, d\xi.&lt;/math&gt;

Here it is assumed that:
# ''P''(''D'') is a linear differential operator with ''constant'' coefficients,
# its symbol ''P''(&amp;xi;) is never zero,
# both ''u'' and &amp;fnof; have a well defined Fourier transform.
The last assumption can be weakened by using the theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]]s.
The first two assumptions can be weakened as follows.

In the last formula, write out the Fourier transform of &amp;fnof; to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;  u (x) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \iint e^{i (x-y) \xi} \frac{1}{P(\xi)} f (y) \, dy \, d\xi.&lt;/math&gt;

This is similar to formula ({{EquationNote|1}}), except that 1/''P''(&amp;xi;) is not a polynomial function, but a function of a more general kind.

==Definition of pseudo-differential operators==

Here we view pseudo-differential operators as a generalization of differential operators.
We extend formula (1) as follows. A '''pseudo-differential operator''' ''P''(''x'',''D'') on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is an operator whose value on the function ''u(x)'' is the function of ''x'':

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\quad P(x,D) u (x) = 
\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{i x\cdot \xi} P(x,\xi) \hat{u}(\xi) \, d\xi &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}(\xi)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fourier transform]] of ''u'' and the symbol ''P''(''x'',&amp;xi;) in the integrand belongs to a certain ''symbol class''.
For instance, if ''P''(''x'',&amp;xi;) is an infinitely differentiable function on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the property

:&lt;math&gt; |\partial_\xi^\alpha \partial_x^\beta P(x,\xi)| \leq C_{\alpha,\beta} \, (1 + |\xi|)^{m - |\alpha|} &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'',&amp;xi;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, all multiindices &amp;alpha;,&amp;beta;. some constants ''C''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;, &amp;beta;&lt;/sub&gt; and some real number ''m'', then ''P'' belongs to the symbol class &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{S^m_{1,0}}&lt;/math&gt; of [[Hörmander]]. The corresponding operator ''P''(''x'',''D'') is called a '''pseudo-differential operator of order m''' and belongs to the class
&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle{\Psi^m_{1,0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
Linear differential operators of order m with smooth bounded coefficients are pseudo-differential
operators of order ''m''.
The composition ''PQ'' of two pseudo-differential operators ''P'',&amp;nbsp;''Q'' is again a pseudo-differential operator and the symbol of ''PQ'' can be calculated by using the symbols of ''P'' and ''Q''. The adjoint and transpose of a pseudo-differential operator is a pseudo-differential operator.

If a differential operator of order ''m'' is [[elliptic differential operator|(uniformly) elliptic]] (of order ''m'')
and invertible, then its inverse is a pseudo-differential operator of order &amp;minus;''m'', and its symbol can be calculated. This means that one can solve linear elliptic differential equations more or less explicitly
by using the theory of pseudo-differential operators.

Differential operators are ''local'' in the sense that one only needs the value of a function in a neighbourhood of a point to determine the effect of the operator. Pseudo-differential operators are ''pseudo-local'', which means informally that when applied to a [[Schwartz distribution|distribution]] they do not create a singularity at points where the distribution was already smooth.

Just as a differential operator can be expressed in terms of ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;id/d''x'' in the form

:&lt;math&gt;p(x, D)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for a [[polynomial]] ''p'' in ''D'' (which is called the ''symbol''), a pseudo-differential operator has a symbol in a more general class of functions. Often one can reduce a problem in analysis of pseudo-differential operators to a sequence of algebraic problems involving their symbols, and this is the essence of [[microlocal analysis]].

==Kernel of pseudo-differential operator==

Pseudo-differential operators can be represented by [[Integral transform|kernels]].  The singularity of the kernel on the diagonal depends on the degree of the corresponding operator. In fact, if the symbol satisfies the above differential inequalities with m ≤ 0, it can be shown that the kernel is a [[Singular integral|singular integral kernel]]. &lt;!--The kernels are used for characterization of boundary data for inverse boundary problems.--&gt;

A '''residue numeral system''' ('''RNS''') is a [[numeral system]] representing [[integer]]s by their values [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] several [[pairwise coprime]] integers called the moduli. This representation is allowed by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], which asserts that, if {{mvar|N}} is the product of the moduli, there is, in an interval of length {{mvar|N}}, exactly one integer having any given set of modular values. The [[arithmetic operation|arithmetic]] of a residue numeral system is also called '''multi-modular arithmetic'''.

Multi-modular arithmetic is widely used for computation with large integers, typically in [[linear algebra]], because it provides faster computation than with the usual numeral systems, even when the time for converting between numeral systems is taken into account. Other applications of multi-modular arithmetic include [[polynomial greatest common divisor#Modular GCD algorithm|polynomial greatest common divisor]], [[Gröbner basis]] computation and [[cryptography]].

==Definition==

A residue numeral system is defined by a set of {{mvar|k}} integers
:&lt;math&gt;\{ m_1, m_2, m_3,\ldots, m_k\},&lt;/math&gt;
called the ''moduli'', which are generally supposed to be [[pairwise coprime]] (that is, any two of them have a [[greatest common divisor]] equal to one). 
referred to as the ''moduli''. Residue number systems have been defined for non-coprime moduli, but are not commonly used because of worse properties. Therefore, they will not be considered in the remainder of this article.&lt;ref&gt;Behrooz Parhami, [http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~parhami/text_comp_arit.htm Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware Design]. 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2010. 641+xxv p. {{ISBN|978-0-19-532848-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An integer {{mvar|x}} is represented in the residue numeral system by the set of its remainders
:&lt;math&gt;\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots,x_k \}&lt;/math&gt;
under [[Euclidean division]] by the moduli. That is 
:&lt;math&gt; x_i = x \operatorname{mod}m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;0\le x_i&lt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;
for every {{mvar|i}}

Let {{mvar|M}} be the product of all the &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;. Two integers whose difference is a multiple of {{mvar|M}} have the same representation in the residue numeral system defined by the {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}s. More precisely, the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] asserts that each of the {{mvar|M}} different sets of possible residues represents exactly one [[residue class]] modulo {{mvar|M}}. That is, each set of residues represents exactly one integer in the interval {{math|0, ..., ''M''}}.

In applications where one is also interested with negative integers, it is often more convenient to represent integers belonging to an interval centered at 0. In this case, if {{mvar|M}} is odd, each set of residues represents exactly one integer of [[absolute value]] at most {{mvar|M}}.

==Arithmetic operations==

For adding, subtracting and multiplying numbers represented in a residue number system, it suffices to perform the same [[Modular arithmetic|modular operation]] on each pair of residues. More precisely, if 
:&lt;math&gt;[m_1, \ldots, m_k]&lt;/math&gt;
is the list of moduli, the sum of the integers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, respectively represented by the residues &lt;math&gt;[x_1,\ldots, x_k]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[y_1,\ldots, y_k],&lt;/math&gt; is the integer {{mvar|z}} represented by &lt;math&gt;[z_1,\ldots, z_k],&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;z_i= (x_i+y_i)\operatorname{mod} m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, ..., ''k''}} (as usual, mod denotes the [[modulo operation]] consisting of taking the remainder of the [[Euclidean division]] by the right operand). Subtraction and multiplication are defined similarly.

For a succession of operations, it is not necessary to apply the modulo operation at each step. It may be applied at the end of the computation, or, during the computation, for avoiding [[integer overflow|overflow]] of hardware operations.

===Comparison===

If two integers are equal, then all their residues are equal. Conversely, if all residues are equal, then the two integers are equal, or their differences is a multiple of {{mvar|M}}. It follows that testing equality is easy.

At the opposite, testing inequalities ({{math|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}) is difficult and, usually, requires to convert integers to the standard representation. As a consequence, this representation of numbers is not suitable for algorithms using inequality tests, such [[Euclidean division]] and [[Euclidean algorithm]].

===Division===

Division in residue numeral systems is problematic.  A paper describing one possible algorithm is available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20050217165652/http://www.cs.rpi.edu/research/ps/93-9.ps]. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is coprime with &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; (that is &lt;math&gt;b_i\not =0&lt;/math&gt;) then
:&lt;math&gt;C=A\cdot B^{-1} \mod M&lt;/math&gt;
can be easily calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c_i=a_i \cdot b_i^{-1} \mod m_i,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;B^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[multiplicative inverse]] of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;b_i^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is multiplicative inverse of &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt;.

{{expand section|date=July 2018}}

RNS have applications in the field of [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer arithmetic]]. By decomposing in this a large integer into a set of smaller integers, a large calculation can be performed as a series of smaller calculations that can be performed independently and in parallel.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}
'''Riesz's lemma''' (after [[Frigyes Riesz]]) is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] in [[functional analysis]]. It specifies (often easy to check) conditions that guarantee that a [[Linear subspace|subspace]] in a [[normed linear space]] is [[dense set|dense]]. The lemma may also be called the '''Riesz lemma''' or '''Riesz inequality'''. It can be seen as a substitute for orthogonality when one is not in an inner product space.

== The result ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Riesz's Lemma.''' Let ''X'' be a normed linear space, ''Y'' be a closed proper subspace of ''X'' and α be a real number with {{nowrap|0 &lt; α &lt; 1.}}  Then there exists an ''x'' in ''X'' with |''x''| = 1 such that |''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;α for all ''y'' in ''Y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rynne|first=Bryan P.|title=Linear Functional Analysis|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=London|isbn=978-1848000049|edition=2nd|author2=Youngson, Martin A. |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Remark 1.'' For the finite-dimensional case, equality can be achieved. In other words, there exists ''x'' of unit norm such that ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''Y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. When dimension of ''X'' is finite, the unit ball ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''X'' is compact. Also, the distance function ''d''(· ,&amp;nbsp;''Y'') is continuous. Therefore its image on the unit ball ''B'' must be a compact subset of the real line, proving the claim.

''Remark 2.'' The space ℓ&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; of all bounded sequences shows that the lemma does not hold for&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

The proof can be found in functional analysis texts such as Kreyszig. An [http://www.math.umn.edu/~garrett/m/fun/riesz_lemma.pdf online proof from Prof. Paul Garrett] is available.
== Converse ==
Riesz's lemma can be applied directly to show that the [[unit ball]] of an infinite-dimensional normed space ''X'' is never [[compact set|compact]]: Take an element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from the unit sphere. Pick ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the unit sphere such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_n, Y_{n-1}) &gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; for a constant 0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; 1, where ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; is the linear span of {''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;} and &lt;math&gt;d(x, Y) = \inf_{y \in Y} |x - y|&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly {''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} contains no convergent subsequence and the noncompactness of the unit ball follows.

More generally, if a [[topological vector space]] ''X'' is [[locally compact]], then it is finite dimensional. The converse of this is also true. Namely, if a topological vector space is finite dimensional, it is locally compact&lt;ref&gt;https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/locally-compact-topological-vector-spaces/&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore local compactness characterizes finite-dimensionality. This classical result is also attributed to Riesz. A short proof can be sketched as follows: let ''C'' be a compact neighborhood of 0 ∈ ''X''. By compactness, there are ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''C'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;C = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \; \left( c_i + \frac{1}{2} C \right).&lt;/math&gt;

We claim that the finite dimensional subspace ''Y'' spanned by {''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}, or equivalently, its closure, is ''X''. Since scalar multiplication is continuous, it's enough to show ''C'' ⊂ ''Y''. Now, by induction, 

:&lt;math&gt;C \sub Y + \frac{1}{2^m} C&lt;/math&gt;

for every ''m''. But compact sets are [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded]], so ''C'' lies in the closure of ''Y''. This proves the result. For a different proof based on Hahn Banach Theorem see&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emis.de/journals/PM/51f2/pm51f205.pdf/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Some consequences ==
The [[spectral theory of compact operators|spectral properties of compact operators]] acting on a Banach space are similar to those of matrices. Riesz's lemma is essential in establishing this fact.

Riesz's lemma guarantees that any infinite-dimensional normed space contains a sequence of unit vectors {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} with &lt;math&gt;|x_n - x_m| &gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; for 0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; 1. This is useful in showing the non-existence of certain [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] on infinite-dimensional [[Banach space]]s. Riesz's lemma also shows that the identity operator on a Banach space ''X'' is compact if and only if ''X'' is finite-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kreyszig|1978|loc=Theorem 2.5-3, 2.5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also use this lemma to demonstrate whether or not the normed vector space X is finite dimensional or otherwise: if the closed unit ball is compact, then X is finite dimensional (we proceed by contradiction to this proof this results).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13903">In [[mathematics]], there is in [[mathematical analysis]] a class of '''Sobolev inequalities''', relating norms including those of [[Sobolev space]]s. These are used to prove the '''Sobolev embedding theorem''', giving inclusions between certain [[Sobolev space]]s, and the [[Rellich–Kondrachov theorem]] showing that under slightly stronger conditions some Sobolev spaces are [[compactly embedded]] in others. They are named after [[Sergei Lvovich Sobolev]].

==Sobolev embedding theorem==
Let {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} denote the Sobolev space consisting of all real-valued functions on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} whose first {{mvar|k}} [[weak derivative]]s are functions in [[Lp space|{{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}}]].  Here {{mvar|k}} is a non-negative integer and {{math|1 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ∞}}.  The first part of the Sobolev embedding theorem states that if {{math|''k'' &gt; ''ℓ''}} and {{math|1 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ''q'' &lt; ∞}} are two real numbers such that {{math|(''k'' − ''ℓ'')''p'' &lt; ''n''}} and:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p}-\frac{k}{n} = \frac{1}{q} -\frac{\ell}{n},&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)\subseteq W^{\ell,q}(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

and the embedding is continuous. In the special case of {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''ℓ'' {{=}} 0}}, Sobolev embedding gives

:&lt;math&gt;W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n) \subseteq L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the '''[[Sobolev conjugate]]''' of {{mvar|p}}, given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p^*} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This special case of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of the [[#Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality|Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality]].

The second part of the Sobolev embedding theorem applies to embeddings in [[Hölder space]]s {{math|''C&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;r,α&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. If {{math|''n'' &lt; ''p''}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{p}-\frac{k}{n} = -\frac{r + \alpha}{n},&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''α'' ∈ (0, 1]}} then one has the embedding

:&lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)\subset C^{r,\alpha}(\mathbf{R}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

This part of the Sobolev embedding is a direct consequence of [[#Morrey's inequality|Morrey's inequality]]. Intuitively, this inclusion expresses the fact that the existence of sufficiently many weak derivatives implies some continuity of the classical derivatives.

===Generalizations===
The Sobolev embedding theorem holds for Sobolev spaces {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(''M'')}} on other suitable domains {{mvar|M}}. In particular ({{harvnb|Aubin|1982|loc=Chapter 2}}; {{harvnb|Aubin|1976}}), both parts of the Sobolev embedding hold when
* {{mvar|M}} is a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[open set]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] boundary (or whose boundary satisfies the [[cone condition]]; {{harvnb|Adams|1975|loc=Theorem 5.4}})
* {{mvar|M}} is a [[compact space|compact]] [[Riemannian manifold]]
* {{mvar|M}} is a compact Riemannian [[manifold with boundary]] with Lipschitz boundary
* {{mvar|M}} is a [[complete manifold|complete]] Riemannian manifold with [[injectivity radius]] {{math|''δ'' &gt; 0}} and bounded [[sectional curvature]].

===Kondrachov embedding theorem===
{{main article|Rellich–Kondrachov theorem}}
On a compact manifold with {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} boundary, the '''Kondrachov embedding theorem''' states that if {{math|''k'' &gt; ''ℓ''}} and&lt;math display="block"&gt;\frac{1}{p}-\frac{k}{n} &lt; \frac{1}{q} -\frac{\ell}{n}&lt;/math&gt;then the Sobolev embedding

:&lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}(M)\subset W^{\ell,q}(M)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[completely continuous]] (compact). Note that the condition is just as in the first part of the Sobolev embedding theorem, with the equality replaced by an inequality, thus requiring a more regular space {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''M''')}}.

==Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality==
Assume that {{mvar|u}} is a continuously differentiable real-valued function on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with [[compact support]]. Then for {{math|1 &amp;le; ''p'' &lt; ''n''}} there is a constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|p}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n)}\leq C \|Du\|_{L^{p}(\mathbf{R}^n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

with 1/p* = 1/p - 1/n.
The case &lt;math&gt; 1&lt; p &lt; n &lt;/math&gt; is due to Sobolev, &lt;math&gt;  p =1 &lt;/math&gt; to Gagliardo and Nirenberg independently.  The Gagliardo–Nirenberg–Sobolev inequality implies directly the Sobolev embedding

:&lt;math&gt;W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n) \sub L^{p^*}(\mathbf{R}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

The embeddings in other orders on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are then obtained by suitable iteration.

==Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev lemma==
Sobolev's original proof of the Sobolev embedding theorem relied on the following, sometimes known as the Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev [[fractional integration]] theorem. An equivalent statement is known as the '''Sobolev lemma''' in {{harv|Aubin|1982|loc=Chapter 2}}.  A proof is in {{harv|Stein|loc=Chapter V, §1.3}}.

Let {{math|0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; ''n''}} and {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ''q'' &lt; ∞}}.  Let {{math|''I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} (−Δ)&lt;sup&gt;−''α''/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be the [[Riesz potential]] on {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Then, for {{mvar|q}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 q = \frac 1 p - \frac \alpha n&lt;/math&gt;

there exists a constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{mvar|p}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left \|I_\alpha f \right \|_q \le C \|f\|_p.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}}, then one has two possible replacement estimates.  The first is the more classical weak-type estimate:

:&lt;math&gt;m \left \{x : \left |I_\alpha f(x) \right | &gt; \lambda \right \} \le C \left( \frac{\|f\|_1}{\lambda} \right )^q,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1/''q'' {{=}} 1 − ''α''/''n''}}.  Alternatively one has the estimate&lt;math display="block"&gt;\left \|I_\alpha f \right \|_q \le C \|Rf\|_1,&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt; Rf &lt;/math&gt; is the vector-valued [[Riesz transform]], c.f.   {{harv|Schikorra | Spector | Van Schaftingen}}.  The boundedness of the [[Riesz transform]]s implies that the latter inequality gives a unified way to write the family of inequalities for the Riesz potential.

The Hardy–Littlewood–Sobolev lemma implies the Sobolev embedding essentially by the relationship between the [[Riesz transform]]s and the Riesz potentials.

==Morrey's inequality==
Assume {{math|''n'' &lt; ''p'' ≤ ∞}}. Then there exists a constant {{mvar|C}}, depending only on {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|n}}, such that

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{C^{0,\gamma}(\mathbf{R}^n)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(\mathbf{R}^n)}&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''u'' ∈ ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) ∩ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=1-\frac{n}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if {{math|''u'' ∈ ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, then {{mvar|u}} is in fact [[Hölder continuous]] of exponent {{mvar|γ}}, after possibly being redefined on a set of measure 0.

A similar result holds in a bounded domain {{mvar|U}} with {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} boundary.  In this case,

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{C^{0,\gamma}(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(U)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant {{mvar|C}} depends now on {{math|''n'', ''p''}} and {{mvar|U}}.  This version of the inequality follows from the previous one by applying the norm-preserving extension of {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'')}} to {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

==General Sobolev inequalities==
Let {{mvar|U}} be a bounded open subset of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, with a {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} boundary. ({{mvar|U}} may also be unbounded, but in this case its boundary, if it exists, must be sufficiently well-behaved.) Assume {{math|''u'' ∈ ''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(''U'')}}, then we consider two cases:

==={{math|''k'' &lt; ''n''/''p''}}===
In this case {{math|''u'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''(''U'')}}, where

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{p}-\frac{k}{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

We have in addition the estimate

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{L^q(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{k,p}(U)}&lt;/math&gt;,

the constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{math|''k'', ''p'', ''n''}}, and {{mvar|U}}.

==={{math|''k'' &gt; ''n''/''p''}}===
Here, {{mvar|u}} belongs to a [[Hölder space]], more precisely:

:&lt;math&gt; u \in C^{k-\left[\frac{n}{p}\right]-1,\gamma}(U),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \begin{cases}
\left[\frac{n}{p}\right]+1-\frac{n}{p} &amp; \frac{n}{p} \notin \mathbf{Z} \\
\text{any element in } (0, 1) &amp; \frac{n}{p} \in \mathbf{Z}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

We have in addition the estimate

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{C^{k-\left[\frac{n}{p}\right]-1,\gamma}(U)}\leq C \|u\|_{W^{k,p}(U)},&lt;/math&gt;

the constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{math|''k'', ''p'', ''n'', ''γ''}}, and {{mvar|U}}.

==Case &lt;math&gt;p=n, k=1&lt;/math&gt;==
If &lt;math&gt;u\in W^{1,n}(\mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;, then {{mvar|u}} is a function of [[bounded mean oscillation]] and

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{BMO} \leq C \|Du\|_{L^n(\mathbf{R}^n)},&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{mvar|n}}. This estimate is a corollary of the [[Poincaré inequality]].

==Nash inequality==
The Nash inequality, introduced by {{harvs|first=John|last=Nash|authorlink=John Forbes Nash, Jr.|year=1958|txt}}, states that there exists a constant {{math|''C'' &gt; 0}}, such that for all {{math|''u'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) ∩ ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}},

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{L^2(\mathbf{R}^n)}^{1+2/n} \leq C\|u\|_{L^1(\mathbf{R}^n)}^{2/n} \| Du\|_{L^2(\mathbf{R}^n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The inequality follows from basic properties of the [[Fourier transform]].  Indeed, integrating over the complement of the ball of radius {{mvar|ρ}},

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\int_{|x|\ge\rho} \left |\hat{u}(x) \right |^2\,dx \le \int_{|x|\ge\rho} \frac{|x|^2}{\rho^2} \left |\hat{u}(x) \right |^2\,dx\le \rho^{-2}\int_{\mathbf{R}^n}|D u|^2\,dx&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

by [[Parseval's theorem]]. On the other hand, one has

:&lt;math&gt;|\hat{u}| \le \|u\|_{L^1}&lt;/math&gt;

which, when integrated over the ball of radius {{mvar|ρ}} gives

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\int_{|x|\le\rho} |\hat{u}(x)|^2\,dx \le \rho^n\omega_n \|u\|_{L^1}^2&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where {{math|''ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the volume of the [[n sphere|{{mvar|n}}-ball]].  Choosing {{mvar|ρ}} to minimize the sum of ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) and again applying Parseval's theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\|\hat{u}\|_{L^2} = \|u\|_{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

gives the inequality.

In the special case of {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}, the Nash inequality can be extended to the {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} case, in which case it is a generalization of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality ({{harvnb|Brezis|2011}}, Comments on Chapter 8). In fact, if {{mvar|I}} is a bounded interval, then for all {{math|1 ≤ ''r'' &lt; ∞}} and all {{math|1 ≤ ''q'' ≤ ''p'' &lt; ∞}} the following inequality holds

:&lt;math&gt;\| u\|_{L^p(I)}\le C\| u\|^{1-a}_{L^q(I)} \|u\|^a_{W^{1,r}(I)},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;a\left(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{r}+1\right)=\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Steiner tree problem''', or '''minimum Steiner tree problem''', named after [[Jakob Steiner]], is an [[umbrella term]] for a class of problems in [[combinatorial optimization]]. While Steiner tree problems may be formulated in a number of settings, they all require an optimal interconnect for a given set of objects and a predefined objective function.  One well-known variant, which is often used synonymously with the term Steiner tree problem, is the '''Steiner tree problem in graphs'''. Given an [[undirected graph]] with non-negative edge weights and a subset of vertices, usually referred to as '''terminals,''' the Steiner tree problem in graphs requires a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] of minimum weight that contains all terminals (but may include additional vertices). Further well-known variants are the '''Euclidean Steiner tree problem''' and the '''rectilinear minimum Steiner tree problem'''.

The Steiner tree problem in graphs can be seen as a generalization of two other famous combinatorial optimization problems: the (non-negative) [[shortest path problem]] and the [[Minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree problem]]. If a Steiner tree problem in graphs contains exactly two terminals, it reduces to finding a shortest path. If, on the other hand, all vertices are terminals, the Steiner tree problem in graphs is equivalent to the minimum spanning tree. However, while both the non-negative shortest path and the minimum spanning tree problem are solvable in polynomial time, the [[Decision problem|decision variant]] of the Steiner tree problem in graphs is [[NP-complete]]  (which implies that the optimization variant is [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]]); in fact, the decision variant was among [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems|Karp's original 21 NP-complete problems]]. The Steiner tree problem in graphs has applications in [[Electrical network|circuit]] layout or [[network design]]. However, practical applications usually require variations, giving rise to a multitude of Steiner tree problem variants.

Most versions of the Steiner tree problem are [[NP-complete|NP-hard]], but some restricted cases can be solved in [[polynomial time]]. Despite the pessimistic worst-case complexity, several Steiner tree problem variants, including the Steiner tree problem in graphs and the rectilinear Steiner tree problem, can be solved efficiently in practice, even for large-scale real-world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dimacs11.zib.de/papers/PolzinVahdatiDIMACS.pdf |title=Report by Polzin and Vahdati Daneshmand |format=PDF |access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Juhl|Warme|Winter |Zachariasen|2014}}

==Euclidean Steiner tree==
The original problem was stated in the form that has become known as the '''Euclidean Steiner tree problem''' or '''geometric Steiner tree problem''': Given ''N'' points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], the goal is to connect them by lines of minimum total length in such a way that any two points may be interconnected by [[line segment]]s either directly or via other [[Point (geometry)|points]] and line segments. It may be shown that the connecting line segments do not intersect each other except at the endpoints and form a tree, hence the name of the problem.

The problem for ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 has long been considered, and quickly extended to the problem of finding a [[star (graph theory)|star network]] with a single hub connecting to all of the ''N'' given points, of minimum total length.
However, although the full Steiner tree problem was formulated in a letter by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], its first serious treatment was in a 1934 paper written in Czech by [[Vojtěch Jarník]] and {{ill|Miloš Kössler|cs}}. This paper was long overlooked, but it already contains "virtually all general properties of Steiner trees" later attributed to other researchers, including the generalization of the problem from the plane to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

For the Euclidean Steiner problem, points added to the graph ([[Steiner point (computational geometry)|Steiner points]]) must have a [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of three, and the three edges incident to such a point must form three 120 degree angles (see [[Fermat point]]). It follows that the maximum number of Steiner points that a Steiner tree can have is ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2, where ''N'' is the initial number of given points.

For ''N'' = 3 there are two possible cases: if the triangle formed by the given points has all angles which are less than 120 degrees, the solution is given by a Steiner point located at the [[Fermat point]]; otherwise the solution is given by the two sides of the triangle which meet on the angle with 120 or more degrees.

For general ''N'', the Euclidean Steiner tree problem is [[NP-hard]], and hence it is not known whether an [[Optimization problem|optimal solution]] can be found by using a [[polynomial-time algorithm]]. However, there is a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] (PTAS) for Euclidean Steiner trees, i.e., a ''near-optimal'' solution can be found in polynomial time.{{sfnp|Crescenzi|Kann|Halldórsson|Karpinski|2000}} It is not known whether the Euclidean Steiner tree problem is NP-complete, since membership to the complexity class NP is not known.

==Rectilinear Steiner tree==
{{main article|Rectilinear Steiner tree}}

The rectilinear Steiner tree problem is a variant of the geometric Steiner tree problem in the plane, in which the [[Euclidean distance]] is replaced with the [[rectilinear distance]]. The problem arises in the [[physical design (electronics)|physical design]] of [[electronic design automation]]. In [[VLSI circuit]]s, [[wire routing]] is carried out by wires that are often constrained by design rules to run only in vertical and horizontal directions, so the rectilinear Steiner tree problem can be used to model the routing of nets with more than two terminals.{{sfnp|Sherwani|1993|p=228}}

==Steiner tree in graphs and variants==
Steiner trees have been extensively studied in the context of [[weighted graph]]s. The prototype is, arguably, the '''Steiner tree problem''' '''in graphs'''. Let ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''V'',&amp;nbsp;''E'') be an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights c and let ''S''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''V'' be a subset of vertices, called '''terminals'''. A '''Steiner tree''' is a tree in ''G'' that spans ''S''. There are two versions of the problem: in the [[optimization problem]] associated with Steiner trees, the task is to find a minimum-weight Steiner tree; in the [[decision problem]] the edge weights are integer and the task is to determine whether a Steiner tree exists whose total weight does not exceed a predefined [[natural number]] ''k''. The decision problem is one of [[Karp's 21 NP-complete problems]]; hence the optimization problem is [[NP-hard]].

A special case of this problem is when ''G'' is a [[complete graph]], each vertex ''v''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''V'' corresponds to a point in a [[metric space]], and the edge weights ''w''(''e'') for each ''e''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''E'' correspond to distances in the space. Put otherwise, the edge weights satisfy the [[triangle inequality]]. This variant is known as the '''metric Steiner tree problem'''. Given an instance of the (non-metric) Steiner tree problem, we can transform it in polynomial time into an equivalent instance of the metric Steiner tree problem; the transformation preserves the approximation factor.{{sfnp|Vazirani|2003|pp=27–28}}

While the Euclidean version admits a PTAS, it is known that the metric Steiner tree problem is [[APX-complete]], i.e., unless [[P = NP]], it is impossible to achieve approximation ratios that are arbitrarily close to 1 in polynomial time. There is a polynomial-time algorithm that [[Approximation algorithm|approximates]] the minimum Steiner tree to within a factor of &lt;math&gt;\ln(4) + \varepsilon\approx1.386&lt;/math&gt;;{{sfnp|Byrka|Grandoni|Rothvoß|Sanita|2010}}
however, approximating within a factor &lt;math&gt;96/95\approx 1.0105&lt;/math&gt; is NP-hard.{{sfnp|Chlebík|Chlebíková|2008}} For the restricted case of Steiner Tree problem with distances 1 and 2, a 1.25-approximation algorithm is known.{{sfnp|Berman|Karpinski|Zelikovsky|2009}}

In a special case of the graph problem, the Steiner tree problem for [[quasi-bipartite graph]]s, ''S'' is required to include at least one endpoint of every edge in ''G''.

The Steiner tree problem has also been investigated in higher dimensions and on various surfaces. Algorithms to find the Steiner minimal tree have been found on the sphere, torus, [[projective plane]], wide and narrow cones, and others.{{sfnp|Smith|Winter|1995|p=361}}

Another generalizations of the Steiner tree problem are the '''''k''-edge-connected Steiner network problem''' and the '''''k''-vertex-connected Steiner network problem''', where the goal is to find a [[k-edge-connected graph|''k''-edge-connected graph]] or a [[k-vertex-connected graph|''k''-vertex-connected graph]] rather than any connected graph.

The Steiner problem has also been stated in the general setting of metric spaces and for possibly infinitely many points.{{sfnp|Paolini|Stepanov|2012}}

==Approximating the Steiner tree==

The general graph Steiner tree problem can be approximated by computing the minimum spanning tree of the subgraph of the metric closure of the graph induced by the terminal vertices. The metric closure of a graph ''G'' is the complete graph in which each edge is weighted by the shortest path distance between the nodes in ''G''. This algorithm produces a tree whose weight is within a 2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2/''t'' factor of the weight of the optimal Steiner tree; this can be proven by considering a traveling salesperson tour on the optimal Steiner tree. The approximate solution is computable in [[Time complexity#polynomial time|polynomial time]] by first solving the [[Shortest path problem#All-pairs shortest paths|all-pairs shortest paths problem]] to compute the metric closure, then by solving the [[minimum spanning tree|minimum spanning tree problem]].

A series of papers provided approximation algorithms for the minimum Steiner tree problem with approximation ratios that improved upon the 2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2/''t'' ratio. This sequence culminated with Robins and Zelikovsky's algorithm in 2000 which improved the ratio to 1.55 by iteratively improving upon the minimum cost terminal spanning tree. More recently, however, Jaroslaw Byrka et al. proved an &lt;math&gt;\ln(4) + \varepsilon \le 1.39&lt;/math&gt; approximation using a linear programming relaxation and a technique called iterative, randomized rounding.{{sfnp|Byrka|Grandoni|Rothvoß|Sanita|2010}}

==Steiner ratio==

The '''Steiner ratio''' is the [[supremum]] of the ratio of the total length of the minimum spanning tree to the minimum Steiner tree for a set of points in the Euclidean plane.{{sfnp|Ganley|2004}}

In the Euclidean Steiner tree problem, the Steiner ratio is conjectured to be &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\approx 1.1547&lt;/math&gt;, the ratio that is achieved by three points in an [[equilateral triangle]] with a spanning tree that uses two sides of the triangle and a Steiner tree that connects the points through the centroid of the triangle. Despite earlier claims of a proof,&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Oct 30, 1990, reported that a proof had been found, and that [[Ronald Graham]], who had offered $500 for a proof, was about to mail a check to the authors.&lt;/ref&gt; the conjecture is still open.{{sfnp|Ivanov|Tuzhilin|2012}} The best widely-accepted [[upper bound]] for the problem is 1.2134, by {{harvtxt|Chung|Graham|1985}}.

For the rectilinear Steiner tree problem, the Steiner ratio is exactly &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, the ratio that is achieved by four points in a square with a spanning tree that uses three sides of the square and a Steiner tree that connects the points through the center of the square.{{sfnp|Hwang|1976}} More precisely, for &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; distance the square should be tilted at &lt;math&gt;45^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the coordinate axes, while for &lt;math&gt;L_{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; distance the square should be axis-aligned.

A '''straight-line grammar''' (sometimes abbreviated as SLG) is a [[formal grammar]] that generates exactly one string.&lt;ref name="GECCO"&gt;Florian Benz and Timo Kötzing, “An effective heuristic for the smallest grammar problem,” Proceedings of the fifteenth annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation conference - GECCO  ’13, 2013.  {{ISBN|978-1-4503-1963-8}} {{doi|10.1145/2463372.2463441}}, p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, it does not branch (every non-terminal has only one associated production rule) nor loop (if non-terminal ''A'' appears in a derivation of ''B'', then ''B'' does not appear in a derivation of ''A'').&lt;ref name="GECCO"/&gt;

== Areas of usefulness ==

Straight-line grammars are widely used in the development of algorithms that execute directly on compressed structures (without prior decompression).&lt;ref name="Lohrey.Maneth.Schmidt.2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Markus Lohrey |author2=Sebastian Maneth |author3=Manfred Schmidt-Schauß | chapter=Parameter Reduction in Grammar-Compressed Trees| title=Proc. FOSSACS| year=2009| volume=5504| pages=212–226| publisher=Springer| series=LNCS| url=http://www.eti.uni-siegen.de/ti/veroeffentlichungen/09-fossacs.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}}

SLGs are of interest in fields like [[Kolmogorov complexity]], [[Lossless data compression]], [[Structure discovery]] and [[Compressed data structure]]s.{{clarify|reason=Indicate how SLGs are used in each of these fields. E.g. in the current version of the 'Kolmogorov complexity' article, they are mentioned nowhere.|date=October 2013}}

The problem of finding a context-free grammar (equivalently: an SLG) of minimal size that generates a given string is called the [[smallest grammar problem]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Straight-line grammars (more precisely: straight-line context-free string grammars) can be generalized to ''Straight-line context-free tree grammars''.
The latter can be used conveniently to compress [[tree (data structure)|trees]].&lt;ref name="Lohrey.Maneth.Schmidt.2009"/&gt;{{rp|212}}

==Formal Definition==
A [[context-free grammar]] ''G'' is an SLG if:

1. for every non-terminal ''N'', there is at most one production rule that has ''N'' as its left-hand side, and

2. the [[directed graph]] ''G''=&lt;''V'',''E''&gt;, defined by ''V'' being the set of non-terminals and (''A'',''B'') ∈ ''E'' whenever ''B'' appears at the right-hand side of a production rule for ''A'', is [[directed acyclic graph|acyclic]].

A mathematical definition of the more general formalism of straight-line context-free tree grammars can be found in Lohrey et al.&lt;ref name="Lohrey.Maneth.Schmidt.2009"/&gt;{{rp|215}}

An SLG in [[Chomsky normal form]] is equivalent to a [[straight-line program]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== A list of algorithms using SLGs ==
*  The [[Sequitur algorithm]] constructs a straight-line grammar for a given string.
*  The [[Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm]] creates a context-free grammar in such a deterministic way that it is necessary to store only the start rule of the generated grammar.
*  [[Byte pair encoding]]

[[File:Tetrahedral group 2.svg|thumb|right|300px|A [[tetrahedron]] is invariant under 12 distinct [[rotation]]s, reflections excluded. These are illustrated here in the [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graph]] format, along with the 180° edge (blue arrows) and 120° vertex (reddish arrows) [[rotation]]s that [[permutation|permute]] the tetrahedron through the positions. The 12 rotations form the '''rotation (symmetry) group''' of the figure.]]

In [[group theory]], the '''symmetry group''' of an object ([[image]], [[Signal (information theory)|signal]], etc.) is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of all [[Transformation (geometry)|transformation]]s under which the object is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] with [[Function composition|composition]] as the group operation. For a space with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], it is a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the space concerned. If not stated otherwise, this article considers [[symmetry]] groups in [[Euclidean geometry]], but the concept may also be studied in more general contexts as expanded below.

==Introduction==
The "objects" may be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a [[wallpaper group|wallpaper pattern]]. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also want to take their physical composition into account. The group of isometries of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

The symmetry group is sometimes also called '''full symmetry group''' in order to emphasize that it includes the orientation-reversing isometries (like reflections, [[glide reflection]]s and [[improper rotation]]s) under which the figure is invariant. The [[subgroup]] of orientation-preserving isometries (i.e. translations, rotations, and compositions of these) that leave the figure invariant is called its '''proper symmetry group'''.  The proper symmetry group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group [[if and only if]] the object is [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] (and thus there are no [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-reversing isometries under which it is invariant).

Any symmetry group whose elements have a common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is true for all finite symmetry groups and also for the symmetry groups of bounded figures, can be represented as a [[subgroup]] of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(''n''), and is therefore also called '''rotation group''' of the figure.

A '''discrete symmetry group''' is a symmetry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries in the symmetry group is a [[discrete set]]. The number of elements in the group may be either finite or infinite.

Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite '''[[point groups]]''', which include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion – they are just the finite subgroups of O(''n''), (2) infinite '''[[Lattice (group)|lattice]] groups''', which include only translations, and (3) infinite '''[[space groups]]''' which combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra transformations like [[screw displacement]]s and [[glide reflection]]s. There are also ''continuous'' symmetry groups, which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances.  The group of all symmetries of a sphere [[orthogonal group|O(3)]] is an example of this, and in general such [[continuous symmetry]] groups are studied as [[Lie group]]s. With a  [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group]] corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups.

Two geometric figures are considered to be of the same symmetry type if their symmetry groups are conjugate subgroups of the [[Euclidean group]] E(''n'') (the isometry group of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), where two subgroups ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a group ''G'' are ''[[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]]'', if there exists {{nowrap|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''}}. For example:
*two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.
*two 3D figures have 3-fold [[rotational symmetry]], but with respect to different axes.
*two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.

When considering isometry groups, one may restrict oneself to those where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]]. This includes all discrete isometry groups and also those involved in continuous symmetries, but excludes for example in 1D the group of translations by a rational number. A "figure" with this symmetry group is non-drawable and up to arbitrarily fine detail homogeneous, without being really homogeneous.

==One dimension==
The isometry groups in one dimension where for all points the set of images under the isometries is [[Closed (topology)|topologically closed]] are:
*the trivial group C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
*the groups of two elements generated by a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z, the additive group of the integers
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection in a point; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of Z,  Dih(Z), also denoted by D&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (which is a [[semidirect product]] of Z and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). 
*the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with the additive group of the real numbers '''R'''); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a "pattern": it would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a uniform one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.
*the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the [[Dihedral group#Generalizations|generalized dihedral group]] of '''R''',  Dih('''R''').

See also [[symmetry groups in one dimension]].

==Two dimensions==

[[Up to]] conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:

*[[cyclic group]]s C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ... where C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/''n''
*[[dihedral group]]s D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[Dihedral group of order 6|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Examples of groups#A symmetry group|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], ..., where D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (of order 2''n'') consists of the rotations in C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; together with reflections in ''n'' axes that pass through the fixed point.

C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[trivial group]] containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure has no symmetry at all, for example the letter '''F'''. C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the symmetry group of the letter '''Z''', C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that of a [[triskelion]], C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a [[swastika]], and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.

D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of [[reflection symmetry|bilateral symmetry]], for example the letter '''A'''.

D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.

D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; etc. are the symmetry groups of the [[regular polygon]]s.

The actual symmetry groups in each of these cases have two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.

The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are:
*the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called  the [[circle group]] S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the multiplicative group of [[complex number]]s of [[absolute value]] 1. It is the ''proper'' symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no geometric figure that has as ''full'' symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the three-dimensional case below). 
*the orthogonal group O(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih(S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) as it is the [[dihedral group|generalized dihedral group]] of S&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

For non-bounded figures, the additional isometry groups can include translations; the closed ones are:
*the 7 [[frieze group]]s 
*the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s
*for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction
*ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.

==Three dimensions==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bipyramid]] --&gt;
{{see also|Point groups in three dimensions}}

[[Up to]] conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 separate ones. In crystallography they are restricted to be compatible with the discrete translation symmetries of a crystal lattice. This [[crystallographic restriction theorem|crystallographic restriction]] of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 from the 7 infinite series, and 5 of the 7 others).

The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:
*cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis, this applies for example often for a [[bottle]]
*cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis
*spherical symmetry

For objects and [[scalar field]]s the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical planes of reflection. However, for [[vector field]]s it does not: in [[cylindrical coordinates]] with respect to some axis,  
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = A_\rho\boldsymbol{\hat \rho} + A_\phi\boldsymbol{\hat \phi} + A_z\boldsymbol{\hat z}&lt;/math&gt; has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;A_\rho, A_\phi,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; A_z&lt;/math&gt; have this symmetry, i.e., they do not depend on &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Additionally there is reflectional symmetry if and only if &lt;math&gt;A_\phi = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

For spherical symmetry there is no such distinction, it implies planes of reflection.

The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a [[screw axis]], such as an infinite [[helix]]. See also [[Euclidean group#Subgroups|subgroups of the Euclidean group]].

==Symmetry groups in general==
{{see also|Automorphism}}
In wider contexts, a '''symmetry group''' may be any kind of '''transformation group''', or [[automorphism]] group. Once we know what kind of [[mathematical structure]] we are concerned with, we should be able to pinpoint what [[Map (mathematics)|mappings]] preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry can define the structure, or at least clarify what we mean by an [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], geometric language in which to discuss it; this is one way of looking at the [[Erlangen programme]].

For example, automorphism groups of certain models of [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] are not "symmetry groups" in the usual sense, although they preserve symmetry.  They do this by preserving ''families'' of point-sets rather than point-sets (or "objects") themselves.

Like above, the group of automorphisms of space induces a [[group action]] on objects in it.

For a given geometric figure in a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent [[if and only if]] the two images of the figure are the same (here "the same" does not mean something like e.g. "the same up to translation and rotation", but it means "exactly the same"). Then the equivalence class of the identity is the symmetry group of the figure, and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version of the figure.

There is a bijection between every pair of equivalence classes: the inverse of a representative of the first equivalence class, composed with a representative of the second.

In the case of a finite automorphism group of the whole space, its order is the order of the symmetry group of the figure multiplied by the number of isomorphic versions of the figure.

Examples:
*Isometries of the Euclidean plane, the figure is a rectangle: there are infinitely many equivalence classes; each contains 4 isometries.
*The space is a [[cube]] with Euclidean metric; the figures include cubes of the same size as the space, with colors or patterns on the faces; the automorphisms of the space are the 48 isometries; the figure is a cube of which one face has a different color; the figure has a symmetry group of 8 isometries, there are 6 equivalence classes of 8 isometries, for 6 isomorphic versions of the figure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17212">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]] the '''Turing degree''' (named after [[Alan Turing]]) or '''degree of unsolvability''' of a set of natural numbers measures the level of algorithmic unsolvability of the set.

==Overview==
The concept of Turing degree is fundamental in [[computability theory]], where sets of natural numbers are often regarded as [[decision problem]]s. The Turing degree of a set is a measure of how difficult it is to solve the decision problem associated with the set, that is, to determine whether an arbitrary number is in the given set.

Two sets are '''Turing equivalent''' if they have the same level of unsolvability; each Turing degree is a collection of Turing equivalent sets, so that two sets are in different Turing degrees exactly when they are not Turing equivalent.  Furthermore, the Turing degrees are [[partial order|partially ordered]] so that if the Turing degree of a set ''X'' is less than the Turing  degree of a set ''Y'' then any (noncomputable) procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in ''Y'' can be effectively converted to a procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in ''X''. It is in this sense that the Turing degree of a set corresponds to its level of algorithmic unsolvability.

The Turing degrees were introduced by [[Emil Leon Post]] (1944), and many fundamental results were established by [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] and Post (1954). The Turing degrees have been an area of intense research since then. Many proofs in the area make use of a proof technique known as the '''priority method'''.

==Turing equivalence==
{{main|Turing reduction}}

For the rest of this article, the word ''set'' will refer to a set of natural numbers.  A set ''X'' is said to be '''[[Turing reducible]]''' to a set ''Y'' if there is an [[oracle Turing machine]] that decides membership in ''X'' when given an oracle for membership in ''Y''.  The notation ''X'' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' indicates that ''X'' is Turing reducible to ''Y''.

Two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined to be '''Turing equivalent''' if ''X'' is Turing reducible to ''Y'' and ''Y'' is Turing reducible to ''X''.  The notation ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' indicates that ''X'' and ''Y'' are Turing equivalent.  The relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; can be seen to be an [[equivalence relation]], which means that for all sets ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'': 
* ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''X'' 
* ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' implies ''Y'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''X''
* If ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y'' and ''Y'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Z'' then ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Z''.

A '''Turing degree''' is an [[equivalence class]] of the relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;. The notation [''X''] denotes the equivalence class containing a set ''X''. The entire collection of Turing degrees is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Turing degrees have a [[partial order]] &amp;le; defined so that [''X''] &amp;le; [''Y''] if and only if ''X'' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y''. There is a unique Turing degree containing all the computable sets, and this degree is less than every other degree.  It is denoted '''0''' (zero) because it is the least element of the poset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. (It is common to use boldface notation for Turing degrees, in order to distinguish them from sets.  When no confusion can occur, such as with [''X''], the boldface is not necessary.)

For any sets ''X'' and ''Y'', X '''join''' Y, written ''X'' &amp;oplus; ''Y'', is defined to be the union of the sets {{nowrap|1={2''n'' : ''n'' &amp;isin; ''X'' }}} and  {{nowrap|1={2''m''+1 : ''m &amp;isin; Y''}}}. The Turing degree of ''X'' &amp;oplus; ''Y'' is the [[Join (mathematics)|least upper bound]] of the degrees of ''X'' and ''Y''. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[join-semilattice]]. The least upper bound of degrees '''a''' and '''b''' is denoted '''a''' &amp;cup; '''b'''.  It is known that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is not a lattice, as there are pairs of degrees with no greatest lower bound.

For any set ''X'' the notation ''X''&amp;prime;  denotes the set of indices of oracle machines that halt when using ''X'' as an oracle.  The set ''X''&amp;prime; is called the '''[[Turing jump]]''' of ''X''.  The Turing jump of a degree [''X''] is defined to be the degree [''X''&amp;prime;]; this is a valid definition because ''X''&amp;prime; &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y''&amp;prime; whenever ''X'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''Y''. A key example is '''0'''&amp;prime;, the degree of the [[halting problem]].

==Basic properties of the Turing degrees==
* Every Turing degree is [[countably infinite]], that is, it contains exactly &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; sets.
* There are &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; distinct Turing degrees.
* For each degree '''a''' the strict inequality '''a''' &lt; '''a'''&amp;prime; holds.
* For each degree '''a''', the set of degrees below '''a''' is [[Countable set|countable]].  The set of degrees greater than '''a''' has size &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Structure of the Turing degrees==
A great deal of research has been conducted into the structure of the Turing degrees.  The following survey lists only some of the many known results. One general conclusion that can be drawn from the research is that the structure of the Turing degrees is extremely complicated.

===Order properties===
* There are '''minimal degrees'''.  A degree '''a''' is ''minimal'' if '''a''' is nonzero and there is no degree between '''0''' and '''a'''. Thus the order relation on the degrees is not a [[dense order]].
* For every nonzero degree '''a''' there is a degree '''b''' incomparable with '''a'''.
* There is a set of &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; pairwise incomparable Turing degrees.
* There are pairs of degrees with no greatest lower bound.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is not a lattice.
* Every countable partially ordered set can be embedded in the Turing degrees.
* No infinite, strictly increasing sequence of degrees has a least upper bound.

===Properties involving the jump===
* For every degree '''a''' there is a degree strictly between '''a''' and '''a&amp;prime;'''. In fact, there is a countable sequence of pairwise incomparable degrees between '''a''' and '''a&amp;prime;'''.
* A degree '''a''' is of the form '''b&amp;prime;''' if and only if '''0&amp;prime;''' &amp;le; '''a'''.
* For any degree '''a''' there is a degree '''b''' such that '''a''' &lt; '''b''' and '''b&amp;prime;''' = '''a&amp;prime;'''; such a degree '''b''' is called ''low'' relative to '''a'''.
* There is an infinite sequence '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of degrees such that '''a'''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for each ''i''.

===Logical properties===
* Simpson (1977) showed that the first-order theory of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; in the language {{nowrap|1=&amp;lang; &amp;le;, = &amp;rang;}} or {{nowrap|1=&amp;lang; &amp;le;, &amp;prime;, =&amp;rang;}} is [[Many-one reduction|many-one equivalent]] to the theory of true second-order arithmetic.  This indicates that the structure of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is extremely complicated.
* Shore and Slaman (1999) showed that the jump operator is definable in the first-order structure of the degrees with the language  &amp;lang; &amp;le;, =&amp;rang;.

==Structure of the r.e. Turing degrees==
A degree is called r.e. (recursively enumerable) if it contains a [[recursively enumerable set]].  Every r.e. degree is less than or equal to '''0&amp;prime;''' but not every degree less than '''0&amp;prime;''' is an r.e. degree.

* ([[Gerald Sacks|G. E. Sacks]], 1964) The r.e degrees are dense; between any two r.e. degrees there is a third r.e degree.
* (A. H. Lachlan, 1966a and C. E. M. Yates, 1966) There are two r.e. degrees with no greatest lower bound in the r.e. degrees.
* (A. H. Lachlan, 1966a and C. E. M. Yates, 1966) There is a pair of nonzero r.e. degrees whose greatest lower bound is '''0'''.
* (S. K. Thomason, 1971) Every finite distributive lattice can be embedded into the r.e. degrees.  In fact, the countable atomless Boolean algebra can be embedded in a manner that preserves suprema and infima.
* (A. H. Lachlan and [[Robert I. Soare|R. I. Soare]], 1980) Not all finite lattices can be embedded in the r.e. degrees (via an embedding that preserves suprema and infima).  The following particular [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] cannot be embedded in the r.e. degrees:

::[[File:rehasse.png]]

* (A. H. Lachlan, 1966b) There is no pair of r.e. degrees whose greatest lower bound is '''0''' and whose least upper bound is '''0&amp;prime;'''.  This result is informally called the ''nondiamond theorem''.
* ([[Leo Harrington|L. A. Harrington]] and [[Theodore Slaman|T. A. Slaman]], see Nies, Shore, and Slaman (1998)) The first-order theory of the r.e. degrees in the language &amp;lang; '''0''', &amp;le;, = &amp;rang; is many-one equivalent to the theory of true first order arithmetic.

==Post's problem and the priority method==
{{redirect|Post's problem|the other "Post's problem"|Post's correspondence problem}}

[[Emil Post]] studied the r.e.&amp;nbsp;Turing degrees and asked whether there is any r.e. degree strictly between '''0''' and '''0&amp;prime;'''.  The problem of constructing such a degree (or showing that none exist) became known as '''Post's problem'''.  This problem was solved independently by Friedberg and [[Albert Muchnik|Muchnik]] in the 1950s, who showed that these intermediate r.e. degrees do exist.  Their proofs each developed the same new method for constructing r.e. degrees which came to be known as the '''priority method'''.   The priority method is now the main technique for establishing results about r.e. sets.

The idea of the priority method for constructing a r.e. set ''X'' is to list a countable sequence of ''requirements'' that ''X'' must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set ''X'' between '''0''' and '''0&amp;prime;''' it is enough to satisfy the requirements ''A&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each natural number ''e'', where ''A&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' requires that the oracle machine with index ''e'' does not compute 0&amp;prime; from ''X'' and ''B&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' requires that the Turing machine with index ''e'' (and no oracle) does not compute ''X''.  These requirements are put into a ''priority ordering'', which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages can be thought of as steps of time during which the set ''X'' is enumerated.  At each stage, numbers may be put into ''X'' or forever prevented from entering ''X'' in an attempt to ''satisfy'' requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of ''X'' has been enumerated).  Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into ''X'' to satisfy one requirement but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be ''injured'').  The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case.  The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property.  An argument must be made that the overall set ''X'' is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.

For this reason, it is the most important example of a [[Method of complements|radix complement]].

The two's complement of an {{mvar|N}}-bit number is defined as its [[method of complements|complement]] with respect to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. For instance, for the three-bit number 010, the two's complement is 110, because {{math|010 + 110 {{=}} 1000}}.

Two's complement is the most common method of representing signed integers on computers.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. "Signed integers are two's complement binary values that can be used to represent both positive and negative integer values.", Section 4.2.1 in Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 1: Basic Architecture, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In this scheme, if the binary number 010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; encodes the signed integer 2&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, then its two's complement, 110&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, encodes the inverse: -2&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, to reverse the sign of any integer in this scheme, you can take the two's complement of its binary representation.&lt;ref&gt;David J. Lilja and Sachin S. Sapatnekar, ''Designing Digital Computer Systems with Verilog'', Cambridge University Press, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN052182866X&amp;id=5BvW0hYhxkQC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;ots=l-E0VjyPt8&amp;dq=%22two%27s+complement+arithmetic%22&amp;sig=sS5_swrfrzcQI2nHWest75sIjgg online]&lt;/ref&gt; The tables at right illustrate this property.

Compared to other systems for representing signed numbers (''e.g.,'' [[ones' complement]]), two's complement has the advantage that the fundamental arithmetic operations of [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]] are identical to those for unsigned binary numbers (as long as the inputs are represented in the same number of bits, and any [[integer overflow|overflow]] beyond those bits is discarded from the result). This property makes the system simpler to implement, especially for higher-precision arithmetic. Unlike ones' complement systems, two's complement has no representation for [[Ones'_complement#Negative_zero|negative zero]], and thus does not suffer from its associated difficulties.

Conveniently, another way of finding the two's complement of a number is to take its ones' complement and add one: the sum of a number and its ones' complement is all '1' bits, or {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1}}; and by definition, the sum of a number and its ''two's'' complement is {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==History==
The [[method of complements]] had long been used to perform subtraction in decimal [[adding machine]]s and [[mechanical calculator]]s. [[John von Neumann]] suggested use of two's complement binary representation in his 1945 ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' proposal for an electronic stored-program digital computer.&lt;ref name = "von Neumann 1945"&gt;{{Citation | last = von Neumann | first = John | author-link = John von Neumann | title = First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC | year = 1945 | url = https://sites.google.com/site/michaeldgodfrey/vonneumann/vnedvac.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1 | accessdate = February 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1949 [[EDSAC]], which was inspired by the ''First Draft'', used two's complement representation of binary numbers.

Many early computers, including the [[CDC 6600]], the [[LINC]], the [[PDP-1]], and the UNIVAC 1107, use [[ones' complement]] notation; the descendants of the UNIVAC 1107, the [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series]], continue to do so. The [[IBM 700/7000 series]] scientific machines use sign/magnitude notation, except for the index registers which are two's complement. Early commercial two's complement computers include the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] PDP-5 and the 1963 [[PDP-6]]. The [[IBM System/360|System/360]], introduced in 1964 by [[IBM]], then the dominant player in the computer industry, made two's complement the most widely used binary representation in the computer industry. The first minicomputer, the [[PDP-8]] introduced in 1965, uses two's complement arithmetic as do the 1969 [[Data General Nova]], the 1970 [[PDP-11]], and almost all subsequent minicomputers and microcomputers.

==Potential ambiguities of terminology==
The term ''two's complement'' can mean either a number format or a mathematical operator. For example, 0111 represents decimal 7 in two's-complement ''notation'', but the two's complement of 7 in a [[nibble|4-bit register]] is actually the "1001" [[bit string]] (the same as represents {{math|1=9 = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 7}} in unsigned arithmetics) which is the two's complement ''representation'' of −7. The statement "convert {{mvar|x}} to two's complement" may be ambiguous, since it could describe either the process of representing {{mvar|x}} in two's-complement notation without changing its value, or the calculation of the two's complement, which is the [[additive inverse|arithmetic negative]] of {{mvar|x}} if two's complement representation is used.

==Converting from two's complement representation==
A two's-complement number system encodes positive and negative numbers in a binary number representation. The weight of each bit is a power of two, except for the [[most significant bit]], whose weight is the negative of the corresponding power of two.

The value&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|w}} of an {{mvar|N}}-bit integer &lt;math&gt;a_{N-1} a_{N-2} \dots a_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;w = -a_{N-1} 2^{N-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{N-2} a_i 2^i.&lt;/math&gt;
The most significant bit determines the sign of the number and is sometimes called the [[sign bit]]. Unlike in [[sign-and-magnitude]] representation, the sign bit also has the weight {{math|−(2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} shown above. Using {{mvar|N}} bits, all integers from {{math|−(2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} to {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} can be represented.

The following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code shows a simple function which will convert an unsigned input integer to a two's complement signed integer using the above logic with [[Bitwise operation|bitwise operators]]:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="python"&gt;
def twos_complement(input_value, num_bits):
	'''Calculates a two's complement integer from the given input value's bits'''
	mask = 2**(num_bits - 1)
	return -(input_value &amp; mask) + (input_value &amp; ~mask)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Converting to two's complement representation==
&lt;!-- This section contains one footnote that is wrapped in a &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; tag, but this footnote does not list any external references or sources. --&gt;
In two's complement notation, a ''non-negative'' number is represented by its ordinary [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]]; in this case, the most significant bit is 0. Though, the range of numbers represented is not the same as with unsigned binary numbers.  For example, an 8-bit unsigned number can represent the values 0 to 255 (11111111).  However a two's complement 8-bit number can only represent positive integers from 0 to 127 (01111111), because the rest of the bit combinations with the most significant bit as '1' represent the negative integers −1 to −128.

The two's complement operation is the [[additive inverse]] operation, so negative numbers are represented by the two's complement of the [[absolute value]].

===From the ones' complement===
To get the two's complement of a binary number, the [[bit]]s are inverted, or "flipped", by using the [[bitwise NOT]] operation; the value of 1 is then added to the resulting value, ignoring the overflow which occurs when taking the two's complement of 0.

For example, using 1 byte, the decimal number 5 is represented by
:0000 0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The most significant bit is 0, so the pattern represents a non-negative value. To convert to −5 in two's-complement notation, the bits are inverted; 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0:
:1111 1010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
At this point, the representation is the [[ones' complement]] of the decimal value −5. To obtain the two's complement, 1 is added to the result, giving:
:1111 1011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The result is a signed binary number representing the decimal value −5 in two's-complement form. The most significant bit is 1, so the value represented is negative.

The two's complement of a negative number is the corresponding positive value. For example, inverting the bits of −5 (above) gives:
:0000 0100&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
And adding one gives the final value:
:0000 0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The two's complement of zero is zero: inverting gives all ones, and adding one changes the ones back to zeros (since the overflow is ignored). Furthermore, the two's complement of the most negative number representable (e.g. a one as the most-significant bit and all other bits zero) is itself. Hence, there appears to be an 'extra' negative number.

===Subtraction from 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;===

The sum of a number and its ones' complement is an {{mvar|N}}-bit word with all 1 bits, which is (reading as an unsigned binary number) {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}. Then adding a number to its two's complement results in the {{mvar|N}} lowest bits set to 0 and the carry bit 1, where the latter has the weight (reading it as an unsigned binary number) of {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Hence, in the unsigned binary arithmetic the value of two's-complement negative number {{math|''x''*}} of a positive {{mvar|x}} satisfies the equality {{math|1=''x''* = 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;For {{math|1=''x'' = 0}} we have {{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − 0 = 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is equivalent to {{math|1=0* = 0}} modulo {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} (i.e. after restricting to {{mvar|N}} least significant bits).&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, to find the 4-bit representation of −5 (subscripts denote the [[radix|base of the representation]]):
:{{math|1=''x'' = 5&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} therefore {{math|size=120%|1=''x'' = 0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
Hence, with {{math|1=''N'' = 4}}:
:{{math|1=''x''* = 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 5&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 10000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
The calculation can be done entirely in base 10, converting to base 2 at the end:
:{{math|1=''x''* = 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; − 5&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 11&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 1011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Working from LSB towards MSB===
A shortcut to manually convert a [[binary number]] into its two's complement is to start at the [[least significant bit]] (LSB), and copy all the zeros, working from LSB toward the most significant bit (MSB) until the first&amp;nbsp;1 is reached; then copy that&amp;nbsp;1, and flip all the remaining bits (Leave the MSB as a 1 if the initial number was in sign-and-magnitude representation). This shortcut allows a person to convert a number to its two's complement without first forming its ones' complement. For example: the two's complement of "0011&amp;nbsp;1100" is "1100&amp;nbsp;0&lt;u&gt;100&lt;/u&gt;", where the underlined digits were unchanged by the copying operation (while the rest of the digits were flipped).

In computer circuitry, this method is no faster than the "complement and add one" method; both methods require working sequentially from right to left, propagating logic changes. The method of complementing and adding one can be sped up by a standard [[carry look-ahead adder]] circuit; the LSB towards MSB method can be sped up by a similar logic transformation.

When turning a two's-complement number with a certain number of bits into one with more bits (e.g., when copying from a 1-byte variable to a 2-byte variable), the most-significant bit must be repeated in all the extra bits.  Some processors do this in a single instruction; on other processors, a conditional must be used followed by code to set the relevant bits or bytes.

Similarly, when a two's-complement number is shifted to the right, the most-significant bit, which contains magnitude and the sign information, must be maintained. However, when shifted to the left, a 0 is shifted in. These rules preserve the common semantics that left shifts multiply the number by two and right shifts divide the number by two.

Both shifting and doubling the precision are important for some multiplication algorithms. Note that unlike addition and subtraction, width extension and right shifting are done differently for signed and unsigned numbers.

==Most negative number==
With only one exception, starting with any number in two's-complement representation, if all the bits are flipped and 1 added, the two's-complement representation of the negative of that number is obtained. Positive 12 becomes negative 12, positive 5 becomes negative 5, zero becomes zero(+overflow), etc.

{|class="wikitable floatright" style="width:18em;"

The two's complement of the minimum number in the range will not have the desired effect of negating the number. For example, the two's complement of −128 in an 8-bit system results in the same binary number. This is because a positive value of 128 cannot be represented with an 8-bit signed binary numeral.

This phenomenon is fundamentally about the mathematics of binary numbers, not the details of the representation as two's complement. Mathematically, this is complementary to the fact that the negative of 0 is again 0. For a given number of bits ''k'' there is an even number of binary numbers 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, taking negatives is a [[group action]] (of the group of order 2) on binary numbers, and since the [[Orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of zero has order 1, at least one other number must have an orbit of order 1 for the orders of the orbits to add up to the order of the set. Thus some other number must be invariant under taking negatives (formally, by the [[orbit-stabilizer theorem]]). Geometrically, one can view the ''k''-bit binary numbers as the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Z/2^k&lt;/math&gt;, which can be visualized as a circle (or properly a regular 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;-gon), and taking negatives is a reflection, which fixes the elements of order dividing 2: 0 and the opposite point, or visually the zenith and nadir.

Note that this negative being the same number is detected as an overflow condition since there was a carry into but not out of the most-significant bit. This can lead to unexpected bugs in that an unchecked implementation of [[absolute value]] could return a negative number in the case of the minimum negative. The ''abs'' family of integer functions in [[C (programming language)|C]] typically has this behaviour. This is also true for Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html | title = Math ( Java Platform SE 7 )}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case it is for the developer to decide if there will be a check for the minimum negative value before the call of the function.

The most negative number in two's complement is sometimes called "the weird number," because it is the only exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jssst2006/papers/Affeldt.pdf | title = Formal Verification of Arithmetic Functions in SmartMIPS Assembly | author = Reynald Affeldt | author2 = Nicolas Marti | last-author-amp = yes | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722080531/http://www.ipl.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/jssst2006/papers/Affeldt.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Although the number is an exception, it is a valid number in regular two's complement systems. All arithmetic operations work with it both as an operand and (unless there was an overflow) a result.

==Why it works==
Given a set of all possible {{mvar|N}}-bit values, we can assign the lower (by the binary value) half to be the integers from 0 to {{math|(2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)}} inclusive and the upper half to be {{math|−2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to −1 inclusive.  The upper half (again, by the binary value) can be used to represent negative integers from {{math|−2&lt;sup&gt;''N'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} to −1 because, under addition modulo {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} they behave the same way as those negative integers.  That is to say that because {{math|1= ''i'' + ''j'' mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''i'' + (''j'' + 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;) mod 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} any value in the set {{math|1= { ''j'' + ''k'' 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; {{!}} ''k'' is an integer } }} can be used in place of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|j}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, with eight bits, the unsigned bytes are 0 to 255. Subtracting 256 from the top half (128 to 255) yields the signed bytes −128 to −1.

The relationship to two's complement is realised by noting that {{math|1=256 = 255 + 1}}, and {{math|(255 − ''x'')}} is the [[Signed number representations|ones' complement]] of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.

Fundamentally, the system represents negative integers by counting backward and [[modulo arithmetic|wrapping around]]. The boundary between positive and negative numbers is arbitrary, but by [[Convention (norm)|convention]] all negative numbers have a left-most bit ([[most significant bit]]) of one. Therefore, the most positive 4-bit number is 0111 (7) and the most negative is 1000 (&amp;minus;8). Because of the use of the left-most bit as the sign bit, the absolute value of the most negative number (|&amp;minus;8| = 8) is too large to represent. For example, an 8-bit number can only represent every integer from &amp;minus;128 to 127 ({{math|1=2&lt;sup&gt;8 − 1&lt;/sup&gt; = 128}}) inclusive. Negating a two's complement number is simple: Invert all the bits and add one to the result. For example, negating 1111, we get 0000&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Therefore, 1111 must represent &amp;minus;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is useful in simplifying the implementation of arithmetic on computer hardware. Adding 0011&amp;nbsp;(3) to 1111&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;1) at first seems to give the incorrect answer of 10010. However, the hardware can simply ignore the left-most bit to give the correct answer of 0010&amp;nbsp;(2). Overflow checks still must exist to catch operations such as summing 0100 and 0100.

The system therefore allows addition of negative operands without a subtraction circuit and a circuit that detects the sign of a number. Moreover, that addition circuit can also perform subtraction by taking the two's complement of a number (see below), which only requires an additional cycle or its own adder circuit. To perform this, the circuit merely pretends an extra left-most bit of 1 exists.

==Arithmetic operations==

===Addition===
Adding two's-complement numbers requires no special processing even if the operands have opposite signs: the sign of the result is determined automatically.  For example, adding 15 and −5:
&lt;pre style="width:25em"&gt;
  11111 111   (carry)
   0000 1111  (15)
 + 1111 1011  (−5)
 ===========
   0000 1010  (10)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This process depends upon restricting to 8 bits of precision; a carry to the (nonexistent) 9th most significant bit is ignored, resulting in the arithmetically correct result of 10&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

The last two bits of the [[Carry flag|carry]] row (reading right-to-left) contain vital information: whether the calculation resulted in an [[arithmetic overflow]], a number too large for the binary system to represent (in this case greater than 8 bits).  An overflow condition exists when these last two bits are different from one another.  As mentioned above, the sign of the number is encoded in the MSB of the result.

In other terms, if the left two carry bits (the ones on the far left of the top row in these examples) are both 1s or both 0s, the result is valid; if the left two carry bits are "1 0" or "0 1", a sign overflow has occurred.  '''Conveniently, an [[XOR]] operation on these two bits can quickly determine if an overflow condition exists.'''  As an example, consider the signed 4-bit addition of 7 and 3:
&lt;pre style="width:25em"&gt;
  0111   (carry)
   0111  (7)
 + 0011  (3)
 ======
   1010  (−6)  invalid!
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this case, the far left two (MSB) carry bits are "01", which means there was a two's-complement addition overflow.  That is, 1010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; is outside the permitted range of &amp;minus;8 to 7. The result would be correct if treated as unsigned integer.

In general, any two {{mvar|N}}-bit numbers may be added ''without'' overflow, by first sign-extending both of them to {{math|''N'' + 1}} bits, and then adding as above. The {{math|''N'' + 1}} bits result is large enough to represent any possible sum ({{math|1=''N'' = 5}} two's complement can represent values in the range &amp;minus;16 to 15) so overflow will never occur. It is then possible, if desired, to 'truncate' the result back to {{mvar|N}} bits while preserving the value if and only if the discarded bit is a proper sign extension of the retained result bits. This provides another method of detecting overflow&amp;mdash;which is equivalent to the method of comparing the carry bits&amp;mdash;but which may be easier to implement in some situations, because it does not require access to the internals of the addition.

===Subtraction===
Computers usually use the [[method of complements]] to implement subtraction. Using complements for subtraction is closely related to using complements for representing negative numbers, since the combination allows all signs of operands and results; direct subtraction works with two's-complement numbers as well. Like addition, the advantage of using two's complement is the elimination of examining the signs of the operands to determine whether addition or subtraction is needed. For example, subtracting −5 from 15 is really adding 5 to 15, but this is hidden by the two's-complement representation:
&lt;pre style="width:25em"&gt;
  11110 000   (borrow)
   0000 1111  (15)
 − 1111 1011  (−5)
 ===========
   0001 0100  (20)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Overflow is detected the same way as for addition, by examining the two leftmost (most significant) bits of the borrows; overflow has occurred if they are different.

Another example is a subtraction operation where the result is negative: 15&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;35 = −20:
&lt;pre style="width:25em"&gt;
  11100 000   (borrow)
   0000 1111  (15)
 − 0010 0011  (35)
 ===========
   1110 1100  (−20)
&lt;/pre&gt;
As for addition, overflow in subtraction may be avoided (or detected after the operation) by first sign-extending both inputs by an extra bit.

===Multiplication===
The product of two {{mvar|N}}-bit numbers requires {{math|2''N''}} bits to contain all possible values.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Paillard. ''An Introduction To Digital Signal Processors'', Sec. 6.4.2. Génie électrique et informatique Report, Université de Sherbrooke, April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the precision of the two operands using two's complement is doubled before the multiplication, direct multiplication (discarding any excess bits beyond that precision) will provide the correct result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, take {{math|1=6 &amp;times; &amp;minus;5 = &amp;minus;30}}. First, the precision is extended from four bits to eight. Then the numbers are multiplied, discarding the bits beyond the eighth bit (as shown by "{{Mono|x}}"):
&lt;pre style="width:25em"&gt;
     00000110  (6)
 *   11111011  (−5)
 ============
          110
         1100
        00000
       110000
      1100000
     11000000
    x10000000
 + xx00000000
 ============
   xx11100010
&lt;/pre&gt;
This is very inefficient; by doubling the precision ahead of time, all additions must be double-precision and at least twice as many partial products are needed than for the more efficient algorithms actually implemented in computers. Some multiplication algorithms are designed for two's complement, notably [[Booth's multiplication algorithm]]. Methods for multiplying sign-magnitude numbers don't work with two's-complement numbers without adaptation. There isn't usually a problem when the multiplicand (the one being repeatedly added to form the product) is negative; the issue is setting the initial bits of the product correctly when the multiplier is negative. Two methods for adapting algorithms to handle two's-complement numbers are common:

* First check to see if the multiplier is negative. If so, negate (''i.e.'', take the two's complement of) both operands before multiplying. The multiplier will then be positive so the algorithm will work. Because both operands are negated, the result will still have the correct sign.
* Subtract the partial product resulting from the MSB (pseudo sign bit) instead of adding it like the other partial products. This method requires the multiplicand's sign bit to be extended by one position, being preserved during the shift right actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John F. |last=Wakerly |title=Digital Design Principles &amp; Practices |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=3rd |year=2000 |page=47 |isbn=0-13-769191-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the second method, take the common add-and-shift algorithm for multiplication. Instead of shifting partial products to the left as is done with pencil and paper, the accumulated product is shifted right, into a second register that will eventually hold the least significant half of the product. Since the [[least significant bit]]s are not changed once they are calculated, the additions can be single precision, accumulating in the register that will eventually hold the most significant half of the product. In the following example, again multiplying 6 by &amp;minus;5, the two registers and the extended sign bit are separated by "|":
&lt;pre&gt;
  0 0110  (6)  (multiplicand with extended sign bit)
  × 1011 (−5)  (multiplier)
  =|====|====
  0|0110|0000  (first partial product (rightmost bit is 1))
  0|0011|0000  (shift right, preserving extended sign bit)
  0|1001|0000  (add second partial product (next bit is 1))
  0|0100|1000  (shift right, preserving extended sign bit)
  0|0100|1000  (add third partial product: 0 so no change)
  0|0010|0100  (shift right, preserving extended sign bit)
  1|1100|0100  (''subtract'' last partial product since it's from sign bit)
  1|1110|0010  (shift right, preserving extended sign bit)
   |1110|0010  (discard extended sign bit, giving the final answer, −30)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Comparison (ordering)===
[[Comparison (computer programming)|Comparison]] is often implemented with a dummy subtraction, where the flags in the computer's [[status register]] are checked, but the main result is ignored. The [[zero flag]] indicates if two values compared equal. If the exclusive-or of the [[Sign flag|sign]] and [[Overflow flag|overflow]] flags is 1, the subtraction result was less than zero, otherwise the result was zero or greater. These checks are often implemented in computers in [[conditional branch]] instructions.

Unsigned binary numbers can be ordered by a simple [[lexicographic ordering]], where the bit value 0 is defined as less than the bit value 1.  For two's complement values, the meaning of the most significant bit is reversed (i.e. 1 is less than 0).

The following algorithm (for an {{mvar|n}}-bit two's complement architecture) sets the result register R to −1 if A &lt; B, to +1 if A &gt; B, and to 0 if A and B are equal:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
 // reversed comparison of the sign bit

 if A(n-1) == 0 and B(n-1) == 1 then
    R := +1
    break
 else if A(n-1) == 1 and B(n-1) == 0 then
    R := -1
    break
 end
 
 // comparison of remaining bits

 for i = n-2...0 do
   if A(i) == 0 and B(i) == 1 then
      R := -1
      break
   else if A(i) == 1 and B(i) == 0 then
      R := +1
      break
   end
 end
 
 R := 0
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Two's complement and 2-adic numbers==
In a classic ''[[HAKMEM]]'' published by the [[MIT AI Lab]] in 1972, [[Bill Gosper]] noted that whether or not a machine's internal representation was two's-complement could be determined by summing the successive powers of two. In a flight of fancy, he noted that the result of doing this algebraically indicated that "algebra is run on a machine (the universe) which is two's-complement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hacks.html#item154 Hakmem - Programming Hacks - Draft, Not Yet Proofed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosper's end conclusion is not necessarily meant to be taken seriously, and it is akin to a [[mathematical joke]]. The critical step is "...110 = ...111&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1", i.e., "2''X'' = ''X''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1", and thus ''X''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;...111&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1. This presupposes a method by which an infinite string of 1s is considered a number, which requires an extension of the finite place-value concepts in elementary arithmetic.&lt;!--Does this interpretation take into account a sign bit?--&gt; It is meaningful either as part of a two's-complement notation for all integers, as a typical [[p-adic number|2-adic number]], or even as one of the generalized sums defined for the [[divergent series]] of real numbers [[1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + …|1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ···]].&lt;ref&gt;For the summation of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ··· without recourse to the 2-adic metric, see {{cite book |last=Hardy |first=G.H. |authorlink=G. H. Hardy |title=Divergent Series |year=1949 |publisher=Clarendon Press |id={{LCC|QA295|.H29|1967}}}} (pp. 7–10)&lt;/ref&gt; Digital arithmetic circuits, idealized to operate with infinite (extending to positive powers of 2) bit strings, produce 2-adic addition and multiplication compatible with two's complement representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On circuits and numbers |last=Vuillemin |first=Jean |year=1993 |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corp.]] |location=Paris |page=19 |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/PRL-RR-25.pdf |accessdate=2012-01-24}}, Chapter 7, especially 7.3 for multiplication.&lt;/ref&gt; [[continuous function|Continuity]] of binary arithmetical and [[bitwise operation]]s in 2-adic [[metric space|metric]] also has some use in cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crypto.rsuh.ru/ |title=ABC Stream Cipher |last1=Anashin|first1=Vladimir |last2=Bogdanov|first2=Andrey |last3=Kizhvatov|first3=Ilya |year=2007 |publisher=[[Russian State University for the Humanities]] |accessdate=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fractions conversion ==
To convert a fraction, for instance; .0101 you must convert starting from right to left the 1s to decimal as in a normal conversion. In this example 0101 is equal to 5 in decimal. Each digit after the floating point represents a fraction where the denominator is a multiplier of 2. So, the first is 1/2, the second is 1/4 and so on. Having already calculated the decimal value as mentioned above, you use only the denominator of the LSB (LSB = starting from right). As a result, we have 5/16.

For instance, having the floating value of .0110 for this method to work, one should not consider the last 0 from the right. Hence, instead of calculating the decimal value for 0110, we calculate the value 011, which is 3 in decimal (by leaving the "0" in the end, the result would have been 6, together with the denominator 2^4 = 16 reduces to 3/8). So the denominator is 8. So, the final result is 3/8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">In [[mathematics]], a '''Young symmetrizer''' is an element of the  [[group ring|group algebra]] of the [[symmetric group]], constructed in such a way that, for the homomorphism from the group algebra to the endomorphisms of a vector space &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n}&lt;/math&gt; obtained from the action of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n}&lt;/math&gt; by permutation of indices, the image of the endomorphism determined by that element corresponds to an [[irreducible representation]] of the symmetric group over the [[complex number]]s. A similar construction works over any field, and the resulting representations are called '''[[Specht module]]s'''. The Young symmetrizer is named after British mathematician [[Alfred Young]].

==Definition==
Given a finite symmetric group ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and specific [[Young tableau]] λ corresponding to a numbered partition of ''n'', define two [[permutation group|permutation subgroups]] &lt;math&gt;P_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:
{{what|reason=you forgot to specify the action|date=November 2016}}

:&lt;math&gt;P_\lambda=\{ g\in S_n : g \text{ preserves each row of } \lambda \}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_\lambda=\{ g\in S_n : g \text{ preserves each column of } \lambda \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Corresponding to these two subgroups, define two vectors in the [[group algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}S_n&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;a_\lambda=\sum_{g\in P_\lambda} e_g&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;b_\lambda=\sum_{g\in Q_\lambda} \sgn(g) e_g&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_g&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector corresponding to ''g'', and &lt;math&gt;\sgn(g)&lt;/math&gt; is the sign of the permutation. The product

:&lt;math&gt;c_\lambda := a_\lambda b_\lambda = \sum_{g\in P_\lambda,h\in Q_\lambda} \sgn(h) e_{gh}&lt;/math&gt;

is the '''Young symmetrizer''' corresponding to the [[Young tableau]] λ. Each Young symmetrizer corresponds to an irreducible representation of the symmetric group, and every irreducible representation can be obtained from a corresponding Young symmetrizer. (If we replace the [[complex number]]s by more general [[field (mathematics)|field]]s the corresponding representations will not be irreducible in general.)

==Construction==
Let ''V'' be any [[vector space]] over the [[complex number]]s.  Consider then the [[tensor product]] vector space &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n}=V \otimes V \otimes \cdots \otimes V&lt;/math&gt; (''n'' times). Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; act on this tensor product space by permuting the indices. One then has a natural [[group ring|group algebra]] representation  &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}S_n \rightarrow \text{End} (V^{\otimes n})&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a partition λ of ''n'', so that &lt;math&gt;n=\lambda_1+\lambda_2+ \cdots +\lambda_j&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;a_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Im}(a_\lambda) := a_\lambda V^{\otimes n} \cong
\text{Sym}^{\lambda_1}\; V \otimes 
\text{Sym}^{\lambda_2}\; V \otimes \cdots \otimes
\text{Sym}^{\lambda_j}\; V.
&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, if &lt;math&gt;n =4&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda = (2,2)&lt;/math&gt;, with the canonical Young tableau &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,2\},\{3,4\}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the corresponding &lt;math&gt;a_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt; a_\lambda = e_{\text{id}} + e_{(1,2)} + e_{(3,4)} + e_{(1,2)(3,4)}&lt;/math&gt;. Let an element in &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes 4}&lt;/math&gt; be given by &lt;math&gt;v_{1,2,3,4}:=v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3 \otimes v_4&lt;/math&gt;. Then 
:&lt;math&gt; a_\lambda v_{1,2,3,4} = v_{1,2,3,4} + v_{2,1,3,4} + v_{1,2,4,3} + v_{2,1,4,3} = (v_1 \otimes v_2 + v_2 \otimes v_1) \otimes (v_3 \otimes v_4 + v_4 \otimes v_3). &lt;/math&gt;
The latter clearly span &lt;math&gt; \text{Sym}^2\; V\otimes \text{Sym}^2\; V&lt;/math&gt;.

The image of &lt;math&gt;b_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Im}(b_\lambda) \cong
\bigwedge^{\mu_1} V \otimes 
\bigwedge^{\mu_2} V \otimes \cdots \otimes
\bigwedge^{\mu_k} V 
&lt;/math&gt;
where μ is the conjugate partition to λ. Here, &lt;math&gt;\text{Sym}^i V &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge^j V&lt;/math&gt; are the [[symmetric algebra|symmetric]] and [[exterior algebra|alternating tensor product spaces]].

The image &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}S_nc_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;c_\lambda = a_\lambda \cdot b_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}S_n&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible representation of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, called a [[Specht module]]. We write
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Im}(c_\lambda) = V_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; 
for the irreducible representation.

Some scalar multiple of &lt;math&gt;c_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is idempotent,&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Fulton|Harris|1991|loc=Theorem 4.3, p. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is  &lt;math&gt;c^2_\lambda = \alpha_\lambda c_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; for some rational number &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda\in\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  Specifically, one finds &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda=n! / \text{dim } V_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, this implies that representations of the symmetric group can be defined over the rational numbers; that is, over the rational group algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider, for example, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the partition (2,1). Then one has &lt;math&gt;c_{(2,1)} = e_{123}+e_{213}-e_{321}-e_{312}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''V'' is a complex vector space, then 
the images of &lt;math&gt;c_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on spaces &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes d}&lt;/math&gt; provides essentially all the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of GL(V).
