The '''Black Egyptian hypothesis''' is the hypothesis that [[ancient Egypt]] was a predominantly Black civilization, as the term is currently understood in modern American ethnic perception. It includes a particular focus on identifying links to [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] cultures and the questioning of the race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times, including [[Tutankhamun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tutankhamun was not black: Egypt antiquities chief |accessdate=May 28, 2012 |website=AFP |date=Sep 25, 2007 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB6u3XEMp9IrJfl-kH6FHNgZCg_A |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213002414/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iB6u3XEMp9IrJfl-kH6FHNgZCg_A |archivedate=February 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the king represented in the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]],&lt;ref name="Africans abroad"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DBhqAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=sphinx+negroid&amp;q=sphinx+#search_anchor |title=Africans abroad: a documentary history of the Black Diaspora in Asia, Latin … |author=Graham W.

The hypothesis is regarded as a fringe theory. Mainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and present day Egyptians, applying modern notions of black or white [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] to ancient Egypt is [[Anachronism|anachronistic]].&lt;ref name="Egypt pg 162"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AClFWV6PE8wC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;dq=brace,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&amp;q=brace%2C%20egyptian%2C%20race&amp;f=false |title=Black Athena Revisited |page=162 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=2016-05-28|isbn=9780807845554 |last1=Lefkowitz |first1=Mary R |last2=Rogers |first2=Guy Maclean |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancient Egypt pg 329"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PG6HffPwmuMC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=bard,+egyptian,+race#v=onepage&amp;q=race&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt |page=329 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780415185899 |last1=Bard |first1=Kathryn A |last2=Shubert |first2=Steven Blake |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Race pg 19"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pFrm19cZhugC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=race,+egypt,+anachronistic,+bard#v=snippet&amp;q=race&amp;f=false |title=Afrocentrism: Mythical Pasts and Imagined Homes |author=Stephen Howe |page=19 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9781859842287 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the black Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt. At the [[UNESCO]] "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the [[Meroitic script]]" in [[Cairo]] in 1974, the Black hypothesis met with profound disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA43 |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=43 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=onepage&amp;q=conclusion&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |website=Books.google.co.za |access-date=28 May 2016|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last few years, the first credible, peer-reviewed genetic studies on Ancient Egyptians have been conducted, which show a small but significant and consistent affinity with sub-Saharan Africans among Ancient Egyptians from northern Egypt, which becomes increasingly large as one proceeds south through the populations of Middle and Upper (southern) Egypt. A 2017 genetic study of 83 mummies from northern Egypt (buried near modern-day Cairo), which constituted "the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods," showed that these persons were most closely related to the diverse modern populations of what is now the Arab world, particularly the southern Levant and Arabia, while also indicating smaller affinities to the neighboring southeastern European and sub-Saharan African (Nubian) populations.{{cn|date=December 2018}} All 83 mummies tested had significant levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry, although this ancestry was relatively distant. Specifically, the mummies contained between 6% and 15% sub-Saharan African ancestry, with this component getting increasingly large in the later eras of Ancient Egypt. The study's authors noted that this is much less than the percentage of sub-Saharan African ancestry in modern Egyptians, and emphasized the genetic distance between modern and Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzewski, Sonia (2007). "Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state". American Journal of Physical Anthropology. 132 (4): 501–9. doi:10.1002/ajpa.20569. {{PMID|17295300}}, retrieve at [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2d97/908369cfee5b6b7431e508326f07b6cd492d.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors also cautioned that their findings might be unrepresentative of Ancient Egypt as a whole, anticipating that mummies from Upper (southern) Egypt would contain considerably greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry than the Lower Egyptian mummies they examined, and calling for more future research on the matter.

In 2008, S. O. Y. Keita wrote that "There is no scientific reason to believe that the primary ancestors of the Egyptian population emerged and evolved outside of northeast Africa.... The basic overall genetic profile of the modern population is consistent with the diversity of ancient populations that would have been indigenous to northeastern Africa and subject to the range of evolutionary influences over time, although researchers vary in the details of their explanations of those influences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keita|first=S.O.Y.|title=Ancient Egyptian Origins:Biology|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/geopedia/Ancient_Egypt|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=15 June 2012|date=Sep 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuart Tyson Smith]] writes in the 2001 ''Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' that "Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as 'black', while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans."&lt;ref name=" Redford 2001 p. 27-28"&gt;Stuart Tyson Smith (2001) The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt, Volume 3.

A study by published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from [[Abusir|Abusir el-Meleq]] in the Cairo Governate. The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided "the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods". The study showed that Ancient Egyptians had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern (Arab, Levantine and Anatolian) populations, and had significantly more affinity with southeastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Nevertheless, there was a significant sub-Saharan African component in the ancestry of three of the mummies tested: "absolute estimates of African ancestry using these two methods in the three ancient individuals range from 6 to 15%." This level of sub-Saharan African ancestry is significantly lower than that of modern Egyptians from Abusir, who "range from 14 to 21%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The authors of the study cautioned that the samples from the mummies, which were taken from a region that (while technically part of Middle Egypt) is geographically in the far north of Egypt, may not be representative of Ancient Egypt as a whole. Contemporary genetic studies show much greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the current-day populations of southern as opposed to northern Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzewski, Sonia (2007).

The Black African model relied heavily on the interpretation of the writings of Classical historians, who were writing during and after the time when Egypt was a province of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], i.e. long after the golden age of pharaohic Egypt had passed and when Egypt was full of foreigners. 
Several Ancient Greek historians noted that Egyptians had complexions that were "melanchroes".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' 2.104.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is considerable controversy over the translation of melanchroes.

Many scholars (Aubin, Heeren, Davidson, Diop, Poe, Welsby, Celenko, Volney, Montet, Bernal, Jackson, DuBois, Strabo), ancient and modern, routinely cite Herodotus in their works on the Nile Valley.  Some of these scholars (Welsby, Heeren, Aubin, Diop, etc.) explicitly mention the reliability of Herodotus' work on the Nile Valley and demonstrate corroboration of Herodotus' writings by modern scholars.  Welsby said that "archaeology graphically confirms some of Herodotus' observations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welsby|first=Derek|title=The Kingdom of Kush|year=1996|publisher=British Museum Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7141-0986-2|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.H.L.

*"For all the writers who preceded the ludicrous and vicious falsifications of modern Egyptology, and the contemporaries of the ancient Egyptians (Herodotus, Aristotle, Diodorus, Strabo, and others), the Black identity of the Egyptian was an evident fact."

==Melanin samples==
While at the [[University of Dakar]], Diop used microscopic laboratory analysis to measure the melanin content of skin samples from several Egyptian mummies (from the Mariette excavations).  The melanin levels found in the dermis and epidermis of that small sample led Diop to classify all the ancient Egyptians as "unquestionably among the Black races".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3|pages=236–243}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the UNESCO conference, Diop invited other scholars to examine the skin samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=20, 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gray, ''Conceptions of History in the Works of Cheikh Anta Diop and Theophile Obenga'', (Karnak House:1989) 11–155&lt;/ref&gt;  Diop also asserted that Egyptians shared the "B" blood type with black Africans.

The other scholars at the symposium however rejected Diop's Black-Egyptian theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=33 |website=Books.google.co.za |date= |accessdate=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Diop and Obenga attempted to linguistically link Egypt and Africa, by arguing that the [[Ancient Egyptian language]] was related to Diop's native [[Wolof language|Wolof]] (Senegal).&lt;ref&gt;Alain Ricard, Naomi Morgan, ''The Languages &amp; Literatures of Africa: The Sands of Babel,'' James Currey, 2004, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;  Diop's work was well received by the political establishment in the [[Decolonisation of Africa|post-colonial]] formative phase of the state of [[Senegal]], and by the Pan-Africanist ''[[Négritude]]'' movement, but was rejected by mainstream scholarship. In drafting that section of the report of the UNESCO Symposium, Diop claimed that Diop and Obenga's linguistic reports had a large measure of agreement and were regarded as "very constructive".&lt;ref name="Mokhtar 1990 31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the discussion thereof in the work ''Ancient Civilizations of Africa, Volume 2'', the editor has inserted a footnote stating that these are merely Diop's opinions and that they were not accepted by all the experts participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=snippet&amp;q=language&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-05-28|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Prof Abdelgadir M. Abdalla stated that "The linguistic examples given by Prof Diop were neither convincing nor conclusive."&lt;ref name="google40"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=snippet&amp;q=dynastic%20race&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-05-28|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural practices==
According to Diop, historians are in general agreement that the Aethiopians, Egyptians, Colchians, and people of the Southern Levant were among the only people on Earth practicing circumcision, which confirms their cultural affiliations, if not their ethnic affiliation.&lt;ref name="Diop 1974 112, 135–138"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3|pages=112, 135–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Egyptian (adolescent) style of circumcision was different from how circumcision is practiced in other parts of the world, but similar to how it is practiced throughout the African continent.&lt;ref name="Bailey 1996 88–89"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Susan|title=Egypt in Africa|year=1996|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indiana, USA|isbn=978-0-253-33269-1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ancient writings discuss (Egyptian) circumcision in religious terms"&lt;ref name="Stouhal 1992 29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stouhal|first=Eugen|title=Life of the Ancient Egyptians|year=1992|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Oklahoma|isbn=978-977-424-285-4|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 6th Dynasty tomb shows circumcision being performed by a "circumcising priest, rather than a physician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ghalioungui|first=Paul|title=Magic &amp; Medical Science in Ancient Egypt|year=1963|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=New York|asin=B000IP45Z8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The practice of circumcising by religious, rather than medical, authorities is still common throughout Africa today."&lt;ref name="Bailey 1996 88–89"/&gt;  Furthermore, in both ancient Egypt and modern Africa, young boys were circumcised in large groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stracmans|first=M.|title=Encore un texte peau connu relatif a la circoncision des anciens Egyptiens.  Archivo Internazionale di Ethnografia e Preistoria|year=1959|pages=2:7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumcision was practiced in Egypt at a very early date.  Strouhal mentions that "the earliest archaeological evidence for circumcision was found in the southern Nile Valley and dates from the Neolithic period, some 6000 years ago".  The remains of circumcised individuals are cited as proof.&lt;ref name="Stouhal 1992 29"/&gt;  Similarly, Doyle states "It is now thought that the Egyptians adopted circumcision much earlier" (than the confirmed 2400 BC date), "from peoples living further south in today's Sudan and Ethiopia, where dark-skinned peoples are known to have practised circumcision".  Evidence suggests that circumcision was practiced in the [[Arabian peninsula]] "from where, in the fourth millennium BCE, two groups of people migrated into what we today call Iraq. These were the Sumerians and, slightly later, the [[Semitic people|Semite]]s, the forefathers of the Hebrews".&lt;ref name=doyle_2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doyle D |title=Ritual male circumcision: a brief history |journal=The Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh|volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=279–285 |date=October 2005 |pmid=16402509|url=http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_35_3/doyle_circumcision.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical Ham, blackness, and Ham's offspring==

According to Diop, Bernal, and other scholars, "Ham was the ancestor of Negroes and Egyptians."  According to Bernal, "the Talmudic interpretation that the [[Curse of Ham|curse of Ham]] (the father of Canaan and Mizraim, Egypt) was blackness was widespread in the 17th century".&lt;ref name="Bernal 1987 242"/&gt;  [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] was the father of [[Mizraim]] (the Hebrew word for Egypt), [[Phut]], [[Cush (Bible)|Kush]], and [[Canaan]].  For Diop, Ham means "heat, black, burned" in Hebrew, an etymology which became popular in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kush is positively identified with black Africa.  Furthermore, "If the Egyptians were Negroes, sons of Ham...it is not by chance that this curse on the father of Mesraim, Phut, Kush, and Canaan, fell only on Canaan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3|pages=5–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of David Goldenberg's ''The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam'' states that Goldenberg "argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Molly Myerowitz|title=David M.

{{main article | Km (hieroglyph)}}

Ancient Egyptians referred to their homeland as ''Kmt'' (conventionally pronounced as ''Kemet''). 

According to Diop, the Egyptians referred to themselves as "Black" people or ''kmt'', and ''km'' was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa II: Ancient Civilizations of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-55652-072-3|pages=246–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diop,&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148" /&gt; [[William Leo Hansberry]],&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148" /&gt; Aboubacry Moussa Lam&lt;ref&gt;Aboubacry Moussa Lam, "L'Égypte ancienne et l'Afrique", in Maria R. Turano et Paul Vandepitte, ''Pour une histoire de l'Afrique'', 2003, pp. 50 &amp;51&lt;/ref&gt; and other supporters of the Black Egyptian hypothesis have argued that the name ''kmt'' or ''Kemet'' was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people, which Diop ''et al.'' claim was black.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar 1990 21, 26"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=21, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herodotus|title=The Histories|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London, England|isbn=978-0-14-044908-2|pages=134–135, 640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|pages=27, 38, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that the Ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography,&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148" /&gt; but it is rejected by most Egyptologists.&lt;ref&gt;Bard, Kathryn A. "Ancient Egyptians and the Issue of Race". in Lefkowitz and MacLean rogers, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scholars hold that ''kmt'' means "the black land" or "the black place", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil which was washed down from Central Africa by the annual [[Nile]] inundation. By contrast the barren [[desert]] outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called ''dšrt'' (conventionally pronounced ''deshret'') or "the red land".&lt;ref name="Shavit01-148"&gt;Shavit 2001: 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

At the [[UNESCO]] Symposium in 1974, Professors Sauneron, Obenga, and Diop concluded that KMT and KM meant black.&lt;ref name="Mokhtar 1990 40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=978-0-520-06697-7|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Professor Sauneron clarified that the Egyptians never used the adjective ''Kmtyw'' to refer to the various black peoples they knew of, they only used it to refer to themselves.&lt;ref name="google40"/&gt;

==Ancient art==

Diop saw the representation of black people in Egyptian art and iconography throughout Egyptian history.  University of Chicago scholars state that the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range "from dark red to brown to black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nubia Gallery|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/nubia/huy.html|publisher=The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy, as well as Ramses II's temple at Beit el-Wali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=22–23, 36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Snowden indicates that Statius spoke of "red Ethiopians" and Romans had accurate knowledge of "negroes of a red, copper-colored complexion...among African tribes".&lt;ref name="Snowden 1970 3"/&gt;

Professors Vercoutter, Ghallab and Leclant stated that "Egyptian iconography, from the 18th Dynasty onward, showed characteristic representations of black people who had not previously been depicted; these representations meant, therefore, that at least from that dynasty onward the Egyptians had been in contact with peoples who were considered ethnically distinct from them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZWuVAL2GooC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%2BUNESCO,+%2BMokhtar,+%2BCairo,+%2Brace#v=snippet&amp;q=dynastic%20race&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Civilizations of Africa |author=Muḥammad Jamāl al-Dīn Mukhtār |page=10 |accessdate=2016-05-28|isbn=9780852550922 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of Egyptians in art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.&lt;ref name="egyptologyonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptologyonline.com/book_of_gates.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207072141/http://www.egyptologyonline.com/book_of_gates.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Booth,The Ancient Egyptians for Dummies (2007) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  Najovits states that "Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately, arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature."&lt;ref name="Egypt pg 318"&gt;'Egypt, Trunk of the Tree, A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land, Vol. 2''. by Simson Najovits pg 318&lt;/ref&gt; He continues that "There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddish-brown Egyptians and black Nubians."&lt;ref name="Egypt pg 318"/&gt;

==Sculpture and the Sphinx==

Numerous scholars, such as DuBois,&lt;ref name="Africans abroad"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h1RRPJSaThsC&amp;dq=William+Edward+Burghardt+Du+Bois+the+negro&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Negro |author=W.

Cairo: Government Press, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all Egyptologists and scholars currently believe that the face of the Sphinx represents the likeness of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Khafra]], although a few Egyptologists and interested amateurs have proposed several [[Great Sphinx of Giza|different hypotheses]].

==[[Qustul]] artifacts==
Scholars from the University of Chicago Oriental Institute excavated at Qustul (near Abu Simbel – Modern Sudan), in 1960–64, and found artifacts which incorporated images associated with Egyptian pharaohs. From this Williams concluded that "Egypt and Nubia [[A-Group culture]] shared the same official culture", "participated in the most complex dynastic developments", and "[[Nubia]] and Egypt were both part of the great East African substratum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Bruce|title=Before the Pyramids|year=2011|publisher=Oriental Institute Museum Publications|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-885923-82-0|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also wrote that Qustul in Nubia "could well have been the seat of Egypt's founding dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/museum/special/nubia/|title=The Nubia Salvage Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=E9nfgKRMxVoC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=qustul,+baines#v=onepage&amp;q=qustul&amp;f=false |title=Ancient Egyptian Kingship |website=Books.google.co.za |accessdate=2016-05-28|isbn=978-9004100411 |last1=O'Connor |first1=David Bourke |last2=Silverman |first2=David P |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diop used  this as further evidence in support of his Black Egyptian hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=Civilization or Barbarism|year=1991|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois, USA|isbn=978-1-55652-048-8|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; David O'Connor wrote that the Qustul incense burner provides evidence that the A-group Nubian culture in Qustul marked the "pivotal change" from predynastic to dynastic "Egyptian monumental art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Before the Pyramids|year=2011|publisher=Oriental Institute Museum Publications|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1-885923-82-0|pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent and broader studies have determined that the distinct pottery styles, differing burial practices, different grave goods and the distribution of sites all indicate that the [[Naqada]] people and the Nubian A-Group people were from different cultures. Kathryn Bard further states that "Naqada cultural burials contain very few Nubian craft goods, which suggests that while Egyptian goods were exported to Nubia and were buried in A-Group graves, A-Group goods were of little interest further north."&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt'', by Kathryn A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4144">The '''Centre for Contemporary History''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Zentrum für Zeithistorische Forschung'', abbreviated ''ZZF'') is an interdisciplinary [[research institute]] focusing on the [[contemporary history]] of Europe, especially Germany, and member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]].

==History==
The ZZF, located in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]], was established in 1996 as the continuation of the [[Max Planck Society]] research program on Contemporary History, founded in 1992. Its main operation was supported by the state of [[Brandenburg]], with additional financial backing from the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] (German Research Foundation) for specific projects. Since 2009 the ZZF is a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community]] and therefore mainly funded to equal parts by the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[States of Germany|''Länder'']].

Its current directors are Martin Sabrow and Frank Bösch. Past directors include [[Jürgen Kocka]], Christoph Kleßmann, and Konrad H. Jarausch.

==Research==
The Centre cooperates with the doctoral programs of several universities, and other research programs. The emphasis is on production of scholarly papers and dissertations on the [[History of Germany since 1945|partition of Germany after world War II]], the comparison of post-war [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes in [[Central Europe|Central and Eastern Europe]], and the history and transformation of European memory. The Centre also organizes joint academic conferences, accepts [[visiting scholar]]s, and coordinates [[memorial]]s and [[museum]]s. Additionally, the Centre also engages in the production of non-academic public lectures, conferences, workshops and multimedia based websites.

==Publications==
The Centre publishes several publications and websites:
* ''Zeithistorische Forschungen / Studies in Contemporary History'', an [[open access journal]] published also in print by [[Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht]]. The journal contains both German and English articles, each with an abstract in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeithistorische Forschungen / Studies in Contemporary History'' was reviewed by Andrew I. Port, H-Net Reviews, July, 2009,
URL: [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=24748 http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showrev.php?id=24748].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Zeithistorische Studien'' (Contemporary Historical Studies), a monograph series of which up to 2010 have been published 47 titles.
* ''Geschichte der Gegenwart'' (The History of the Present), a monograph series (since 2010).
* ''ZeitRäume'' (TimeSpaces), an [[almanac]].
* ''Zeitgeschichte-online'' (ContemporaryHistory-online), a [[web portal]].

Sites on the portal devoted to the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]] ([http://www.17Juni53.de 17Juni53.de]) and on the history of the [[Berlin Wall]] ([http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de Chronik-der-Mauer.de]) are particularly frequently used. The Centre also designed the website [http://www.ungarn1956.de Ungarn1956.de] (Hungary1956), on the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] jointly with the “[[Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur]]” (Foundation for the Reconciliation of the SED Dictatorship) and the Collegium Hungaricum Berlin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6153">'''Chapel Tseten Puntsok''' ({{lang-bo|ཆབ་སྤེལ་ཚེ་བརྟན་ཕུན་ཚོགས་}}, {{lang-zh|恰白·次旦平措}}; October 1922 – August 2013) was a Tibetan historian, author and politician. He was one of the leading figures in Tibetan history research in China.

== Biography ==
Chapel Tseten Puntsok was born in [[Lhatse]] in 1922 to the Lhamon family, one of the three aristocrat families in the town. His brother Lhamon Yeshe Tsultrim was at the time an attendant of the [[9th Panchen Lama]]. Both Lhamon Yeshe Tsultrim and his younger brother Lhamon Sonam Lhundrup would later become vice-presidents of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|People's Political Consultative Conference]]. At a young age, Lhamon Tseten Phuntsok was adopted by his uncle Chapel Jigme Kunga and changed his surname to Chapel. He became an attendant of [[Kalön]] Surkhang Wangchen Gelek. Three years later, he was appointed as the [[Dzongpen]] (mayor) of [[Gyantse County|Gyangtse]], and then Dzongpen of [[Gyirong County|Gyirong]].&lt;ref name=ctibet&gt;{{cite news|title=恰白·次旦平措：西藏新史学的奠基者和开拓者|url=http://www.tibet.cn/culture/history/1351747320706.shtml|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=tibet.cn|date=1 November 2012|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, Shigatse Primary School, the first facility of modern education in [[Shigatse]] region, was established. Chapel Tseten Puntsok became the vice-headmaster of the school, and later [[Shigatse Prefecture]]'s director of culture and education. From 1956 to 1959, he was also the Dzongpen of [[Namling]]. In 1960, Chapel Tseten Puntsok became a member of Shigatse's Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee, and in 1965, vice-secretary-general of [[Lhasa]]. He was purged to work in the countryside during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 

After 1978, he worked as the vice-president of Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, consultant of Tibet Academy of Social Sciences, honorary president of [[China Writers Association]] Tibet Autonomous Region Branch, vice-president of Tibet Autonomous Region [[politics of China#local government|People's Congress]] Standing Committee, and at other positions. After retirement in 1998, he continued to work at [[Tibet University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=恰白·次旦平措|url=http://www.xzass.org/html/news249.html|publisher=Tibet Autonomous Region Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapel died in Lhasa in 2013.&lt;ref name="scio"&gt;{{cite news|title=恰白·次旦平措同志逝世 习近平等表示哀悼|url=http://www.scio.gov.cn/zhzc/8/1/Document/1344105/1344105.htm|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=Tibet Daily|publisher=The State Council Information Office of the People's Republic of China|date=20 August 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and Works ==
After the cultural revolution, Chapel Tseten Puntsok began his career of scientific research. Chapel is heavily inspired by [[Gendun Chophel]], and continued Gendun's academic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=恰白·次旦平措同志逝世|url=http://cpc.people.com.cn/n/2013/0820/c87393-22625790-2.html|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=cpc.people.com.cn (Communist Party of China--People's Daily Online)|date=20 August 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his main works, ''A Comprehensive History of Tibet: The Precious String of Turquoise'' ({{lang-bo|བོད་ཀྱི་ལོ་རྒྱུས་རགས་རིམ་གཡུ་ཡི་ཕྲེང་བ}}, {{lang-zh|西藏通史：松石宝串}}), published in 1989, is the first book in modern China that covered the entire Tibetan history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=巴桑罗布|title=往事知多少，汗青印千秋——评《西藏简明通史》|journal=China Tibetology|date=1993|issue=2|pages=132-136|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-volume book in Tibetan was expanded from one of his earlier works, which was written as a task to counter the influences of [[Shakabpa]]'s work ''Tibet: A Political History''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=亚东达瓦次仁|title=西藏历史巨著——《西藏简明通史：松石宝串》|journal=Journal of Tibet University|date=2005|volume=20|issue=1|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chapel's work won China's National Book Award, the first book in Tibetan ever to win the award. It was also recommended by [[Hu Jintao]], Party secretary of Tibet Autonomous Region at the time of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=中国著名藏学家恰白·次旦平措逝世|url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2013/08-16/5173332.shtml|accessdate=8 November 2017|agency=China News Agency|date=16 August 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapel is the chief editor of ''Gangchen Rigzo'' ({{lang-bo|གངས་ཅན་རིག་མཛོད།}}, {{lang-zh|雪域文库}}), one of the largest collection of classical Tibetan works.

Among China's [[Tibetology]] community, Chapel is often credited with successfully reconstructing Tibet's early history from ancient Tibetan literature, in which historical events are usually mixed with legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=史学家恰白·次旦平措：坚持真理的历史老人|url=http://www.tibet.cn/holiday/zmft/201310/t20131030_1945776.htm|accessdate=8 November 2017|publisher=tibet.cn|date=3 November 2013|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapel is also among the first Tibetan historians in China to comparatively study ancient Tibetan and contemporary Chinese, Mongolian and Tangut documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huo|first1=Wei|title=Dual Evidence and the Reconstruction of Tibetan Ancient History: Discussions on Professor Chaphel Tseten Phuntsog's Influence on Tibetan New History|journal=Tibetan Studies|date=2008|issue=4|url=http://www.zangx.com/cms/d/file/chengguopingtai/lunwen/2010-06-10/d16a4f5f60809be14d05b365e06c08ac.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2017|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2795">'''December''' (from Latin ''decem'', "ten") or '''''mensis December''''' was originally the tenth month of the [[Roman calendar]], following [[November (Roman month)|November]] (''novem'', "nine") and preceding [[Ianuarius]]. It had 29 days. When the calendar was reformed to create a 12-month year starting in Ianuarius, December became the twelfth month, but retained its name, as did the other numbered months from Quintilis (July) through December. Its length was increased to 31 days under the [[Julian calendar|Julian calendar reform]].

==Dates==
The Romans did not number days of a month sequentially from the first day through the last. Instead, they counted back from the three fixed points of the month: the [[Nones (calendar)|Nones]] (5th or 7th), the [[Ides (calendar)|Ides]] (13th or 15th), and the [[Kalends]] (1st) of the following month. The Nones of December was the 5th, and the Ides the 13th. The last day of December was the ''pridie Kalendas Ianuarias,''&lt;ref&gt;The month name is construed as an adjective modifying the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] plural ''Kalendae,'' ''Nonae'' or ''Idūs''.&lt;/ref&gt; "day before the Januarian Kalends". Roman counting was [[inclusive counting|inclusive]]; December 9 was ''ante diem V Idūs Decembrīs'', "the 5th day before the Ides of December," usually abbreviated ''a.d. V Id. Dec.'' (or with the ''a.d.'' omitted altogether); December 24 was ''IX Kal. Ian.'', "the 9th day before the Kalends of Ianuarius," on the Julian calendar ''(VII Kal. Ian.'' on the pre-Julian calendar, when December had only 29 days).

On the calendar of the [[Roman Republic]] and early [[Principate]], each day was marked with a letter to denote its religiously lawful status. By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show days marked with these letters, probably in part as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 17, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Days were also marked with [[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinal letters]] in cycles of ''A B C D E F G H'', to mark the "market week"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''The Roman Calendar from Numa to Constantine: Time, History, and the Fasti,'' translated by David M.B. Richardson (Blackwell, 2011, originally published 1995 in German), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17618">A '''dolium''' (plural: dolia) is a large [[earthenware]] vase or vessel used in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman times]] for storage or [[Transport|transportation of goods]].
It's similar to [[Kvevri]] which is widely used for wine farming in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to this day.
[[File:Ostia Antica Dolia.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Dolia at [[Ostia Antica]].]]

==Description==
Though many modern authors{{Who|date=March 2013}} make the mistake of translating a dolium as a wooden [[barrel]], it was actually a very large jug or container made of [[fired clay]]. Oval in shape, with a wide mouth and rim, it was much larger than the [[amphora]], a similar pottery container. The dolium had no neck or handles and, in many cases, could measure up to six [[foot (measurement)|feet]] in height. Some dolia have a rounded body tapering into a flat bottom, while more frequently, dolia maintained a rounded bottom. They were lined with [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] or wax in order to contain or process liquids and solid foods. Some sources mention dolia holding up to 50 [[quadrantals]], equivalent to 346.5 [[gallons]]. Though there was no standard size for dolia, even the smallest capacity recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] was large for Roman earthenware containers.

==History==
Much of what modern scholars know about the dolium comes from ancient [[Latin literature]]. Sources which address agriculture, significantly ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'' by [[Cato the Elder]], ''[[Res Rustica]]'' by [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ''[[Res Rustica]]'' by [[Columella]], and the ''[[Res Rustica]]'' by [[Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]], help us determine the size, appearance and purposes of the dolia. Because these sources deal with rural matters of the time, they also give scholars an insight into the life and [[culture of ancient Rome]] in addition to specific information about use of the dolium. Another noteworthy source is the [[Digest of Justinian]]. It is a collection of quotations from earlier works of [[Roman jurisprudence|Roman jurists]] that discuss the importance of the integration of dolia in ancient Roman society. These sources, along with a variety of other less significant sources where dolia are only briefly mentioned, characterize the dolia as the largest type of earthenware vessel made by the Romans.&lt;ref name="Brenni, G. M. R 1985"&gt;Brenni, G. M. R. 1985. “The Dolia and the Sea-Borne Commerce of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]].” MA thesis, [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and purpose==
There is evidence to support the claim of many classical archaeologists that dolia were used exclusively on land for the processing and storage of foodstuffs. For instance, dolia were manufactured for the most part by travelling specialist [[pottery|potters]] or by workshops that were involved principally in production of [[architectural ceramics]]. Dolia were used in food production areas, such as farmhouses, and selling points like taverns and town warehouses. Dolia were also used in theatres for their [[acoustics|acoustic]] qualities (presumably for special [[sound effect]]s).

The two methods of storing dolia were to either bury them half way in the ground or standing under a roof. They were used to hold goods such as [[wine]], [[grape husks]], [[olive oil]], [[amurca]], [[wheat]], and other common grains. Many dolia hold record amounts of 40-50 quadrantals (quadrantals being the general amount held in one amphora). Unlike the amphora, the dolium was not regarded as an accessory and sold along with the wine that it contained. Rather, dolia were fixed facilities not employed for the distribution of wine. Its major purpose was for the permanent storage capacity of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Pena, T. J. 2007. ''Roman Pottery In The Archaeological Record''. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]]. 20, 46-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, dolia were also commonly used in conjunction with transport facilities such as [[Cargo ship|merchant ships]] and temporary storage places like harbor warehouses. Surprisingly given their construction, dolia were often used in overseas transport. Recent archaeological discoveries indicate two or three rows of dolia were sometimes positioned along the keel of a merchant ship, apparently cemented in place to prevent shifting with the ship's movement at sea. This technique allowed dolia to serve as fixed receptacles for the transport of wine. The high prices of dolia is evidence to indicate that their incorporation into maritime transportation represented a substantial investment of funds. Also, given their great weight and bulk, replacement must have represented both an inconvenience and an expense. Thus, extraordinary caution must have been placed when handling the dolia to preserve and maintain their useful life. 

[[Ethnography|Ethnographic research]] indicates that in many cases dolia remained in use for several decades, and therefore, it seems plausible to suggest that dolia regularly remained in prime use for up to 20–30 years and perhaps longer.&lt;ref name="Brenni, G. M. R 1985"/&gt;

==Dolia in maritime commerce==

===Positions of dolia in ships===
While the mystery of the dolia in relation to maritime commerce is still being researched, archaeologists have substantial evidence from shipwrecks to support its significant, yet short role. One of the most striking evidences of the use of dolia in the commerce of food supplies is their presence on board Roman merchant ships. There have been at least seven [[shipwreck]]s discovered carrying dolia, dating between the 1st century BC and the 3rd century AD. Three of the most interesting and identifiable shipwrecks that lend themselves to study of dolia are the ''[[Diano Marina]]'', the ''[[Petit Congloue]]'', and the ''[[La Giraglia]]'' shipwrecks. 

The ''Diano Marina'' shipwreck (IM, [[Liguria]], Italy) was discovered with fifteen dolia still intact. Its relatively deep underwater location provided sufficient protection from both natural and human disturbances to allow for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. The dolia from this shipwreck were found to be two different shapes, corresponding to two different positions on board the ship. Four long, cylindrical dolia were located in a line along the keel of the ship, while ten shorter, more rounded dolia were divided into two lines and laid alongside the central dolia. This type of disposition seems to be related to the structure of the ship and most likely implies that the lips of all the dolia were lying at an even level. The preservation of the Diano Marina's entire cargo provides a rare chance to estimate the capacity of Roman ships. Based on the calculations of the capacity of the central cylindrical dolia and the surrounding rounded dolia on board, the total capacity of the dolia on board the “Diano Marina” would have been approximately 9,500 gallons. 

The “Petit Congloue” shipwreck ([[Marseille]], [[Bouches-du-Rhône|Bouches-du-Rhone]], [[Provence]], France) was discovered in a similar environment as the “Diano Marina” shipwreck. Its relatively deep underwater location sufficiently protected the site from disturbances as well, which also allowed for a more detailed study on the position of dolia on board this Roman merchant ship. However, in the “Petit Congloue” shipwreck, the dolia are all unfortunately silted up to their shoulders, making it impossible to distinguish their different shapes. But their disposition clearly shows the same pattern of three lines parallel to the keel as in the “Diano Marina” shipwreck, which allows us to further specify that the vases in each line were actually sized compared to the ones in the neighboring line. It is important to note here that even though this shipwreck does not allow us to study the shapes of these particular dolia, the sporadic recovery of single dolia from the sea without its known origins basically shows two different and distinct shapes: cylindrical or rounded.

===Construction of Dolia Ships===
The “La Giraglia” shipwreck, discovered off the coast of [[Corsica|Corsica, France]], is particularly interesting because it is officially recognized as a [[cistern boat]]. This type of vessel was intended to transport dolia in bulk as the dolia appear to have been placed in the hold as the ship was being built. The “La Giraglia” was carrying at least eight dolia and its excavation gives insight into the ship’s design and how such vessels contributed to patterns of trade in the western Mediterranean. The cistern boat was an innovation in [[Shipbuilding|ship construction]], intended to respond to changes in the production and transportation of wine brought about by Roman expansion. The cistern boat began being built during the [[Augustan Period]], and continued until the 2nd century. The relatively short period of production for this ship-type suggests that there were problems with its design which caused the design to be superseded. Because each discovery illuminates the ways in which maritime commerce adapted to the demands of production and transportation, the “La Giraglia” shipwreck is essential in the understanding of mutual exchange within the Mediterranean. 

As this dolia ship came to a very traumatic ending, there is little left to be excavated and studied of the hull. The hull planking is also poorly preserved, but there were, however, thirteen [[strake]]s that may serve for extrapolation to the design of the entire ship. The strakes were fastened together by pegged [[mortise and tenon]] [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] and assembled in the classic shell-first construction. The spacing between mortises and the width of the mortises is very tight and they also appear to be slightly wider than the tenons. It is believed that the space left within the mortises was intended to compensate for possible misalignment of opposite mortises. It appears that they were arranged in a straight line, rather than alternating from the inboard to the outboard edge and the back inboard in order to prevent the wood from splitting. Twenty-six frames were also identified and recorded from the “La Giraglia” dolia shipwreck. The large quantity of nails indicates their significance as a strengthening element in the assemblage of the frames with the planking. 

The “La Giraglia” was a medium-sized ship, but possessed a few rather unusual characteristics because the discovery and study of the twenty-six frames reveal that 58.8% of the preserved hull was composed of [[oak]]. The use of oak solely for the hull planking has never before been seen in the Mediterranean. However, given the fragmented nature of the remaining wreck, this preponderance of oak in the surviving portions may not reflect the composition of the rest of the original ship. It could have perhaps only been used for the bottom of the hull, which would certainly be an interesting characteristic for such cistern boats. The ship builder might have thought it necessary to use this hardwood because the weight of the cargo was concentrated in the center section of the ship. Overall, there were six species of wood  used in the construction of the “La Giraglia”: oak was used for the [[frame (nautical)|frame]]s and tenons, [[beech]] and [[elm]] also for the frames, [[Wood ash|ash]] made up the small pegs used in the hull planking, and [[fir]] and two other types of oak. The shipwright obviously knew how to use the available species appropriately for the construction of the different structures and elements of the ship. 

“Whatever the answers to the numerous questions raised about the dolia vessels or cistern boats, these ships must be considered not only as a technical innovation of their time, but also as a daring enterprise. The presence of huge containers in the hold presented an obvious and real danger. The rupture of a full dolium would have caused almost two tons of wine to pour rapidly into the hold, which could have resulted in a sudden destabilization and [[capsizing]] of the vessel. In spite of the advantages of dolia over [[amphoras]], the obvious risks may explain why cistern boats disappeared”.&lt;ref&gt;Marlier, S. and P. Sibella. 2002, “La Giraglia, a dolia wreck of the 1st century BC from Corsica, France: study of its hull remains.” International Journal of [[Maritime archaeology|Nautical Archaeology]] 31.2: 161-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent discovery===
A new dolia shipwreck has recently been discovered on the seabed just off the coast of the Tuscan island of [[Elba]]. The contents of the Roman ship were perfectly preserved, containing nine intact dolia that measured two meters high and five meters round. Experts estimate the ship to be about twenty-two meters in length and date back to the time of the [[first Roman empire]]. "This is the first time a complete, inviolate wreck has been found," [[Michelangelo Zecchini]], an archaeologist who works for the Forum [[UNESCO]] commented. "However in itself just the number of containers and their superb condition makes this a truly astounding discovery”.&lt;ref&gt;“Mystery of seabed resolved with 2,000 year old ship’s discovery.” The Roman Hideout. http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2002/irna20020824.asp (26 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Excavation remains slow and tedious as the shipwreck lies under a meter of lime, but archeologists are hoping that this discovery will provide valuable information and details about the layout and cargo of the ship, as well as cargo ships like it. Doing so will help historians better understand and study the shipping routes of the Mediterranean in antiquity. 

[[ProMare]], a [[non-profit organization]] that promotes marine discovery and archeology around the globe, is currently heading up the excavation process. It began on September 2, 2008 and represents current attempts to use modern technology in the excavation process. So far, it has been discovered that the ship was carrying ten dolia with a capacity of 400-450 gallons each. The project plans to continue excavating the site in 2009 with the use of a custom-built [[remotely operated vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gambogi, P., et al. 2008. “Dolia Shipwreck.” Promare: Promoting [[Marine Research]] and Exploration. {{cite web |url=http://www.promare.org/project_doliashipwreck.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412095140/http://www.promare.org/project_doliashipwreck.html |archivedate=2009-04-12 |df= }} (26 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusions===
Study and analysis of shipboard use of dolia on Roman merchant ships indicates a strong similarity to how dolia were used on land. “It seems that dolia were made in a shape that allowed them to fit perfectly inside a ship in order to leave minimal empty space. The central row was composed of the highest cylindrical dolia, while the two other lines, laid on both sides of the central one, were composed of shorter and more rounded vases. The very tight disposition of the dolia has led to the deduction that these containers were never removed from their places on board ship and that when they carried wine, it had to be poured in and out at the ports-of-call. This conclusion is supported by the fact that all the dolia found on Roman port buildings were imbedded in the ground, and therefore were also irremovable.” 

In terms of maritime commerce, two assumptions about dolia presented: one, dolia were intended to carry wine and two, they were irremovable within the ships that carried them. This is supported by an ambiguous passage of Latin text from Pliny’s Digest that talks about wine being poured for ships specialized for wine. This would draw the conclusion that ships carrying dolia were specifically transporting only wine. 

“Perhaps one of the most interesting results of the search for information on dolia is the fact that they have been found in considerable quantities in every step of a system of food supply which was related to the overseas trade. In fact, the archaeological evidence confirms the existence of a commercial organization, which would buy a certain food commodity, most likely wine, stored in dolia… In a second step the same commodity may be been further transported to other dolia in other warehouses located closer to possible buyers… All the archaeological and literary evidence support this vision” of the role of dolia in maritime commerce.&lt;ref name="Brenni, G.

'''El Kef''' ({{lang-ar|الكاف}} ''{{audio|help=no|Kef.wav|il-kāf}}''), also known as ''Le Kef'', is a city in northwestern [[Tunisia]]. It serves as the capital of the [[Kef Governorate]].

El Kef is situated {{convert|175|km}} to the west of [[Tunis]] and some {{convert|40|km}} east of the border between Algeria and Tunisia. It has a population of {{formatnum:45191}} (2004 census).&lt;ref name="ins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ins.nat.tn/fr/rgph2.1.commune.php?code_modalite=24423&amp;Code_indicateur=0301007&amp;Submit3=Envoyer|title=Recensement de 2004 (Institut national de la statistique)|language=fr|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128160935/http://www.ins.nat.tn/fr/rgph2.1.commune.php?code_modalite=24423&amp;Code_indicateur=0301007&amp;Submit3=Envoyer|archivedate=2015-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old town is built on the cliff face of the table-top [[Jebel Dyr]] mountain. El Kef was the provisional capital of Tunisia during [[World War II]]. It was the command centre of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération Nationale]] during the [[Algerian War of Independence]] against the [[France|French]] in the 1950s.

The [[Sidi Bou Makhlouf]] Mausoleum entombs the patron saint of the city.

== Geography ==
The highest-elevated city of Tunisia, at {{convert|780|m}}, its metropolitan [[area]] reaches {{convert|2500|ha}} of which {{convert|45|ha}} lie within the interior of the old walled [[Medina quarter]].

The municipality of El Kef is shared between two national [[Delegations of Tunisia|delegates]], East Kef and West Kef, which correspond to the two municipal boroughs.

=== Etymology ===
First known by the name of Sicca during the [[Punics|Carthaginian]] era, then later [[Sicca Veneria]] during the rise of [[Ancient Rome|Roman domination]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tunisia|author= Anthony Ham, Abigail Hole|year=2004|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4lQNCHfS4gC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Tunisia+%22El+Kef%22|isbn=1-74104-189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city has carried numerous names throughout its history: [[Sicca Veneria|Colonia Julia Cirta]], Cirta Nova, Sikka Beneria, Shaqbanariya and finally El Kef since the [[16th century]].

===Ancient times===
El Kef has since ancient times been the principal city of the High-Tell Mountains and of the Tunisian northwest of which it constituted, until recently, the political center, the most important religious center, and the dominant stronghold.

In the early 5th Century [[Apiarius of Sicca]] was a priest here, and instigated a dispute between the churches of Carthage and Rome concerning the jurisdiction of the Bishops of Africa when he appealed to the church of Rome against his excommunication by the church of Carthage.

Around 439, invading [[Vandals]] conquered the African Romans near the coast. Eventually, El Kef became part of a Berber Kingdom.&lt;!---really needs citation---&gt;

===Umayyad conquest===
In 688 AD, the city was raided during the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]].

In the 17th century, a [[Kasbah of Le Kef]] was built to house a permanent garrison (''ujaq''); the construction was completed by the addition of fortified ramparts in 1740.  This did not however prevent the taking and pillaging of the city by the [[Algeria]]ns in 1756, nor the occupation by the French military from 1881, following the partial collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

On July 8, 1884, the authorities of the new [[French Protectorate of Tunisia|French Protectorate]] declared El Kef a municipality, one of the first in the country.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb]], Johannes Hendrik Kramers, [[Bernard Lewis]], [[Charles Pellat]] et [[Joseph Schacht]], ''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', vol. IV, éd. Brill, Leyde, 1954, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
In 1973, there was a summit meeting here between the Tunisian president [[Habib Bourguiba]] and the Algerian president [[Houari Boumédiène]]. The latter proposed a constitution for a Tunisian-Algerian union which Bourguiba declined in favor of the development of economic cooperation between the two countries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Twz0kOnCxXYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=kef+1973+boumediene&amp;ei=57dJTPGrN5P84Aa9seSZDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Nicole Grimaud|title=La politique extérieure de l'Algérie (1962-1978)''|edition=Karthala|location=Paris|year=1984|pages=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climate==
The climate is usually unstable, ranging from summer heat waves to winter snow blizzards.

[[File:Sidi Bou Makhlouf roof.jpg|thumb|Domes of the Sidi Bou Makhlouf Mausoleum.]]

El Kef contains a certain number of Islamic religious edifices, in its role as the center of a [[Sufism|Sufic]] movement.  The [[Sidi Bou Makhlouf Mausoleum]] holds the tomb of the founder of the [[Aissawa]] brotherhood in Tunisia, [[Sidi Bou Makhlouf]]. The El Qadriya mosque is also important to Sufism.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

A legacy of the old [[History of the Jews in Tunisia|local Jewish community]], the [[Synagogue of the Ghriba (El Kef)|synagogue of the Ghriba]] is the object of veneration by Jews of the region, who come in pilgrimage each year during the week marked by the festival of [[Sukkot]].

In the city is the mausoleum of Ali Tukie, the father of [[Al-Husayn I ibn Ali at-Turki]], founder of the [[Husainid dynasty]] which ruled Tunisia from 1705 to 1957.

The vestiges, well preserved, of a three-naved Roman [[basilica]] dating from the beginning of the 5th century named Dar El Kous, dedicated to [[Peter (apostle)|Saint Peter]], have been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;François Baratte, Féthi Béjaoui et Zeïneb Ben Abdallah, ''Recherches archéologiques à Haïdra : miscellanea, 2'', éd.

{{Campaignbox Rise of Macedon}}

Under the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] (359–336 BC), the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|kingdom of Macedonia]], initially at the periphery of classical Greek affairs, came to dominate [[Ancient Greece]] in the span of just 25 years, largely thanks to the personality and policies of its king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zacharia|2008|loc=Simon Hornblower, "Greek Identity in the Archaic and Classical Periods", pp. 55–58}}; {{harvnb|Joint Association of Classical Teachers|1984|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Errington|1990|pp=3–4}}; {{harvnb|Fine|1983|pp=607–608}}; {{harvnb|Hall|2000|p=64}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|2001|p=11}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2001|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Osborne|2004|p=127}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|1989|pp=12–13}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|1993|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Starr|1991|pp=260, 367}}; {{harvnb|Toynbee|1981|p=67}}; {{harvnb|Worthington|2008|pp=8, 219}}; {{harvnb|Chamoux|2002|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Perlman|1973|p=78}}; {{harvnb|Hamilton|1974|loc=Chapter 2: The Macedonian Homeland, p. 23}}; {{harvnb|Bryant|1996|p=306}}; {{harvnb|O'Brien|1994|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Bard|1999|p=460}}; {{harvnb|Levinson|1992|p=239}}; {{harvnb|Fox|1986|pp=104, 128, 131, 256}}; {{harvnb|Wilcken|1967|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and [[Marriage of state|marriage alliances]] to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the [[ancient Macedonian army]] into an effective fighting force. The [[Macedonian phalanx]] became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent [[Hellenistic period]]. His army and engineers also made extensive use of [[siege engine]]s.

[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] during the reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding [[Illyrians]] and [[Thracians]]. Chief among Philip's Thracian enemies was the ruler [[Kersebleptes]], who may have coordinated a temporary alliance with [[Classical Athens|Athens]]. In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a [[Tributary state|tributary]] [[vassal]], conquering much of [[Thrace]] in the process and founding new cities there such as [[Philippi]] (modern [[Filippoi]], [[Greece]]) and [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] (modern [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king [[Bardylis]], who threatened Macedonia proper, and against [[Grabos]] and [[Pleuratus]] in [[Illyria]] (centred in modern-day [[Albania]]).

Philip II eventually campaigned against the city-state of [[Second Athenian League|Athens and her allies]] in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean region]], as well as [[Theban hegemony|Thebes after the decline of its hegemony]] in [[mainland Greece]]. In the defence of the [[Amphictyonic League]] of [[Delphi]] and in conjunction with the [[Thessalian League]], Macedonia became a key player in the [[Third Sacred War]] (356–346 BC), defeating the [[Phocian]]s, commanded by [[Onomarchus]], at the [[Battle of Crocus Field]] in 352 BC. While poised to launch a direct assault on [[History of Athens|Athens]] in 346 BC, the Macedonian king was met with an Athenian embassy that arranged a [[peace treaty]] known as the [[Peace of Philocrates]]. As a result, Macedonia and Athens became allies, yet Athens was forced to relinquish its claims to the city of [[Amphipolis]] (in modern-day [[Central Macedonia]]).

The Peace of Philocrates eventually broke down as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. [[Demosthenes]], an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered [[Philippic|a series of speeches]] encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian [[hegemony]] over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC. In the aftermath the [[federation]] of Greek states known as the [[League of Corinth]] was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as ''[[strategos]]'' (i.e. [[commander-in-chief]]) for a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|planned invasion]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[History of Persia|Persia]]. However, Philip [[Pausanias of Orestis|was assassinated]] before he could begin the campaign, a task that instead fell to his son and successor, [[Alexander the Great]].

{{further information|Greek historiography}}
[[File:Aeschines_bust.jpg|thumb|Marble bust of the Athenian statesman [[Aeschines]], 4th century BC, [[British Museum]]]]
Intact and relatively detailed histories of Greece, such as [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', and [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Hellenica]]'' cover the period from roughly 500–362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant period of Greek history (359–336 BC), although it is included within various [[Universal history|universal histories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2014|pp=312–316}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2008|p=xxiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the period of Philip's reign, but the action is much compressed, and due to the scope of the work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same period elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2006|pp=1–13}}; {{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the period therefore contains many gaps.&lt;ref name=Bucklerxiv&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=xiv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another surviving work for the period is [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]'s [[epitome]] of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus]]'s ''Philippic History''. Justin's epitomised history is also much condensed from the no-longer-extant original and covers not only Philip's reign, but also the history of Macedon before him, the exploits of Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], and his ''[[diadochi]]'' successors during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Justinus|2011|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Worthington|2014|pp=314–315}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These surviving histories are complemented by fragments of other histories, including [[Theopompus]]'s 58-volume history of Philip (which was the source for much of Trogus's ''Philippic History'') and by contemporary [[epigraphic]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Justinus|2011|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Worthington|2014|pp=312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the brief notices of Philip's exploits which occur in Diodorus and Justin, further details of his campaigns (and indeed the period in general) can be found in the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily [[Demosthenes]] and [[Aeschines]], which have survived intact.&lt;ref name=Bucklerxiv/&gt; Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with great circumspection, particularly given the identity of the authors. Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as "a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to have told the truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell92&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [[Peace of Philocrates]] (made in 346 BC) is known primarily from their speeches (both called ''On the False Embassy''), made in 343 BC, when Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines for his involvement in making the peace treaty.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=95–96}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Aeschines poses as the champion of the peace treaty, when he had in fact opposed making peace; conversely, Demosthenes, who had been a proponent of peace in 346 BC represents himself as part of the "war-party". The arguments made in the speeches therefore refer to the political situation in 343 BC and not the situation when the treaty was made, which makes teasing out the actual historical threads rather difficult.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95*/&gt;

{{further|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
[[File:362BCThebanHegemony.png|thumb|right|250px|The [[Theban hegemony]]; power-blocks in Greece in the decade up to 362 BC.]]

In the aftermath of the [[Peloponnesian War]], the militaristic city-state of [[Sparta]] had been able to impose a [[Spartan hegemony|hegemony]] over the heartland of Classical Greece (the [[Peloponessus]] and mainland Greece south of [[Thessaly (ancient region)|Thessaly]]), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and led directly to the [[Corinthian War]] of 395–387 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seager|1994a|pp=97–99}}; {{harvnb|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|loc="Corinthian War", p. 376}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called [[Peace of Antalcidas|King's Peace]].&lt;ref name=Seager117&gt;{{harvnb|Seager|1994b|pp=117–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however,&lt;ref name=Seager117/&gt; and in the next decade, the [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] would revolt against Sparta.&lt;ref name=Seager171*&gt;{{harvnb|Seager|1994b|pp=171–175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to ''de facto'' Theban independence.&lt;ref name=Seager171*/&gt; Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]] (371 BC), and under the leadership of [[Epaminondas]] inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king [[Cleombrotus I]] in the process.&lt;ref name=DSXV55&gt;Diodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23538;layout=;loc=15.54.1 XV.55].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Pelopidas'', 23; Xenophon. ''Hellenica'', [[s:Hellenica/Book 6/Chapter 4#6:4|6.4]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following up on this victory, Epaminondas invaded Peloponnesus in 370 BC and began dismantling the basis of Spartan dominance. Spartan power rested on the forced labour of the [[helots]] of [[Messenia]], which allowed the entire male Spartan population to dedicate themselves to warfare.&lt;ref name=Buckley453&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=453}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This focused military training system had previously enabled Sparta to exert power out of proportion to its small population. However, after their losses at Leuctra, the Spartans were unable to resist Epaminondas's invasion, and he marched into Messenia and liberated the helots, thereby permanently crippling Sparta.&lt;ref name=Buckley453/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy207*&gt;{{harvnb|Roy|1994|pp=207–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Thebans then began to extend their influence over Greece, effectively replacing the Spartan hegemony with [[Theban hegemony|their own]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|pp=450–462}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy187*&gt;{{harvnb|Roy|1994|pp=187–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Theban generals [[Pelopidas]] and Epaminondas [[Epaminondas#Theban hegemony|campaigned all over Greece]] for the next 9 years to further Theban power and influence.&lt;ref name=Roy187*/&gt; In 362 BC, Epaminondas's [[Epaminondas#Fourth invasion of the Peloponnesus (362&amp;nbsp;BC)|fourth invasion of the Peloponnesus]], which reached its climax at the [[Battle of Mantinea (362 BC)|Battle of Mantinea]], brought almost every state in Greece into the conflict, on one side or the other.&lt;ref name=ZVII5&gt;Xenophon. ''Hellenica'', [[s:Hellenica/Book 7/Chapter 1#7:5|7.5]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Thebans and their allies were victorious at Mantinea, Epaminondas was killed, and Theban losses were heavy. Xenophon, summing up his account of Mantinea, suggests that: {{Quotation|When these things had taken place, the opposite of what all men believed would happen was brought to pass. For since well-nigh all the people of Greece had come together and formed themselves in opposing lines, there was no one who did not suppose that if a battle were fought, those who proved victorious would be the rulers and those who were defeated would be their subjects; but the deity so ordered&amp;nbsp;... that while each party claimed to be victorious, neither was found to be any better off&amp;nbsp;... but [that] there was even more confusion and disorder in Greece after the battle than before.|[[Xenophon]]&lt;ref name=ZVII5/&gt;}}

The years of conflict which resulted from the Theban attempts to reorganise Greece had left much of the country war-weary and exhausted; a general peace (excluding only a recalcitrant Sparta) was therefore concluded between all the states of Greece in the aftermath of Mantinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2002|p=259}}; {{harvnb|Buckley|1996|pp=462–463}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of Epaminondas and significant loss of manpower at Mantinea, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system, and Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece.&lt;ref name=Roy207*/&gt; It was the Athenians, and their [[Second Athenian League|second League]], who would be Macedon's main rivals for control of the lands of the north Aegean, and a major theme during the period was the regular state of war between [[Macedon]] and Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=69–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Expansion of Macedon (English).svg|thumb|200px|right|Expansion of [[Macedon]] under [[Philip II of Macedon]]]]

===Philip's accession===
{{Main article|Philip II of Macedon}}

In 360 BC, the [[Ancient Macedonian army|Macedonian army]] under [[Perdiccas III]] had been defeated in battle by the [[Dardani]]an tribe of [[Illyria]]; Perdiccas and 4,000 troops had been killed. The Illyrians prepared to invade [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]; meanwhile, the [[Paionia]]ns were ravaging Macedonian territory, the [[Thrace|Thracians]] were preparing to invade in support of the pretender [[Pausanias (pretender)|Pausanias]], as were the Athenians, in support of a different pretender, [[Argeus (pretender)|Argeus]].&lt;ref name=DSXVI1&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=16.2 XVI.2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Macedon was in another of its periodic crises.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|pp=467–472}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], was at this time still an infant. Philip, the sole surviving son of [[Amyntas III]], was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as king.&lt;ref name=Ellis730&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1994|p=730}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that he was initially acclaimed as regent for his nephew Amyntas IV, and later usurped the throne, although if so, he did not harm Amyntas.&lt;ref name=Ellis730/&gt; Either way, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] became king by 359 BC, and began energetically attempting to save Macedon from destruction.&lt;ref name=Ellis731&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1994|p=731}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Macedonian recovery (359–358 BC)==

===Reconstruction of the army===
{{Main article|Ancient Macedonian army}}
[[File:Ancient Mieza, Macedonian tombs of Lefkadia, The Tomb of Jugdement 926eb424be6db3e06917e5c03ffdfaaa.jpg|thumb|Painted depiction of a soldier wearing the ''[[linothorax]]'', from an [[ancient Macedonia]]n tomb of [[Mieza, Macedonia]] in [[Imathia]], Greece, 4th century BC]]
Philip's first priorities were to reconstruct the Macedonian army, and restore the morale of both the army and the people. He held a series of assemblies with the Macedonian people, and "exhorting them with eloquent speeches to be men, he built up their morale".&lt;ref name=DSXVI3&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23581;layout=;loc=16.4.1 XVI.3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He exhaustively re-trained his men with new tactics and equipment. In particular, he instigated the use of the [[phalanx formation]] by the Macedonian foot-soldiery, and equipped the troops with 6 metre long pikes (the ''[[sarissa]]''), in contrast to the 2–3 metre spear (''[[dory (spear)|doru]]'') used by Greek [[hoplite]]s.&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt;

===Diplomacy===
At the same time, Philip engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity. He bribed [[Berisades]], son of the Thracian king [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|Cotys]], to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis731/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king [[Bardylis]], possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's weakness is suggestive that some agreement was reached.&lt;ref name=Ellis731/&gt; Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty.&lt;ref name=Ellis731/&gt; At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.

===Battle of Methone===
[[File:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|thumb|200px|right|[[Macedon]]'s neighbours in antiquity]]

Philip realized that the sole intention of the Athenian support for Argeus was to recover [[Amphipolis]] (see below), which they hoped to do by placing Argeus on the throne.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis731/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; Philip therefore withdrew the Macedonian garrison from Amphipolis and declared it autonomous, to undermine the purpose of Athenian support for Argeus.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellis731/&gt;

The Athenian expedition, led by Mantias, still landed at [[Methoni, Pieria|Methone]] on the Macedonian coast, with 3,000 mercenary troops.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt; Mantias now declined to leave Methone, so Argeus instead led the troops to the ancient Macedonian capital of [[Aegae (Macedon)|Aegae]], hoping that the populace would declare him king.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; However, the people of Aegae showed no interest in doing so, and Argeus therefore marched back to Methone. On the way, he was attacked and defeated in battle by Philip, many of the Athenian mercenaries being slain and the rest taken captive.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; According to Diodorus, this victory did much to restore the morale of the Macedonian army, and gave the soldiers encouragement for the battles to come.&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt;

Having defeated the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors to Athens. He was prepared to abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians to make peace with him.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI4&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23582;layout=;loc=16.3.1 XVI.4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paionia and Illyria===
{{Main article|Battle of Erigon Valley}}
The following year (358 BC), Philip heard that the Paionian king, Agis, had died. Taking advantage of their political disarray and transition of power, Philip marched his army into Paionia, where he defeated the Paionians. He then compelled the tribe to swear allegiance to Macedon.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt;

Philip was now able to turn to the Illyrians, who were still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not).&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt; He held an assembly of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria.&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt; Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace on the basis of the status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt;

Diodorus preserves the only account of the battle, which Beloch suggested may have taken place near [[Bitola|Monastir]].&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, note to Diodorus XVI.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He says that: {{Quotation|When the armies approached each other and with a great outcry clashed in the battle, Philip, commanding the right wing, which consisted of the flower of the Macedonians serving under him, ordered his cavalry to ride past the ranks of the barbarians and attack them on the flank, while he himself falling on the enemy in a frontal assault began a bitter combat. But the Illyrians, forming themselves into a square, courageously entered the fray. And at first for a long while the battle was evenly poised because of the exceeding gallantry displayed on both sides, and as many were slain and still more wounded, the fortune of battle vacillated first one way then the other, being constantly swayed by the valorous deeds of the combatants; but later as the horsemen pressed on from the flank and rear and Philip with the flower of his troops fought with true heroism, the mass of the Illyrians was compelled to take hastily to flight.|[[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt;}}

According to Diodorus, some 7,000 Illyrians died in the battle.&lt;ref name=DSXVI4/&gt; The Illyrians withdrew from Macedon and sued for peace. After this campaign Philip had established his authority inland as far as [[Lake Ohrid]] and gained the favour of the [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirotes]], who had also been at war with the Illyrians.{{cref|a}}&lt;ref name=Ellis734&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|1994|p=734}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thessaly===

Justin and Diodorus both say that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, VII.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI14/&gt; In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief ascendancy in the Greek world, after being unified under [[Jason of Pherae|Jason]] of [[Pherae]], who was appointed ''[[Tagus (title)|Tagus]]'' (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, Jason was assassinated in 370 BC, and his son [[Alexander of Pherae|Alexander]] became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the [[Thessalian League]] therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a desultory conflict in which both [[Macedon]] (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes in the aftermath of Mantinea, on-off conflict within Thessaly continued.&lt;ref name=Buckler14&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was himself assassinated in 358 BC, by his wife's brothers [[Lycophron II of Pherae|Lycophron]] and [[Tisiphonus]], who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the [[Aleuadae]], the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of [[Larissa]], were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.&lt;ref name=DSXVI14&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23582;layout=;loc=16.3.1 XVI.14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Silver tetradrachm obverse Philip II CdM Paris Armand-Valton315.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Philip II of Macedon]] – a Macedonian silver [[tetradrachm]] coin minted during his reign]]

Although Diodorus says that Philip defeated the new tyrants, Buckler considers it more likely that Philip's appearance on the scene allowed the Aleuadae to negotiate a peace settlement with Pherae from a position of greater strength.&lt;ref name=Buckler62&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip seems to have come away from the expedition with new wives from both Larissa ([[Philinna]]) ''and'' Pherae ([[Nicesipolis]], Jason's niece), which is suggestive of a negotiated settlement; certainly, as Buckler says, "Philip came away from Thessaly with a foot in both camps".&lt;ref name=Buckler62/&gt;

Philip appears to have had a strong interest in Thessaly from the start of his reign, even despite his problems elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Buckler62/&gt; There are several probable reasons for this interest. Firstly, and most pressingly, Philip probably wanted to take control of the border region of [[Perrhaebia]] (traditionally part of Thessaly), in order to secure Macedon's southern border.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt; Secondly, since Larissa controlled the main north-south routes between Macedon and Thessaly, friendly relations with the Aleuadae would help protect Macedon ''and'' give Philip access to the rest of Greece.&lt;ref name=Buckler62/&gt; Thirdly, Thessaly had plentiful resources that Philip could see the long-term potential of exploiting: {{Quotation|Thessaly was rich in land, produce, cities and men. Thessalian cavalry was the best in Greece, and the mountainous country surrounding Thessaly supplied numerous peltasts. Success in Thessaly would provide Philip with a new army and additional revenues. Nor could he wisely stand by and watch the tyrants of Pherae overwhelm the Thessalian confederacy. Jason of Pherae had given the Greek world a glimpse of the potential might of a united Thessaly, and no Macedonian king could afford to forget the lesson.|John Buckler&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|pp=63–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Summary to 358 BC===
Through his frenetic activity since coming to the throne, Philip had successfully shored up the Macedonian situation, defeating or making peace with Macedon's erstwhile enemies, whilst securing most of Macedon's borders, and revitalising and retraining his army.&lt;ref name=Buckley467*/&gt;

==Conquest in the North (357–353 BC)==

===Amphipolis (357 BC)===
Philip's next aim was to secure Macedon's eastern flank, which bordered Thrace, and in particular the city of Amphipolis.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|pp=470–472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphipolis was a major strategic point, situated on the [[Struma (river)|Strymon River]], where it controlled the only crossing point on the lower reaches of the river, and therefore access to and from Thrace. Eastwards expansion of his kingdom therefore required that Philip control Amphipolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians had founded a colony there in the previous century,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; only to lose control of it during the Peloponnesian War.&lt;ref name=DSXVI3/&gt; The Athenians were very keen to recover Amphipolis, partly because of its history, although the Amphipolitans were not inclined to return to Athenian control.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell72&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main reasons were because of the location of Amphipolis close to forests needed for shipbuilding, and because it controlled the gold and silver mines of [[Mount Pangaion]].&lt;ref name=Cawkwell72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oldfather, note to Diodorus XVI.3.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Amphipolis to the Athenians during this period cannot be overstated; "their longing for it was constant and extreme".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell72/&gt;
[[File:Amphipolis Strymon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|View of the [[Strymon River]] from the [[acropolis]] of [[Amphipolis]]]]

Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, promptly appealed to Athens, offering to return to its control.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell74&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the siege, Philip sent a letter to Athens saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to follow the same policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see whether he would.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell74/&gt; The Athenians may also have been unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell74/&gt; Philip was to make repeated use of the [[Etesian]] winds, campaigning during those months (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell74/&gt;

The Athenians seem to have offered Philip Pydna in exchange for Amphipolis,&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; perhaps during the later stages of the siege, but it is not clear whether Philip agreed to this.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell75&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, the [[Social War (357–355 BC)|Social War]] of 357–355 BC had broken out between Athens and their erstwhile allies, and they would now have been unable to intervene to help Amphipolis.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell75/&gt; Philip eventually succeeded in breaching the walls of Amphipolis, through the use of siege engines and battering rams; his forces then stormed and captured the city.&lt;ref name=DSXVI8&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=16.8 XVI.8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip expelled those who were hostile to him but, according to Diodorus, treated the rest of the population considerately.&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt;

===Pydna and Potidea (357–356 BC)===
During the siege of Amphipolis, the [[Chalkidian League]], led by [[Olynthus|Olynthos]], began to fear Philip's territorial ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to [[Chalkidiki]]), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell84&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of [[Potidea]], located in the territory of the Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;

Philip had no intention of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell75/&gt; The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to).&lt;ref name=Cawkwell75/&gt; Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=36–37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 356 BC, Philip then besieged and captured Potidea, thus marking the beginning of true hostilities with Athens.&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt;&lt;ref name=PTA3&gt;Plutarch. ''Alexander'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As promised, he handed Potidea over to the Olynthians, and let the Athenian garrison depart freely back to Athens, since he did not want to cause undue offence to the Athenians ("he was particularly solicitous toward the people of Athens on account of the importance and repute of their city").&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt; The Athenians were by this time fully engaged in fighting the Social War, and were unable to respond effectively to Philip's moves against Potidea and Pydna.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;

===Alliance against Philip (356–352 BC)===
[[File:Genealogical tree of the Odrysian royal house (English).png|right|thumb|300px|Genealogical tree of the [[Odrysian]] kings of [[Thrace]]]]

In 356 BC, in response to King Philip's machinations, the Athenians allied with the kings of Illyria, Paionia and Thrace, to try to block his advance.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; Thrace was by now ruled by three kings, descendants of Cotys; in the west was [[Cetriporis|Ketriporis]], the son of Berisades (Cotys's second son); in the centre, [[Amadocus II|Amadokos II]] (Cotys's third son), and in the east [[Cersobleptes|Kersebleptes]] (Cotys's first son). Whether Athens allied to all three Thracian kings is a matter of conjecture; certainly at least Ketriporis joined the alliance.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2002|p=272}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If [[Cersobleptes|Kersebleptes]] did ally with Athens, he appears to have relatively quickly cast off this allegiance, in favour of extending his realm at the expense of Amadokos and Ketriporis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, Philip marched on his enemies in this alliance before they had chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead.&lt;ref name=DSXVI22&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=16.8 XVI.22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers over the next few years, with the exception of Athens.

According to Plutarch, an army under [[Parmenion]] defeated the Illyrian king [[Grabos]] in 356 BC, shortly after the conclusion of the siege of Potidea.&lt;ref name=PTA3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Philip seems to have defeated [[Cetriporis|Ketriporis]], and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt; He is also presumed to have defeated the Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;

===Krinides (356 BC)===
In 356 BC, whilst Parmenion campaigned against the Illyrians, Philip campaigned in Thrace, and captured the town of [[Krinides]], which had been founded by Thasos in 360 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; He changed the name to [[Philippi]], after himself, and greatly increased the population. He also greatly improved the gold mines in the surrounding area, the effects of which are described by Diodorus: {{Quotation|Turning to the gold mines in its territory, which were very scanty and insignificant, he increased their output so much by his improvements that they could bring him a revenue of more than a thousand talents. And because from these mines he had soon amassed a fortune, with the abundance of money he raised the Macedonian kingdom higher and higher to a greatly superior position, for with the gold coins which he struck, which came to be known from his name as Philippeioi, he organized a large force of mercenaries, and by using these coins for bribes induced many Greeks to become betrayers of their native lands.|[[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt;}} The capture of Krinides was thus, in the long term, a very significant event in Philip's rise to power.&lt;ref name=DSXVI8/&gt;

===Maroneia and Abdera (c. 355 BC)===
[[Polyaenus]] recounts that Philip attacked and sacked the cities of [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] and [[Maroneia]] along the coast of Thrace. This occurred during a single campaign, but does not say when.&lt;ref&gt;Polyaenus, IV.2.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus does not mention this campaign, making its position within the overall chronology difficult to place.

Buckler suggests the following: According to the Athenian politician [[Demosthenes]], Kersebleptes met Philip at [[Maroneia]] (in Thrace), together with the Theban general [[Pammenes]], and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Demosthenes says that the Athenian general [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] filed the report about the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet off the coast of [[Neapolis (Chalcidice)|Neapolis]].&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; It is not entirely clear what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt;

Conversely, Cawkwell and Sealey suggest the Maroneia campaign was in 353 BC (though without explicit justification).&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt; The Maroneia campaign might therefore have been part of the campaign that Philip fought against Cetriporis (probably 355 BC), or a campaign against Amadokos (probably 353 BC).&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt;

===Siege of Methone (c. 354 BC)===
The chronology for activities in Greece during the years 355–352 BC is not entirely clear (see [[#Chronology of the Sacred War|below]]). Philip certainly started besieging Methone, the last Athenian possession in Macedon, during this period, but different historians choose different dates for this siege.&lt;ref name=Buckler176&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|pp=176–181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main theories, either 355–354 BC, as favoured by, for instance, Buckler,&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; or 354–353 BC, as favoured by Cawkwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=185–187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip began the siege, but was frustrated in his attempt to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler63&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow.&lt;ref name=DSXVI34/&gt; Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each.&lt;ref name=DSXVI34&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=16.34 XVI.34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=Buckler63/&gt;

===Summary to c. 354 BC===
By 354/353 BC, in just 5 years since his accession, Philip had unified Macedon and turned it into the dominant power in Northern Greece.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; He had completely reduced Athenian influence in the region, and was allied to the other major Greek power in the region, the Chalkidian League.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; He had, in the process, secured access to the Aegean sea, which had been an age-old problem in Macedon, since suitable sites had been monopolised by Greek colonists in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]].&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; Furthermore, he had overhauled and re-trained the army, which was now battle-hardened, and he now had a supply of ready money to pay for more troops.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;

This rapid rise in the power of Macedon was in part due to Philip's exceptional military and diplomatic skills.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; However, it was also in part due to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power.&lt;ref name=Buckley470*/&gt; Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had too many other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;

==Thessaly and the Sacred War (356–352 BC)==
{{Main article|Third Sacred War}}

===Background===
The [[Third Sacred War]] (often just called 'the' Sacred War) broke out in 356 BC, and would present Philip with his first real opportunity to expand his influence into the affairs of central and southern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=8}},&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley472&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The war was ostensibly caused by the refusal of the [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocian Confederation]] to pay a fine imposed on them in 357 BC by the [[Amphictyonic League]], a pan-Greek religious organisation which governed the most sacred site in Ancient Greece, the [[Delphi|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]].&lt;ref name=Buckler20&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|pp=20–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the religious element, there probably lay a display of ''[[realpolitik]]'' in bringing charges against the Phocians, instigated by the Thebans. At this time, Thebes controlled a majority of the votes in the council, and at the autumn meeting in 357 BC, the Thebans were able to have both the Phocians (for the cultivation of the sacred land) and the Spartans (for occupying Thebes some 25 years previously) denounced and fined.&lt;ref name=Cawk63&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the fines for both parties were "unjustifiably harsh",&lt;ref name=Buckler20/&gt; the Thebans probably expected neither party to pay, and thus to be able to declare a "sacred war" on either.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell64/&gt;

In response, the Phocians, under the leadership of [[Philomelos]], seized Delphi (which was situated within the boundaries of Phocis), and asserted the ancient claim of Phocis to the presidency of the Amphictyonic League,&lt;ref name=Cawkwell64&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; intending to annul the judgment against themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There seems to have been some sympathy in Greece for the Phocians, since other states could see that "the Thebans&amp;nbsp;... had used the Amphictyony to pursue petty and destructive vendettas".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Phocians were supported by Athens (perennial enemies of Thebes) and unsurprisingly Sparta, who hoped to see their own fine wiped out when the Phocians seized Delphi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|pp=26–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Philomelos plundered the treasury of Apollo to pay for mercenaries, thus raising a powerful army, but drastically altering the opinion of the other Greek states.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell65&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In winter 356/355 BC, a "sacred war" was declared against the Phocians by the Amphictyonic council, with the Thebans being the major protagonists.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell64/&gt; The war started relatively well for the Phocians, but a severe defeat was inflicted on the Phocians at Neon by the Thebans in either 355&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; or 354 BC,&lt;ref name=Buckley472/&gt; and Philomelos was killed. Undeterred, [[Onomarchus]] took over the Phocian effort, and raised new mercenaries to carry on the fight.&lt;ref name=Buckley472/&gt;

===Chronology of the Sacred War===
:''For further information on this topic, see [[Third Sacred War]] (section '[[Third Sacred War#Chronology|Chronology]]")''

The ancient sources for the sacred war are scant, and generally lacking in firm chronological information. Modern historians' dates for the war have therefore been hotly debated, with no clear consensus.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the only firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC for the beginning of the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; as has been discussed, Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his outward journey.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; However, Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused—he dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates—and his dates cannot therefore be relied upon.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt;

Disregarding the dates, most historians agree upon the same sequence of events for this part of the Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt; Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell185&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First campaign in Thessaly===
The Sacred War appears to have laid way for renewed conflict within Thessaly. The Thessalian Confederation were in general staunch supporters of the Amphictyonic League, and had an ancient hatred of the Phocians.&lt;ref name="Cawkwell66"/&gt; Conversely, Pherae had allied itself with the Phocians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In either 354 or 353 BC, the Aleuadae appealed to Philip to help them defeat Pherae.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler63/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell61/&gt; Philip responded positively, perhaps unsurprisingly: {{Quotation|...&amp;nbsp;the struggle between Pherae and its neighbours offered Philip rich possibilities. The chronic political instability of the area and the support of the Thessalian confederation guaranteed that he would face no united opposition to his ambitions. The Thessalians were giving Philip the same opportunity to become ascendant there that they had given [[Pelopidas]] and the Thebans in 369 BC.|John Buckler&lt;ref name=Buckler64&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philip thus brought an army into Thessaly, probably with the intention of attacking Pherae.&lt;ref name=Buckler64/&gt; Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onomarchus dispatched his brother, Phayllos with 7000 men;&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans.&lt;ref name=Buckler66&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Onomarchus then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; It is possible that Onomarchus hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over.&lt;ref name=Buckler67&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Onomarchus probably brought with him 20,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler67/&gt; The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchus seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process.&lt;ref name=DSXVI35&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23613;layout=;loc=16.34.1 XVI.35] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23613;layout=;loc=16.34.1 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey447*&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|pp=447–448}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchus' victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as they climbed a slope to attack the Phocians.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polyaenus, II.38.1.&lt;/ref&gt; After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter.&lt;ref name=Sealey447*/&gt; He is said to have commented that he "did not run away but, like a ram, I pulled back to butt again harder".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell60&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second campaign in Thessaly===
Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon.&lt;ref name=DSXVI35/&gt; Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him in the war against the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell62/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler73*&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|pp=73–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.&lt;ref name=DSXVI35/&gt;

====Pagasae====
At some point during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip captured the strategic port of [[Pagasae]],&lt;ref name=DSXVI31&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=16.31 XVI.31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was in effect the port of Pherae.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell61&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this was during the first or second campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field.&lt;ref name=Buckler176/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell61/&gt; By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell61/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler74&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle of Crocus Field====
{{Main article|Battle of Crocus Field}}
[[File:Isocrates pushkin.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Bust of [[Isocrates]]; plaster cast in the [[Pushkin Museum]] of the bust formerly at [[Villa Albani]], Rome]]
Meanwhile, Onomarchus returned to Thessaly to try and preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year.&lt;ref name=Buckler67/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI35/&gt; Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip.&lt;ref name=Buckler74/&gt; Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived.&lt;ref name=Buckler74/&gt; According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea (the 'crocus field'), probably in the vicinity of Pagasae.&lt;ref name=Buckler74/&gt; Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; "as if he was the avenger&amp;nbsp;... of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin, VIII.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Phocian mercenaries supposedly threw down their arms, panged by their guilty consciences.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66/&gt; In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6000 Phocian troops had been killed including Onormarchus, and another 3000 taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=Sealey447*/&gt; Onomarchus was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as was the ritual punishment demanded for temple-robbers.&lt;ref name=DSXVI35/&gt; These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians.&lt;ref name=Buckler75&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Buckler states that: "Nor should one automatically assume that a mass-drowning&amp;nbsp;... would shock the Greek world. Even the mild-tempered [[Isocrates]] felt that the Phocian mercenaries were better off dead than alive&amp;nbsp;... Dreadful indeed was the punishment, but it was entirely consistent with Philip's role as Apollo's champion".&lt;ref name=Buckler75/&gt;

====Re-organisation of Thessaly====
It was probably in the aftermath of his victory (if not before) that the [[Thessalians]] appointed Philip ''[[archon]]'' of Thessaly.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell62/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler78&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thessalian army.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell62&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip was now able to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He probably first finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly.&lt;ref name=Buckler78/&gt; Pagasae was not part of the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it.&lt;ref name=Buckler79&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis.&lt;ref name=Buckler79/&gt; Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he tightened his control of Perrhaebia, and invaded [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]], also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; "when finished, he was lord of Thessaly."&lt;ref name=Buckler80&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermopylae====
Once satisfied with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of [[Thermopylae]], the gateway to central Greece.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey447*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler80/&gt; He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself,&lt;ref name=Buckler80/&gt; a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he had passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens.&lt;ref name=Sealey447*/&gt; The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] celebrated the defence of the pass in one of his speeches.&lt;ref name=Buckler81/&gt; Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted.&lt;ref name=Buckler81/&gt; Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.&lt;ref name=Sealey447*/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler81&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary to 352 BC===
{{double image|right|Filip II Macedonia.jpg|185|Philip-ii-of-macedon.jpg|200|'''Left''': a bust of [[Philip II of Macedon]] (r. 359–336 BC) from the [[Hellenistic period]], located at [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] &lt;br&gt;'''Right''': another bust of Philip II, a 1st-century AD [[Hellenistic art#Later Roman copies|Roman copy]] of a [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic Greek]] original, now in the [[Vatican Museums]]}}
Cawkwell describes 352 BC as Philip's ''[[annus mirabilis]]''.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell67&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment to high command in Thessaly was a dramatic increase in his power,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively giving him a whole new army.&lt;ref name=Buckler64/&gt; His actions as the "avenger" and "saviour" of Apollo were calculated to win him goodwill amongst the Greeks in general.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2008|pp=61–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Philip's increased power and influence, Worthington suggests that by the time of Demosthenes' "[[First Philippic]]" (351 BC), Philip was already unstoppable in his aim to control Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2008|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strategic situation====
The stalemate at Thermopylae pointed the future direction of the ongoing conflict between Philip and the Athenians. Athens was a significant naval power, whilst Macedon had no real navy to speak of.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell76/&gt; Conversely, Macedon had a very powerful army, especially with the addition of the Thessalians after 352 BC, which Athens could not hope to match.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians could therefore prevent Philip attacking Athens by sea, but not by land—unless they could occupy Thermopylae in time.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pass was narrow enough to make troop numbers irrelevant, and could only be bypassed with some difficulty, meaning the Athenians could hope to resist Philip there; Thermopylae therefore became the key position in the conflict.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66*/&gt; The Athenians also began to realise that they could not hope to reclaim Amphipolis, or defeat Philip, and must instead act on the defensive; as Demosthenes said: "the war at the outset was concerned with taking revenge on Philip, now at its conclusion with not suffering at Philip's hands".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=76–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From Philip's point of view, once he controlled Amphipolis, he could operate in the North Aegean unimpeded, especially if he campaigned during the Etesian winds, or in winter, when the Athenian navy could do little to stop him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=73–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not easily advance into Greece, to attack Athens for instance, if Thermopylae was held against him.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell66*/&gt;

==Thrace (353–352 BC)==
Most historians agree that Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, but what exactly he achieved is a matter of some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey449&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=449}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally.&lt;ref name=Hornblower272/&gt; Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.

In the early part of 352 BC several key events had occurred in, or around Thrace which challenged Philip's influence in the region.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell76&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington68/&gt; The Athenian general [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] captured [[Sestos]], on the [[Thracian Chersonese]] early in the year, probably taking the city from [[Cersobleptes|Kersebleptes]].&lt;ref name=Cawkwell76/&gt; The Athenians had a long-standing interest in the Chersonese for strategic reasons, and it had formed a significant part of their 'Empire' in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell71*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=71–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, Athens depended largely on the import of grain from the [[Crimea]] for her food supply; controlling the Chersonese helped to ensure that supplies could safely pass through the [[Hellespont]].&lt;ref name=Cawkwell71*/&gt; Secondly, the Chersonese was used as a place to settle the excess citizenry of Athens, usually in the form of [[Cleruchy|cleruchies]], colonies which were not politically independent of the mother city.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell71*/&gt; After the capture of Sestos, Kersebleptes, who up until now had resisted Athenian attempts to reclaim the Chersonese, now came to terms with Athens. He was probably now worried about Philip's influence in the region, and thus sought to ally with the Athenians, giving them control of all the cities of the Chersonese except [[Kardia (Thrace)|Cardia]].&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell76/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Chalkidian League]] also seems to have turned against Philip in 352 BC, presumably also concerned by his designs on their territory, and sought peace with Athens.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell76/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington68/&gt;

Philip probably also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly after returning to Macedon from Thessaly.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington68&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2008|p=68}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt; During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near [[Marmara Ereğlisi|Perinthos]], on the coast of the [[Propontis]] (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC).&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckler186&gt;{{harvnb|Buckler|1989|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed.&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt; It seems clear that Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey449/&gt; It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to [[Pella]], effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;

== Olynthian War (349–348 BC)==
As discussed, the Chalkidian League had made peace with Athens in 352 BC, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip, due to their growing fear of Macedonian power.&lt;ref name="Cawkwell84"/&gt; Cawkwell contends that from that moment on, Olynthos and the League were doomed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell84/&gt; However, the next few years of Philip's reign appear to have been militarily quiet; Diodorus does not mention any activity by Philip until 349 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell82&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip did not yet make any further efforts to intervene in the Sacred War, which was to rumble on until 346 BC. In the meantime, there may have been some unrest in Macedonia; Philip executed one of his stepbrothers (sons of Amyntas III's second wife), and two more fled to Olynthos.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell84/&gt;&lt;ref name="JVIII3"&gt;Justin, VIII.3.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Justin, this provided Philip with the pretext of attacking Olynthos and the Chalkidian League.&lt;ref name="JVIII3"/&gt;
[[File:Ancient Olynthos Chalkidiki - Greece - 048.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of ancient [[Olynthos]]]]

Philip finally began his campaign against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell82/&gt; Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly [[Stageira]]; otherwise unknown).&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23630;layout=;loc=16.53.1 XVI.52] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip seems to have methodically worked his way around the 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including [[Toroni]] and [[Mecyberna]]—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen the fate of the cities which resisted Philip.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell85&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell85/&gt;

Finally, in probably June 348 BC, with all the other cities captured or in submission, Philip moved to attack Olynthos.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell85/&gt; According to Diodorus, there were two pitched battles against the Olynthians; after being defeated twice, the Olynthians were then confined  to the city.&lt;ref name=DSXVI53&gt;Diodorus, [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084;query=chapter%3D%23631;layout=;loc=16.52.1 XVI.53] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111233714/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 |date=11 November 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the commanders of Olynthos, Euthycrates and Lasthenes, defected to Philip with 500 cavalry shortly before the siege.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell85/&gt; Diodorus therefore claims that the city fell by treachery; certainly treachery was committed, but it is not clear that this is how the city was captured.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell85/&gt; Either way, by September the siege was over, and the Chalkidian league had been annihilated. Philip razed the city, and sold the remaining inhabitants into slavery; the same fate awaited the other Chalkidian cities that had not submitted to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|pp=474–475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip then incorporated Chalkidike into the Macedonian state, distributing the land amongst his followers.&lt;ref name=Buckley475/&gt;

===Athens and the Olynthian War===
When Philip began his attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave a series of speeches, now known as the ''[[Olynthiacs]]'', encouraging the Athenians to resist Philip.&lt;ref name=Worthington75*&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2008|pp=75–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual ascendancy of Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make him seem more important than he was.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=90}}; {{harvnb|Worthington|2008|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as [[peltast]]s, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under [[Chares of Athens|Chares]], possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, it is not clear whether this force achieved anything.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86/&gt;

Later, in early 348 BC, the Olynthians appealed for help again.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86/&gt; The Athenians sent [[Charidemus|Charidemos]], a former general of Kersebleptes who had been adopted as an Athenian citizen, with 4000 peltasts, 150 cavalry and 18 triremes; of the triremes, 10 were probably already in his service, and the other 8 may have been those sent to Chares in 349 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86/&gt; Charidemus joined up with the Olynthians, and together they attacked the former territory of Olynthos in western Chalkidike.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86/&gt; Finally, just before the final siege of Olynthos started, the Olynthians appealed a last time for aid. The Athenians prepared to send a force of citizen hoplites, but they were delayed by the weather, probably due to the Etesian winds, and arrive too late to achieve anything.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell86/&gt;

===Euboea===
Athens was prevented from sending more effective aid by events on [[Euboea]] in 348 BC.&lt;ref name=Buckley475/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88/&gt; A pre-eminent politician from [[Chalcis]], [[Callias of Chalcis|Callias]], sought to unite the cities of Euboea in a new confederation, inevitably meaning the end of the hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88/&gt; Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians.&lt;ref name=Buckley475/&gt; In 410 BC, the strait between Euboea and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If Euboea, and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into Euboea from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold Euboea.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88/&gt;

In early 348 BC, the Athenians were distracted by events on Euboea, and were in no position to send much help to Olynthos.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88/&gt; However, the expedition the Athenians sent to Euboea to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell88/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=453}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on Euboea, though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician [[Aeschines]].&lt;ref name=Buckley475&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=475}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower274&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2002|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Sacred War (347–346 BC)==
The Athenian politician [[Philocrates]] had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell91&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, and by the time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell91/&gt; The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell91/&gt; In 347 BC, Philip sent [[privateers]] to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell92/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley476&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=476}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; The Phocian general [[Phalaikos]] was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again.&lt;ref name=Buckley476/&gt; The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.&lt;ref name=Buckley476/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cawkwell95"/&gt;

[[File:Archidamos III MAN Napoli Inv6156.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Archidamus III]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]] in [[Herculaneum]], now in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]]]
In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around the 14th of February.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; The Spartans dispatched [[Archidamus III|Archidamos III]] with 1000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell96&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace with Athens===
{{Main article|Peace of Philocrates}}

When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell96/&gt; By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell96/&gt; The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell98*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=98–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they had little choice but to accept Philip's terms.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell98*/&gt; On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell98*/&gt; Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell98*/&gt;

===End of Thracian independence===
Following the first Athenian embassy to Macedon, Philip went on campaign against Kersebleptes. Details of the campaign are scarce, but it seems that Philip easily captured the Thracian treasury on the "Sacred Mountain".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt; Then, rather than deposing Kersebleptes, he made him a subject ally, in the same manner as his brother Amadokos.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell44/&gt;

===Settlement of the Sacred War===
{{main article|Third Sacred War#Settlement of the Sacred War}}

After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principal combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell102&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When Philip returned from Thrace he received all these embassies.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell102/&gt; The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell102/&gt; Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; "[he] sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell103&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against [[Alos, Greece|Halos]], a small Thessalian city which held out against him.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell103/&gt; He departed for Halos before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell103/&gt;

It was now that Philip applied the ''coup de grace''. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell103/&gt; All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy,&lt;ref name=Buckley478&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=478}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell104&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip could be certain of dictating the terms of the end of the Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for him being allowed to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished.&lt;ref name=Buckley478/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell106&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell110/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley479&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=479}}.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell110&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In return for ending the war, Macedon was made a member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been stripped from Phocis.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell107&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes.&lt;ref name=Hornblower275&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2002|p=275}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip had no choice but to impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war.&lt;ref name=Buckley478/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornblower277/&gt; Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year;&lt;ref name=Buckley479/&gt; the Phocians were not, however, destroyed, and they retained their land.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell107/&gt; The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly.{{cref|b}}&lt;ref name=Cawkwell108&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning the closest town to Thermopylae, [[Nicaea (Locris)|Nicaea]] with Thessalian troops.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell108/&gt;

===Summary to 346 BC===
346 BC was another remarkable year for Philip. The city-states of Greece had exhausted themselves in the previous years, and Philip was therefore the only power capable of finally ending the Sacred War.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell95/&gt; Ultimately, once in control of Thermopylae, this military strength allowed him to settle the war by mere threat of force.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell104/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey459&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=459}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip undoubtedly intended to settle the war even before the Thessalians and Thebans requested that he do so, and the terms on which the war was concluded were presumably much as he would have desired; coming to a separate peace with Athens was a bonus.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell109&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was, through his membership of the Amphictyonic council, now legitimized as a "true" Greek; and by the prestige he had gained for his pious conduct on behalf of Apollo, and by his military strength, he was now the ''de facto'' leader of the Greek city-states.&lt;ref name=Hornblower275/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell108/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sealey460&gt;{{harvnb|Sealey|1976|p=460}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Hornblower]] suggests that Philip was the only real victor in the Sacred War.&lt;ref name=Hornblower275/&gt; Furthermore, Philip's domination of northern Greece and the north Aegean was now almost complete, after his success in the Olynthian War and his subjugation of Kersebleptes. Diodorus sums up Philip's achievements in 346 BC: {{Quotation|Philip returned to Macedon, not only having gained a reputation for piety and superb generalship, but also having made considerable preparations for the increase of power that was destined to be his. For he wished to be appointed the commander-in-chief of Greece and to wage war against the Persians.|[[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus, XVI.60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has been much debate amongst historians about Philip's motives and aims in 346 BC, with particular regard to Athens. Although Philip had made peace and alliance with Athens prior to his settlement of the Sacred War, they failed to send him troops he requested under the terms of the alliance.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell111*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=111–113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these troops were not ultimately needed by Philip, the Athenian failure to honour the terms gave Philip reasonable grounds for war.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell111*/&gt; However, even when in possession of Thermopylae, he made no hostile moves towards Athens, and still prevented any punishment being meted on Athens by the Amphictyonic council.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell111*/&gt; Why was Philip so lenient towards Athens? Cawkwell suggests that Philip was already beginning to contemplate a campaign against Persia in 346 BC (as tentatively suggested by Diodorus), for which purposes he desired the use of the powerful Athenian navy; hence his request for alliance, and his on-going patience with Athens.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell111*/&gt; This may also provide another explanation for Philip's use of the Amphictyonic council to formally settle the Sacred War; if he was to campaign in Asia, he needed Greece to be peaceful, and a peace imposed through a pan-Greek organisation (backed with the threat of Macedonian intervention), was more likely to succeed than one directly imposed by Macedon.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell111*/&gt;

==Reorganisation and retrenchment (345–342 BC)==
[[File:Philip II of Macedon CdM.jpg|thumb|''Niketerion'' (victory medallion) bearing the effigy of king [[Philip II of Macedon]], 3rd century AD, probably minted during the reign of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Severus Alexander]].]]
The next year, Philip returned to the ongoing business of restructuring Macedon. Justin reports that after returning to Macedon, he began transplanting parts of the population to new locations, in particular strengthening the cities of Macedon.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell114&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was probably to increase the security of the population, and promote trade; [[Alexander the Great]] would later recall that his father had brought "the Macedonians down from the hills to the plains".&lt;ref name=Cawkwell114/&gt;

===Illyria (345 BC)===
Philip then went on campaign against the Illyrians, particularly [[Pleuratus]], whose kingdom probably lay along the [[Drin (river)|Drin river]] in modern Albania.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell114/&gt; During the campaign, Philip suffered a smashed shin-bone, and was only saved from death by the bravery of his [[Companion cavalry]] (150 of whom were wounded in the process). Philip did not campaign in 344 or 343 BC, which may have been due to the effects of this severe injury.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell115&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Philip contented himself with reorganising Thessaly in 344 BC, reinstating the ancient fourfold "Tetrarchic" administration system.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell115/&gt;

===Molossia and Cassopaea (342 BC)===
The [[Molossians|Molossian]] kingdom of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] had been an important subject ally of Macedon since 350 BC, when Philip had taken the son of king [[Arybbas of Epirus|Arybbas]], [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander]] hostage. During this time at court, Alexander (brother of Philip's wife [[Olympias]]), had grown into an admirer of Philip, and Philip therefore decided to replace Arybbas with Alexander. The exact date this occurred is unclear; Cawkwell suggests this happened in early 342 BC, when Alexander would have been 20, as a prelude to his Thracian campaign. Arybbas went into exile in Athens, where he was promised help to regain his kingdom; however, Alexander would remain on the throne (and loyal to Philip) until his death in 334 BC.&lt;ref name = Cawkwell116&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=116}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip certainly campaigned against the Epirote [[Cassope|Cassopaeans]] in early 342 BC, taking control of three cities to secure the southern regions of his kingdom.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell116/&gt;

==Thrace (342–340 BC)==
In approximately June 342 BC, Philip set off on what must have been a long-planned expedition into Thrace.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was to last for two years, but other than that his forces were large, and that he fought several battles, the ancient sources contain very few details.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt; Undoubtedly Philip's primary aim was to depose Kersebleptes, who according to Diodorus had been causing problems for the Greeks on the Chersonese, once and for all.&lt;ref name=Hornblower277&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|2002|p=277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley482&gt;{{harvnb|Buckley|1996|p=482}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip ended the campaign by marrying [[Meda of Odessos]], daughter of a king of the [[Getae]], which has been taken to suggest that Philip campaigned not just in Thrace, but in the valley of the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]], and north of the [[Balkan Mountains|Great Balkan range]] of mountains, near the Danube.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley482/&gt;

During the campaign, Philip founded several cities, most notably [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] on the site of the old Thracian fort of Eumolpia (modern [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]).&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt; A [[tithe]] was levied on the Thracians, and the new post of "general in charge of Thrace" may have been established at this time, effectively governor of a new Macedonian province of Thrace.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt;&lt;ref name=Buckley482/&gt; To the north of this pacified region, the Thracians were left mostly independent, under their own kings, who were subject to Philip.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt; Cawkwell rates this extended campaign as one of Philip's major achievements, given the terrain and severe winter conditions.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt;

==Perinthos and Byzantion (340–339 BC)==
At the end of his Thracian campaign, Philip moved against the city of [[Marmara Ereğli|Perinthos]], formerly his ally.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell116/&gt; Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, there is no indication that this was the case.&lt;ref name="Cawkwell117"/&gt; One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt; Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell118&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakdown of the Peace===
{{main article|Peace of Philocrates#Breakdown of the Peace}}

[[File:Demosthenes orator Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of the Athenian politician [[Demosthenes]]]]

Although Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates, almost as soon as it was made, he wished to be rid of it.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell118/&gt; Over the next few years, Demosthenes became leader of the "war-party" in Athens, and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace: "His method was simple and effective. He kept hammering away at untruths until enough Athenians came to believe them."&lt;ref name=Cawkwell118/&gt; Demosthenes believed that all Philip's successes were due to his bribery and corruption of the Greeks, a view which, although there is little evidence for it, became commonplace until re-examined by modern historians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell122&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=122}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, there was also a substantial body of feeling in Athens, led by Aeschines, that the peace should be maintained and developed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell120&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 343 BC onwards, in order to try and disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell119&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell133&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of [[Diopeithes]], who proceeded to ravage the territory of [[Cardia (Thrace)|Cardia]], an ally of Philip.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell131&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech '[[On the Chersonese]]', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, there was no need to do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell131/&gt; Then, in the [[Third Philippic]] of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell132&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the [[Fourth Philippic]] delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell134*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=134–135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perinthos===
Against this fraught background, Philip started the siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell117/&gt; Perinthos occupied a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip did not have a large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 [[cubit]]s high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of the wall was breached.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt; However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his [[satraps]] on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the [[Byzantium|Byzantians]] sent a body of soldiers and their best generals.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt;

===Byzantion===
The Byzantians' actions meant that they too were now at war with Philip. He continued the siege of Perinthos, but now (September) sent half his army to besiege Byzantion. Byzantion was a more important city for Philip, because of its control of the Bosphorus; {{Quotation|[Perinthos] did not really matter to Athens. [Byzantion] did. The corn-ships on their way to Athens down the Bosphorus could still be conveyed past the city, but even so, there was the danger of serious interruption. Given a moderate fleet, whoever controlled [Byzantion] could cause the greatest alarm in Athens.|[[George Cawkwell]]&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt;}}

Demosthenes was determined to prevent the capture of the city, and went on an embassy to Byzantion, which agreed to form an alliance with Athens.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt; The Athenians general Chares was already in the vicinity with 40 ships, and was sent to support Byzantion; furthermore, Byzantion's other allies, [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]] and [[Kos]] also sent aid to the city.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt; Since he still did not control the seas, Philip already faced a difficult task to besiege Byzantion, made all the more difficult by the outside support.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt; Again, Philip's engineers set to work, and created a breach; a night assault was then made, but was repulsed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell136/&gt; Frustrated in the two sieges, Philip now lost patience with the Athenians, and wrote to them, declaring war.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell137&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Athens, Demosthenes proposed that the Athenians should respond by declaring war on Philip; the motion was passed, and the stone tablet recording the peace of Philocrates destroyed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell137/&gt; The Athenians prepared another fleet under the command of [[Phocion]], and dispatched it to Byzantion.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell137/&gt;

The first act in this new war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting on the far side of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell138&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the grain for his own supplies and the ships' timbers to build siege engines.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell138/&gt; However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell139*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=139–140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city was full of defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell139*/&gt; The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell139*/&gt; Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell139*/&gt;

==Philip's final campaigns (339–338 BC)==

===Scythia===
As a prelude to his planned campaign in Greece, Philip went on campaign in the winter of 339 BC, against the [[Scythians]] living south of the [[Danube]], near the river's mouth (in [[Dobruja]]).&lt;ref name=Cawkwell140&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of [[Heracles]] to commemorate his victory.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell140/&gt; He then marched through the territory of the [[Triballi]] in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell140/&gt; During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell140/&gt; Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell140/&gt;

===Fourth Sacred War===
Philip's campaign in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of [[Amfissa|Amphissa]] in [[Ozolian Locris]] had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided to declare a sacred war against Amphissa.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell141&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to campaign in Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell141/&gt;

[[File:Philip II of Macedon's 339 BC Campaign.png|200px|thumb|left|Map showing Philip's movements during 339–338 BC.]]

At the start of the 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell141/&gt; Philip does not appear to have treated this as a declaration of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell141/&gt; However, a second route into central Greece was available. In 480 BC, during the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Persian king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] had sent his army via a mountain track (the ''Anopea'') to outflank the pass. From this track, on the western side of Mount Kallidromon, another road led off and descended in Phocis. In 480 BC, a thousand Phocian troops were stationed above Thermopylae to guard the road and prevent a Persian assault on Phocis (though they notably failed to prevent the Persians using ''Anopea'').&lt;ref name=Cawkwell141/&gt; However, in 339 BC, the Greeks had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell142&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=142}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching [[Elatea]], he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole [[Phocian confederation]] was restored to its former state.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell142/&gt; This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell142/&gt; Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell142/&gt; During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, turning it over to Delphi.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell144&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try and avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell142/&gt;
The Amphictyonic council decided  to hold a special session two or three months later. The Athenians and the Thebans did  not send envoys to this council.

===Alliance between Athens and Thebes===
When news first arrived that Philip was in Elatea, just three days march away, there was panic in Athens.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell143&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=143}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In what Cawkwell describes as his proudest moment, Demosthenes alone counselled against despair, and proposed that the Athenians should seek an alliance with the Thebans; his decree was passed, and he was sent as ambassador.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell143/&gt; Philip had also sent an embassy to Thebes, requesting that the Thebans join him, or at least allow him to pass through Boeotia unhindered.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell144/&gt; Since the Thebans were still not formally at war with Philip, they could have avoided the conflict altogether.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell143/&gt; However, in spite of Philip's proximity, and their traditional enmity with Athens, they chose to ally with the Athenians, in the cause of liberty for Greece.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell144/&gt; The Athenian army had already pre-emptively been sent in the direction of Boeotia, and was therefore able to join the Thebans within days of the alliance being agreed.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell143/&gt;

The details of the campaign leading up to the decisive [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] are almost completely unknown.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell145&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helikon, as the Spartans had done in the run-up to the Battle of Leuctra, or by any of the other mountain passes.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell145/&gt; There were certainly some preliminary skirmishes; Demonsthenes alludes to a "winter battle" and "battle on the river" in his speeches, but no other details are preserved.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell145/&gt; Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the allied Greek army defending the road at Chaeronea.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell145/&gt;

===Chaeronea===
{{Main article|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}
[[File:Chaironeia lion.JPG|thumb|The [[Lion of Chaeronea]], erected by the [[Thebans]] to honor the dead from the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], described by the ancient geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and discovered by the British architect [[George Ledwell Taylor]] in the early 19th century.]]
The allied Greek army had taken up a position near Chaeronea, astride the main road.&lt;ref name = Cawkwell146*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=146–147}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to [[Livadeia|Lebedea]], while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell146*/&gt; The allied Greek army included contingents from [[Achaea (ancient region)|Achaea]], [[Corinth]], [[Chalcis]], [[Epidaurus]], [[Megara]] and [[Troezen]], with the majority of troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self-governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] and [[Lysicles (4th century BC)|Lysicles]], and the Thebans by [[Theagenes (general)|Theagenes]]. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern view is that the allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell145/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVI85&gt;Diodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D16%3Achapter%3D83 XVI.85] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604203353/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D16%3Achapter%3D83 |date= 4 June 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip took command of the right wing of the Macedonian wing and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future [[Alexander the Great]]) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.&lt;ref name=DSXVI85/&gt;

Details of the battle itself are scarce, with Diodorus providing the only formal account. He says that "once joined, the battle was hotly contested for a long time and many fell on both sides, so that for a while the struggle permitted hopes of victory to both."&lt;ref name=DSXVI86&gt;Diodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+16.86&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084 XVI.86].&lt;/ref&gt; He then recounts that the young Alexander, "his heart set on showing his father his prowess" succeeding in rupturing the allied Greek line aided by his companions, and eventually put the allied Greek right wing to flight; meanwhile, Philip advanced in person against the allied Greek left and also put it to flight.&lt;ref name=DSXVI86/&gt; This brief account can be filled out, if [[Polyaenus]]'s anecdotes related to the battle (found in his work ''Strategems'') are to be believed. Polyaenus's accounts have led some modern historians to tentatively propose the following synthesis of the battle. After the general engagement had been in progress for some time, Philip had his army perform a wheeling manoeuver, with the right wing withdrawing, and the whole line pivoting around its centre.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell148&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, wheeling forward, the Macedonian left wing attacked the Thebans on the allied Greek right and punched a hole in the allied Greek line.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell148/&gt; On the allied Greek left, the Athenians followed Philip, their line becoming stretched and became disordered;&lt;ref name=Cawkwell148/&gt; the Macedonians then turned, attacked and routed the tired and inexperienced Athenians. The allied Greek right wing, under the assault of the Macedonian troops under Alexander's command, then also routed, ending the battle.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell148/&gt; Diodorus says that more than 1000 Athenians died in the battle, with another 2000 taken prisoner, and that the Thebans fared similarly.&lt;ref name=DSXVI86/&gt; Cawkwell suggests that this was one of the most decisive battles in ancient history; since there was now no army which could prevent Philip's advance, the war effectively ended.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell148/&gt;

==Settlement of Greece and League of Corinth (337–336 BC)==
In the aftermath of Chaeronea, records show desperate attempts in Athens and Corinth to re-build the city walls, as they prepared for Philip to lay siege to them.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell166&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Philip had no intention of  besieging any city, nor indeed of conquering Greece. Himself also being Greek, he wanted the rest of the Greeks as his allies for his planned campaign against the Persians, and he wanted to leave a stable Greece in his rear when he went on campaign; further fighting was therefore contrary to his aims.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell166/&gt; Philip marched first to Thebes, which surrendered to him; he expelled the Theban leaders who had opposed him, recalled those pro-Macedonian Thebans who had previously been exiled, and installed a Macedonian garrison.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167*&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|pp=167–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also ordered that the Boeotian cities of [[Plataea]] and [[Thespiae]], which Thebes had destroyed in previous conflicts, be re-founded. Generally, Philip treated the Thebans severely, making them pay for the return of their prisoners, and even to bury their dead; he did not, however, dissolve the Boeotian confederacy.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167*/&gt;

By contrast, Philip treated Athens very leniently indeed; although the [[Second Athenian League]] was dissolved, the Athenians were allowed to keep their colony on [[Samos]], and their prisoners were freed without ransom.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip's motives are not entirely clear, but one likely explanation is that he hoped to use the Athenian navy in his campaign against Persia, since Macedon did not possess a substantial fleet; he therefore needed to remain on good terms with the Athenians.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167/&gt; Philip also made peace with the other combatants, Corinth and Chalcis, which controlled important strategic locations; both received Macedonian garrisons.&lt;ref name = Cawkwell168&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=168}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He then turned to deal with Sparta, which had not taken part in the conflict, but was likely to take advantage of the weakened state of the other Greek cities to try to attack its neighbours in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell169&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans refused Philip's invitation to engage in discussions, so Philip ravaged [[Laconia (ancient region)|Lacedaemonia]], but did not attack Sparta itself.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell169/&gt;

===League of Corinth===
{{Main article|League of Corinth}}

Philip seems to have moved around Greece in the months after the battle, making peace with the states that opposed him, dealing with the Spartans, and installing garrisons; his movements also probably served as a demonstration of force to the other cities, that they should not try to oppose him.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167/&gt; In mid-337 BC, he seems to have camped near Corinth, and began the work to establish a league of the Greek city-states, which would guarantee peace in Greece, and provide Philip with military assistance against Persia.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell167/&gt; The result, the [[League of Corinth]], was formed in the latter half of 337 BC at a congress organised by Philip. All states signed up to the league, with the exception of Sparta.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell170&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The principal terms of the concord were that all members became allied to each other, and to Macedon, and that all members were guaranteed freedom from attack, freedom of navigation, and freedom from interference in internal affairs.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell171&gt;{{harvnb|Cawkwell|1978|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip, and the Macedonian garrisons installed in Greece, would act as the 'keepers of the peace'.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell171/&gt; At Philip's behest, the [[synod]] of the League then declared war on Persia, and voted Philip as ''Strategos'' for the forthcoming campaign.&lt;ref name=Cawkwell170/&gt;

==War with Persia and death of Philip (336 BC)==
[[File:Image larnax of philip.jpg|thumb|The golden [[larnax]] that was buried with [[Philip II of Macedon]] in his tomb at [[Vergina]] (Aigai), featuring the [[Vergina Sun]] design, the royal symbol of the [[Argead dynasty]].]]
In 336 BC, whilst the invasion of Persia was in its very early stage, Philip was assassinated in [[Vergina|Aegae]] by the captain of his [[Somatophylax|bodyguard]], [[Pausanias of Orestis|Pausanias]], whilst attending the wedding of his daughter by [[Olympias]], [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]], to Olympias's brother (and Cleopatra's uncle) [[Alexander I of Epirus]].{{cref|c}} Philip's son [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander III]] by Olympias was proclaimed king by the [[Ancient Macedonian military|Macedonian army]] and by the Macedonian noblemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2013|pp=61–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox72&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1980|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main article|Alexander the Great|Wars of Alexander the Great}}

===Accession of Alexander===
[[File:AlexanderTheGreat Bust Transparent.png|thumb|Bust of a young [[Alexander the Great]] from the [[Hellenistic period]], [[British Museum]]]]
Alexander began his reign by having his potential rivals to the throne murdered.  He had his cousin, the former [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], executed, as well as having two Macedonian princes from the region of [[Lyncestis]] killed, while a third, [[Alexander Lyncestes]], was spared. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and her daughter by Philip, Europa, burned alive. When Alexander found out about this, he was furious with his mother. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor. Attalus was at the time in correspondence with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Regardless of whether Attalus actually intended to defect, he had already severely insulted Alexander, and having just had Attalus's daughter and grandchildren murdered, Alexander probably felt Attalus was too dangerous to leave alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2008|pp=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexander spared the life of his half-brother Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts somewhat mentally  disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.&lt;ref name=Fox72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|pp=30–31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PA77&gt;Plutarch. ''Alexander'', 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2013|pp=70–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolts in Greece reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though his advisors advised him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's neighbor to the south. When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Mount Ossa]], he had the men ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear, and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force, as he rode down towards the Peloponnesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Renault|2013|p=72}}; {{harvnb|Fox|1980|p=104}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the [[Amphictyonic League]] before heading south to Corinth.  Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising.  At Corinth, he was given the title ''Hegemon'', and like Philip, appointed commander of the forthcoming war against Persia.

===Balkan campaign===
{{Campaignbox Alexander's Balkan campaign}}
{{Main article|Alexander's Balkan campaign}}

Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders; in the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several apparent revolts.  Starting from Amphipolis, he first went east into the country of the "Independent Thracians", and at [[Haemus Mons|Mount Haemus]], the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a Thracian army manning the heights.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, I.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonians marched on into the country of the [[Triballi]], and proceeded to defeat the Triballian army near the Lyginus river (a [[List of tributaries of the Danube|tributary of the Danube]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, I.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander then advanced for three days on to the [[Danube]], encountering the [[Getae]] tribe on the opposite shore. Surprising the Getae by crossing the river at night, he forced the Getae army to retreat after the first cavalry [[skirmish]], leaving their town to the Macedonian army.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, I.3–4; {{harvnb|Renault|2013|pp=73–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; News then reached Alexander that [[Cleitus the Illyrian|Cleitus]], king of Illyria, and [[King Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii]] were in open revolt against Macedonian authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their armies, leaving Alexander's northern frontier secure.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, I.5–6; {{harvnb|Renault|2013|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was triumphantly campaigning in the north, a rumour of his death caused the Thebans and Athenians to rebel against Macedonian hegemony once more. Alexander reacted immediately but, while the other cities hesitated when he advanced into Greece, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor. However, the resistance was useless, and the city was captured and then razed to the ground, and its territory was divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Phocion'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; With Macedon's vassals and allies once again peaceable, Alexander was finally free to take control of the stalled war with Persia, and in early 334 BC he crossed with an army of 42,000 men into Asia Minor.

===Alexander's campaigns in Asia===
Alexander's 10-year campaign in Asia, and the Macedonian conquest of the Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at [[Battle of the Granicus|the Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|the Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]], before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule over most of the territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, [[Death of Alexander the Great|he died in Babylon]] in 323 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-the-great-9180468#early-life |title=Alexander the Great |publisher=A&amp;E Television Networks |access-date=February 26, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233200/http://www.biography.com/people/alexander-the-great-9180468 |archivedate=27 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">'''Ferdinand Brock Tupper''' (1795 – 1874), was one of the leading historians of the [[Channel Islands]].

He was born in [[Guernsey]] in 1795 to parents John Elisha Tupper (shipowner and merchant from Les Cotils and Carrefour in [[Guernsey]]) and Elizabeth Brock (1767-1847), sister of Sir [[Isaac Brock]]. 

In 1845 he published ''The Life and Correspondence of Sir Isaac Brock, KB'', which contains a wealth of information on General Brock and the [[War of 1812]].  After a near-mutiny at [[Fort George, Ontario]], it was Tupper who reported by letter on the courts-martial (and subsequent executions of several) of the accused to Brock, and evidently corresponded with the General until the latter's death at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]].

He went on to publish ''Chronicles of [[Castle Cornet]] with details of its nine years siege during the civil wars, and frequent notices of the [[Channel Islands]]'' in 1851 and ''History of [[Guernsey]] and its Bailiwick; with occasional notices of [[Jersey]]'' in 1854. The latter remained the definitive reference work on the history of Guernsey until the publication of ''History of the Bailiwick of Guernsey'' by [[James Marr (author)|James Marr]] in 1982. 

He married Mary Ann Herbert, and they had two daughters, Henrietta and Emily.

He died in 1874 leaving his elder daughter, Henrietta, as his literary [[executrix]].

According to [[Henry Nicholas Paint]], [[Point Tupper, Nova Scotia]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="Mander"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mander |first=Nicholas |year=2005 |title=Varnished Leaves: a biography of the Mander family of Wolverhampton |location=Owlpen |publisher=Owlpen Press |isbn= 0-9546056-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="131326">{{Nihongo|'''Groups of Traditional Buildings'''|伝統的建造物群|Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun}} is a Japanese category of historic preservation introduced by a 1975 amendment of the law which mandates the protection of groups of traditional buildings which, together with their environment, form a beautiful scene. They can be [[shukuba|post towns]], [[castle town]]s, mining towns, merchant quarters, ports, farming or fishing villages, etc.&lt;ref name="chapter06"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h23_chapter_06.pdf |title=Preservation and Utilization of Cultural Properties |date=1 April 2011 |work= |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=2012-02-20 |page=43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119143921/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/pdf/h23_chapter_06.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]]'s [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] recognizes and protects the country's [[Cultural Properties of Japan|cultural properties]] under the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties.

Municipalities can designate items of particular importance as {{Nihongo|Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings|伝統的建造物群保存地区|Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun Hozon-chiku}} and approve measures to protect them. Items of even higher importance are then designated {{Nihongo|Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings|重要伝統的建造物群保存地区|Jūyō Dentōteki Kenzōbutsu-gun Hozon-chiku}} by the central government.&lt;ref name="chapter06"/&gt; The Agency for Cultural Affairs then provides guidance, advice, and funds for repairs and other work. Additional support is given in the form of preferential tax treatment.

As of May 18, 2018, 118 districts have been classified as Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings.

==List of Important Preservation Districts==

===Criteria===
Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings are designated according to three criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/hakusho/nc/k19751120002/k19751120002.html |script-title=ja:重要伝統的建造物群保存地区選定基準 |publisher=[[MEXT]] |location=Tokyo |language= Japanese |trans-title=Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Traditional Buildings selection criteria |accessdate= 2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Groups of traditional buildings that show excellent design as a whole

'''Gyula (Julius) Moravcsik''' (Budapest, 29 January 1892 – Budapest, 10 December 1972), who usually wrote just as '''Gy. Moravcsik''', was a Hungarian professor of Greek [[philology]] and [[Byzantine]] history who in 1967 was awarded the [[Pour le Mérite]] for Sciences and Arts.

==Scholarship==
Moravcsik explored in depth the relationship between Byzantium and the [[Turkic people]]s, broadly defined and so including Hungarians, and this was reflected in the two volumes of ''Byzantinoturcica'' and the 1953 ''Bizánc és a Magyarság'' (Byzantium and the Magyars).&lt;ref name=Rtt&gt;Rttook, Zsigmund. (1997) [http://epa.niif.hu/01400/01462/00020/pdf/005-015.pdf "The contribution of Hungary to international classical scholarship"], ''[[Hungarian Studies (journal)|Hungarian Studies]]'', 12. [https://www.webcitation.org/6NtepxQmg Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[R.J.H. Jenkins]], he produced the important new critical and translated edition of [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus']] ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]''. That work was first published in Budapest, 1949, and later at [[Dumbarton Oaks]]. Moravcsik also contributed to the later ''Commentary'', also in the Dumbarton Oaks series.

==Family==
His son, [[Julius Moravcsik]] (1931 – 2009), became a Professor of Philosophy at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2009/pr-moravcsik-obit-100109.html Memorial service on Oct. 7 for 'pragmatic Platonist' Julius Moravcsik] ''Stanford News Service'', Stanford University, 1 October 2009. Retrieved 5 March 2014. [https://www.webcitation.org/6NptMu2g1 Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63328">{{History of Kosovo}}
The history of [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} is intertwined with the histories of its neighboring regions. The name "Kosovo" is derived from the [[Gazimestan|Kosovo Plain]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} where the [[Battle of Kosovo]] was fought between [[Moravian Serbia|Serbia]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Kosovo's modern history can be traced to the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Prizren]], of which parts were organized into [[Kosovo Vilayet]] in 1877. In antiquity, [[Dardania (Balkans)|Dardania]] covered the area, which formed part of the larger Roman province of [[Moesia]] in the 1st century AD. In the Middle Ages, the region became part of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian medieval states]]. It was then conquered by the Ottoman Empire an exact 70 years after the Battle of Kosovo. In 1913 the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] was [[Treaty of London (1913)|incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia]], which in 1918 became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Kosovo gained autonomy in 1963 under [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s direction, an autonomy which was significantly extended by Yugoslavia's 1974 Constitution, but lost its autonomous institutions in 1990. In 1999 [[UNMIK]] stepped.

On 17 February 2008 [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo's Parliament declared independence]], as the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]], with [[International recognition of Kosovo|partial recognition of that declaration]].

The favorable Geo-strategic position as well as abundant natural resources were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archeological heritage.&lt;ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7"&gt;Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout [[Kosovo]] but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7"/&gt;

The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the [[Stone Age]] Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the '''Radivojce Cave''' set near the spring of the [[Drin (river)|Drin]] river, then there are some indications at '''Grnčar Cave''' in the [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]] municipality, Dema and Karamakaz '''Caves of [[Peć]]''' and others. However, life during the [[Paleolithic]] or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven. Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and [[Mesolithic]] man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory. Whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century BC, the area was in the eastern parts of [[Illyria]] which bordered on [[Thrace]]. At that time it was inhabited by the  [[Thraco-Illyrian]] tribes of the [[Dardani]], by [[Celts]]&lt;ref name="Naissos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/415944/Nis|title=Nis - History, Facts, &amp; Points of Interest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribe of the [[Triballi]]. The region of Illyria was  conquered by Rome in 168 BC, and made into the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. The Kosovo region probably became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87, although archaeological evidence suggests that it may have been divided between [[Dalmatia]] and Moesia.&lt;ref name="Jankovic"/&gt;

[[Image:Map of ancient Dardania and environs (English).svg|thumb|left|Dardania and its environs in pre-Roman times.]]

After 284 [[Diocletian]] further divided Upper Moesia into the smaller provinces of Dardania, Moesia Prima, Dacia Ripensis, and Dacia Mediterranea. Dardania's capital was [[Naissus]], previously a Celts settlement.&lt;ref name="Naissos"/&gt; The Roman province of Dardania included eastern parts of modern Kosovo, while its western part belonged to the newly formed Roman province of Prevalitana with its capital Doclea. The Romans colonized the region and founded several cities.

[[Image:Ancient balkans 4thcentury.png|thumb|Roman province of Dardania in the 4th century AD.]]

The [[Hun]]nic invasions of 441 and 447-49 were the first barbarian invasions which were able to take Eastern Roman fortified centers and cities. Most Balkan cities were sacked by Attila, and recovered only partially if at all. While there is no direct written evidence of Hunnic invasion of Kosovo, its economic hinterland will anyway have been affected for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2005, pp. 325–350)&lt;/ref&gt;[[Justinian I]], who assumed the throne of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 527, oversaw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories, and re-absorbed the area of Kosovo into the empire.

[[Slavic migrations]] to the Balkans took place between the 6th to 7th centuries.

==Middle Ages==
{{Main|History of Medieval Kosovo}}

===Bulgarian Period===
[[Image:Bulgaria Simeon I (893-927).svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kosovo]] in the 10th century.]]
{{Main|First Bulgarian Empire|Second Bulgarian Empire}}

The region of Kosovo was incorporated into the [[Bulgarian Empire]] during the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Presian of Bulgaria|Presian]] (836–852). Numerous churches and monasteries were constructed after the [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization]] in 864. It remained within the borders of [[Bulgaria]] for 150 years until 1018, when the country was overrun by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] after half-century bitter struggle. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' of the 10th century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Serbian-populated lands lay to the north-west of [[Kosovo]] and the region was Bulgarian.

During the [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040-1041)|Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040–1041)]], [[Kosovo]] was briefly liberated and during the [[Uprising of Georgi Voiteh]] in 1072, [[Constantine Bodin|Peter III]] was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria in [[Prizren]] from where the Bulgarian army marched to [[Skopje]].

In the beginning of the 13th century, Kosovo was reincorporated in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]] but the Bulgarian control faded after the death of Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (1218–1241).

===Byzantine Period===
When Kosovo was overrun by the Byzantines, the control was subsequently reasserted by Emperor [[Basil II]]. Serbia at that time was not a united state: a number of Serbian principalities lay to the north and west of Kosovo, of which [[Raška (state)|Raška]] and [[Duklja]] were the strongest. In the 1180s, the Serbian ruler [[Stefan Nemanja]] seized control of Duklja and parts of Kosovo. His successor, [[Stefan Prvovenčani]] took control of the rest of Kosovo by 1216, creating a state incorporating most of the area which is now Serbia and [[Montenegro]].

===Serbian Period===
{{Further|Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian Empire}}
[[Image:Serbia boundaries CIA.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''"Kosovo: History of a Balkan Hot Spot"'']]
[[File:Car Dušan, Manastir Lesnovo, XIV vek, Makedonija.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Stefan Dušan]] used the city of [[Prizren]] as capital of [[Serbian Empire]] at that time.]]

Kosovo was absorbed into the [[Serbia]]n state of Rascia in the late 12th and early 13th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; and was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] from 1346 to 1371. In 1389, in the [[Battle of Kosovo]],{{sfn|Ćirković|2004|pp=84-85}} the army of the Serbian Prince [[Lazar Hrebljanović]] was defeated by the [[Ottoman Turks]], who finally took control of the territory in 1455.

During the rule of the [[Nemanjić]] dynasty (c. 1160–1355), many [[Serbian Orthodox]] churches and monasteries were built throughout Serbian territory. From the mid-13th century to the end of the century, the Nemanjić rulers had their main residences in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of the Balkans'', p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Large estates were given to the monasteries in Western Kosovo ([[Metohija]]). The most prominent churches in Kosovo – the [[Patriarchate]] at [[Peć]], the church at [[Gračanica, Kosovo|Gračanica]] and the monastery at [[Visoki Dečani]] near [[Dečani]] – were all founded during this period.  Kosovo was economically important, as the modern Kosovo capital [[Priština]] was a major trading centre on routes leading to ports on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Also, mining was an important industry in [[Novo Brdo]] and [[Janjevo]] which had its communities of émigré [[Saxons|Saxon]] miners and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants. In 1450 the mines of Novo Brdo were producing about 6,000&amp;nbsp;kg of silver per year.

The ethnic composition of Kosovo's population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and [[Vlachs]] along with a token number of [[Greeks]], [[Croats]], [[Armenians]], Saxons, and [[Bulgarians]], according to Serbian monastic charters or ''chrysobulls''. A majority of the names given in the charters are overwhelmingly Slavic rather than Albanian. This has been interpreted as evidence of an overwhelming Serbian majority. This claim seems to be supported by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] cadastral tax-census ([[defter]]) of 1455 which took into account religion and language and found an overwhelming [[Kosovo population data-points|Serb majority]]. But, since there are many examples of both Slavic and Albanian names occurring within the same family, name evidence must be treated with caution;&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' p.56&lt;/ref&gt; giving children "foreign" names can occur through inter-marriage, through imitation of a socially superior class from a different ethnic group, or simply through fashion.

Ethnic identity in the [[Middle Ages]] was somewhat fluid throughout Europe, and most people at that time do not appear to have defined themselves rigidly by ethnicity. But Serbian-speakers were the majority linguistic group in this period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In 1355, the Serbian state fell apart on the death of [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Dušan]] and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. The Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanjićs had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Battle of Kosovo====

====First Battle of Kosovo====
{{See also|Battle of Kosovo}}

[[File:Battle of Kosovo, Adam Stefanović, 1870.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 determined the future of central Balkans and marked the beginning of disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]]]]

The [[Battle of Kosovo|First Battle of Kosovo]] occurred on the field of [[Kosovo Polje]] on June 28, 1389, when the ruling ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'' (prince) of Serbia, [[Lazar Hrebeljanović]], marshalled a coalition of Christian soldiers, made up of Serbs, but in small numbers also of [[Bosnians]], [[Albanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]]  and a troop of Saxon mercenaries. [[Sultan]] [[Murad I]] also gathered a coalition of soldiers and volunteers from neighboring countries in [[Anatolia]] and [[Rumelia]]. Exact numbers are difficult to come by, but most reliable historical accounts suggest that the Christian army was heavily outnumbered by the Ottomans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The combined numbers of the two armies are believed to be less than 100,000.

The Serbian army was defeated and Lazar was slain, although Murad I was killed, according to tradition by [[Miloš Obilić]], or Kobilić as he was always called until the 18th century; he has been variously described as a Serb, an Albanian, and a Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp.68–74&lt;/ref&gt; Although the battle has been mythologised as a great Serbian defeat, at the time opinion was divided as to whether it was a Serbian defeat, a stalemate or possibly even a Serbian victory. Serbian principalities continued their existence, usually as vassals of the Ottomans, and maintained sporadic control of Kosovo, until the final extinction of the Despotate of Serbia in 1459, following which Serbia became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The fortress of Novo Brdo, important at the time due to its rich silver mines, came under siege for forty days by the Ottomans during that year, capitulating and becoming occupied by the Ottomans on June 1, 1455.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp. 81–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Battle of Kosovo====
{{See also|Battle of Kosovo (1448)}}

The [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] was fought over the course of a two-day period in October 1448, between a Hungarian force led by [[John Hunyadi]] and an Ottoman army led by [[Murad II]]. Significantly larger than the first battle, with both armies numbering twice that of the first battle,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} the ending was the same, and the Hungarian army was defeated in the battle and pushed from the field. Although the loss of the battle was a setback for those resisting the Ottoman invasion of Europe at that time, it was not a 'crushing blow to the cause'. Hunyadi was able to maintain Hungarian resistance to the Ottomans during his lifetime.

====Significance====
The overall significance of these battles (within their medieval context) remains disputed,&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp 55–80&lt;/ref&gt; although the First Battle of Kosovo has become, for Serbians since their independence at least, a national symbol for heroism and an admirable 'fight against all odds', and may therefore have assumed a significance that it lacked . It seems unlikely that single battles could seriously have affected the rise of Ottoman power. In the First Battle of Kosovo, Sultan Murat I was the first Ottoman ruler to lose his life in combat; his successor Sultan Bayazid I went on to expand Ottoman territories significantly despite defeats in Wallachia, in his siege of Constantinople, and his crushing defeat in the battle of Ankara, in which he was captured and which resulted in a civil war for the succession. Despite these defeats, Ottoman power continued to expand.

The Second Battle of Kosovo might have had more significance&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 87–91&lt;/ref&gt;  in that there were two powers simultaneously resisting the Ottomans (the Hungarians under Hunyadi and the Albanians under Skanderbeg), with Skanderbeg only narrowly missed joining Hunyadi for the battle. While the resistance of the Byzantines, Serbians, Hungarians, Albanians and Wallachians should have given the Austrians (and Italians) more time to prepare for an Ottoman threat against them, it is by no means clear that they believed the threat to be serious or consciously prepared for it.

===Ottoman Period===

{{See also|Vilayet of Kosovo}}
{{See also|History of Ottoman Albania}}

{{Main|20th century history of Kosovo}}
[[Image:Kosovo02.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1875–1878.]]
[[Image:Vilayet of Kosovo (1881–1913) map.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1881–1912.]]
[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|Ethnographic map of the Balkans in the end of the 19th century.]]
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam]] with them and later also created the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years, in which time the Ottomans were the absolute power in the region. Many Slavs converted to Islam and served under Ottomans. Kosovo was taken temporarily by the Austrian forces during the War of 1683–1699 with help of Serbs but were defeated and retreated shortly thereafter. In 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Peć]] [[Arsenije III]], who had previously escaped a certain death, fled to Austria as did 30–40,000 people (according to the Patriarch).&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; He was probably referring only to Serbs; numbers of Albanians also fled. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the 18th century. Most Albanians eventually adopted [[Islam]], while most Serbs did not.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp.104–138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] and the position of [[Christians]] in Kosovo was greatly reduced.

==Modern==
The territory of today's province was for centuries ruled by the Ottoman Empire. During this period several administrative districts known as [[sanjak]]s ("banners" or districts) each ruled by a ''sanjakbey'' (roughly equivalent to "district lord") have included parts of the territory as parts of their territories. Despite the imposition of [[Muslim]] rule, large numbers of [[Christian]]s continued to live and sometimes even prosper under the Ottomans. A process of [[Islamisation]] began shortly after the beginning of Ottoman rule but it took a considerable amount of time – at least a century – and was concentrated at first on the towns. A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. Christian religious life nonetheless continued, while churches were largely left alone by the Ottomans, but both the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] churches and their congregations suffered from high levels of taxation.

From the 17th century, there is evidence of an increasing proportion of Albanian-speakers in Kosovo, spreading from the West. Some of this seems to have been the result of migration from the mountains of modern Albania into lands which could support higher populations, and that the putative migrants brought Islam with them. Catholic Albanians who found it convenient to be officially Muslim (whatever their origins) were not allowed by the Vatican to continue Catholic rites in private, and therefore became increasingly Islamised.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm, ''Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 114–138&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1689 Kosovo was greatly disrupted in the course of the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683–1699), in one of the pivotal events. In October 1689, a small [[Habsburg Monarcy|Habsburg]] force under [[Margrave]] [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Ludwig of Baden]] breached the Ottoman Empire and reached as far as Kosovo, following their earlier capture of [[Belgrade]]. Many Serbs and Albanians pledged their loyalty to the [[Austrians]], some joining Ludwig's army. This was by no means a universal reaction; many other Albanians fought alongside the Ottomans to resist the Austrian advance. A massive Ottoman counter-attack the following summer drove the Austrians back to their fortress at [[Niš]], then back to Belgrade, then finally back across the [[Danube]] into Austria.

In 1878, one of the four [[vilayet]]s with Albanian inhabitants that formed the [[League of Prizren]] was [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. The League's purpose was to resist both Ottoman rule and incursions by the newly emerging Balkan nations.

[[file: Ethnic map of Balkans - german 1882.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Balkans – Heinrich Kiepert 1882.]]

In 1910, an Albanian insurrection, which was possibly aided surreptitiously by the [[Young Turks]] to put pressure on the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]], broke out in [[Pristina]] and soon spread to the entire vilayet of Kosovo, lasting for three months. The Sultan visited Kosovo in June 1911 during peace settlement talks covering all Albanian-inhabited areas.

===Albanian National Movement===
{{Main|Albanian National Revival|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877-1878}}
The Albanian national movement was inspired by various factors. Besides the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against the Slavic monarchies of Europe. During and after the [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–78)|Serbian–Ottoman War]] of 1876–78, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from the [[Sanjak of Niš|Sanjak of Niș]] and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.&lt;ref&gt;Pllana, Emin (1985).

(3): 470.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the signing of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] marked the beginning of a difficult situation for the Albanian people in the Balkans, whose lands were to be ceded from Turkey to Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Hysni Myzyri, "Kriza lindore e viteve 70 dhe rreziku i copëtimit të tokave shqiptare," ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://historia.shqiperia.com/rilindja/kreu_5.php Historia e Shqipërisë, “Kreu V: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenit,” ''Shqiperia.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-11A.html HRW, " Prizren Municipality," ''UNDER ORDERS: War Crimes in Kosovo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing the partitioning of Albanian-inhabited lands among the newly founded Balkan kingdoms, the Albanians established their [[League of Prizren]] on June 10, 1878, three days prior to the Congress of Berlin that would revise the decisions of San Stefano.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Г. Л. Арш, И. Г. Сенкевич, Н. Д. Смирнова «Кратая история Албании» (Приштина: Рилиндя, 1967) 104–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the League was founded with the support of the Sultan who hoped for the preservation of Ottoman territories, the Albanian leaders were quick and effective enough to turn it into a national organization and eventually into a government. The League had the backing of the [[Arbëreshë people|Italo-Albanian]] community and had well developed into a unifying factor for the religiously diverse Albanian people. During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an [[Albanian vilayet]] within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of [[Ymer Prizreni]], assisted by prominent ministers such as [[Abdyl Frashëri]] and [[Sulejman Vokshi]]. Nevertheless, military intervention from the Balkan states, the Great Powers as well as Turkey divided the Albanian troops in three fronts, which brought about the end of the League.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hysni Myzyri, "Kreu VIII: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenit (1878–1881)," ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 149–172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historia.shqiperia.com/rilindja/kreu_5.php|title=LIDHJA SHQIPTARE E PRIZRENIT - (1878 - 1881)|website=historia.shqiperia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo was yet home to other Albanian organizations, the most important being the [[League of Peja]], named after the city in which it was founded in 1899. It was led by [[Haxhi Zeka]], a former member of the League of Prizren and shared a similar platform in quest for an autonomous [[Albanian vilayet]]. The League ended its activity in 1900 after an armed conflict with the Ottoman forces. Zeka was assassinated by a Serbian agent in 1902 with the backing of the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hysni Myzyri, "Kreu VIII: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenit (1878–1881)," ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkan Wars===
{{Main|First Balkan War|Second Balkan War}}

[[Image:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|Boundaries on the Balkans after the [[First Balkan War|First]] and [[Second Balkan War]]]]

The demands of the [[Young Turks]] in early 20th century sparked support from the Albanians, who were hoping for a betterment of their national status, primarily recognition of their language for use in offices and education.&lt;ref&gt;Hysni Myzyri, "Lëvizja kombëtare shqiptare dhe turqit e rinj," ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Г. Л. Арш, И. Г. Сенкевич, Н. Д. Смирнова «Кратая история Албании» (Приштина: Рилиндя, 1967) 140–160.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, 20,000 armed Albanian peasants gathered in [[Uroševac]] to prevent any foreign intervention, while their leaders, [[Bajram Curri]] and [[Isa Boletini]], sent a telegram to the sultan demanding the promulgation of a constitution and the opening of the parliament.
The Albanians did not receive any of the promised benefits from the Young Turkish victory. Considering this, an unsuccessful uprising was organized by Albanian highlanders in Kosovo in February 1909. The adversity escalated after the takeover of the Turkish government by an oligarchic group later that year. In April 1910, armies led by [[Idriz Seferi]] and Isa Boletini rebelled against the Turkish troops, but were finally forced to withdraw after having caused many casualties amongst the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Hysni Myzyri, "Kryengritjet shqiptare të viteve 1909–1911," ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: për shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtinë, 2002) 195–198.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further Albanian rebellion in 1912 was the pretext for Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria beginning the [[First Balkan War]] against the Ottoman Empire. Most of Kosovo was incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]], while the region of [[Metohija]] ({{lang-sq|Dukagjini Valley}}) was taken by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. Kosovo was split into four counties: three being a part of the entity of Serbia (Zvečan, Kosovo and southern Metohija); one of Montenegro (Northern Metohija).

===Interbellum Period===
[[Image:Map of Kosovo during WW II.png|thumb|left|Kosovo in 1941]]
{{Main|Colonisation of Kosovo}}
The 1918–1929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a [[The Forced Deportation of Albanians in the Years 1912–1941|decline]] in the non-Serbian.

In 1929, Kosovo was split between the [[Zeta Banovina]] in the west with the capital in [[Cetinje]], [[Vardar Banovina]] in the southeast with the capital in [[Skopje]] and the [[Morava Banovina]] in the northeast with the capital in [[Niš]].

After the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources put the numbers of Serbs killed during WWII in Kosovo at anywhere from 10,000-40,000, with 250,000 forcibly expelled.  "We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... All indigenous Serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such, via the Albanian and Italian governments, should be sent to concentration camps in Albania. Serbian settlers should be killed." Mustafa Kruja, the then Prime Minister of Albania, June 1942

The Kosovo Albanians, whose population refused to respond to calls by the multi-ethnic [[Yugoslav Partisans]] to resist against the Nazis, were treated harshly following the war because they were regarded as being Nazi and Fascist collaborators. The Albanian Kosovar military leader [[Shaban Polluzha]], who first fought with Yugoslav partisans but then refused to collaborate further, was attacked and killed. Between 400 and 2,000 Albanian Kosovar recruits were [[Bar massacre|shot in Bar]].

After the war, in a bid to terminate the cycle of revenge and ethnic conflict, the new Communist government of Yugoslavia prohibited the return of 50,000–70,000 Serbs and Montenegrins who were expelled from their homesteads by Kosovo Albanians during the war, while conversely 70,000&lt;ref name="BieberDaskalovski2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Florian Bieber|author2=Židas Daskalovski|title=Understanding the War in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sUzZWLHEdgwC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=1 April 2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-7146-8327-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; settlers from Albania moved to Kosovo to replace the expelled Serb population. Subsequently, the ethnic balance of Kosovo shifted strongly in favour of the Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mojzes|Mojzes 2011]], p. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavian Period===
{{Main|Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo}}

[[Image:Locator map Kosovo in Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|190px|[[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]] of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Socialist Serbia]] inside [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]], 1974–1990]]

Following the end of the war and the establishment [[Yugoslav Communist Party|Communist]] Yugoslavia, Kosovo was granted the status of an autonomous region of Serbia in 1946 and became an autonomous province in 1963. The Communist government did not permit the return of all of the refugees.

With the passing of the 1974 Yugoslavia constitution, Kosovo gained virtual self-government. The province's government has applied Albanian curriculum to Kosovo's schools: surplus and obsolete textbooks from [[Enver Hoxha]]'s Albania were obtained and put into use.

Throughout the 1980s tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the province escalated.&lt;ref name="reuters19860527"&gt;Reuters 1986-05-27, "Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm19860728"&gt;Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, "Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over"&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian community favoured greater autonomy for Kosovo, whilst Serbs favored closer ties with the rest of Serbia. There was little appetite for unification with Albania itself, which was ruled by a [[Stalinist]] government and had considerably worse living standards than Kosovo. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students organized [[1981 protests in Kosovo|protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia]]. Those protests rapidly escalated into violent riots "involving 20,000 people in six cities"&lt;ref name="nyt19810419"&gt;New York Times 1981-04-19, "One Storm has Passed but Others are Gathering in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt; that were harshly contained by the Yugoslav government. The demonstrations of March and April 1981 were started by Albanian students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bits.de/public/articles/osteuropa9-05.htm |title=Die Zukunft des Kosovo |publisher=Bits.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Priština, protesting against poor living conditions and the lack of prospects (unemployment was rampant in the province and most of the university educated ended up as the unemployed). In addition, calls for a separate Albanian republic within Yugoslavia were voiced.

[[Image:Bibloteka Kombëtare e Kosovës.jpg|thumb|National Library in Pristina.]]

Serbs living in Kosovo were discriminated against by the provincial government, notably by the local law enforcement authorities failing to punish reported crimes against Serbs.&lt;ref name="nyt19820712"&gt;New York Times 1982-07-12, "Exodus of Serbians Stirs Province in Yugoslavia"&lt;/ref&gt;  The increasingly bitter atmosphere in Kosovo meant that even the most farcical incidents could become ''causes célèbres''. When a Serbian farmer, [[Djordje Martinović|Đorđe Martinović]], turned up at a Kosovo hospital with a bottle in his [[rectum]] after being assaulted in his field by masked men, 216 prominent Serbian intellectuals signed a petition declaring that "the case of Đorđe Martinović has come to symbolize the predicament of all Serbs in Kosovo."

Perhaps the most politically explosive complaint leveled by the Kosovo Serbs was that they were being neglected by the Communist authorities in Belgrade.&lt;ref name="nyt19870627"&gt;New York Times 1987-06-27, "Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs"&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1987, [[Slobodan Milošević]], then a rising politician, visited Kosovo. He appealed to Serb nationalism to further his career{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Having drawn huge crowds to a rally commemorating the Battle of Kosovo, he pledged to Kosovo Serbs that "No one should dare to beat you", and became an instant hero of Kosovo's Serbs. By the end of the year Milošević was in control of the Serbian government.

Through 1988 and 1989, dominant forces in Serbian politics engaged in a series of moves that became known as the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. The leading politicians of Kosovo and the northern province of [[Vojvodina]] were sacked and replaced, and the level of autonomy of the provinces started to be unilaterally reduced by the Serbian federal authority. In protest, the Kosovo Albanians engaged in mass demonstrations, and Trepča miners [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|began a hunger strike]].

The new constitution significantly reduced the provinces' rights, permitting the government of Serbia to exert direct control over many previously autonomous areas of governance. In particular, the constitutional changes handed control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies to the Serbian government.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}
It was strongly opposed by many of Serbia's national minorities, who saw it as a means of imposing ethnically based centralized rule on the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970851,00.html Yugoslavia The Old Demons Arise], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', August 06, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The Albanian representatives in provincial government largely opposed the constitutional changes and abstained from ratification in the Kosovo assembly.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} In March 1989, preceding a final push for ratification, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for [[due process]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|pp=27–29}} When the assembly met to discuss the proposals, tanks and armored cars surrounded the meeting place.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=56}} Though the final vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority threshold, it was declared as having passed.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}

===Kosovo War===
{{Kosovo War}}
After the constitutional changes, the parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them. Kosovo Albanians refused to participate in the elections and held their own, unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required  turnout higher than 50%, the parliament of Kosovo could not be established.

The new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the [[Albanian language]]. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo was suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including that in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made creating privately owned media possible, however their functioning was very difficult because of high rents and restricting laws. State-owned Albanian language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027223050/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |date=October 27, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is "Koha Ditore", which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after it published a calendar which was claimed to be a glorification of ethnic Albanian separatists.

The constitution also transferred control over state-owned companies to the Serbian government (at the time, most of the companies were state-owned). In September 1990, up to 12,000 Albanian workers were fired from their positions in government and the media, as were teachers, doctors, and workers in government-controlled industries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wolfgang Plarre |url=http://www.bndlg.de/~wplarre/back337.htm |title=ON THE RECORD: //Civil Society in Kosovo// – Volume 9, Issue 1 – August 30, 1999 – THE BIRTH AND REBIRTH OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN KOSOVO – PART ONE: REPRESSION AND RESISTANCE |publisher=Bndlg.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  provoking a [[general strike]] and mass unrest. Some of those who were not sacked quit in sympathy, refusing to work for the Serbian government. Although the sackings were widely seen as a purge of ethnic Albanians, the government maintained that it was simply getting rid of old communist directors.
[[File:Kosovo-metohija-koreni-duse002.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian victims of massacres during [[Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)|insurgency (1995–98)]]]]

The old Albanian educational curriculum and textbooks were revoked and new ones were created. The curriculum was basically the same as Serbian and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in Albanian language. Education in Albanian was withdrawn in 1992 and re-established in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/kosovo/documents/reports/hr/part1/ch1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010143329/http://www.osce.org/kosovo/documents/reports/hr/part1/ch1.htm |date=October 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Pristina University, which was seen as a centre of Kosovo Albanian cultural identity, education in the Albanian language was abolished and Albanian teachers were also sacked en masse. Albanians responded by boycotting state schools and setting up an unofficial parallel system of Albanian-language education.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Howard. ''Civil Resistance in Kosovo''. London: Pluto Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-7453-1569-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kosovo Albanians were outraged by what they saw as an attack on their rights. Following mass rioting and unrest from Albanians as well as outbreaks of inter-communal violence,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} in February 1990, a state of emergency was declared, and the presence of the Yugoslav Army and police was significantly increased to quell the unrest.

Unsanctioned elections were held in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as "president" of a self-declared Republic of Kosovo; however these elections were not recognised by Serbian nor any foreign government. In 1995, thousands of Serb refugees from [[Croatia]] settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities.

Albanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital [[Pristina]]. Ibrahim Rugova initially advocated non-violent resistance, but later opposition took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA; Alb. ''Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës'' or ''UÇK'').

The KLA launched a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] and [[terrorism|terror campaign]], characterised by regular bomb and gun attacks on Yugoslav security forces, state officials and civilians known to openly support the national government, this included Albanians who were non-sympathizers with KLA motives. In March 1998, Yugoslav army units joined Serbian police to fight the separatists, using military force. In the months that followed, thousands of Albanian civilians were killed and more than 10,000 fled their homes; most of these people were Albanian. Many Albanian families were forced to flee their homes at gunpoint, as a result of fighting between national security and KLA forces leading to expulsions by the security forces including associated paramilitary militias. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) estimated that 460,000 people had been displaced from March 1998 to the start of the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&amp;page=home&amp;id=3ae6b80dc |title=Kosovo Crisis Update |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was violence against non-Albanians as well: UNHCR reported (March 1999) that over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo "have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants" and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia. The [[Yugoslav Red Cross]] estimated there were more than 130,000 non-Albanian displaced in need of assistance in Kosovo, most of whom were Serb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210223223/http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm |date=December 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kukes Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|left|Refugee camp near [[Kukës]], [[Albania]] (1999)]]
Following the breakdown of negotiations between Serbian and Albanian representatives, under [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) auspices, NATO intervened on March 24, 1999 without United Nations authority. NATO launched a campaign of heavy bombing against Yugoslav military targets and then moved to wide range bombings (like bridges in Novi Sad). A full-scale war broke out as KLA continued to attack Serbian forces and Serbian/Yugoslav forces continued to fight KLA amidst a massive displacement of the population of Kosovo, which most human rights groups and international organisations regarded as an act of [[ethnic cleansing]] perpetrated by the government forces. A number of senior Yugoslav government officials and military officers, including President Milošević, were subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]) for [[war crime]]s. Milošević died in detention before a verdict was rendered.

The [[United Nations]] estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 40,000 Albanians fled or were expelled from Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to Albania, the [[Republic of Macedonia]], or [[Montenegro]]. Government security forces confiscated and destroyed the documents and license plates of many fleeing Albanians in what was widely regarded as an attempt to erase the identities of the refugees, the term "[[identity cleansing]]" being coined to denote this action. This made it difficult to distinguish with certainty the identity of returning refugees after the war. Serbian sources claim that many Albanians from Macedonia and Albania – perhaps as many as 300,000, by some estimates – have since migrated to Kosovo in the guise of refugees. The entire issue is moot, however, due to the survival of birth and death records.

===Post Kosovo War===
{{Further|Constitutional status of Kosovo|Kosovo status process|2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Republic of Kosovo}}

The war ended on June 10, 1999 with the Serbian and Yugoslav governments signing the [[Kumanovo agreement]] which agreed to transfer governance of the province to the United Nations. A NATO-led Kosovo Force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) entered the province following the [[Kosovo War]], tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]). Before and during the handover of power, an estimated 100,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians, mostly Serbs, fled the province for fear of reprisals. In the case of the non-Albanians, the Roma in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted the Serbs during the war. Many left along with the withdrawing Serbian security forces, expressing fears that they would be targeted by returning Albanian refugees and KLA fighters who blamed them for wartime acts of violence. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war as KFOR struggled to restore order in the province.

Large numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029061224/http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm |date=October 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=414ad5b57&amp;page=statistics ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613013001/http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=414ad5b57&amp;page=statistics |date=June 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some sources put the figure far lower; the European Stability Initiative estimates the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with another 40,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for. The largest concentration of ethnic Serbs in Kosovo is in the north of the province above the [[Ibar river]], but an estimated two-thirds of the Serbian population in Kosovo continues to live in the Albanian-dominated south of the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=156&amp;document_ID=53 |title=Chronology of all ESI publications – Reports – ESI |publisher=Esiweb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2004, serious [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|unrest in Kosovo]] led to 19 deaths,&lt;ref name=PeaceatAnyPrice&gt;{{cite book | author=Iain King and Whit Mason | title= [[Peace at Any Price|Peace at Any Price: How the World Failed Kosovo]] | publisher=Cornell University Press| year=2006 |ISBN= 978-0-8014-4539-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the destruction of 35 Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries in the province, as Albanians started pogroms against the Serbs. Several thousand more Kosovo Serbs have left their homes to seek refuge in Serbia proper or in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo.

Since the end of the war, Kosovo has been a major source and destination country in the [[trafficking of women]], women forced into prostitution and sexual slavery. The growth in the sex trade industry has been fuelled by NATO forces in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |title=Amnesty International &amp;#124; Working to Protect Human Rights |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013123632/http://web.amnesty.org/actforwomen/stories-9-eng |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian Traynor in Zagreb |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1211214,00.html |title=Nato force 'feeds Kosovo sex trade' &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date=2004-05-07 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/4146?PHPSESSID=8cd9d5b0df1ae0bbae8d3ddf647ec715 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20061121070047/http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/4146 |archivedate=November 21, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]] which ended the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] of 1999. Whilst Serbia's continued sovereignty over Kosovo was recognised by the international community, a clear majority of the province's population sought independence.

The [[United Nations]]-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] ", ''BBC News'', October 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes 'supervised independence' for the province. As of early July 2007 the draft resolution, which is backed by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of five permanent members, has stated that it will not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02 |title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo |publisher=SETimes.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence===
[[File:Kosovo rep en.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of the Republic of Kosovo, as proclaimed in 2008]]

On February 17, 2008, [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo's Parliament declared independence]],&lt;ref name="bbc_proclaim"&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7249034.stm Kosovo MPs proclaim independence]", BBC News Online, 17 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; to [[International recognition of Kosovo|mixed international reactions]]. Some Kosovo Serbs opposed to secession have boycotted the move by refusing to follow orders from the central government in Pristina and attempting to seize infrastructure and border posts in Serb-populated regions. There have also been sporadic instances of violence against international institutions and governmental institutions, predominantly in [[Northern Kosovo]] (see [[2008 unrest in Kosovo]]).

On July 25, 2011 Kosovan Albanian police wearing riot gear [[2011 Kosovo-Serbia border clashes|attempted to seize]] several border control posts in Kosovo's Serb-controlled north trying to enforce the ban on Serbian imports imposed in retaliation of Serbia's ban on import from Kosovo. It prompted a large crowd to erect roadblocks and Kosovan police units came under fire. An Albanian policeman died when his unit was ambushed and another officer was reportedly injured. Nato-led peacekeepers moved into the area to calm the situation and Kosovan police pulled back. The US and EU criticised the Kosovan government for acting without consulting international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Kosovo-Serbia-Border-Row-Nato-Intervenes-After-Police-Try-To-Take-Over-Border-Control-Posts/Article/201107416038032?|title=Nato Steps In Amid Kosovo-Serbia Border Row|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14303165|title=Kosovo tense after border clash|date=27 July 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though tensions between the two sides eased somewhat after the intervention of [[NATO]]'s KFOR forces, they continued to remain high.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32906">{{History of Tunisia}}
In its modern history, [[Tunisia]] is a sovereign republic, called the [[Republic of Tunisia|al-Jumhuriyyah at-Tunisiyyah]]. Tunisia has over [[Demographics of Tunisia|ten million citizens]], almost all of Arab-Berber descent. The [[Mediterranean Sea]] is to the north and east, [[Libya]] to the southeast, and [[Algeria]] to the west. [[Tunis]] is the capital and the largest city (over 800,000); it is located near the ancient site of the city of [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt;See map at end of article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For background information on geography, see [[History of Tunisia]] preview.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first modern leader, President [[Habib Bourguiba]] brought to the office hard-won political experience, after many decades of service in  the leadership of the independence movement. As the major figure of the [[Neo-Destour]] Party, he was instrumental in obtaining full independence for Tunisia in 1956. He dominated the government until his removal in 1987. During his years in office, his accomplishments included: a law reform, economic policies which detoured briefly in a socialist direction, a moderate but steady improvement in standard of living, and a foreign policy which retained an independent approach while maintaining trade and economic connections to the west.

[[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] became President of the Republic in 1987, and kept power until he was [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|forced to leave in 2011]]. His economic policies emphasized a market orientation. His attempt at reapproachment with Islamist groups did not meet expectations. The ruling party was reorganized. Under his leadership [[Economy of Tunisia|Tunisia's economy]] continued to perform at a pace which yielded a moderate but overall steady rate of growth.

A [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]] was elected following the overthrow of Ben Ali, which completed the task of drafting a new constitution and handed over to newly elected authorities in 2014, ushering in the [[#Second Republic (2014–present)|Second Republic]].

==Independence of the Kingdom of Tunisia==

[[File:Lamine Bey.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Lamine Bey]], first king and last bey of Tunisia]]

An independence movement lasting many decades eventually prevailed, leading to the end of the [[French protectorate of Tunisia|French protectorate]] (commenced in 1881). In 1954 the Tunisian struggle and consequent civil disturbances resulted in the start of negotiations for [[autonomy]] between France and the [[Neo Destour]] political party (essentially under Habib Bourguiba) supported by the Tunisian labor unions and by the [[Arab League]]. The agreed ''Convention'' of April, 1955, stated that France would retain control of the army and foreign affairs while granting autonomy, which was to begin the following year. Bourguiba was released from prison by the French to a tumultuous welcome. This compromise, however, split the Neo Destour; eventually it led to suppression of its left wing, and expulsion of its radical, [[pan-Arab]] leader [[Salah ben Youssef]] (or Yusuf), who later fled to [[Egypt]]. This resolution of intra-party strife signalled that Neo Destour would pursue a moderate path. The French then terminated their ''protectorate'' over [[Morocco]], in order to concentrate their forces in [[Algeria]]. In reaction, and following the strong public opinion voiced by Tunisians, Bourguiba pressed for independence. The French, overcoming the heated objections of the French settlers, eventually acceded and protocols were drafted. On 20 March 1956, Tunisia achieved its full sovereignty. In July Tunisia's application for membership in the [[United Nations]] was accepted.

The French conceived an [[Kingdom of Tunisia|independent Tunisia as a constitutional monarchy]] ruled by the [[Bey of Tunis]], [[Muhammad VIII al-Amin]] Bey (Lamine or Amin Bey). The [[Bey]] was an institution that dated back to the early [[History of Ottoman era Tunisia|Ottoman era]]. The prior Bey [[Muhammad VII al-Munsif]] (Moncef Bey) had been a popular nationalist, but Amin Bey was both considered by some to be compromised by the French, by others to be a ''youssefist''. Already scheduled elections were held on 25 March 1956; due to secret arrangements negotiated by Bourguiba with the Bey the voters choose only party lists, not candidates. This arrangement made it easier for the Neo Destour party to keep out any ''youssefist'' or other dissidents, and to maintain party discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Geyer, ''Tunisia'' (London: Stacy 2003) at 41. Geyer notes the "pyramidal structure" of the Neo Destour, nonetheless she praises Bourguiba's "flexibility and moderation".&lt;/ref&gt; The elections were then swept by the Neo Destour party, whose leader [[Habib Bourguiba]] became prime minister. On 25 July 1957, the monarchy was abolished, the [[List of Beys of Tunis|beylical office]] terminated, and Tunisia proclaimed a Republic. The assembly then made Bourguiba the first president, of what would be a single-party state.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (Cambridge University 2004) at 125-129, 131-133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Anderson, ''The State and Social Transformation in Tunisia and Libya, 1830-1980'' (Princeton University 1986) at 231-235.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Hrbek, "North Africa and the Horn" 127-160, at 129-132, [under section "The struggle for political sovereignty: from 1945 to independence"], in Ali A. Mazrui, editor, ''General History of Africa. VIII Africa since 1935'' (UNESCO 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Soames Nickerson, ''A Short History of North Africa'' (New York: Devin-Adair 1961) at 162-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Brace, ''Morocco Algeria Tunisia'' (Prentice-Hall 1964) at 114-116, 121-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Republic (1957 - 2014)==

=== Presidency of Habib Bourguiba ===
{{Habib Bourguiba sidebar}}

The [[Neo Destour]] regime sought to run a strictly structured regime with efficient and equitable state operations, but not with democratic-style politics. In effect, Bourguiba dominated the country for the next 31 years. He governed with programs yielding stability and economic progress, repressing [[Islamic fundamentalism]], and establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) at 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The political culture would be secular, populist, and imbued with a kind of French rationalist vision of the state that was buoyant, touched with élan, even ''Napoleonic'' in spirit. Bourguiba then saw an idiosyncratic, eclectic future combining tradition and innovation, Islam with a liberal prosperity. Habib Bourguiba has been compared to [[Ataturk]] (Mustafa Kemal) of Turkey, as a unique national modernizing leader. Yet, what may be called an inclination to arbitrary methods when making government decisions, and to a kind of personality cult, detracted from Bourguiba's insight and substantial achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (2004), e.g., at 130, 204-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bourguibism" was also resolutely nonmilitarist, arguing that Tunisia could never be a credible military power and that the building of a large military establishment would only consume scarce investment resources and perhaps thrust Tunisia into the cycles of military intervention in politics that had plagued the rest of the Middle East. In the name of economic development, Bourguiba nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions. While surely a secularist, he did not appear anti-religious.&lt;ref&gt;Bourguiba could bargain when opportunity offered. He negotiated with the Catholic Church; as a result Tunisia received scores of churches and land parcels to be used for libraries or museums, and the right to be consulted in the naming of future Church leaders. John K. Cooley, ''Baal, Christ, and Mohammad. Religion and Revolution in North Africa'' (Holt Rinehart Winston 1965) at 3-5, 297-298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourguiba's great asset was that "Tunisia possessed a mature nationalist organization, the Neo Destour Party, which on independence day held the nation's confidence in hand." It had made its case to the city workers in the modern economy and to country folk in the traditional economy; it had excellent leaders who commanded respect and who generally developed reasonable government programs.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia (1964) at 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

====External and internal struggles====
[[Image:Portrait_officiel_Bourguiba.png|thumb|[[Habib Bourguiba]], official photo as President of Tunisia.]]
In July 1961 when Tunisia imposed a blockade on the French naval base at [[Bizerte]], hoping to force its evacuation [[Bizerte crisis|the crisis culminated in a three-day battle between French and Tunisian forces that left some 630 Tunisians and 24 French dead]] and eventually led to France ceding the city and naval base to Tunisia in 1963.

One serious rival to Habib Bourguiba was Salah Ben Youssef. Exiled in [[Cairo]] during the early 1950s he had absorbed the pan-Arab nationalism associated with the Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]]. Yet as a result of his strong opposition to the Neo Destour leadership during their negotiations with France for autonomy prior to independence, Ben Youssef was removed from his position as secretary-general and expelled from the party. Nonetheless he rallied disaffected union members, students, and others, enough to put 20,000 ''youssefists'' into the street during the next congress of the Neo Destour party. Eventually he left Tunisia for Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (Cambridge Univ. 2004) at 117-118, 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Youssef was assassinated in Egypt in 1961. Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) at 115-116, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After 1987, Ben Youssef was gradually "rehabilitated" and his body returned to Tunisia for burial. Perkins, ''A History of Modern Tunisia'' (Cambridge Univ. 2004) at 199-201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the end of any meaningful opposition to Bourguiba.  In 1963, the Neo-Destour Party was proclaimed to be the only legally permitted party, though for all intents and purposes Tunisia had been a one-party state since independence.

====Economy====
Socialism was not initially a major part of the Neo Destour project, but the government had always held and implemented redistributive policies. A large public works program was launched in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Brace, ''Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia'' (1964) at 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless in 1964, Tunisia entered a short lived socialist era. The Neo Destour party became the Socialist Destour (''Parti Socialiste Destourien'' or PSD), and the new minister of planning, [[Ahmed Ben Salah]], formulated a state-led plan for agricultural cooperatives and public-sector industrialization. The socialist experiment raised considerable opposition within Bourguiba's old coalition. Ahmed Ben Salah was eventually dismissed in 1970, and many socialized operations (e.g., the farm cooperatives) were returned to private ownership in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name = "Khaddar, 849"&gt;Moncef M. Khaddar, "Tunisia" at 848-850, 849, in Joel Krieger (ed.), ''Oxford Companion to Politics of the World'' (2d ed. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, a general strike was repressed by the government with its forces killing dozens, and union leaders were jailed.

After independence, Tunisian economic policy had been primarily to promote light industry and tourism, and develop its phosphate deposits. The major sector remained agriculture with small farms prevailing, but these did not produce well. In the early 1960s the economy slowed down, but the socialist program did not prove to be the cure. In the 1970s the economy of Tunisia expanded at a very agreeable rate. Oil was discovered, and tourism continued. Foreign corporate investment increased. For example, [[Renault]] opened an auto manufacturing plant. City and countryside populations drew roughly equal in number. Yet agricultural problems and urban unemployment led to increased migration to Europe for work.

====Politics in the 1980s====
[[File:RachedGhannouchi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Rashid al-Ghannushi]] (around 1980)]]
In 1981 the government allowed a few "officially sanctioned" parties to run for office. But the economy faltered. Austerity imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund|I.M.F.]] caused increases in the price of bread. During the [[Tunisian bread riots]] of December 1983 – January 1984 over 100 demonstrators were killed. The [[Islamic Tendency Movement]] (MTI) of [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]] came to the fore. Thousands were jailed, especially Islamists; critical newspapers were closed, disruptive trade unions disbanded. Security was headed by General Ben Ali. An ailing Bourguiba threatened severe repression.

Tunisia continued its close ties to the West, both economic and political. From 1979 to 1991 the [[Arab League]] was located in Tunis. The [[Palestine Liberation Organization|P.L.O.]] was also based in Tunis from 1982 to 1994.&lt;ref name = "Khaddar, 849"/&gt;  On 1 October 1985, in [[Operation Wooden Leg]], [[Israeli Air Force]] [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15s]] bombed the PLO's [[Tunis]] headquarters, killing more than 60 people.

On the debit side, political democracy in the Western sense was more or less nonexistent.  Even before Tunisia became a one-party state, it adopted a constitution vesting almost dictatorial powers in the presidency.  Civil liberties were subject to "the limits prescribed by law," per the constitution.  The media were expected to practice self-censorship, and opponents were frequently imprisoned.  Bourguiba became the focus of a [[personality cult]] in which he was extolled as the "Supreme Warrior" of the nation.  In 1975, Bourguiba was proclaimed [[president for life]], though his health was increasingly poor.  Although he was prevailed upon to legalize opposition parties in 1981, Tunisia remained for all intents and purposes a one-party state.  The Destourian Socialist Party, in alliance with the trade unions, swept all of the seats in parliament.  The opposition was disgusted; it boycotted the next elections, in 1986.

===Era of Ben Ali===
{{Main article|Zine el Abidine Ben Ali}}
In the 1980s the economy performed poorly. In 1983 the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) forced the government to raise the price of bread and [[semolina]], causing severe hardship and protest riots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Riot and Rebellion: Political Responses to Economic Crisis in North Africa, Tunisia, Morocco and Sudan |first=David |last=Seddon |publisher=University of Texas |date=October 1986 |url=https://webspace.utexas.edu/hcleaver/www/357L/357LSeddontable.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927205635/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hcleaver/www/357L/357LSeddontable.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this situation, the [[Islamic Tendency Movement]] (MTI) under [[Rashid al-Ghannushi]] provided popular leadership. Civil disturbances, including those by the Islamists, were repressed by government security forces under General [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]]. The government persisted in following its program; Ben Ali was named prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Longtime Tunisian Leader Deposed by Prime Minister |first= |last= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=November 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-11-07/news/mn-4869_1_ben-ali-prime-minister |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rise to the Presidency====
[[Image:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.jpg|thumb|right|Ben Ali, former President of Tunisia]]
Ben Ali ascended to the office of President on 7 November 1987, after attending physicians to the former president filed an official medical report declaring Habib Bourguiba medically incapacitated and unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tunisian Constitution | work=United Nations| year=2009 |url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/cafrad/unpan004842.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bourguiba Described in Tunis | first=Paul |last=Delany | date=9 November 1987 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/09/world/senile-bourguiba-described-in-tunis.html?scp=2&amp;sq=senile%20bourguiba&amp;st=cseSenile |accessdate=20 November 2010 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the names given to Ben Ali's rise to the presidency include "the medical coup d'état" and the "[[Tunisian revolution|Jasmine Revolution]]".&lt;ref name="jasmin87_ayari_geisser"&gt;{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Ayari |authorlink= |author2=Vincent Geisser |language=French |title=Tunisie: la Révolution des "Nouzouh"* n'a pas l'odeur du jasmin |work= |publisher=[[Témoignage chrétien]] |year=2011 |url=http://www.temoignagechretien.fr/ARTICLES/International/Tunisie-la-Revolution-des-%C2%ABNouzouh%C2%BB*-n%E2%80%99a-pas-l%E2%80%99odeur-du-jasmin/Default-3-2370.xhtml |doi= |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xBhIUXxM?url=http://www.temoignagechretien.fr/ARTICLES/International/Tunisie-la-Revolution-des-%C2%ABNouzouh%C2%BB%2A-n%E2%80%99a-pas-l%E2%80%99odeur-du-jasmin/Default-3-2370.xhtml |archivedate=2011-03-14 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jasmin87_QudOran"&gt;{{cite web |language=French |title=La révolution par le feu et par un clic |work= |publisher=[[Le Quotidien d'Oran]]/moofid.com |date=2011-02-25 |url=http://news.moofid.com/fr-8441-La-revolution-par-le-feu-et-par-un-clic.htm |doi= |accessdate=2011-03-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xBh31rJ9?url=http://news.moofid.com/fr-8441-La-revolution-par-le-feu-et-par-un-clic.htm |archivedate=2011-03-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conformity with Article 57 of the Tunisian Constitution, the peaceful transition occurred as Tunisia was on the verge of economic collapse and a takeover of power by religious extremists{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The country had faced 10% inflation, external debt accounting for 46% of GDP and a [[debt service ratio]] of 21% of GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Republic of Tunisia Country Assistance Evaluation | work=World Bank | date= September 2004 |  url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/1/59/35286196.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to a bombing campaign and attempted government overthrow, for which 76 members of the radical “Islamic Tendency Movement” were convicted in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Tunisian Constitution | work=United Nations | url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/cafrad/unpan004842.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 [[Fulvio Martini]], former head of Italian military secret service [[SISMI]], declared to a parliamentary committee that "In 1985-1987 we organized a kind of coup in Tunisia, putting president Ben Ali as head of state, replacing Burghiba (''sic'') who wanted to flee".
Bourguiba, although a symbol of anticolonial resistance, was considered not capable to lead his country anymore, and his reaction to the raising Islamic integralism was deemed "a bit too energetic" by Martini: Bourguiba's threat to execute the suspects might have had strong negative implications in the neighbouring countries. Acting under directives of [[Bettino Craxi]], Italian prime minister, and [[Giulio Andreotti]], foreign minister, Martini claims to have brokered the accord that lead to the peaceful transition of powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/afri/tuni/tuni.html La Repubblica, 10 October 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bettino Craxi]] had visited [[Algeria]] in November 1984, being warned by the president [[Chadli Benjedid]] that [[Algeria]] was ready to invade that region of [[Tunisia]] that was crossed by the pipeline towards Italy, if Bourguiba wasn't able to guarantee the stability of his own country. Algeria was trying to diversify its foreign policy, feeling isolated by Spain and by [[Mitterrand]]'s accord with Morocco and Libya over Chad. For two years, according to Martini, Italian and Algerians secret services worked together in order, on one hand, to avoid that the growing destabilization of Tunisia might spillover in Algeria, and on the other hand to control pro-Palestinian terrorist activities in Italy. Finally, Ben Ali was singled out as possible replacement for Bourguiba: as chief of the Tunisian secret services and as Minister of Interiors, he had opposed plans for rough justice execution of fundamentalists. SISMI's action did not have the consent of [[René Imbot]], head of the French secret service, and the United States were not informed.

According to Martini, the SISMI didn't have an operational role in Ben Ali's raise to power, but organized a political move to support politically and economically his new government, avoiding that Tunisia might fell in an open confrontation with fundamentalists as would be in Algeria in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/afri/nigro/nigro.html La Repubblica], 11 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, following the [[Tangentopoli]] scandal and the [[Mani Pulite]] inquiry, [[Bettino Craxi]] fled from Italy to [[Hammamet, Tunisia|Hammamet]] in [[Tunisia]], and remained a fugitive there, protected by [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]]'s government. He repeatedly declared himself innocent, but never returned to Italy where he had been sentenced to 27 years in jail because of his corruption crimes (of these, 9 years and 8 months were upheld on appeal). He died on 19 January 2000, at the age of 65, from complications of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/610659.stm

====Liberalisation, then repression====
Ben Ali initially took some steps to liberalise the regime. He dismantled the personality cult surrounding his predecessor. He also amended the constitution to limit the president to a total of three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. In 1988, several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party [[Ennahda Movement|Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami]] (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda]] (the Renaissance Party). He also changed the ruling party's name to the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally]].

However, Ben Ali's innovative tack did not work out well. Subsequently, An-Nahda claimed to have run strongly in the [[Tunisian general election, 1989|1989 elections]], giving it the appearance of being unfair; official results gave the RCD every seat in the legislature. Ben Ali subsequently banned Islamist political parties and reportedly jailed as many as 8,000 activists.&lt;ref name = "Khaddar, 849"/&gt; At the same time, Ben Ali ran unopposed in Tunisia's first presidential election since 1972. At the time, prospective presidential candidates had to get the endorsements of 30 political figures. Given the RCD's near-total domination of politics, opposition candidates found it impossible to get their nomination papers signed.

The 1989 crackdown led to the restoration of some Bourguiba-era restrictions. Increasingly, self-censorship gave way to official censorship. Ben Ali was reelected unopposed in 1994. After amending the constitution to allow a president to run for three consecutive terms, Ben Ali was reelected in 1999, 2004 and 2009—each time by implausibly high margins (never falling below 89 percent of the vote) While the requirement to get signatures from 30 political figures had been lifted, opposition figures still faced nearly insurmountable obstacles.

By the dawn of the 21st century, Ben Ali was reckoned as leading one of the most repressive regimes in the world.  His regime consistently gained poor ratings from human rights and press freedom agencies.

====Economic reforms====
As president, Ben Ali championed economic reforms that strengthened Tunisia's economy and increased foreign investment. After he ascended to the office of President, Tunisia's per capita GDP more than tripled from $1,201 in 1986 to $3,786 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= UNdata Record View Per Capita GDP at Current Prices | first= |last= | work=United Nations | date=August 10, 2010 |url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=tunisia&amp;d=SNAAMA&amp;f=grID:101;currID:USD;pcFlag:1;crID:788 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, growth in 2002 slowed to a 15-year low of 1.9% due to drought and lackluster tourism, better conditions after 2003 helped push growth to about 5% of GDP. For about 20 years after 1987, the GDP annual growth averaged nearly 5%. A report published in July 2010 by the Boston Consulting Group ("The African Challengers: Global Competitors Emerge from the Overlooked Continent") listed Tunisia as one of the African "Lions" and indicated that the eight African lions account for 70 percent of the continent's gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The African Challengers: Global Competitors Emerge from the Overlooked Continen | first=Various |last=Various | work=The Boston Consulting Group | date=June 2010 |url=http://www.bcg.com/documents/file44610.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stable increases in GDP growth continued through positive trade relations with the European Union, a revitalized tourism industry and sustained agricultural production. Privatization, increasing foreign investment, improvements in government efficiency and reduction of the trade deficit remained  challenges however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali Biography |first=Various |last=Various |work=Bio |year=2009 |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Zine-el-Abidine-Ben-Ali-39445 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105023440/http://www.biography.com/articles/Zine-el-Abidine-Ben-Ali-39445 |archivedate=5 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Country Coverage Tunisia | first= |last= | work=Oxford Business Report | year= 2006| url=http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/country/Tunisia |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010-2011 Global Competitiveness Report (Davos World Economic Forum) ranked Tunisia first in Africa and 32nd globally out of 139 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Global Competitiveness Index |first= |last= |work=Oxford Business Report |date=2010 |url=http://www.weforum.org/documents/GCR10/Full%20rankings.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922102308/http://www.weforum.org/documents/GCR10/Full%20rankings.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Tunisia continued to suffer from a high unemployment, especially among youth. Left out of the relative prosperity were many rural and urban poor, including small businesses facing the world market. This was the cause of [[2010–2011 Tunisian protests|mass protests in December 2010-January 2011]] - the worst unrest the country had faced for at least a decade.

====Diplomacy====
During Ben Ali's presidency, Tunisia pursued a moderate foreign policy promoting peaceful settlement of conflicts. Tunisia took a middle of the road approach contributing to peacemaking especially in the Middle East and Africa. Tunisia hosted the first-ever Palestinian American dialogue. While contributing actively to the Middle East peace process, Tunisian diplomacy supported the Palestinian cause. As host to the Palestine Liberation Organization from 1982–1993, considerable efforts were made to moderate the views of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tunisian Model | first=Jerry | last=Sorkin | work=Middle East Quarterly | date=Fall 2001  | url=http://www.meforum.org/107/the-tunisian-model |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunisia has, since the early 90's, called for a "concerted" international effort against terrorism. It has also been a key US partner in the effort to fight global terrorism through the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Report: Tunisia 2007: Country Profile | first= |last= | work=Oxford Business Group | year=2007 |url=http://www.meforum.org/107/the-tunisian-model |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Ben Ali mostly retained his predecessor's pro-western foreign policy, though he improved ties with the Arab-Moslem world. He took several initiatives to promote solidarity, dialogue and cooperation among nations, initiating the United Nations World Solidarity Fund to eradicate poverty and promote social development based on the successful experience of the Tunisian National Solidarity Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=ECOSOC Endorses Decision to Establish World Solidarity Fund to Eradicate Poverty and Promote Social Development  | first= |last= | work=United Nations | date=7 November 2003 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/ecosoc6072.doc.htm |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ali also played a lead role in the UN's proclaiming 2010 as the International Year of Youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Address by Mr. Samir Labidi | first=Samir |last=Labidi | work=United Nations | year=2008 |url=http://social.un.org/youthyear/docs/Labidi-Tunisian-Minister.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Loss of power ====
Starting in December 2010, Tunisian citizens began mass protesting against unemployment and Ben Ali's corruption. As mass protests grew, Ben Ali declared a [[state of emergency]] in the country, dissolved the government on 14 January 2011 and promised new legislative elections within six months. Later on that same day Prime Minister [[Mohammed Ghannouchi]] went on state television to say he was assuming power in Tunisia and said that the President had left the country. Ben Ali fled the country on 14 January at 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm local time on a flight bound for [[Dubai]] and arrived in [[Saudi Arabia]] early on Saturday 15 January, where he was welcomed by Saudi authorities. The protests became known as the [[Tunisian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="BBC_BenAli_forcedout"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |pages= |title=Tunisia: President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali forced out |date=14 January 2011 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025 |accessdate=15 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vkC6mFEY?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12195025 |archivedate=15 January 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tunisian leader flees amid protests, PM takes over |first=Elaine |last=Ganley |first2=Angela |last2=Charlton |first3=Jamey |last3=Keaten |first4=Hadeel |last4=Al-Shalchi |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/tunisian-pm-assumes-power-802911.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |issn=1539-7459 |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New World Trade Center}}
The '''International Freedom Center''' ('''IFC''') was a proposed museum to be located adjacent to the site of [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] at the former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], [[United States|USA]].   It was selected in 2004 to comprise a "cultural space" near to the memorial for victims of the [[September 11 attacks]], called [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum|Reflecting Absence]].

However, opponents reacted against the IFC's mission, saying that plans to promote international freedom through exhibits and displays about various [[genocides]] and crimes against humanity through history, including genocide of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and the [[slave trade]] in the United States, were inappropriate at a site that many people consider to be [[sacred]].  On September 28, 2005, New York Governor [[George E. Pataki]] barred the IFC from the World Trade Center site."&lt;ref name="pataki"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/nyregion/29freedom.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=521d88e7aaf4966b&amp;ex=1285646400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Governor Bars Freedom Center at Ground Zero |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-09-29|last=Dunlap|first=David|accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Soros]], Tom Bernstein, [[Anthony Romero]], and [[Eric Foner]] were promoters of the IFC.  Within an hour of being barred from the WTC site, the IFC museum declared itself to be out of business, making no effort to find a new location. "We do not believe there is a viable alternative place for the I.F.C. at the World Trade Center site," said the statement from the center's executives, Tom Bernstein, [[Peter Kunhardt]] and [[Richard Tofel]]. "We consider our work, therefore, to have been brought to an end."&lt;ref name="pataki"/&gt;

==Complaints and defense==
The IFC proposal had received complaints from some families of September 11 victims. In August 2005, officials stated that the Center would have been required to respond to objections raised by victims' families before it was approved to go forward. Many relatives of 9/11 victims had denounced the International Freedom Center plan as an insult to the 2,749 people who died at the WTC, because it would paint them as a little more than a footnote to the world's march toward freedom. The families, police, and firefighters said that the IFC's plan to use hallowed land at Ground Zero to highlight poverty as a barrier to freedom diminishes the events of 9/11. It has also been disparagingly compared to comedian and political commentator [[Bill Maher]]'s suggestion immediately after 9/11 that reconstruction should include a "Why They Hate Us Pavilion."

A non-profit organization called [[Take Back The Memorial]] was started by blogger Robert Shurbet and 9/11 family member [[Debra Burlingame]], to block the International Freedom Center from being located on the WTC site.&lt;ref name="Take Back The Memorial"&gt;[http://takebackthememorial.org/ Take Back The Memorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050923110947/http://takebackthememorial.org/ |date=2005-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group protested any linkage between what occurred on 9/11 with [[political activism]]&lt;ref name="Take Back The Memorial" /&gt; or with any previous historical event that could contextualize the attack.

[[Jeff Jarvis]], a journalist and 9/11 survivor, noted that the IFC's proponents stated they "will tangibly link September 11 and the lives of its victims to humanity's greatest idea: freedom", but objected:

{{quote|But what is that link? Nothing about September 11 was about liberating people. The people who were killed that day were free. They were not struggling to be free. The murderers, too, were free and exploited that freedom to commit this act. Of course, I support the celebration of freedom; who but a tyrant or a terrorist would not? But the struggle here is not against or for freedom. The struggle here is for civilization against extremism, fanaticism, and criminality. So make your center, elsewhere, about terrorism, then. Have your seminars and events and debates about extremism. Study religious fanaticism. This actually is not about freedom.}}

The ''[[New York Times]]'', in an editorial, criticized the protests against the IFC, arguing that the IFC's opponents had made trivial and unconvincing suggestions that both the IFC and the "cultural component" of architect [[Daniel Libeskind]]'s plans would somehow diminish the scope of the Memorial Museum: "To argue over the size of these two spaces is to assume that emotional power is solely the result of square footage. It is also to forget the profound effect that going to the roots of the World Trade Center will have on most visitors."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/opinion/29fri3.html?ex=1280289600&amp;en=2486a5d058f90310&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |work=The New York Times |title=A Sense of Proportion at Ground Zero |date=July 29, 2005 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' concluded that beneath the superficial arguments and their irrational implications lay an even more disturbing motivation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But this is not really a campaign about money or space. It is a campaign about political purity—about how people remember 9/11 and about how we choose to read its aftermath, including the [[Iraq War]]. On their Web site ... critics of the cultural plan at ground zero offer a resolution called Campaign America. It says that ground zero must contain no facilities "that house controversial debate, dialogue, artistic impressions, or exhibits referring to extraneous historical events." This, to us, sounds un-American.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political opposition==
[[New York State]] politicians were either hostile to or only offering conditional support to the IFC. "I cannot support the IFC," [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] declared on September 23, 2005 in response to an inquiry from ''The [[New York Post]]''. "While I want to ensure that development and rebuilding in lower Manhattan move forward expeditiously, I am troubled by the serious concerns family members and first responders have expressed to me," Senator Clinton said, going on to say that, "The [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] has authority over the site and I do not believe we can move forward until it heeds and addresses their concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Kieran |last1=Crowley |date=November 4, 2005 |title=Seaman 'Slay' Threat |newspaper=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/53950.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210234153/http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/53950.htm |archive-date=10 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2015}}

Clinton spoke out the day after the IFC released a plan intended to save its spot at the site, but it was met with immediate opposition from 9/11 families. Clinton would not support any plan unless the families and first responders back it, said her spokesman, Philippe Reines.

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[U.S. House of Representatives|Congressmen]] [[John E. Sweeney|John Sweeney]] ([[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]]), [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] ([[Long Island, New York|Long Island]]) and [[Vito Fossella]] ([[Staten Island, New York|Staten Island]])—were challenging the IFC as a "blame America first" project.

Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] (D-N.Y.) also voiced concern at the same time as Sen. Clinton and had called for a compromise—although he didn't state flat-out opposition to the IFC. "There's got to be a way to meet the families' sincere and real needs and build a center that honors the freedom that the victims died for. We hope that the LMDC will find some common ground quickly," Schumer said.

Former New York State Republican [[Governor]] [[George Pataki]]—who wielded strong influence over the LMDC—had said that he would not support any plan that offers a forum for [[anti-Americanism]]. On September 28, 2005, Governor Pataki barred the IFC from the World Trade Center site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/nyregion/28cnd-freedom.html?hp&amp;ex=1127966400&amp;en=8c05e53d9bc70657&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage |title=Pataki Bars Museum From World Trade Center Memorial Site |work=New York Times |author=David W. Dunlap |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood of the IFC being built elsewhere is extremely low and the project is considered over at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/28/AR2005092801849.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914150858/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/28/AR2005092801849.html |archivedate=2012-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Janez Janez Švajncer''' (shortened '''Janez J. Švajncer''') (born 3 July 1948) is a Slovenian retired [[brigadier]], historian, lawyer, [[museologist]], writer, editor and a [[veteran]] of the [[Ten-Day War]]. He is an author of several volumes and articles on [[military history]], and is one of the most renowned Slovenian militar historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osebneznamke.org/zanimivosti/janez-j-%C5%A1vajncer-general---v-pokoju.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907143359/http://www.osebneznamke.org/zanimivosti/janez-j-%C5%A1vajncer-general---v-pokoju.aspx |archivedate=7 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Švajncer was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]], now [[Slovenia]]. In 1967 he graduated from a [[grammar school]] in [[Maribor]]. Three years later he took a degree in a law school and after that he enrolled the [[Legal education|Faculty of law]] in [[Ljubljana]].

Between December 1990 and June 1991, he helped in the reorganization of the [[Slovenian Territorial Defence]] into a proper [[Slovenian Army]]. He participated in the [[Ten Day War]] against the invasion of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]]. Between 1991 and 1992, he was head of the Department for Patriotic Education of the Headquarters of the Slovenian Army; between 1992 and 1994, he served as vice-secretary of the Ministry of Defence and director of the Office for Military Affairs within the Ministry. After the dismissal of Defence Minister [[Janez Janša]] in 1994, Janez Švajncer was dismissed from office and retired in 1996.

Švajncer is author of numerous volumes of military history, both Slovenian and widely European. He is also author of several novels and children books.

'''John Sholto Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry''' (20 July 1844{{spaced ndash}}31 January 1900) was a Scottish nobleman, remembered for his atheism, his outspoken views, his brutish manner, for lending his name to the "[[Queensberry Rules]]" that form the basis of modern [[boxing]], and for his role in the downfall of author and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]].

==Biography==
John Douglas was born in [[Florence]], Italy, the eldest son of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|Archibald, Viscount Drumlanrig]], and [[Caroline Douglas|Caroline Margaret Clayton]]. He had three brothers, [[Lord Francis Douglas|Francis]], [[Lord Archibald Edward Douglas|Archibald]], and James, and two sisters, Gertrude and [[Florence Dixie|Florence]]. He was briefly styled Viscount Drumlanrig following his father's succession in 1856, and on the latter's death in 1858 he inherited the [[Marquess of Queensberry|Marquessate of Queensberry]]. The 9th Marquess was educated in the training ships ''Illustrious'' and ''Britannia'' at [[Portsmouth]], and served in the [[Royal Navy]] until resigning in 1864.{{sfn|Cokayne|Doubleday|Howard de Walden|1945|p=706}} He was Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 1st Dumfriesshire Rifle Volunteers from 1869 to 1871.{{sfn|Kelly's Handbook|1899|p=1078}}

In 1864, Lord Queensberry entered [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], which he left two years later without taking a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=QNSY864JS|name=Queensberry, John Sholto (Douglas), Marquess of}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was more distinguished in sport, playing college cricket as well as running, hunting, and steeplechasing.{{sfn|Davis|2004}}
He married Sibyl Montgomery in 1866. They had four sons and a daughter; his wife successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Queensberry Divorce Case|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=24 January 1887|p= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She survived him to the age of 90, dying in 1935.{{sfn|Cokayne|Doubleday|Howard de Walden|1945|p=706}} Queensberry married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.

[[File:Douglas family of Kinmount Mausoleum, Cummertrees, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The Douglas Mausoleum outside [[Cummertrees]] Parish Church in [[Dumfries and Galloway]], traditional burial place of the Marquesses of Queensberry]]
Queensberry sold the family seat of [[Kinmount House|Kinmount]] in [[Dumfriesshire]], Scotland, an action which further alienated him from his family.

He died, two months after a stroke, and after a period of mental decline believed to be caused by [[syphilis]], in his club room in Welbeck Street, west London,{{sfn|Davis|2004}} aged 55, nearly a year before Oscar Wilde's death. He wrote a poem starting with the words "When I am dead cremate me."  After cremation at [[Woking Crematorium]], his ashes were buried at Kinmount{{sfn|Cokayne|Doubleday|Howard de Walden|1945|p=706}}{{sfn|Davis|2004}} in the Douglas Mausoleum outside [[Cummertrees]] Parish Church.

His eldest son and [[heir apparent]] was [[Francis Archibald Douglas, 1st Baron Kelhead|Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig]], who was rumoured to have been engaged in a homosexual relationship with the Liberal Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|The 5th Earl of Rosebery]]. Lord Drumlanrig died from a gunshot wound, unmarried and without children.

Douglas' second son, [[Percy Douglas, 10th Marquess of Queensberry|Lord Percy Douglas]] (1868–1920), succeeded to the peerage instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper= [[New York Times]]|date=3 August 1920|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109222538/http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07EFD61131E433A25750C0A96E9C946195D6CF|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E07EFD61131E433A25750C0A96E9C946195D6CF |archive-date=2012-11-09|title=Ninth Queensberry dies in Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Alfred Douglas|Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas]], the third son, was the close friend and lover of the famous author and poet Oscar Wilde. Queensberry's efforts to end that relationship led to his famous dispute with Wilde.

==Contributions to sports==
Queensberry was a patron of sport and a noted boxing enthusiast.  In 1866 he was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Club, now the [[Amateur Athletic Association of England]], one of the first groups that did not require amateur athletes to belong to the upper-classes to compete.  The following year the Club published a set of twelve rules for conducting boxing matches.  The rules had been drawn up by [[John Graham Chambers]] but appeared under Queensberry's sponsorship and are universally known as the "[[Queensberry Rules]]".{{sfn|Harris|2008|p=182}} These rules were eventually to govern the sport worldwide.

A keen rider, Queensberry was also active in [[fox hunting]] and owned several successful race horses. As a rider his first winner was in the Dumfriesshire Hunt Club chase in 1865, and his last was at [[Sandown Park]] in 1883.  He was Master of the Worcester Fox Hounds in 1870.  He was on the committee of the National Hunt but never won a [[Grand National]] as a rider, a last-minute substitution on the victorious "Old Joe" keeping him out of the 1886 National.  During his riding career he recovered from a series of serious injuries.{{sfn|Davis|2004}}

==Political career==
[[File:Marquess of Queensberry 10 November 1877.jpg|thumb|1877 caricature of Queensberry in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']].]]
In 1872, Queensberry was chosen by the Peers of Scotland to sit in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[representative peer]].  He served as such until 1880, when he was again nominated but refused to take the religious oath of allegiance to the Sovereign.  Viewed by some as an outspoken atheist,{{sfn|Dowling|1994|p=141}} he declared that he would not participate in any "Christian tomfoolery" and that his word should suffice.  As a consequence neither he nor [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who had also refused to take the oath after being elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], were allowed to take their seats in parliament.  This prompted an apology from the new Prime Minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]].  Bradlaugh was re-elected four times by the constituents of [[Northampton]] until he was finally allowed to take his seat in 1886. Queensberry, however, was never again sent to parliament by the Scottish nobles.

In 1881, Queensberry accepted the presidency of the [[British Secular Union]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} a group that had broken away in 1877 from Bradlaugh's [[National Secular Society]].  That year he published a long philosophical poem, ''The Spirit of the [[Matterhorn]]'', which he had written in [[Zermatt]] in 1873 in an attempt to articulate his secularist views.  In 1882, he was ejected from the theatre after loudly interrupting a performance of the play ''The Promise of May'' by [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], the [[Poet Laureate]], because it included a villainous atheist in its cast of characters.  Under the auspices of the British Secular Union, Queensberry wrote a pamphlet entitled ''The Religion of Secularism and the Perfectibility of Man''.  The Union, always small, ceased to function in 1884.

His divorces, brutality, atheism, and association with the boxing world made Queensberry an unpopular figure in London high society. In 1893 his eldest son Francis was made a baron, thus giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Queensberry resented his son sitting in a chamber that had refused to admit him, leading to a bitter dispute between himself and both his son and the Earl of Rosebery, who had promoted Francis' ennoblement and who shortly thereafter became Prime Minister. Francis was killed in a shooting accident in 1894; the inquest returned an "accidental death" verdict,{{sfn|Cokayne|Doubleday|Howard de Walden|1945|p=707}} but his death may have been a suicide. Queensberry believed, as he put it in a letter, that "snob queers like Rosebery" had corrupted his sons, and held Rosebery responsible for Francis's death.(John Queensberry to Alfred Montgomery, 1 November 1894 quoted in {{harvnb|Murray|2000|}})

==Dispute with Oscar Wilde==
[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|325px|The card which was the basis of the lawsuit.]]
{{main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1= Wilde vs Queensberry}}

In February 1895, angered by the apparent ongoing homosexual relationship between Oscar Wilde and his son [[Lord Alfred Douglas|Alfred]], Queensberry left a calling card reading "For Oscar Wilde, posing as {{sic|Som|domite|expected="Sodomite"}}" at Wilde's club.{{sfn|Holland|2004|p=300}} Wilde sued for [[criminal libel]], leading to Queensberry's arrest.

Queensberry's lawyers, headed by barrister [[Edward Carson]], portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who seduced innocent young boys into a life of degenerate homosexuality. Wilde dropped the libel case when Queensberry's lawyers informed the court that they intended to call several male prostitutes as witnesses to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. According to the [[Libel Act 1843]], proving the truth of the accusation and a public interest in its exposure was a defence against a libel charge, and Wilde's lawyers concluded that the prostitutes' testimony was likely to do that. Queensberry won a counterclaim against Wilde for the considerable expenses he had incurred on lawyers and private detectives in organising his defence. Wilde was left bankrupt; his assets were seized and sold at auction to pay the claim.

Queensberry then sent the evidence collected by his detectives to Scotland Yard, which resulted in Wilde being charged and convicted of [[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]] under the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]] and sentenced to two years' hard labour. His health and reputation destroyed, Wilde went into exile in France.

Queensberry died on 31 January 1900. Ten months later, Oscar Wilde died at the Hotel d'Alsace in Paris.

==Screen portrayals==
Queensberry has been portrayed by a number of actors in later dramatisations of the Wilde-Alfred Douglas affair, notably:
*[[Edward Chapman (actor)|Edward Chapman]] in [[20th Century Fox]] movie ''[[Oscar Wilde (film)|Oscar Wilde]]'' (1960).
*[[Lionel Jeffries]] in [[United Artists]] movie ''[[The Trials of Oscar Wilde]]'' (1960)
*[[Keith Richards]] in promotional film for the [[Rolling Stones]] song, ''[[We Love You]]'' (1967)
*[[Tom Wilkinson]] in [[biographical film]] ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]'' (1997).

An effeminately flamboyant caricature of him, voiced by [[Jim Rash]], is featured as a main character in the [[Adult Swim]] cartoon ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' in which he serves as a lifestyle coach to [[Mike Tyson]].

After being trained in and practicing psychiatry, Jaspers turned to philosophical inquiry and attempted to discover an innovative [[philosophical system]]. He was often viewed as a major exponent of [[existentialism]] in Germany, though he did not accept the label.

== Biography ==
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1910.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Karl Jaspers in 1910]]
Jaspers was born in [[Oldenburg]] in 1883 to a mother from a local farming community, and a [[jurist]] father. He showed an early interest in philosophy, but his father's experience with the legal system undoubtedly influenced his decision to study law at [[University of Heidelberg]]. It soon became clear that Jaspers did not particularly enjoy law, and he switched to studying [[medicine]] in 1902 with a thesis about criminology. In 1910 he married Gertrud Mayer (1879–1974), the sister of his close friends [[Gustav Mayer]] and Ernst Mayer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Jaspers earned his [[medical doctorate]] from [[University of Heidelberg]] [[medical school]] in 1908 and began work at a [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Heidelberg]] under [[Franz Nissl]], successor of [[Emil Kraepelin]] and [[Bonhoeffer family|Karl Bonhoeffer]], and Karl Wilmans. Jaspers became dissatisfied with the way the medical community of the time approached the study of [[mental illness]] and gave himself the task of improving the psychiatric approach. In 1913 Jaspers habilitated at the philosophical faculty of the [[Heidelberg University]] and gained there in 1914 a post as a [[psychology]] teacher. The post later became a permanent philosophical one, and Jaspers never returned to clinical practice. During this time Jaspers was a close friend of the Weber family ([[Max Weber]] also having held a professorship at Heidelberg).&lt;ref&gt;Radkau, Joachim (1995) ''Max Weber: A Biography''. Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745683423}}. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, at the age of 38, Jaspers turned from psychology to [[philosophy]], expanding on themes he had developed in his psychiatric works. He became a philosopher, in Germany and [[Europe]].

After the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Jaspers was considered to have a "Jewish taint" (''jüdische Versippung'', in the jargon of the time) due to his Jewish wife, and was forced to retire from teaching in 1937. In 1938 he fell under a publication ban as well. Many of his long-time friends stood by him, however, and he was able to continue his studies and research without being totally isolated. But he and his wife were under constant threat of removal to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] until 30 March 1945, when Heidelberg was liberated by American troops.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 1948 Jaspers moved to the [[University of Basel]] in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; He remained prominent in the philosophical community and became a naturalized citizen of Switzerland living in Basel until his death on his wife's 90th birthday in 1969.

== Contributions to psychiatry ==
Jaspers' dissatisfaction with the popular understanding of mental illness led him to question both the diagnostic criteria and the methods of clinical psychiatry. He published a paper in 1910 in which he addressed the problem of whether [[paranoia]] was an aspect of personality or the result of biological changes. Although it did not broach new ideas, this article introduced a rather unusual method of study, at least according to the norms then prevalent. Not unlike [[Freud]], Jaspers studied patients in detail, giving biographical information about the patients as well as notes on how the patients themselves felt about their symptoms. This has become known as the ''biographical method'' and now forms a mainstay of psychiatric and above all psychotherapeutic practice.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Jaspers, Karl 1913.jpg|thumb|left|Karl Jaspers: ''Allgemeine Psychopathologie'', first print 1913]]
Jaspers set down his views on mental illness in a book which he published in 1913, ''General Psychopathology''.&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers' central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of [[psychosis]]) by their ''form'' rather than by their ''content''. For example, in diagnosing a [[hallucination]], it is more important to note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them, than to note what the patient sees. What the patient sees is the "content", but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the "form".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Jaspers thought that psychiatrists could diagnose [[delusion]]s in the same way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based on the content of the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See [[delusion]] for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between ''primary'' and ''secondary delusions''. He defined primary delusions as ''autochthonous'', meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word ''autochthonous'' than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.

Jaspers considered primary delusions to be ultimately "un-understandable," since he believed no coherent reasoning process existed behind their formation. This view has caused some controversy, and the likes of [[R. D. Laing]] and [[Richard Bentall]] (1999, p.&amp;nbsp;133–135) have criticised it, stressing that this stance can lead therapists into the complacency of assuming that because they do not understand a patient, the patient is deluded and further investigation on the part of the therapist will have no effect. For instance Huub Engels (2009) argues that schizophrenic speech disorder may be understandable, just as [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s [[dream speech]] is understandable.

== Contributions to philosophy and theology ==
Most commentators associate Jaspers with the philosophy of [[existentialism]], in part because he draws largely upon the existentialist roots of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls ''Transcendence''. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls ''[[Dasein#Karl Jaspers' Dasein and Existenz|Existenz]]'', and can finally experience authentic existence.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Transcendence (paired with the term ''The Encompassing'' in later works) is, for Jaspers, that which exists beyond the world of time and space. Jaspers' formulation of Transcendence as ultimate non-objectivity (or no-thing-ness) has led many philosophers to argue that ultimately, Jaspers became a [[Monism|monist]], though Jaspers himself continually stressed the necessity of recognizing the validity of the concepts both of subjectivity and of objectivity.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Although he rejected explicit religious doctrines,&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; including the notion of a personal God, Jaspers influenced contemporary theology through his philosophy of transcendence and the limits of human experience. Mystic [[Christian]] traditions influenced Jaspers himself tremendously, particularly those of [[Meister Eckhart]] and of [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. He also took an active interest in Eastern philosophies, particularly [[Buddhism]], and developed the theory of an [[Axial Age]], a period of substantial philosophical and religious development. Jaspers also entered public debates with [[Rudolf Bultmann]], wherein Jaspers roundly criticized Bultmann's "[[demythologizing]]" of Christianity. (See ''Myth and Christianity: An Inquiry into the Possibility of Religion without Myth'' - a debate between Jaspers and Bultmann, The Noonday Press, New York, 1958){{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Jaspers wrote extensively on the threat to human freedom posed by modern science and modern economic and political institutions. During World War II, he had to abandon his teaching post because his wife was Jewish. After the war he resumed his teaching position, and in his work ''[[The Question of German Guilt]]'' he unabashedly examined the culpability of Germany as a whole in the atrocities of [[Hitler]]'s [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Celinscak|first=Mark|title=Distance from the Belsen Heap: Allied Forces and the Liberation of a Concentration Camp|year=2015|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-4426-1570-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following quote about the Second World War and its atrocities was used at the end of the sixth episode of the BBC documentary series ''[[The Nazis: A Warning from History]]'': "That which has happened is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible for it to happen again at any minute. Only in knowledge can it be prevented." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5968 |title=The Nazis: A Warning from History |last=Jones |first=Ian |work=Off the Telly |date=26 August 2000 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123215757/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/?p=5968 |archivedate=23 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaspers' major works, lengthy and detailed, can seem daunting in their complexity. His last great attempt at a systematic philosophy of Existenz — ''Von Der Wahrheit'' (On Truth) — has not yet appeared in English. However, he also wrote shorter works, most notably, ''Philosophy is for Everyman''. The two major proponents of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[hermeneutics]], namely [[Paul Ricoeur]] (a student of Jaspers) and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (Jaspers' successor at Heidelberg), both display Jaspers' influence in their works.&lt;ref name="SEP" /&gt;

== Political views ==
Jaspers identified with the liberal political philosophy of [[Max Weber]], although he rejected Weber's nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Schilpp |editor1-first=Paul Arthur |title=The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers |date=1977 |publisher=Open Court Publishing Company |pages=57-58}}&lt;/ref&gt; He valued [[humanism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]] and, influenced by [[Immanuel Kant]], advocated an international federation of states with shared constitutions, laws, and international courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=April |title=The Political Theory of Global Citizenship |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |pages=147-148}}&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly opposed [[totalitarian]] despotism and warned about the increasing tendency towards [[technocracy]], or a regime that regards humans as mere instruments of science or of ideological goals. He was also skeptical of [[majoritarian]] democracy. Thus, he supported a form of governance that guaranteed individual freedom and [[limited government]], and shared Weber's belief that democracy needed to be guided by an intellectual elite.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ Karl Jaspers]. [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Jaspers held Kierkegaard and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] to be two of the most important figures in post-Kantian philosophy. In his compilation, ''The Great Philosophers'' (''Die großen Philosophen''), he wrote: "I approach the presentation of Kierkegaard with some trepidation. Next to Nietzsche, or rather, prior to Nietzsche, I consider him to be the most important thinker of our post-Kantian age. With [[Goethe]] and [[Hegel]], an epoch had reached its conclusion, and our prevalent way of thinking – that is, the [[positivistic]], natural-scientific one – cannot really be considered as philosophy."{{cite quote|date=November 2017}} Jaspers also questions whether the two philosophers could be taught. For Kierkegaard, at least, Jaspers felt that Kierkegaard's whole method of [[Søren Kierkegaard#Authorship (1847–1855)|indirect communication]] precludes any attempts to properly expound his thought into any sort of systematic teaching.

Though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he also owes much to more traditional philosophers, especially Kant and Plato. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] argues in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism'' that, though Jaspers was certainly indebted to Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, he was closest to Kant's philosophy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jaspers is too often seen as the heir of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard to whom he is in many ways less close than to Kant ... the Kantian antinomies and Kant's concern with the realm of decision, freedom, and faith have become exemplary for Jaspers. And even as Kant "had to do away with knowledge to make room for faith," Jaspers values Nietzsche in large measure because he thinks that Nietzsche did away with knowledge, thus making room for Jaspers' "philosophic faith" ...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter A. (1980) ''From Shakespeare To Existentialism: An Original Study'', Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691013675}}. p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is supported{{according to whom|date=November 2017}} by Jaspers' essay "On My Philosophy": "While I was still at school [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] was the first. Kant then became the philosopher for me and has remained so...Nietzsche gained importance for me only late as the magnificent revelation of nihilism and the task of overcoming it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/jaspers.htm |last= Jaspers |first=Karl |title= On My Philosophy |date= 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Konstantin Josef Jireček'''{{efn|{{lang-bg|Константин Иречек}}}} (24 July 1854 {{ndash}} 10 January 1918) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Czechs|Czech]] historian, politician, diplomat, and [[Slavist]]. He was the founder of Bohemian [[Balkanology]] (or Balkan Studies) and [[Byzantine studies]], and wrote extensively on Bulgarian and Serbian history. Jireček was also a minister in the government of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] for a couple of years.

==Life==
Jireček was the son of Czech historian [[Josef Jireček]] (1825–1888) and Božena, a daughter of Slovak philologist [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]] (1795–1861). His family was deeply involved in [[Slavistics]].

Jireček was brought up in Vienna and enrolled in the 1864–72 period at [[Theresianum]], a prestigious [[Gymnasium (school)|preparatory school]] in Vienna.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} During his education, he became very interested in and studied several foreign languages (French, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Italian, Russian, English, Hungarian, Turkish and Greek).{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} In 1872 he became a student at the Philological Faculty at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], where he studied history and modern philology.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} At this time, his nearest friends included French historian [[Ernest Denis]] (1849–1921) and the sons of Bulgarian theatre director and actor Krastyo Pishurka.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} In 1874 he took a study trip to [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] and [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]], after which he published several essays on the history and traditions of the [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] countries.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}}

In 1876 he had his first book published, the ''History of the Bulgarians'', a historiographical work spanning the medieval Bulgarian state foundation to the Ottoman conquest, which attracted great attention to the 22-year-old historian.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} This was due to the European public's interest in the [[April Uprising]] of the Bulgarian people, a people little known in Europe at the time.{{sfn|Stadtmüller|1976|pp=409–410}} For his [[dissertation]] on the history of the Bulgarians, Jireček was awarded the title of doctor in philosophy in 1876. In 1877, his [[habilitation]] work was divided between [[Constantinople]] and [[Belgrade]] (Serbia).

After the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], which saw the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state, he helped construct the administration, school system and economy in the newly founded [[Principality of Bulgaria]]. In 1879 he was employed by the Bulgarian government, and from May to July 1881 he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, then until 1882 as Minister of Science. In 1884, he was appointed director of the [[National Library in Sofia]]. During his stay, he devoted himself to research in Balkanology and Byzantine Studies. He published his results in numerous studies and monographs.

From 1884 to 1893 he taught universal history as a full professor at the [[Charles University in Prague]]. After that, he was a professor of Slavic philology at the [[University of Vienna]] until his death in 1918. [[Carl Patsch]] succeeded the office at Vienna.

==Work==
The bulk of Jireček's writings deal with the history of the [[South Slavs]] and their literature. They notably include a ''History of the [[Bulgarians]]'' (Czech and German, 1876), ''History of [[Serb]]s'', ''The Principality of Bulgaria'' (1891), ''Travels in Bulgaria'' (Czech, 1888), etc. He mostly wrote in German.

{{Ancient history}}

[[Classical Antiquity]] is a period in the history of the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] and  [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], extending roughly from the 8th century BC to the 6th century AD.
It is conventionally taken to begin with the earliest-recorded [[Epic Greek|Greek]] poetry of [[Homer]] (8th–7th century&amp;nbsp;BC), and continues through the [[Origins of Christianity|emergence of Christianity]] and the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] in the 5th to 6th centuries, the period during which [[Late Antiquity]] blends into the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" or [[Early Middle Ages]].

The geographic scope of Classical Antiquity may be taken to extend to Central Asia and northern India due to the far-reaching influence of Greek culture during the [[Hellenistic period]] (late 4th to 2nd centuries BC),
but the historiographies of other world regions have their own notion of "classicity" which do not fall within the scope of this list.

[[File:Señor de la Capilla, Tequixquiac (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Señor de la Capilla]]

The '''Lord of the Chapel''', (in Spanish as ''Señor de la Capilla'' and [[Otomi language|Otomi]] as ''Zidada Nikjä''), is a statue of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] from [[Santiago Apóstol Parish (Tequixquiac)|Saint James Apostle parish]] in [[Santiago Tequixquiac]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM15mexico/municipios/15096a.html] Tequixquiac, INADEP.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by illness and epidemics with Indigenous people. It became the [[patron saint]] of Santiago Tequixquiac, and is one of the most well-known images in Mexico State. It was probably created in Actopan ex-monastery by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The author is unknown and belongs to the Spanish colonial period.

The Christ image dates from the first half of the seventeenth century and measures 1.73 meters high. There is a strong relationship with Cryptojudaism because in this town its first Iberian inhabitants were Sephardic converts to Christianity arrived with [[Hernán Cortés]]; in the face of the image are very obvious a Rabbinical signs, one of them are [[payot]]s or cailers in the hair.

== History ==
[[File:Señor de la Capilla por las calles de Tequixquiac.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Procession by [[Santiago Tequixquiac]]]]
During the Spanish colonial period, several Christs, carved with cane paste, were sculpted; it was an indigenous sculptural tradition that prevailed in New Spain when constructing lighter religious images; These Christs were in various parishes of the region, one in El Arenal, Actopan (Lord of the Wonders), anothers in the village of Visitación (Lord of Tlapala), in Amecameca (Lord of the Sacromonte) and other in Chalma (Lord of Chalma). This image was inside a chapel in Saint Francis parish, in the town of Apaxco that later the image was moved to the people from Tequixquiac until our days.

== Description ==
The image has a cross made of walnut and details of ivory called tablets that were brought from the Philippines.

'''Abū ʿAbdallāh Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad ibn Yūsuf al-Kātib al-Khwārizmī''',&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; also referred to as '''al-Balkhī''', was a 10th-century [[Persian people|Persian]] encyclopedist and the author of the early encyclopedia ''[[Mafātīḥ al-ʿulūm]]'' (“Key to the Sciences”) in the [[Arabic language]].

[[Gerlof van Vloten]], the editor of ''Mafātīḥ al-ʿulūm'' 1895 publication in [[Leiden]], mentions in a preface to ''Mafātīḥ al-ʿulūm'' that nothing is known about al-Khwārizmī except his name and that he is also known as al-Balkhi, but [[Hossein Khadiv Jam]], the Persian translator of ''Mafātīḥ al-ʿulūm'' mentions that after a lot of searches he has found that al-Khwārizmī "was born in [[Balkh]], lived in [[Nishapur]], worked as a clerk in the [[Samanid]] court for a while, and has authored the book ''Mafātīḥ al-ʿulūm'', one of the oldest Islamic encyclopedias, at the request of [[Abul-Hossein Atba]], a vizier of [[Nuh II of Samanid|Nuh II]], in the Arabic language."

'''''Muñagorriren bertsoak''''' ('''''The Muñagorri bertsos''''')  were a set of written ''[[bertsolaritza|bertsos]]''&amp;mdash;extemporaneous poems in [[Basque language|Basque]]&amp;mdash;fashioned and released in [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]] during 1838 on the last stage of the [[First Carlist War]] in Spain. The First Carlist War saw the publication of bertso leaflets promoting one faction or another, with some of them reaching wide circulation and influence in public opinion across Basque language areas, the main [[Carlism|Carlist]] stronghold.

''The Muñagorri bertsos'' were issued by José Antonio Muñagorri's faction with a view to encouraging a split with [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos de Borbón]] and an end to war, in exchange for keeping a reduced version of [[History of the Basque people#Under the nation-states|home rule in the Basque Country]]&amp;mdash;"Peace and Fueros." Muñagorri's influence on the ground was small, but his talks with Liberals in Madrid paved the way to the [[Embrace of Vergara|Embrace of Bergara]] (1839).

While the whole version extends longer, the reduced, most widely known version is made up of six paragraphs, and popularized in modern times by singer-songwriter [[Benito Lertxundi]].

'''Patrick James Honey''' (16 December 1922 – 17 August 2005) was an Irish-born [[Vietnamese language]] scholar and historian.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Honey was born in Navan, [[County Meath]], Ireland. He went to Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School in London before entering [[Birkbeck, University of London]] in 1940 to read [[Classics]]. In 1941 he enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]], seeing active service on the [[Atlantic]] convoys, on the Russian convoys, in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], and finally the Far East. In 1945, when the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] surrendered in [[Saigon]], the young lieutenant was sent with a small British force under General [[Douglas Gracey]] to maintain civil order in Saigon. This was Honey's first encounter with Vietnamese culture. Also in 1945, he married Frances Watson (who died in 1986) and had one son and two daughters with her.  In 1946, after being demobilised, he resumed his studies in London, and graduated in Classics from [[University College London]] in 1949.

===Career===
In 1949, Honey was recruited to take up the Vietnamese language, which was considered very difficult, requiring a special aptitude from classics graduates to master. Honey was persuaded by the 1947 Scarbrough Report, which drew attention both to the importance that increasing contacts between countries would assume after the [[Second World War]] and to the serious lack of expertise across Oriental and African languages that the war had revealed. He was trained under [[J. R. Firth]]. From 1949 to 1965 he served as the first Lecturer in Annamese at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]].

After 16 months of preliminary training, he was sent to Vietnam for his first year of long study. In 1951 Honey arrived at Saigon, when the guerrilla war led by the [[Vietminh]] against the French was increased. With a lot of difficulties and at considerable risk, Honey was able to make it to Hanoi to conduct his research and study the local language. This period was very valuable, since in 1954, the [[Geneva Agreements]] partitioned the country into two-halves, and [[North Vietnam]] was not accessible for a long time.

During this time, Honey also earned a BA degree in Chinese.  He became a valuable source of knowledge about Southeast Asia and its cultures, [[language]]s, and politics. Many students from Australia and from the United States came to study with him. The [[British Foreign Office]] sought his advice about Vietnam.

Also seeking his wisdom was the US Government. On 26 September 1963, in [[Saigon, Vietnam]], at the invitation of the 5th US Ambassador to the State of Vietnam, [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], P.J. Honey briefed the 8th US Secretary of Defense, [[Robert S. McNamara]]. Introduced to McNamara by Lodge as ''Professor Smith'' from an American University, P.J. Honey's influence upon McNamara can be seen throughout McNamara's report on his encounter with Honey; an aide to McNamara – [[William P. Bundy]] – later reported that he thought that "Smith's" testimony had carried "considerable weight with McNamara" (See footnote 2).&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v04/d150&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a condensed version of what McNamara wrote after his briefing by P.J. Honey:

"2. (Ngo Dinh) Diem has aged terribly since 1960. He is slow mentally. ...

4. (Ngo Dinh) Diem would not last 24 hours without (Ngo Dinh) Nhu who handles the bribes and manipulates the power base necessary for his survival. ...

8. ... Only a military coup or an assassination will be effective and one or the other is likely to occur soon. In such circumstances we have a 50% chance of getting something better. ...

14. The American government cannot do anything other than to either publicly support (Ngo Dinh) Diem or keep our mouths shut. If we follow the latter policy, a coup will probably take place within four weeks."&lt;ref&gt;https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v04/d150&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the sixth week after this report was written, both [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] and [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] are dead.

In 1964 [[Cornell University]] invited P.J. Honey as a visiting professor. In 1965 Honey was promoted to Reader in Vietnamese Studies in the [[University of London]], a post he held until 1985. After 1975, when Saigon fell, as the [[boat people]] flooded the outside world, his language skills were called upon to brief both officials and refugees from Vietnam. From 1982 to 1985 he was head of the Department of South-East Asia, after which he retired and moved to Devon.

In 1991 he remarried, wedding Isabelle Boyer.

==Published works==
From the 1950s Honey wrote many articles about Vietnamese language, history, and politics. His major research interest was the [[communist regime]] in [[North Vietnam]]. His books included:
*Introduction to [[Hoàng Văn Chí]]'s ''From Colonialism to Communism''. 1962
*''Communism in North Vietnam: Its Role in the Sino-Soviet Dispute''. Hardcover, Greenwood Press, 1963. {{ISBN|0-8371-6791-4}} (0-8371-6791-4)
*''Genesis of a Tragedy: The Historical Background to the [[Vietnam War]]''. Hardcover, Benn, 1968. {{ISBN|0-510-27305-X}} (0-510-27305-X)
*''Voyage to [[Tonking]] in the Year At-Hoi : P. J. B. [[Truong-Vinh-Ky]]''. Softcover, 1982. {{ISBN|0-7286-0099-4}} (0-7286-0099-4)

The pacification resulted in mass deaths of the indigenous people in [[Cyrenaica]]. One quarter of Cyrenaica's population of 225,000 people died during the conflict.&lt;ref name= Mann309/&gt; Italy committed major [[war crime]]s during the conflict, including the use of [[chemical weapon]]s, episodes of [[Take no prisoners|refusing to take prisoners of war]] instead executing surrendering combatants, and mass executions of civilians.&lt;ref name="Duggan497"/&gt; Italian authorities committed a possible [[ethnic cleansing]] by forcibly expelling 100,000 [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Cyrenaicans, half the population of Cyrenaica, from their settlements that were slated to be given to Italian settlers.&lt;ref name="Cardoza, 109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloxham, Moses, 358" &gt;{{Cite book

In 2008, an agreement of compensation for damages caused by Italian colonial rule was signed between [[Italy]] and [[Libya]]. [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan ruler at the time]], attended the signing ceremony of the document wearing a historical photograph on his uniform that shows Cyrenaican rebel leader Omar Mukhtar in chains after being captured by Italian authorities during the Pacification. At the signing ceremony of the document, [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] declared: "In this historic document, Italy apologizes for its killing, destruction and repression of the Libyan people during the period of colonial rule." He went on to say that this was a "complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Background==
Italy had seized military control over Libya from the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1912, but the new colony swiftly revolted and transferred large areas of land to Libyan local rule.&lt;ref name="Wright, 30" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflict between Italy and the [[Senussi]]s {{ndash}} a Muslim political-religious [[tariqa]] based in Libya {{ndash}} erupted into major violence during [[World War I]] when the Senussis in Libya collaborated with the Ottomans against Italian troops. The Libyan Senussis also escalated the conflict with attacks on British forces in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Ian F. W. Beckett. The Great War: 1914-1918. Routledge, 2013. P188.&lt;/ref&gt; Warfare between the British and the Senussis continued until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Gilbert. Encyclopedia of Warfare: From the Earliest Times to the Present Day. Routledge, 2000. P221.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917 an exhausted Italy signed the [[Treaty of Acroma]] that acknowledged the effective independence of Libya from Italian control.&lt;ref name=EPage&gt;Melvin E. Page. Colonialism. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2003. P749.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Tripolitanian rebels founded the [[Tripolitanian Republic]], though the rest of the country remained under nominal Italian rule.&lt;ref name=EPage/&gt; Local agitation against Italy continued, such that by 1920 the Italian government was forced to recognise Senussi leader [[Idris of Libya|Sayid Idris]] as Emir of Cyrenaica and grant him autonomy.&lt;ref name=EPage/&gt; In 1922 Tripolitanian leaders offered Idris the position of Emir of Tripolitania.&lt;ref name=EPage/&gt; However before Idris was able to accept the position, the new Italian government of [[Benito Mussolini]] initiated a campaign of reconquest.&lt;ref name=EPage/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wright, 33" &gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1983|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1911 claims of massacres of Italian soldiers and Italian civilians by the Turkish and by local Moslem troops were made, such as a massacre in [[Shar al-Shatt|Sciara Sciat]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=r9P1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37 Italo-turkish war: Sciara Sciat and the massacre of Italians]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{Quote|''I saw (in Sciara Sciat) in one mosque seventeen Italian crucifixed with their bodies reduced to the status of bloody rags and bones, but whose faces still retain traces of hellish agony. It has passed through the neck of these wretched a long barrel and arms resting on this rod. They were then nailed to the wall and died for a slow fire between untold suffering. It is impossible for us to paint the picture of these hideous rotted meat hanging pitifully on the bloody wall. In a corner another body is crucified, but as an officer he was to have refined his sufferings. The eyes are stitched. All the bodies were mutilated and castrated; so indescribable was the scene and the bodies appeared swollen as shapeless carrion. But that's not all! In the cemetery of Chui which served as a refuge from the Turks and whence pulled from afar we could see another show. Under the same door in front of the Italian trenches five soldiers had been buried up to their shoulders, their heads emerged from the black sand stained of their blood: heads horrible to see, and there you could read all the tortures of hunger and thirst (Gaston Leroud and the correspondent of Matin-Journal&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Leroud , Matin Journal edition August 23, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;)''}}
	
The consequences of these massacres were the retaliation and revenge of fascism. Indeed the rise to power of [[Benito Mussolini]] as Prime Minister of Italy and his [[National Fascist Party]] resulted in a change in foreign policy of Italy (due to the importance that Fascists gave to Libya as part of the [[Italian Empire]]) that resulted in the Pacification of Libya.&lt;ref name="Wright, 33" &gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1983|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 		 

From 1923 to 1924, Italian military forces regained all territory north of the Ghadames-Mizda-Beni Ulid region, with four fifths of the estimated population of Tripolitania and Fezzan within the Italian area; and Italian forces had regained the northern lowlands of Cyrenaica in during these two years.&lt;ref name="Wright, 33"/&gt; However attempts by Italian forces to occupy the forest hills of [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhtar]] were met with popular [[guerrilla]] resistance. This resistance was led by [[Senussis|Senussi]] [[sheikh]] [[Omar Mukhtar]].&lt;ref name="Wright, 33"/&gt;

==The Pacification==
The Pacification began with Italian forces rapidly occupying the [[Sirte]] desert separating Tripolitania from Cyrenaica, using aircraft, motor transport, and good logistical organization that allowed the Italians to occupy 150,000 square kilometres of territory in five months.&lt;ref name="Wright, 34" &gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1983|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing this, the Italians cut off the physical connection formerly held by the rebels between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.&lt;ref name="Wright, 34"/&gt;  By late 1928, the Italians took control of Ghibla and its tribes were disarmed.&lt;ref name="Wright, 34"/&gt;

Attempted negotiations between Italy and Omar Mukhtar broke down and Italy then planned for the complete conquest of Libya.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35" &gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1983|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Italian forces conquered Fezzan and raised the Italian flag in Tummo, the southernmost region of Fezzan.&lt;ref name="Wright, 34"/&gt;

[[File:Al-Magroon Concentration Camp.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Inmates at the [[El Agheila concentration camp]].]]

12,000 Cyrenaicans were executed in 1931 and all the nomadic peoples of northern Cyrenaica were forcefully removed from the region and relocated to huge [[concentration camp]]s in the Cyrenaican lowlands.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35"/&gt; Italian military authorities carried out the forced migration and deportation of the entire population of Jebel Akhdar in Cyrenaica, resulting in 100,000 [[Bedouins]], half the population of Cyrenaica, being expelled from their settlements.&lt;ref name="Bloxham, Moses, 358" /&gt; These 100,000 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, were forced by Italian authorities to march across the desert to a series of barbed-wire concentration camp compounds erected near [[Benghazi]], while stragglers who could not keep up with the march were summarily shot by Italian authorities.&lt;ref name="Duggan496" &gt;{{harvnb|Duggan|2007|p=496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda by the Fascist regime declared the camps to be oases of modern civilization that were hygienic and efficiently run - however in reality the camps had poor sanitary conditions as the camps had an average of about 20,000 Beduoins together with their camels and other animals, crowded into an area of one square kilometre.&lt;ref name="Duggan496"/&gt; The camps held only rudimentary medical services, with the camps of Soluch and Sisi Ahmed el Magrun with 33,000 internees each having only one doctor between them.&lt;ref name="Duggan496"/&gt; [[Typhus]] and other diseases spread rapidly in the camps as the people were physically weakened by meagre food rations provided to them and [[forced labour]].&lt;ref name="Duggan496"/&gt; By the time the camps closed in September 1933, 40,000 of the 100,000 total internees had died in the camps.&lt;ref name="Duggan496"/&gt;

[[File:Fiat3000.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Fiat 3000]] [[light tank]] used by Italian forces during the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;David Miller, Chris Foss. ''Great Book of Tanks: The World's Most Important Tanks from World War I to the Present Day''. Zenith Imprint, 2003. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
To close rebel supply routes from Egypt, the Italians constructed a 300-kilometre barbed wire fence on the border with Egypt that was patrolled by armoured cars and aircraft.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35"/&gt; The Italians persecuted the Senussi Order; [[zawiya (institution)|zawia]]s and [[mosque]]s were closed, [[Senussi]] practices were forbidden, Senussi estates were confiscated, and preparations were made for Italian conquest of the Kufra Oasis, the last stronghold of the Senussi in Libya.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35"/&gt; In 1931, Italian forces seized Kufra where Senussi refugees were bombed and strafed by Italian aircraft as they fled into the desert.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35" /&gt; Mukhtar was captured by the Italians in 1931, followed by a court martial and his public execution by hanging at Suluq.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35" /&gt;

Mukhtar's death effectively ended the resistance, and in January 1932, Badoglio proclaimed the end of the Pacification of Libya.&lt;ref name="Wright, 35-36" &gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1983|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Takeover of Kufra==
The ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' reporter and author [[Muhammad Asad]] interviewed a man from Kufra after its seizure by the Italians in his book ''[[The Road to Mecca (book)|The Road to Mecca]]''.

{{Quote|text="How did Kufra fall?"
With a weary gesture, Sidi Umar motioned to one of his men to come closer: "Let this man tell thee the story...He is one of the few who have escaped from Kufra. He came to me only yesterday."
The man from Kufra sat down on his haunches before me and pulled his ragged ''burnus'' around him. He spoke slowly, without any tremor of emotion in his voice; but his gaunt face seemed to mirror all the horrors he had witnessed.
"They came upon us in three columns, from three sides, with many armoured cars and heavy cannon. Their aeroplanes came down low and bombed houses and mosques and palm groves. We had only a few hundred men able to carry arms; the rest were women and children and old men. We defended house after house, but they were too strong for us, and in the end only the village of Al-Hawari was left to us. Our rifles were useless against their armoured cars; and they overwhelmed us. Only a few of us escaped. I hid myself in the palm orchards waiting for a chance to make my way through the Italian lines; and all through the night I could hear the screams of the women as they were being raped by the Italian soldiers and Eritrean askaris. On the following day an old woman came to my hiding place and brought me water and bread. She told me that the Italian general had assembled all the surviving people before the tomb of Sayyid Muhammad al-Mahdi; and before their eyes he tore a copy of the Koran into pieces, threw it to the ground and set his boot upon it, shouting, "Let your beduin prophet help you now, if he can!" And then he ordered the palm trees of the oasis to be cut down and the wells destroyed and all the books of Sayyid Ahmad's library burned. And on the next day he commanded that some of our elders and ulama [scholars] be taken up in an aeroplane - and they were hurled out of the plane high above the ground to be smashed to death...And all through the second night I heard from my hiding place the cries of our women and the laughter of the soldiers, and their rifle shots...At last I crept out into the desert in the dark of night and found a stray camel and rode away..." |author=Muhammad Asad |source=''The Road to Mecca''}}

But historian Tripodi pinpointed that no Italian plane -when Kufra was conquered- was able to transport passengers, because these airplanes were the first made in Italian aviation and only a pilot with a copilot could use it: this simple fact showed -in his opinion- that the Muhammad Asad interview was a fake propaganda issue, because no "ulama" could be hurled out of the planes. 

==War crimes==

Both the Senussi and the Italian armed forces were accused of committing numerous war crimes.
 
The Senussi were accused by Italian sources of refusing to take prisoners from the Italian armed forces and torture including mutilation of Italian soldiers before death.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Graziani. "Ho servito la Patria" p. 18-39&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific war crimes to have been committed by the Italian armed forces against civilians -according to Libyan authorities like Gheddafi- include deliberate bombing of civilians, killing unarmed children, women, and the elderly, rape and [[disembowelment]] of women, throwing prisoners out of aircraft to their death and running over others with [[tank]]s, regular daily executions of civilians in some areas, and bombing tribal villages with [[mustard gas]] bombs beginning in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Simons]], [[Tam Dalyell]] (British Member of Parliament, forward introduction). ''Libya: the struggle for survival''. St. Martin's Press, 1996. 1996 Pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Italian Fascist official [[Giovanni Gentile]] declared that only a few thousands died, mainly of disease (even related to the "[[Spanish flu]] epidemy" and consequences) and starvation&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Gentile.''Idee fondamentali'' (in "La Dottrina del Fascismo"). Ed. Enrico Hoepli. Milano, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Gentile pinpointed that the Spanish flu lasted until the early 1920s and resulted in the deaths of 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;million persons in the world, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Niall P.; Mueller, J. (2002). "Updating the accounts: global mortality of the 1918–1920 "Spanish" influenza pandemic". Bull Hist Med 76 (1): 105–115&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Film Portrayals==
The 1981 film [[Lion of the Desert]] by Moustapha Akkad is about this conflict.

'''Revlon, Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[cosmetics]], [[skin care]], [[fragrance]], and [[personal care]] [[company]] founded in 1932 and based in [[New York City]].

==History==
===Founding and Charles Revson control (1932-1975)===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Revlon was founded in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], 1932, by [[Jewish American]] brothers [[Charles Revson]] and Joseph Revson along with a chemist, Charles Lachman, who contributed the "L" in the Revlon name.  Starting with a single product — a new type of [[nail enamel]] — the three founders pooled their resources and developed a unique [[manufacturing]] process. Using [[pigment]]s instead of [[dye]]s, Revlon developed a variety of new shades of opaque nail enamel. In 1937, Revlon started selling the polishes in [[department stores]] and [[drug stores|pharmacies]]. In six years, the company became a multimillion-dollar organization. By 1940, Revlon offered an entire manicure line, and added [[lipstick]] to the collection. During [[World War II]], Revlon created makeup and related products for the [[United States Army]], which was honored in 1944 with the [[Army-Navy "E" Award]] for Excellence.

By the end of the war, Revlon was listed as one of America's top five cosmetic houses.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}} Expanding its capabilities, the company bought ''Graef &amp; Schmidt'', a cutlery manufacturer seized by the government in 1943 because of German business ties. This acquisition made it possible for Revlon to produce its own manicure and pedicure instruments, instead of buying them from outside supply sources.

====Stock market====
In November 1955, Revlon went public. The [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] price was $12 per share, but it reached $30 per share within 8 weeks.

====Divisions====
In the 1960s, Revson segmented Revlon Inc into different divisions, each focusing on a different market. He borrowed this strategy from [[General Motors]]. Each division had its own target customer:
* Revlon, the largest and most popular-priced brand
* [[Princess Marcella Borghese]], upscale/international
* [[Ultima II (cosmetics line)|Ultima II]], premium
* [[Natural Wonder (Revlon subsidiary brand)|Natural Wonder]], juniors
* Moon Drops, dry skin
* Etherea, hypo-allergenic

====Acquisitions====
In 1957, Revlon acquired ''Knomark'', a shoe-polish company, and sold its shoe-polish line [[Esquire Shoe Polish]] in 1969. Other acquisitions, such as ''[[Ty-D-Bol]]'', the maker of toilet cleansers, and a 27 percent interest in the [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shaver company were soon discarded. Evan Picone, a women's sportswear manufacturer which came with a price tag of $12 million in 1962, was sold back to one of the original partners four years later for $1 million. However, the 1967 acquisition of U.S. Vitamin and Pharmaceutical Corporation made Revlon a leader in [[diabetes]] drugs.

The company began to market its products overseas at the end of the 1950s. By 1962, when Revlon debuted in Japan, there were subsidiaries in France, Italy, Argentina, Mexico, and Asia. Revlon's entrance into the Japanese market was typical of its international sales strategy. Instead of adapting its ads and using Japanese models, Revlon chose to use its basic U.S. advertising and models. Japanese women loved the American look, and the sales for 1962 came to almost $164 million.

In 1968, Revlon introduced Eterna27, the first cosmetic cream with an [[estrogen]] precursor called ''Progenitin'' (pregnenolone acetate), as well as introducing the world's first American fashion designer fragrance, [[Norman Norell]]. Later, Revlon launched ''Braggi'' and ''Pub'' for men, and a line of wig maintenance products called Wig Wonder.

In 1970, Revlon acquired the [[Mitchum]] line of deodorants. In 1971 Flex shampoo and conditioner was introduced.

In 1973, Revlon introduced [[Charlie (fragrance)|Charlie]]. Geared to the under-30 market, Charlie model [[Shelley Hack]] in [[Ralph Lauren]] clothes, personified the independent woman of the 1970s. This was the first perfume ad to feature a woman wearing pants. Charlie raised Revlon's net sales figures to $506 million for 1973 and almost $606 million the following year. Shelley Hack appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' in 2007 to talk about the power of these Charlie print and commercial ads. Their follow-up fragrance, ''Jontue'', became the number two best seller.

====Models====
In 1973, model [[Lauren Hutton]] signed an exclusive modeling contract, agreeing to pose for Revlon's Ultima line for $400,000 for two years. She was featured on the cover of [[Newsweek]] for this ground-breaking cosmetics contract.&lt;ref&gt;Model, by Michael Gross, 1995, page 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, famed photographer [[Richard Avedon]] was signed on as the exclusive photographer for the brand - another cosmetics industry first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewtobias.com/fireandice18.html |title=Andrewtobias.com |publisher=Andrewtobias.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michel Bergerac control (1975-1985)===
In 1975, Charles Revson died. [[Michel Bergerac]], whom Revson had hired as President of the company, continued to expand the company holdings. Revlon acquired Coburn Optical Industries, an Oklahoma-based manufacturer of ophthalmic and optical processing equipment and supplies. Barnes-Hind, the largest U.S. marketer of hard contact lens solutions, was bought in 1976 and strengthened Revlon's share of the eye-care market. Revlon purchased ''Armour Pharmaceutical Company'', a division of [[Armour and Company]], from [[The Greyhound Corporation]] in 1977. Other acquisitions included the Lewis-Howe Company, makers of ''Tums'' antacid in 1978. These health-care operations helped sales figures to pass the $1 billion mark in 1977, bringing total sales to $1.7 billion in 1979.

In the mid-1980s, Revlon lost ground to [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]].  Estee Lauder spent millions of dollars on numerous magazine ads featuring Czech supermodel [[Paulina Porizkova]], shot by famed Chicago fashion photographer [[Victor Skrebneski]]. Revlon's share dropped from 20 percent to 10 percent of department store cosmetics sales. Sales at the drugstore also declined as Revlon lost shares to Noxell's [[Cover Girl]] brand.  Revlon compensated with more acquisitions; [[Max Factor]], Ellen Betrix, [[Charles of the Ritz]], [[Germaine Monteil]], [[Almay]], Fermodyl, Lancaster, Aziza, and [[Halston]]. The 1977 acquisition of ''Carlos Colomer'', a Spanish professional beauty supply distributor, brought ''Fermodyl'' and ''Roux'' and helped introduce Revlon to the world of ethnic care: ''Creme of Nature'', ''Realistic'', ''Lovely Color'' and ''Milk and Honey''. In 1983 the company attempted an unsuccessful [[hostile takeover]] of [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]]. In 1989, Revlon became one of the first companies to replace animal tests with alternative safety testing methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/business/cosmetics-companies-quietly-ending-animal-tests.html | work=The New York Times | first=Douglas C. | last=McGill | title=Cosmetics Companies Quietly Ending Animal Tests | date=August 2, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ronald Perelman control (1985-present)===
On November 5, 1985, at a price of $58 per share, totaling $2.7 billion, Revlon was sold to [[Pantry Pride]] (later renamed to Revlon Group, Inc.), a subsidiary of [[Ronald Perelman]]'s [[MacAndrews &amp; Forbes]]. The buyout—engineered with the help of junk bond king [[Michael Milken|Michael P. Milken]]—saddled Revlon with a huge $2.9 billion debt load, which became an albatross around the company's neck for years to come. Pantry Pride Inc. offered to buy any or all of Revlon's 38.2 million outstanding shares for $47.5 a share when its street price stood at $45 a share. Initially rejected, he repeatedly raised his offer until it reached $53 a share while fighting Revlon's management every step of the way. [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company]] swooped in at $56 a share, a brief public bidding war ensued, and Perelman triumphed with an offer of $58 a share. Perelman paid $1.8 billion to Revlon's shareholders, but he also paid $900 million of other costs associated with the purchase.&lt;ref name="2.7Billion"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Stevenson |title=Pantry Pride Control of Revlon Board Seen Near |publisher=New York Times |page=D5 |date=1985-11-05 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perelman filed suit in the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] to force Revlon to accept Perelman's offer, and the resulting appellate decision, ''[[Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc.|Revlon v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings]]'', was a landmark case in determining the obligations of public company directors in hostile takeover situations under Delaware law.

Perelman had Revlon sell four divisions: two for $1 billion, the vision care division for $574 million, and the National Health Laboratories division which became a publicly owned corporation in 1988. Additional make-up lines were purchased for Revlon: [[Max Factor]] in 1987 and Betrix in 1989, later sold to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/MacAndrews-amp;-Forbes-Holdings-Inc-Company-History.html |title=MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings Inc. |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Funding Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1991, Revlon sold the [[Clean &amp; Clear]] brand to [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].

In March 2011, Revlon acquired Mirage Cosmetics, makers of [[Sinful Colors]] nail products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wwd.com/wwd-publications/wwd/2011-03-25/ |work=Women's Wear Daily |title=Revlon Acquires Sinful Nail Brand |date=March 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[PETA]] removed Revlon and other high-profile cosmetic brands from its list of companies who do not test their products on animals after the organization learned they were paying Chinese laboratories to test their cosmetics on [[rabbit]]s and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hills|first1=Suzannah|title=L'Occitane and Yves Rocher: The big-name beauty brands among those ditching cruelty-free animal testing policies to sell their products to China |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181468/Big-beauty-brands-dropping-cruelty-free-animal-testing-policies-sell-products-China.html|accessdate=28 January 2015|agency=Daily Mail|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Revlon Consumer Products Corp. bought the [[Colomer Group]] from [[CVC Capital Partners]], a private equity firm, for $660 million.&lt;ref name="revon"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/financial/revlon-acquires-the-colomer-group-7076124?src=nl/mornReport/20130806 | title=Revlon Acquires Colomer Group for $660 Million | publisher=WWD | accessdate=6 August 2013 | author=Young, Vicki M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After suffering business loss in 2011 and 2012, at the end of 2013, Revlon announced that it will exit the Chinese market, which employs 1,100 people. The business in China accounted for just 2 percent portion of net sales of Revlon's international operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-31/revlon-to-exit-operations-in-china-cutting-940-beauty-advisers.html |title=Revlon to Exit Operations in China, Cut 1,100 Jobs |date=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2013, Revlon named Lorenzo Delpani as President and CEO  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131031/retail_apparel/131039972 |title=Revlon Names Lorenzo Delpani President, CEO |date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Revlon announced leaving midtown and relocate headquarters to the top the two floors of One New York Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/03/04/revlon-says-so-long-to-midtown-hello-to-one-new-york-plaza/|title=Revlon says so long to Midtown, hello to One New York Plaza|date=2014-03-05|work=New York Post|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, 2014, Revlon's board of directors elected Roberto Simon as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective as of Sept. 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/REV/key-developments/article/3074837|title=Revlon Inc announces election of Roberto Simon as executive vice president and chief financial officer - Form 8-K |date=September 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2015, Revlon completed the acquisition of U.K. based fragrance management company ''CBBeauty'' including its U.K. distributor ''SAS &amp; Company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150430006773/en/Revlon-Completes-Acquisition-CBBeauty-SAS-Company|title=Revlon Completes Acquisition of CBBeauty and SAS &amp; Company|last=|first=|date=2015-04-30|website=[[BusinessWire]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company announced on January 29, 2017 that CEO Fabian Garcia would leave the company at the end of February. Board member, Paul Meister, would become executive vice chairman of the board and run the day-to-day operations. A quarterly report from the end of 2017 estimated its quarterly loss falling approximately between $60 million and $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/01/29/revlons-ceo-stepping-down/1076841001/|title=Revlon's CEO departing amid expected steep losses|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
[[File:HK Des Vouex Road REVLON Tram.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Tram with Revlon advertising in [[Hong Kong]], June 2007]]
Up until the 1940s, Revlon's magazine [[advertisement|ads]] were drawn by hand and mostly in black and white. Beginning in 1945, Revlon began launching full-color photographic advertisements in major magazines and stores across the country. Revlon introduced matching nail polish and lipsticks with exotic and unique names. These ads were taken by the top fashion photographers of the day including [[Richard Avedon]], [[Cecil Beaton]], and [[John Rawlings]]. Some of these ads were for "Paint the Town Pink" and 1945's "Fatal Apple" with [[Dorian Leigh]]. In 1947 Revlon introduced "Bachelor's Carnation" and in 1948, "Sweet Talk".

In 1950, Revlon introduced a red lipstick and nail enamel called "Where's the Fire?" Revlon used the word "fire" again later in their "Fire and Ice" ads. One of the world's first supermodels, [[Dorian Leigh]], starred in some of Revlon's most memorable advertisements of all time. In 1946, Dorian was covered in purple flowers and wrapped in a pale purple sheet for "Ultra Violet." In 1947, Dorian appeared in "Fashion Plate." In 1953, at the age of 36, she appeared in "Cherries in the Snow." Later that year she appeared in the legendary "Fire and Ice" ad shot by Richard Avedon. Originally, Dorian appeared in a tight, silver-beaded dress with an enormous red wrap. Her black hair had a silver swirl in it and she had her hands, with long red nails, positioned in front of her breasts. Charles Revson rejected Avedon's original ad as "too sexual."&lt;ref&gt;The Girl Who Had Everything, The Story of 'The Fire and Ice Girl,' by Dorian Leigh and Laura Hobe, 1980, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; They re-shot the ad, this time with her open hand in front of one hip, the other in front of her cheek. The advertisement became Madison Avenue legend because of the full-page quiz next to the sensual ad.  Almost 50 years later, in November 2010, Revlon re-created 1953's "Fire and Ice" magazine ad, this time with actress [[Jessica Biel]].  With this ad, Revlon announced they were issuing a limited edition Fire and Ice lipstick and nail color calling this campaign, "lips and tips."

Dorian Leigh's 15-years-younger red-headed sister, [[Suzy Parker]], also shot numerous Revlon magazine ads in the 1950s.  [[Charles Revson]], who wanted to marry Dorian at some point, despised Suzy, and vice versa.  At one point, he refused to hire her anymore because Suzy complained about the "peanut" paycheck she received from Revlon. [[Richard Avedon]], however, after photographing other models for a particular Revlon ad, would call in Suzy last minute, sometimes late at night, to do re-takes with him.  This happened with "Stormy Pink," an ad Suzy shot very late at night with a wild white horse in the ocean.  Avedon would then tell Revson that it was not Suzy in the ad, but a model named "Bubbles" or another made-up name.&lt;ref&gt;''The Girl Who Had Everything. The Story of the "Fire and Ice Girl,"'' Dorian Leigh and Laura Hobe, 1980, page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Revlon became the first American cosmetics company to feature an African American model, icon [[Naomi Sims]], in their advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tell Me More |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111572300 |title=Naomi Sims Showed The World That Black Is Beautiful |publisher=NPR |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1970s, Revlon also made history when it created their line of cosmetics, specifically for women of color, called "The Polished Ambers Collection" and selected fashion model icon, [[Iman (model)|Iman]], to be featured in the advertising campaigns.  Revlon was also noted for featuring models of a wide age range in the 1980s, including then 13-year-old [[Milla Jovovich]] and then 60-year-old [[Audrey Hepburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millaj.com/model/revlon.shtml |title=The Official Milla Jovovich Website :: Gallery - Revlon |publisher=MillaJ.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the successful campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s featuring models, in particular [[Cindy Crawford]], Revlon decided to drop fashion models and focus on movie stars, among them [[Kate Bosworth]], [[Jaime King]], [[Halle Berry]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Jennifer Connelly]], [[Beau Garrett]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Emma Stone]] and [[Bond girls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2009/05/04/jessica-biels-new-role-face-of-revlon/ |title=Stylenews.peoplestylwatch.com |publisher=Stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Australian supermodel [[Elle Macpherson]] became a new spokesmodel for the company. American actress [[Jessica Biel]] is the newest woman to model for the brand, first shown in advertisements in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happi.com/articles/2009/06/marketing-news |title=Marketing News |publisher=HAPPI |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Main article: [[List of Revlon spokesmodels]])
In 2008, celebrity makeup artist [[Gucci Westman]] was hired as Revlon's Global Artistic Director, representing the company at runway shows and brand events and designing collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/revlon-taps-gucci-westman-1022645 |title=Revlon Taps Gucci Westman - Beauty Industry and Products News |publisher=WWD.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Revlon is a corporate sponsor of several charity projects. The largest of these is the [[Revlon Run Walk]], a run and walk event held in New York and Los Angeles to raise money and awareness for breast and ovarian cancer. Revlon also supports other cancer charities such as Look Good Feel Better and the National Breast Cancer Coalition and operates a mobile mammography clinic in and around Oxford, North Carolina, where the company's primary manufacturing operations are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revlon.com/Revlon-Home/Revlon-Corporate/RevlonCares.aspx |title=Revlon Cares |publisher=Revlon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Revlon supported the development of a breast center at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Renamed Revlon/UCLA Breast Center, the center is a well-known institute for treatment and research of breast cancer and other breast diseases and disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://breastcenter.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=18 |title=About Us |publisher=Revlon/UCLA Breast Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Revlon lip gloss shade whose proceeds support Revlon's cancer charities was also created in 2009.

In September 2010, Revlon, with global artistic director [[Gucci Westman]] and spokesmodel [[Halle Berry]] hosted an event at Fashion's Night Out in New York City to raise funds for the Jenesse Center, a Los Angeles organization for domestic violence victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100914007361/en/Revlon-Halle-Berry-Celebrate-Fashion%E2%80%99s-Night-York |title=Revlon and Halle Berry Celebrate Fashion’s Night Out New York |publisher=Business Wire |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revlon also hosted luncheons and various other events to benefit the center and partnered with then-online retailer [[drugstore.com]] to donate portions of lipstick sales to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Bobbie |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/34417346/ns/today-today_holiday_guide/ |title=Shop for change!

'''Robert (Bob) McDonald Chapman''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|CMG|size=85%}} (30 October 1922 – 26 May 2004) was a New Zealand political scientist and historian.

==Early life==
[[File:Robert Chapman and family.png|thumbnail|Chapman as a small child (right) with his mother and sister in 1927.]]
Chapman was born in 1922 in Takapuna, Auckland. He attended [[Auckland Grammar]]. He later attended Auckland teacher's training college, and also studied at Auckland University College, where he received scholarships.&lt;ref name="NZH obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3570757 | title=Obituary: Robert Chapman | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=5 June 2004 | accessdate=8 October 2014 | author=Aimer, Peter, Phoebe Falconer and Brian Rudman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his Master's research project in history, he analysed the 1928 general election in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

He married Noeline Amy Chapman, a teacher, in 1948.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

==Career==

Chapman was first appointed to the History Department at the University of Auckland in 1948. He was interested in "New Zealand history as an expression of the nation's social development."&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt; According to the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' obituary of Chapman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"He was one of a pioneer group of teachers at the university - among them historian Sir Keith Sinclair and poet Allen Curnow - who, in the 1960s, proudly asserted that New Zealand had its own history, its own politics, its own literature, which was every bit as important as that of Britain."&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapman was interested in fields outside political science and history, and was involved in the development of New Zealand literature and poetry. He co-edited, with Jonathan Bennett, ''An Anthology of New Zealand Verse'' (1956). His interest in other areas was part of a wider pattern among New Zealand public intellectuals:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Literary criticism sometimes functioned as cultural criticism for intellectuals whose formal expertise lay in other fields. Robert Chapman’s 1954 ''Landfall'' essay "Fiction and the social pattern" charted the ways recent novels had revealed Pākehā social mores – a subject at some remove from Chapman’s research as a lecturer in political science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilliard, Chris|title=Intellectuals - Literature and the modern New Zealand intellectual|work=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapman participated in the first television coverage of the [[New Zealand general election, 1966|New Zealand general election in 1966]]. He also helped with election coverage in the [[New Zealand general election, 1969|1969]] and [[New Zealand general election, 1972|1972]] elections.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

Over his career Chapman had an interest in broadcasting issues, and was appointed in 1973 to a ministerial committee to look into restructuring broadcasting in New Zealand. Later, in 1984, he was appointed chairman of a Royal Commission into Broadcasting, which reported in 1986.&lt;ref name="NZH obit" /&gt;

In 1966, lecturers Keith Sinclair and Chapman established the University of Auckland Art Collection, beginning with the purchase of several paintings and drawings by [[Colin McCahon]]. The Collection is now managed by the Centre for Art Research, based at the Gus Fisher Gallery.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===Awards===
In the [[1987 Birthday Honours|1987 Queen's Birthday Honours]] Chapman was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] for public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue= 50950|date=12 June 1987 |page=31|supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The New Zealand journal ''Political Science'', in an editorial, noted Chapman's death:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Finally, the fifth article in this issue ... laments the passing of Professor Robert Chapman, truly a rangatira of New Zealand political science. Significant among his landmark publications was his contribution to the 1986 ''Report of the Royal Commission on the Electoral System: Towards a Better Democracy'', entitled "Voting in the Maori Political Sub-System, 1935-1984"."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://intl-pnz.sagepub.com/content/56/1/3.full.pdf+html | title=Editorial | author=Levine, Stephen | author2=Roberts, Nigel|journal=Political Science |date=June 2004  | volume=56 | issue=1 | pages=3 | doi=10.1177/003231870405600101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Robert Chapman Prize in Politics and International Relations is awarded annually at the University of Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/schools-in-the-faculty-of-arts/school-of-social-sciences/scholarships-and-awards.html | title=Faculty of Arts - School of Social Sciences - Te Pokapū Pūtaiao Pāpori | publisher=University of Auckland | accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Chapman Archive===
The Chapman Archive began as a personal collection of broadcast recordings made by Professor Robert Chapman and his wife Noeline in the mid 1960s. It later became a resource of the University of Auckland's Department of Political Studies before moving to the University Library in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV and Radio - About|url=https://www.library.auckland.ac.nz/tv-radio/about| publisher=University of Auckland | accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now part of the University Library, the Archive is the University Library's largest audiovisual collection. Its focus is on building a collection that reflects New Zealand's political, social, cultural and economic history as shown through broadcast media. This focus has allowed the Chapman Archive to develop a comprehensive collection of news and current affairs programming depicting defining moments in New Zealand's history.

The collection covers broadcasting from the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, Television New Zealand, commercial broadcasters, including TV3 from 1989. Also included is an extensive collection of Radio New Zealand broadcasts.

In a speech at the Chapman memorial lecture in 2000, former Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] highlighted the contribution made by Noeline:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In an unpaid capacity, Noeline [Chapman] clipped the newspapers and recorded the news and current affairs day in, day out. That work formed the basis for the Noeline Chapman archive in the Political Studies Department - supplemented, of course, by the ceaseless flow of parliamentary material from Jonathan Hunt for the last 34 years!"&lt;ref name="Clark chapman lecture 2000" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chapman memorial lecture===
In honour of Robert and Noeline Chapman, the University of Auckland established the Chapman memorial lecture.

In 2000, Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]], a student of Chapman's, gave the first Chapman memorial lecture.&lt;ref name="Clark chapman lecture 2000"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/chapman-lecture-series-honour-emeritus-professor-robert-chapman | title=The Chapman Lecture Series, in honour of Emeritus Professor Robert Chapman | publisher=New Zealand Government | work=Beehive.govt.nz | date=20 November 2000 | accessdate=8 October 2014 | author=Clark, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She gave another memorial lecture in his honour in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssUHDsSkKI | title=2013 Robert Chapman Lecture: The Rt Hon Helen Clark | publisher=University of Auckland Arts Faculty | work=Youtube.com | accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Lecture was presented by Associate Professor Elizabeth McLeay, on "Studying New Zealand Politics".

In 2005, Hon. Bill English, who went on to become NZ Deputy Prime Minister for 8 years and later, Prime Minister (2016-17), [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0510/S00015.htm presented] the Chapman Lecture.

In 2011, Professor Stephen Levine presented the Chapman Lecture, speaking on '[https://mediastore.auckland.ac.nz/uploaded/public/01-2012/60824635AF904144A219067327423839.preview New Zealand Politics: Democracy and the Semi-Sovereign People]'.

The 2012 memorial lecture was given by Associate Professor Ralph Chapman, a son of Robert Chapman, and was titled "Averting dangerous climate change: accelerating the energy transition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sgees/about/staff/staff-publications/publications-ralph-chapman | title=Publications Ralph Chapman | publisher=Victoria University of Wellington | accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Lacour-Gayet''' (July 22, 1896 – March 2, 1989) was a French banking official, [[historian]], author, and educator who taught in the United States after World War II.

==Life and career==
Lacour-Gayet came from a family of intellectuals, teachers, and historians. His maternal grandfather was [[Paul Janet]], a French philosopher. His father, [[Georges Lacour-Gayet]], was a historian who published a famous biography of [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]]. His brother, [[:fr:Jacques Lacour-Gayet|Jacques Lacour-Gayet]], was an economic historian with whom he frequently collaborated.

He served as an artillery officer during World War I, for which he received the [[Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmemory.stjohns.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/commencement/id/306/rec/3 "Citation for the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters: Dr. Robert Lacour-Gayet,"] Mar. 23, 1964; [http://digitalmemory.stjohns.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/alumnews1960/id/189/rec/2 Bill Esposito, "Sports," ''St. John's University Alumni News''], Apr. 1964, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacour-Gayet studied at the Lycee Louis-le-Grand, l'Ecole des sciences Politiques, and the [[University of Paris]], from which he held both a Master's and Doctorate in Law, as well as a Doctorate in Economic Science. In 1921, Lacour-Gayet was admitted to the Council of the Inspector General of Finance in France, and was subsequently named Financial Representative of France in the United States (1924-1930). He then became Director of the Economic Department for the Bank of France in 1930, before being named Chief of the Office of Inspectors General of Finance in 1939, a position he held until 1945. He was given the title of Inspecteur général honoraire des Finances.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in France/Qui est qui en France'', 14th edition, 1979-1980;

Lacour-Gayet began his teaching career in the United States in 1945 as a Lecturer in Administrative Law at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]]. He began teaching at [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] in 1946, and was appointed Associate Professor and Chairman of the Department of History and Government in 1950. Lacour-Gayet was promoted to Professor in 1954, and remained at St. John's until 1957, when he became Professor Emeritus. He frequently taught evening classes at [[New York University]], and during Summers at the [[Universite Laval]]. He became president of the Société des Professeurs Français en Amérique in 1953. Lacour-Gayet returned to Paris in 1957 to teach American history and literature at the [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Catholic Institute of Paris]]. He was honored in 1966 with the Homme de Lettres from la fédération des Alliances Françaises aux Etats-Unis.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in France/Qui est qui en France'', 14th edition, 1979-1980;

Beginning in the 1920s, Lacour-Gayet was a regular contributor to ''Revue des deux mondes'', ''Revue de Paris'', ''Revue d'histoire diplomatique'', and ''L'Actualité économique'', among other publications. In the United States, he contributed articles to the ''Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York'' and the ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', as well as book reviews to the ''Catholic Historical Review''. He was the author, co-author, or editor of nineteen books, ranging from economic histories of France to popular histories of Canada, South Africa, Australia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in France/Qui est qui en France'', 14th edition, 1979-1980;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7068">'''Robert of Gloucester''' (fl. c. 1260 – c. 1300) wrote a chronicle of [[Great Britain|British]], [[England|English]], and [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] history sometime in the mid- or late-thirteenth century.

==Biography==

Little is known about Robert himself; the key reason for attributing the Chronicle to a person of this name is a mention in the continuation of the longer version that 'roberd / þat verst þis boc made' ('Robert / that first this book made',  lines 11748-49) personally witnessed an eclipse that accompanied the [[Battle of Evesham]] (1265). The appellation 'of Gloucester' was added by early modern antiquarians on the basis of the perspective taken in later sections of the longer version of the chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Galloway, 'Writing History in England', in ''The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature'', ed. by David Wallace (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), pp. 255-83 (pp. 268-69).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts and versions==

The chronicle survives in two versions; there are seven manuscripts of each. Up to 1135 (the death of Henry I, line 9137 in Wright's edition of the longer version), the versions are 'broadly identical', 'but they then have wholly different continuations'. The longer version contains almost 3000 more lines, is more detailed, and ends (in the least incomplete manuscript) in 1271. The shorter version only contains a further 592 lines, and ends in the 1280s. However, this shorter version ''adds'' about 800 lines earlier in the text, some of them deriving from [[Laȝamon's Brut]].&lt;ref&gt;O. S. Pickering, 'South English Legendary style in Robert of Gloucester's Chronicle', ''Medium Ævum'', 70.1 (2001), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts of the longer version are:&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Hudson (academic)|Anne Hudson]], 'Tradition and Innovation in some Middle English Manuscripts', ''Review of English Studies'', 17 (68)  (1966), 359-72 (p. 360 fn 1). doi: 10.1093/res/XVII.68.359.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the ''South English Legendary''==

The chronicle is similar to the ''[[South English Legendary]]'' (probably first composed c. 1270-85), and between them they comprise 'two huge monuments of later thirteenth-century literary activity' in England:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''South English Legendary'' [...] and the historical chronicle that goes under the name of Robert of Gloucester, have long been known to be intimately related. They are written in the same septenary couplet metre, and are closely similar in dialect, vocabulary, phrasing, choice of rhyme words, overall narrative technique, and 'outlook': a Christian piety which places them on the side of the oppressed and suffering individual, and in opposition to corrupt and wicked lords of whatever estate. They also have numerous actual lines in common.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that Robert, as well as being inspired by the ''South English Legendary'', also revised a version of that text himself.&lt;ref&gt;O. S. Pickering, 'South English Legendary style in Robert of Gloucester's Chronicle', ''Medium Ævum'', 70.1 (2001), 1-18 (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical reliability==

The ''Chronicle'' was of considerable interest to contemporaries and antiquarian scholars.  Although an early generation of antiquarians including [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]] found the chronicle interesting, its reputation later faded.  Somewhat perversely, it was not until after the text was edited by [[William Aldis Wright]] that its neglect - "worthless as history" and "verse without one spark of poetry" according to its editor - became widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Donald Kennedy, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23736 ‘Gloucester, Robert of (fl. c.1260–c.1300)’], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 Aug 2008; "Robert of Gloucester's ''Chronicle''." ''Gentleman's Magazine'' (Nov. 1834): 470-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the text is of interest primarily for materials relating to the [[Second Barons' War]], to which the author (or an author of a portion of the text) seems to have been a witness.  The first part of the ''Chronicle'' translates materials from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''Historia regum Britanniae'', narrating fabulous British history.  The majority of English/Anglo-Saxon history is compiled from the works of [[Henry of Huntingdon]] and [[William of Malmesbury]], and the post-Conquest portions are translated from numerous sources densely interwoven with original text.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Donald Kennedy, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23736 ‘Gloucester, Robert of (fl. c.1260–c.1300)’], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 Aug 2008; "Robert of Gloucester's ''Chronicle''." ''Gentleman's Magazine'' (Nov. 1834): 470-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Royal Western Australian Historical Society''' has for many decades been the main association for Western Australians to collectively work for adequate understanding and protection of the cultural heritage of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Western Australia]].  It was founded in 1926.

With membership including local historians and writers, it preceded the Western Australian branch of the [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] and the [[History Council of Western Australia]] by decades.

Based in [[Nedlands, Western Australia|Nedlands]] it holds many important objects and archives relative to Western Australian history.

The RWAHS is a constituent member of the [[Federation of Australian Historical Societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org.au/FAHS%20constituents.html "FAHS Constituents". Federation of Australian Historical Societies]. Retrieved 22 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of Western Australian historians, writers and public figures have been involved with the society.

==Early days==
''[[Early Days (journal)|Early Days]]'' is the official journal and is published annually.  It is one of the more lasting legacies of the society - a regular run of articles with a wide range of subjects concerning West Australian history.

'''San Francisco Ballet''' is a [[ballet company]], founded in 1933 as the '''San Francisco Opera Ballet''' under the leadership of ballet master [[Adolph Bolm]]. The company is currently based in the [[War Memorial Opera House (San Francisco)|War Memorial Opera House]], San Francisco, under the direction of [[Helgi Tómasson (dancer)|Helgi Tomasson]]. San Francisco Ballet was the first professional ballet company in the United States. It is among the world's leading dance companies, presenting more than 100 performances annually, with a [[repertoire]] that spans both [[classical ballet|classical]] and [[contemporary ballet]]. Along with [[American Ballet Theatre]] and the [[New York City Ballet]], San Francisco Ballet has been described as part of the "triumvirate of great classical companies defining the American style on the world stage today".&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/feb/18/dance | title=One Step Closer to Perfection | date=February 18, 2007 |work=The Observer |location=UK | author=Jennings, Luke | accessdate=August 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding: Christensen brothers===
[[Willam Christensen]], [[Harold Christensen]], and [[Lew Christensen]] made up the famed trio of brothers considered by many to have done more than anyone else to establish ballet in the United States. Born into an artistic and musical family, the three brothers studied [[folk dance]] and ballet from early ages and went on to tour the famous vaudeville [[Orpheum Circuit]] during the 1920s and 1930s, exposing many Americans to ballet for the first time with their act "The Christ Brothers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Ballet-pioneer-Willam-F-Christensen-2867680.php%20-F-Christensen-2867680.php | title=Ballet pioneer Willam F. Christensen | date=October 16, 2013 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Roca, Octavio | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As vaudeville faded from American popular culture, Harold and Lew joined [[George Balanchine]]'s new company, [[American Ballet]], in 1935. In 1932, Willam formed a ballet school in Portland, Oregon; in 1937, he was engaged as principal male soloist by San Francisco Opera Ballet.&lt;ref name="Flatrow"&gt;{{Citation | last = Flatow | first = Sheryl | title = Christensen Brothers | url = http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/christensenbros_essay_flatow.pdf | publisher = Dance Heritage Collection | accessdate = October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the company's ballet master and choreographer in 1938. With his brother Harold, he purchased the company from the Opera in 1942, renaming it San Francisco Ballet.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Dictionary of Dance"&gt;Craine, Debra; Mackrell, Judith (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=42g8Hp-xA48C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99&amp;dq=when+did+harold+become+director+of+the+San+Francisco+Ballet+School?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RIQo-4em3s&amp;sig=awA32uswLgDKlkJ8_pTWGTRcVtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AFVdUta6M-bC0QWYnYHABQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20did%20harold%20become%20director%20of%20the%20San%20Francisco%20Ballet%20School%3F&amp;f=false The Oxford Dictionary of Dance]''. Oxford University Press, USA. {{ISBN|0199563446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, Willam retired as director of SF Ballet and moved to Utah, where he started teaching ballet in the country’s first university ballet department at the [[University of Utah]]. With a group of his students, he founded the Utah Civic Ballet (now known as [[Ballet West]]) in 1963; the company remained under Christensen's directorship until 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/arts/willam-christensen-99-dies-helped-ballet-flourish-in-us.html | title=Willam Christensen, 99, Dies; Helped Ballet Flourish in U.S. | date=October 17, 2001 |work=The New York Times |author=Anderson, Jack | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Balanchine's tutelage at American Ballet, Lew Christensen became the first American-born ''[[danseur noble]]''.&lt;ref name="The Oxford Dictionary of Dance"/&gt; The [[United States Army]] drafted Christensen to fight in [[World War II]]. After the war ended, he joined Balanchine's and [[Lincoln Kirstein]]'s [[Ballet Society]] (soon to become [[New York City Ballet]]), eventually becoming [[ballet master]]; he served in the role from 1946 until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/10/obituaries/lew-christensen-dies-at-75-lead-dancer-for-balanchine.html | title=Lew Christensen Dies at 75; Lead Dancer for Balanchine | date=October 10, 1984 |work=The New York Times |author=Dunning, Jennifer | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he joined his brother Willam as co-director of San Francisco Ballet. When Willam moved to Salt Lake City later that year, Lew took over as full director of SF Ballet; he held the position until 1976, when [[Michael Smuin]] joined him as co-director. Lew Christensen remained SF Ballet co-director until 1984, the year of his death.&lt;ref name="Flatrow"/&gt;

After leaving the vaudeville circuit in 1935, Harold Christensen danced with American Ballet, San Francisco Opera Ballet, Kirstein's [[Ballet Caravan]], and San Francisco Ballet until his retirement from the stage in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/22/obituaries/harold-christensen-84-a-dancer-and-ballet-school-director-dies.html | title=Harold Christensen, 84, a Dancer and Ballet School Director | date=February 22, 1989 |work=The New York Times |author=Dunning, Jennifer | accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, his brother Willam invited him to become director of the [[San Francisco Ballet School]], and in 1942 he and Willam purchased the SF Ballet. Harold continued to serve as the school's director until his retirement in 1975.

===1938–1950===
{{redirect|Harold Christensen|the American attorney|Harold G. Christensen}}
In 1938, the company's first major production was ''[[Coppélia]]'', choreographed by Willam Christensen.&lt;ref name="sfbmag"&gt;{{cite magazine | author=McCarthy, Terrence | title=History of San Francisco Ballet | magazine=San Francisco Ballet Magazine| volume=71 | issue=6 |year=2004 | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, it staged ''[[Swan Lake]]'', the first time that the ballet was produced in its entirety by an American company. On Christmas Eve 1944, the company staged ''[[Nutcracker]]''—the first complete production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s most popular piece ever danced in the United States.

In 1942, San Francisco Opera Ballet split into two independent companies, ballet and opera. The ballet half was sold to Willam and Harold Christensen. Willam became artistic director, while Harold took on the job of director of the San Francisco Ballet School.&lt;ref name="sfbmag"/&gt; The San Francisco Ballet Guild was also formed as a support organization for San Francisco Ballet.&lt;ref name="renouf"&gt;{{cite news | author=Renee Renouf | title=San Francisco Ballet history | url=http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_99/oct99/rr_san_francisco_ballet_history.htm | work=Ballet.co Magazine | year=2001 | accessdate=August 13, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922145438/http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_99/oct99/rr_san_francisco_ballet_history.htm | archivedate=September 22, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1951–1972===
The year 1951 marked a significant shift in administration of San Francisco Ballet. Lew Christensen—''[[premier danseur]]'' at the time—partnered with his brother Willam Christensen as co-directors. Then in 1952, Lew Christensen took over as sole director. Under his guidance, San Francisco Ballet began to travel and establish itself as a significant American ballet company. Until 1956, San Francisco Ballet had remained on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], but Christensen took the company to the [[Jacob's Pillow]] Dance Festival in [[Massachusetts]]. In 1957, it was the first American ballet company to tour the Far East, performing in 11 Asian nations.&lt;ref name="sfbmag" /&gt; On New Year's Day 1965, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] televised a one-hour abridgement of the Lew Christensen-choreographed production of ''Nutcracker'' featuring San Francisco Ballet.

In 1972, San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House was named the official residence of San Francisco Ballet.

===1973–1985===
In 1973, Michael Smuin became co-artistic director of San Francisco Ballet with Lew Christensen; Smuin had danced with the Company from 1953 to 1961.&lt;ref name="Winn"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-dance-pioneer-Michael-Smuin-collapses-dies-2600518.php#photo-2089331 | title=SF dance pioneer Michael Smuin collapses, dies | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=April 23, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Winn, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direction, the national and international profile of SF Ballet was raised significantly by the broad success of productions such as 1977's ''Romeo and Juliet'', which aired on the [[PBS]] series ''[[Great Performances]]: Dance in America'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/MICHAEL-SMUIN-1938-2007-Prolific-dance-2575617.php | title=Michael Smuin: 1938-2007/Prolific dance director had showy career | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=April 24, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Winn, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; This televised performance marked the first time that a West Coast ballet company, and a full-length ballet, was shown on the PBS TV series.&lt;ref name="Dancers in Career Transition"&gt;Upper, Nancy (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mFuKmnibeoAC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=%22romeo+and+juliet%22+%22dance+in+america%22+pbs+%22san+francisco+ballet%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a6snszOBpI&amp;sig=P-CPZqmVMIXLsPgA_c_kT2BaT40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8x1YUs74BMSI0AXS8IDgCw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22romeo%20and%20juliet%22%20%22dance%20in%20america%22%20pbs%20%22san%20francisco%20ballet%22&amp;f=false|Ballet Dancers in Career Transition]'' McFarland and Co. {{ISBN|0786418192}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS televised three more of Smuin's SF Ballet productions, and his productions of ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''A Song for Dead Warriors'' went on to win [[Emmy Award]]s. Smuin led the company until 1985.

===1985–present===
Helgi Tomasson's 1985 arrival as artistic director marked the beginning of a new era for San Francisco Ballet. Under Tomasson's direction,&lt;ref name=Tomassonbio&gt;{{cite press release

Over a span of more than 25&amp;nbsp;years, Tomasson has staged acclaimed full-length productions of classics including ''[[Swan Lake]]'' (1988, 2009); ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1990); ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1994); ''[[Giselle]]'' (1999); ''[[Don Quixote]]'', co-staged with former principal dancer and current choreographer in residence Yuri Possokhov (2003); and ''[[Nutcracker]]'' (2004). Tomasson's ''Nutcracker'', set in San Francisco during the 1915 [[Panama Pacific International Exposition]], is notable for being the only uniquely San Francisco ''Nutcracker''. It features sets (including "a backdrop of San Francisco's Victorian houses known as 'painted ladies{{'"}})&lt;ref name="Simpson"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E0DA1330F932A15751C1A9629C8B63|title = San Francisco Ballet Review; Clara and her 'Nutcracker' Friends Stop By the World's Fair|accessdate = April 21, 2015|date = December 21, 2004 |first = Anna|last = Kisselgoff |newspaper = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and costumes created by, respectively, Michael Yeargan and Martin Pakledinaz, both repeat [[Tony Award]]-winning designers.&lt;ref name="50&amp;nbsp;years"&gt;Steinberg, Cobbett (1983).

Today, San Francisco Ballet presents approximately 100 performances each year.

===Festivals and touring===
In 1991, San Francisco Ballet performed in New York City for the first time in 26&amp;nbsp;years, returning in 1993, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2013. Following the initial tour, ''The New York Times'' proclaimed, "Mr. Tomasson has accomplished the unprecedented: He has pulled a so-called regional company into the national ranks, and he has done so by honing the dancers into a classical style of astonishing verve and purity. San Francisco Ballet under Helgi Tomasson's leadership is one of the spectacular success stories of the arts in America."&lt;ref name="Kisselgoff"/&gt;

In May 1995, San Francisco Ballet hosted 12 ballet companies from around the world for UNited We Dance: An International Festival. The festival commemorated the 50th anniversary of the signing of the [[United Nations Charter]], which took place at the San Francisco War Memorial and [[Performing arts center|Performing Arts Center]].

In fall 2008, as part of the company's 75th anniversary celebration, San Francisco Ballet embarked on a critically acclaimed four-city American tour with engagements at Chicago's [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater for Music and Dance]], [[New York City Center]], Southern California's [[Segerstrom Center for the Arts]], and the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in Washington, D.C. The year culminated in a New Works Festival of world premieres by 10 of the dance world's most acclaimed choreographers—Julia Adam, Val Caniparoli, Jorma Elo, [[Margaret Jenkins]], James Kudelka, Mark Morris, Yuri Possokhov, Paul Taylor, [[Stanton Welch]], and Christopher Wheeldon. Other anniversary initiatives included a commemorative book, ''San Francisco Ballet at Seventy-Five'', and the broadcast of Tomasson's ''Nutcracker'' in December 2008 on the ''Great Performances: Dance in America'' series on PBS, produced in partnership with [[KQED]] Public Television in San Francisco.

San Francisco Ballet also performed in frequent overseas tours, including engagements at prestigious venues such as the famed [[Palais Garnier|Opéra de Paris-Palais Garnier]] in Paris (1994, 2001); London's [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] (1999, 2004, 2012) and [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] (2002); Athens' Megaron Theatre (2002) and [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus|Herod Atticus Amphitheatre]] (2004); Copenhagen's [[Tivoli Gardens]] (1998, 2010); and the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] at the [[Edinburgh Playhouse]] (1997, 2003). In fall 2009, San Francisco Ballet made its first trip to the People's Republic of China, with performances in Shanghai and Beijing.

In 2012, San Francisco Ballet embarked on the longest tour in the company's history, with engagements in London and Washington, DC, as well as first-time visits to Hamburg, Germany; Moscow; and Sun Valley, Idaho.

==Broadcast and media projects==
In 1978, San Francisco Ballet's Michael Smuin-directed production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' became the first production by a West Coast ballet company, and the first full-length ballet, to be aired by the PBS ''Great Performances: Dance in America'' television series.&lt;ref name="Dancers in Career Transition"/&gt; Under the direction of Smuin, the ballet's 1981 production of ''The Tempest'' became the first ballet to be broadcast live (on PBS) from the War Memorial Opera House. Three years later, the 1984 PBS broadcast of the Ballet's performance of ''A Song for Dead Warriors'' earned Smuin an Emmy.&lt;ref name="Winn"/&gt;

The fruitful relationship between PBS and SF Ballet continues to this day, with regular broadcasts of the Ballet's 2007 production of ''Nutcracker'', choreographed by Helgi Tomasson. I Also in 2007, the Company had its first theatrical release with ''Nutcracker'', shown in limited theaters in Canada, Australia, and the U.S. In 2011, theatrical distributor IndieNetFilms arranged for additional screenings throughout the U.S. and Canada.

In December 2011, the U.S. premiere of [[John Neumeier]]'s ''The Little Mermaid'', performed by San Francisco Ballet, was broadcast nationally on PBS's ''Great Performances: Dance in America'', and also internationally. DVDs of the ''Nutcracker'' and ''The Little Mermaid'' performances were released in 2008 and 2011, respectively. CD recordings of the complete score of ''Nutcracker'' and Shinji Eshima's ''RAkU'' were released in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

==Accolades and awards==
The company has garnered numerous accolades and awards. In 2005, San Francisco Ballet won its first [[Laurence Olivier Award]], in the category of Outstanding Achievement in Dance, for its 2004 fall season at Sadler's Wells Theatre. Of the engagement, London's ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' proclaimed, "Helgi Tomasson's outstanding artistic direction ... has transformed a regional American troupe into one of the world's top ballet companies."&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt; In 2006, in a readers' poll conducted by ''Dance Europe'' magazine, San Francisco Ballet was the first non-European company to be voted "Company of the Year". In 2008, San Francisco Ballet received the Jerome Robbins Award for excellence in dance.

In 2012, Helgi Tomasson was named recipient of the Dance/USA Honor, acknowledging individuals' contributions to dance in America and the role they play in the national dance community.

==Official school==
[[San Francisco Ballet School]], San Francisco Ballet's official school, is America's oldest ballet school. The program includes classes in technique, [[pointe work]], [[pas de deux]], men's technique, contemporary dance, floor [[barre (ballet)|barre]]/conditioning, and character dance. Male and female students are placed in divisions according to age, experience, and ability. More than 50 percent of current San Francisco Ballet dancers received some training at San Francisco Ballet School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ballet School | url = http://school.sfballet.org/history | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and directors===
The school was founded in 1933 as part of the San Francisco Operatic and Ballet School when [[Gaetano Merola]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Opera]], perceived a need for an institution where dancers could be trained to perform in opera productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gereben|first=Janos|title=From Merola to S.F. Ballet School Showcase|url=https://www.sfcv.org/article/from-merola-to-sf-ballet-school-showcase|work=San Francisco Classical Voice|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was under the direction of ballet director Adolph Bolm from 1933 to 1938. Willam Christensen became director from 1938 to 1940, followed by his brother Harold Christensen from 1942 until 1975.&lt;ref name="50&amp;nbsp;years"/&gt; Richard L. Cammack directed the school from 1975 to 1985; he oversaw the move to its current state-of-the-art facilities on Franklin Street in 1983. In 1985, new SF Ballet artistic director Helgi Tomasson appointed Nancy Johnson as school head. Lola de Avila joined as associate director from 1993 to 1999, followed by Gloria Govrin beginning in 1999. In 2006, de Avila returned to serve as associate director until 2012, when Patrick Armand stepped into the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Patrick Armand | url = http://school.sfballet.org/staff/patrick-armand | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School programs===
Admission into the school is by audition only. Students may apply for financial aid and merit-based scholarships. Advanced students may be invited to join the SFBS Trainee Program, a one- to two-year pre-professional program established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Trainee Program | url = http://school.sfballet.org/trainee | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 150 students are chosen by audition to dance in the yearly SF Ballet production of ''Nutcracker''. The most advanced students may also dance with SF Ballet in the repertory season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stage Experience | url = http://school.sfballet.org/school/stage-experience | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also runs a pre-ballet program for children ages 4–7; after completing the program, students of age who wish to continue study must audition in order to continue at the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pre-ballet | url = http://school.sfballet.org/pre-ballet | accessdate = October 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Francisco Ballet Orchestra==
Founded in 1975 to serve as San Francisco Ballet's official permanent orchestra, San Francisco Ballet Orchestra (SFBO) holds the rare position of being one of three major orchestras in a single city. The orchestra debuted at the end of 1975 with ''Nutcracker'' and has met with both audience and critical acclaim ever since, becoming known by the 1990s as one of the world's finest ballet orchestras.

SFBO toured with the SF Ballet's touring company from 1978 until 1984. It has accompanied many prestigious international ballet companies that have toured to the San Francisco Bay Area, including [[The Royal Ballet]], the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[Stuttgart Ballet]], [[Hamburg Ballet]],the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[Paul Taylor Dance Company]], [[American Ballet Theatre]], and the [[Paris Opéra Ballet]]. In 1995, the orchestra took on the remarkable task of accompanying 13 international dance companies over the space of a single week in the UNited We Dance Festival.

The 49-member orchestra accompanies SF Ballet throughout its winter and spring repertory seasons. It also performs apart from the Company; it debuted solely as an orchestra in 1979 at the [[Herbst Theatre]] in San Francisco's War Memorial Veterans Building, playing a program that included works by [[Haydn]], [[Ives]], and [[Vivaldi]].

===San Francisco Ballet Orchestra music directors===
The orchestra was led by Denis de Coteau from 1975 until 1998, when de Coteau's battle with terminal cancer forced him to step down from the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Denis-de-Coteau-s-legacy-at-Ballet-lives-on-3230008.php | title=Denis de Coteau's legacy at Ballet lives on | accessdate=October 14, 2013 | date=February 1, 2008 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |author=Kosman, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil de Cou]], who had been serving as conductor since 1995, then assumed the role of music director, leading the Orchestra until 2001, when he left to join Washington D.C.'s [[National Symphony Orchestra]].

'''Sir John Dalrymple of Cousland, 4th Baronet''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FSA(Scot)]] (1726 – 26 February 1810) was a Scottish advocate, judge, chemist and author. He is best known for his ''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland from the dissolution of the last parliament of Charles II until the sea battle of La Hogue'', first published in 1771. A new edition of 1790 carried on to the capture of the French and Spanish navies at Vigo. The Dalrymples formed a dynasty among the legal profession in Scotland. Although a central figures in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and a friend of persons like [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]], Dalrymple's writings were not appreciated and he has been described as an irritating member of the Edinburgh literati.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Sir John Dalrymple 1726–1810&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Sir John was the son of Sir William Dalrymple of Cranstoun, 3rd Baronet (1704–1771) and a cousin of [[William Dalrymple-Crichton, 4th Earl of Stair]]. His mother was Agnes Crawford (died 1755). He was educated at [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] universities, Dalrymple was admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]] in 1748. He served as Solicitor to the Board of Excise, and as a [[Baron of the Exchequer (Scotland)|Baron of the Exchequer]] (1776–1807).

On Thomas Hamilton's death in 1779, Sir John inherited Oxenfoord, and began laying out the gardens. He published his ''Essays on Different Natural Situations of Gardens'' in 1774, which became an influential book at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/gardens_search_results.htm/gardenssearchmoreinfo.htm?s=&amp;r=&amp;bool=0&amp;PageID=2337&amp;more_info=Site |title=Oxenfoord Castle: Site history |work=An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783 Dalrymple was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In later life his Edinburgh house was at 15 Buccleuch Place, just south of George Square.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1807–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir John Dalrymple died on 26 February 1810.

==Family==
In 1760 Dalrymple married his cousin, Elizabeth Hamilton MacGill,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Sir John Dalrymple 1726-1810&lt;/ref&gt; daughter and heiress of Thomas Hamilton of [[Fala, Midlothian|Fala]], who himself had inherited [[Oxenfoord Castle]], property of the [[Viscount of Oxfuird|Viscounts of Oxfuird]]. This led him to adopt her name upon her inheritance. They had thirteen children only five of whom still lived at the time of his death.

==''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland''==
[[David Hume]], in the course of writing his ''[[The History of England (Hume)|History of England]]'', requested that Dalrymple search the French state archives.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalrymple discovered that the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] did indeed contain a provision that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] convert to Roman Catholicism, and that there was a secret agreement between Charles and Louis XIV made in March 1681. He also uncovered "King William's Chest" at Kensington Palace, which contained the original ''[[Invitation to William]]'' from the Immortal Seven. When Dalrymple, "a devoted [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]]", saw that he had discovered the original, he was filled with emotion: "Immortal Seven! whose memories Britain can never sufficiently revere".&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He published this in the first volume of his ''Memoirs'' in 1771. However, when he returned to the French archives for the second volume (published in 1773), he found in the French Ambassador's despatches evidence that the legendary Whig martyr [[Algernon Sidney]] had accepted money from Louis XIV in 1678 and that [[William Russell, Lord Russell]] had negotiated with him. Dalrymple wrote: "When I found Lord Russell intriguing with the Court of Versailles, and Algernon Sidney taking money from it, I felt very near the same shock as if I had seen a son turn his back in the day of battle."&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first volume of Dalrymple's ''Memoirs'' appeared in 1771, Hume criticised it: "There is not a new circumstance of the least importance from the beginning to the end of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; He said of the controversy surrounding the revelations on Russell and Sidney:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is amusing to observe the general, and I may say national rage, excited by the late discovery of this secret negotiation [with the French Court]; chiefly on account of Algernon Sidney, whom the blind prejudices of party had exalted into a hero. His ingratitude and breach of faith in applying for the King's pardon, and immediately on his return entering into cabals for rebellion, form a conduct much more criminal than the taking of French gold. Yet the former circumstance was always known, and always disregarded. But everything connected with France is supposed in England to be polluted beyond all possibility of expiation. Even Lord Russell, whose conduct in this negotiation was only factious, and that in an ordinary degree, is imagined to be dishonoured by the same discovery.&lt;ref&gt;http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=652&amp;chapter=62166&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a discussion with [[James Boswell]], [[Samuel Johnson]] said of the discoveries on Russell and Sidney:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JOHNSON. "Why, Sir, every body who had just notions of government thought them rascals before. It is well that all mankind now see them to be rascals." BOSWELL. "But, Sir, may not those discoveries be true without their being rascals?" JOHNSON. "Consider, Sir; would any of them have been willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France? Depend upon it, Sir, he who does what he is afraid should be known, has something rotten about him. This Dalrymple seems to be an honest fellow; for he tells equally what makes against both sides. But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing: it is the mere bouncing of a school-boy. Great He! but greater She! and such stuff."&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Maurice Ashley (historian)|Maurice Ashley]] wrote that the publication of the ''Memoirs'' was "a striking change in the historiography of the revolution" as he had access to important papers.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Ashley, 'King James II and the Revolution of 1688: Some Reflections on the Historiography', in H. E. Bell &amp; R. L. Ollard (eds.), ''Historical Essays. 1600–1750. Presented to David Ogg'' (London: Adam &amp; Charles Black, 1963), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. P. Kenyon]] has said that the "careful and accurate transcripts [Dalrymple] published... [of] key documents have been a boon to other historians right down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9523">The '''Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission''' was a federal commission established within the Department of the Interior to oversee the America's Industrial Heritage Project. It was created in 1988 as a  means  for  "recognizing,  preserving,  promoting,  and  interpreting  the cultural  heritage  of  the  9-county  region  in  southwestern Pennsylvania associated with the three basic industries of iron and steel, coal, and transportation. &lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. 100–698, § 1, title I, §§ 101–105, Nov. 19, 1988, 102 Stat.  4618,  as  amended  by  Pub.  L.  104–333,  div.  I,  title VIII,  § 814(d)(1)(L),  Nov.  12,  1996,  110  Stat.  4196;  Pub.

=== America's Industrial Heritage Project (AIHP) ===
The purpose of America's Industrial Heritage Project is twofold. First, there will be an examination of the significant contribution of the region's iron, steel, coal, and transportation industries, which helped fuel and move America's industrial growth and development and establish its standing among the nations of the world. Many of the region's cultural resources relate not only to its heritage but to the present and future as well. Second, in addition to the historic sites, the project will use sites within Johnstown and Altoona as focal points for a nine-county tourism promotion program. Tourism development efforts will take advantage of the region's scenic, natural, and recreational areas and will include these resources as integral to the planning process. Much of the project's background is based in a 1985 National Park Service (NPS) study of the
region entitled Reconnaissance Survey of Western Pennsylvania Roads and Sites. The NPS study identified the significant cultural resources at Johnstown and Altoona as focal points for new tourism initiatives. &lt;ref&gt; 1990 National Park Service (NPS) pamphlet on the AIHP.{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====East Broad Top Railroad National Historic Landmark ====
Early on in AIHP planning, Altoona, Pennsylvania, was identified as the focal point around which the story of rail transportation could revolve. However, other resources in the nine-county area are integral components of the rail transportation theme of the AIHP.&lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"&gt;Study of Alternatives: East Broad Top Railroad: America's Industrial Heritage Project, Southwestern Pennsylvania: draft, 1990 National Park Service [https://archive.org/details/studyofalternati00btop Accessed] on October 8, 2017. [https://archive.org/details/studyofalternati00btop pdf] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two such resources were the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site]] (a unit of the Park Service) and [[Horseshoe_Curve_(Pennsylvania)|Horseshoe Curve]] (a national historic landmark). &lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"/&gt; A third resource was the privately owned [[East Broad Top Railroad and Coal Company]] &lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"/&gt; relating to the "secondary theme of support industries, including refractory industries, timber, and iron ore production." &lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"/&gt; 
For the America's Industrial Heritage Project, the East Broad Top Railroad National Historic Landmark was "...the best remaining example in the nation of a regional narrow-gauge railroad system ...(and) ... probably the only opportunity in the nation to tell a comprehensive railroad industry story."  &lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"/&gt; The landmark however was "...seriously threatened through deterioration, lack of operating capital, and legal threats to the right-of-way." &lt;ref name="NPS1990Draft"/&gt; Although the heritage project made efforts to preserve the landmark, they were not successful before the Commission was sunset in 2008.

'''Theophylact Simocatta''' ([[Byzantine Greek]]: Θεοφύλακτος Σιμοκάτ(τ)ης ''Theophylaktos Simokat(t)es''; {{lang-la|Theophylactus Simocattus}})&lt;ref&gt;"Snub-nosed cat". Other forms of the name are ''Simocattos'' and ''Simocatos''.&lt;/ref&gt; was an early seventh-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historiographer, arguably ranking as the last historian of [[Late Antiquity]], writing in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 630) about the late [[Maurice (emperor)|Emperor Maurice]] (582–602).&lt;ref&gt;J.D.C. Frendo, "History and Panegyric in the Age of Heraclius: The Literary Background to the Composition of the 'Histories' of Theophylact Simocatta", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[Image:Cherub plaque Louvre MRR245 n2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] receiving the submission of the [[Sassanid]] king [[Khosrau II]] – during Simocatta's times (plaque from a cross. Champlevé enamel over gilt copper, 1160–1170, Meuse Valley). Housed at the [[Louvre]].]]
Simocatta is best known as the author of a history in eight books, of the reign of the emperor  [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582–602), for which period he is the best and oldest authority. However, his work is of lesser stature than that of [[Procopius]] and his self-consciously classicizing style is pompous, but he is an important source of information concerning the seventh-century [[Slavs]], the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and the [[Persia]]ns, and the emperor's tragic end.&lt;ref&gt;Important editions published in 1609, ed. pr. by [[Johan Isaksson Pontanus|J. Pontanus]], and [[Carl Gotthard de Boor|C.G. de Boor]] in 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentions the [[Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628|war]] of [[Heraclius]] against the Persians (610–28), but not [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|that against the Arabs]] (beginning 634), so it is likely that he was writing around 630. Among his sources he used the history of [[John of Epiphania]].

[[Edward Gibbon]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; His want of judgement renders him diffuse in trifles and concise in the most interesting facts.&lt;ref&gt;E. Gibbon, ''The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', The Folio Society (1997), ''s.v. "Simocatta"''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This notwithstanding, Simocatta's general trustworthiness is admitted. The history contains an introduction in the form of a dialogue between [[History]] and [[Philosophy]].

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] translated Greek verses by Theophylact into [[Latin]] prose and had his translation, dedicated to his uncle [[Lucas Watzenrode]], published in [[Kraków]] in 1509 by [[Johann Haller]]. It was the only book that Copernicus ever brought out on his own account.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Armitage, ''The World of Copernicus'', pp. 75–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simocatta was also the author of ''Physical Problems'', a work on [[natural history]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ed. J. Ideler in ''Physici et medici Graeci minores'', i. 1841.&lt;/ref&gt; and of a collection of 85 essays in epistolary form.&lt;ref&gt;The best edition was published in 1873 by R. Hercher in ''Epistolographi Graeci''. The letters were translated into [[Latin language|Latin]] by [[Copernicus]] in 1509, reprinted in 1873 by F. Hipler in ''Spicilegium Copernicanum''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the Far East, Simocatta wrote a [[Sino-Roman relations#Roman geography|generally accurate depiction]] of the [[History of China|reunification of China]] by [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] (r. 581-604 AD) of the [[Sui Dynasty]], with the conquest of the rival [[Chen Dynasty]] in [[Northern and Southern dynasties|southern China]], correctly placing these events within the reign period of Byzantine ruler [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]].&lt;ref name="yule 1915 pp29-31"&gt;Yule (1915), pp 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Simocatta also provided cursory information about the [[geography of China]] along with its [[Chinese culture|customs and culture]], deeming its people "idolatrous" but wise in governance.&lt;ref name="yule 1915 pp29-31"/&gt; He also related how the ruler was named ''Taisson'', the meaning of which was "Son of God", possibly derived from Chinese ''Tianzi'' ([[Son of Heaven]], a title of the [[emperor of China]]) or even the name of the contemporaneous ruler [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] of [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), p. 29, footnote #4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to radio host Hal Turner, in December 2006 and January 2007 individuals who identified themselves as Anonymous took Turner's website offline, costing him thousands of dollars in [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] bills. As a result, Turner sued [[4chan]], [[eBaum's World]], 7chan, and other websites for [[copyright infringement]]. He lost his plea for an injunction, however, and failed to receive letters from the court, which caused the lawsuit to lapse.&lt;ref name="halsuecopyright"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-njdce/case_no-2:2007cv00306/case_id-198438/ |publisher=Justia |title=Harold C.

===Chris Forcand arrest===
On December 7, 2007, the Canada-based ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' newspaper published a report on the arrest of the alleged Internet predator Chris Forcand.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; Forcand, 53, was charged with two counts of luring a child under the age of 14, attempt to invite sexual touching, attempted exposure, possessing a dangerous weapon, and carrying a concealed weapon.&lt;ref name="PoliceReport"&gt;{{cite news |author=Constable George Schuurman, Public Information, for Detective Constable Janelle Blackadar, Sex Crimes Unit |title=Man facing six charges in Child Exploitation investigation, Photograph released, Chris Forcand, 53 |work=News Release |publisher=[[Toronto Police Service]] |date=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stated that Forcand was already being tracked by "cyber-[[vigilante]]s who seek to out anyone who presents with a sexual interest in children" before police investigations commenced.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Jenkins |title=Man trolled the web for girls: cops |url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2007/12/07/4712680-sun.html |work=Toronto Sun |date=December 7, 2007 |accessdate=February 19, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121205070551/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2007/12/07/4712680-sun.html |archivedate=December 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Global Television Network]] report identified the group responsible for Forcand's arrest as a "self-described Internet vigilante group called Anonymous" who contacted the police after some members were "propositioned" by Forcand with "disgusting photos of himself". The report also stated that this is the first time a suspected Internet predator was arrested by the police as a result of [[Internet vigilantism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite news |author=[http://www.canada.com/globaltv/ontario/personalities/story.html?id=ff2d5236-9ff0-4ea7-b8ab-1123d851219b Gus Kim] (reporter) |title=Internet Justice? |work=[[Global Television Network|Global News]] |publisher=[[CanWest Global Communications]] |date=December 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epilepsy Foundation forum invasion===
{{Main|Epilepsy Foundation#2008 forum invasion|l1=Epilepsy Foundation: 2008 forum invasion}}
On March 28, 2008, ''[[Wired News]]'' reported that "Internet [[griefer]]s"—a slang term for people whose only interests are in harassing others&lt;ref name="ramadgeepilepsy"/&gt;—assaulted an [[epilepsy]] support forum run by the [[Epilepsy Foundation|Epilepsy Foundation of America]].&lt;ref name="wiredepilepsy"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kevin Poulsen |title=Hackers Assault Epilepsy Patients via Computer |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2008/03/epilepsy |work=[[Wired News]] |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[JavaScript]] code and flashing computer animations were posted with the intention of triggering [[migraine]] headaches and [[seizure]]s in [[photosensitive epilepsy|photosensitive and pattern-sensitive epileptics]].&lt;ref name="wiredepilepsy"/&gt; According to ''Wired News'', circumstantial evidence suggested that the attack was perpetrated by Anonymous users, with the initial attack posts on the epilepsy forum blaming [[eBaum's World]]. Members of the epilepsy forum claimed they had found a thread in which the attack was being planned at 4chan.org, an [[imageboard]] that has been described as a stronghold for Anonymous. The thread, like all old threads eventually do on these types of imageboards, has since cycled to deletion.&lt;ref name="wiredepilepsy"/&gt;

''[[News.com.au]]'' reported that the administrators of 4chan.org had posted an open letter claiming that the attacks had been carried out by the Church of Scientology "to ruin the public opinion of Anonymous, to lessen the effect of the lawful protests against their virulent organization" under the Church's [[Fair Game (Scientology)|fair game]] policy.&lt;ref name="ramadgeepilepsy"&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew Ramadge |title=Anonymous attack targets epilepsy sufferers |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,23460969-5014239,00.html |work=News.com.au |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defacement of SOHH and AllHipHop websites===
{{Main|SOHH#Defacement|l1=SOHH: Defacement}}

In late June 2008, users who identified themselves as Anonymous claimed responsibility for a series of attacks against the [[SOHH]] (Support Online Hip Hop) website.&lt;ref name="MTV SOHH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1590117/20080627/id_0.jhtml |title=Hip-Hop Sites Hacked By Apparent Hate Group; SOHH, AllHipHop Temporarily Suspend Access |accessdate=July 18, 2008 |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=June 30, 2008 |work=MTV |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was reported to have begun in retaliation for insults made by members of SOHH's "Just Bugging Out" forum against members of Anonymous. The attack against the website took place in stages, as Anonymous users flooded the SOHH forums, which were then shut down. On June 23, 2008, the group which identified themselves as Anonymous organized [[DDoS]] attacks against the website, successfully eliminating 60% of the website's service capacity. On June 27, 2008, the hackers utilized [[cross-site scripting]] to deface the website's main page with satirical Nazi images and headlines referencing numerous racial stereotypes and slurs, and also successfully stole information from SOHH employees.&lt;ref name="SOHH NPR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92033455 |title=Hip Hop Sites Attacked by Hate Groups |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |last=Chideya |first=Farai |authorlink=Farai Chideya |date=June 30, 2008 |work=[[News &amp; Notes]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]}} (Radio broadcast)&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defacement, the website was temporarily shut down by its administration.

A /b/ user then logged in and changed the password, posting a screenshot of his sending an email to a friend of Palin's informing her of the new password on the /b/ thread.

In September 2009, the group reawakened "in order to protect civil rights" after several governments began to block access to its imageboards. The [[blacklisting]] of Krautchan.net in Germany infuriated many, but the tipping point was the Australian government's plans for ISP-level censorship of the internet. The policy was spearheaded by [[Stephen Conroy]] and had been driven aggressively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Adam |last=Turner |url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/conroy-named-internet-villain-of-the-year-20090713-di8q.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Conroy named Internet Villain of the Year |date=July 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] since its election in 2007.

In 2010, several [[Bollywood]] companies hired [[Aiplex Software]] to launch DDoS attacks on websites that did not respond to software [[takedown notice]]s.&lt;ref name="theregister1"&gt;{{cite news |title=4chan launches DDoS against entertainment industry |first=John |last=Leyden |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=September 22, 2010 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/20/4chan_ddos_mpaa_riaa/ |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; File sharing activists then created Operation Payback in September 2010 in retaliation.&lt;ref name="theregister1"/&gt; The original plan was to attack Aiplex Software directly, but upon finding some hours before the planned DDoS that another individual had taken down the firm's website on their own, Operation Payback moved to launching attacks against the websites of copyright stringent organizations, [[law firm]]s and other websites.&lt;ref name="pandalabssecurity"&gt;{{cite news |title=4chan Users Organize Surgical Strike Against MPAA |newspaper=Pandalabs Security |first=Sean-Paul |last=Correll |date=September 17, 2010 |url= http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/4chan-users-organize-ddos-against-mpaa/ |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grew into multiple DDoS attacks against anti-piracy groups and law firms.

On April 2, 2011, Anonymous launched an attack on the media giant Sony, named #opsony, as a part of Operation Payback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn |first=John E |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/224360/anonymous_launches_attack_against_sony_ps3_websites.html |title=Anonymous Launches Attack Against Sony PS3 Websites |publisher=PCWorld |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous claims the attack a success after they took down the PlayStation Network and other related PlayStation Websites. Anonymous' actions also included personal harassment of employees and their families. The PlayStation Network subsequently has had lengthy outages, although Anonymous claims that this is not due to any officially sanctioned action on their part, but may be due to sub-groups of Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/04/anonymous-goes-after-sony-makes-it-personal-very-personal.ars|title=Anonymous goes after Sony, makes it personal... very personal|author=Nate Anderson|publisher=ars technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony Corp. came to Anonymous' attention after it [[Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz|took legal action]] against [[George Hotz]] (a.k.a. GeoHot), the coder behind a popular tool that allows homebrew software to run on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). Sony is also taking legal action against Alexander Egorenkov (aka Graf_Chokolo) for his efforts to restore Linux to the PS3.
The reason why Hotz and Egorenkov did that follows on from Sony's decision to remove the system's OtherOS feature, which enabled the use of Linux. While the pair has earned respect for their research and technical skills, they have also gained the attention of Sony's legal team.
With a lawsuit now against Hotz this attracted the attention of Anonymous. They claim that Sony is breaching the free speech border, and this is the reason for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201114/7017/Anonymous-Operation-Sony-is-a-double-edged-sword|title=Anonymous' Operation: Sony is a double-edged sword|author=Steve Ragan|publisher=Tech Herald|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119051531/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201114/7017/Anonymous-Operation-Sony-is-a-double-edged-sword|archivedate=November 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2011, the group launched attacks on ninety-one websites of the [[Malaysian government]] in response to the blocking of websites like Wikileaks and [[The Pirate Bay]] within the country, which the group labels censorship of a basic human right to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|title=Hackers Target Malaysian Government Sites|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387108,00.asp|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[PC Magazine]]|agency=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Orlando===
On June 20, 2011, members of the group took down the websites of the [[Orlando, Florida]] Chamber of Commerce and inserted a message into the website of the [[Universal Orlando Resort]] requesting that users "boycott Orlando". The group did so in response to the arrests of members of [[Food Not Bombs]] for feeding the homeless in [[Lake Eola Park]] against city ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Damron|first=David|title=Hackers crash web sites to protest Orlando's homeless feeding restrictions|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-hackers-attack-sites-for-homeless-20110620,0,7225913.story|accessdate=June 21, 2011|newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|date=June 20, 2011|agency=[[Tribune Company]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zb2JybnE?url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-hackers-attack-sites-for-homeless-20110620,0,7225913.story|archivedate=June 21, 2011|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group had planned and announced the attack on their IRC channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mack|first=Eric|title=Anonymous Plans Attack on City of Orlando Website, IRC Chatter Suggests|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/230432/anonymous_plans_attack_on_city_of_orlando_website_irc_chatter_suggests.html|accessdate=June 21, 2011|newspaper=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date=June 16, 2011|agency=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zb2cJRKl?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/230432/anonymous_plans_attack_on_city_of_orlando_website_irc_chatter_suggests.html|archivedate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13952864 |title=BBC News - Hacker group Anonymous declares war on Orlando, Florida |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=June 28, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has vowed to take a different Orlando-related website offline every day, and have also targeted the re-election website of [[Mayor of Orlando]] [[Buddy Dyer]] and the [[Orlando International Airport]].

===Operation Intifada===
On June 28, 2011, Anonymous announced that within the next 24 hours, it would hack into the website of the [[Knesset]], the legislature of [[Israel]], and knock it offline. It was stated that the planned attacks were a response to alleged hacking attacks by Israeli intelligence such as the [[Stuxnet]] virus, a computer virus which allegedly was created by Israeli and U.S. intelligence and targeted the [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4088515,00.html |title=Knesset targeted by hackers - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=June 20, 1995 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Anti-Security===
{{main|Operation AntiSec}}
The group collaborated with [[LulzSec]] to hack the websites of a number of government and corporate sources and release information from them.&lt;ref name=newantisec&gt;{{cite news|last=Olivarez-Giles|first=Nathan|title=AntiSec 'hackers without borders' claim new hack on Arizona state police|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/06/antisec-hackers-leak-files-said-to-be-from-arizona-state-police.html|accessdate=June 30, 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 29, 2011|agency=[[Tribune Company]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zq3OxQQv?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/06/antisec-hackers-leak-files-said-to-be-from-arizona-state-police.html|archivedate=June 30, 2011|location=[[Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weisenthal|first=Joe|title=Notorious Hacker Group LulzSec Just Announced That It's Finished |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lulzsec-finished-2011-6|accessdate=June 25, 2011|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|date=June 25, 2011|agency=Silicon Alley Insider|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ziS1EJcn?url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lulzsec-finished-2011-6|archivedate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as targeting American sites, Anonymous also targeted government sites in [[Tunisia]], [[Anguilla]], [[Brazil]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Turkey]], and [[Australia]]. On July 21, Anonymous released two [[PDF]]s allegedly taken from [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388823,00.asp |title=Anonymous: We Hacked NATO &amp;#124; News &amp; Opinion |publisher=PCMag.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Facebook===
In August 2011, someone created an account on [[Twitter]] with the name ''OP_Facebook'' and announced the "Operation Facebook". According to the links on the post, Anonymous was going to take down [[Facebook]] on November 5, 2011.&lt;ref name=opfacebook&gt;{{cite news|last=Poeter|first=Damon|title=Anonymous Vows to 'Destroy' Facebook on the November 5 at 12h15|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2390768,00.asp|accessdate=August 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2011|work=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date "November 5" is believed to be attributed to the comics [[V for Vendetta]], where the character "V" conducts his major plans every fifth of November in memory of Guy Fawkes. This operation isn't assuredly an Anonymous one. There was an earlier OpFacebook that was abandoned, and this current plan is a revival of the communication channels previously used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Parmy|title=Why The Anonymous Facebook 'Plot' Was A Dud|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2011/08/11/why-the-anonymous-facebook-plot-was-a-dud/|accessdate=August 11, 2011|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan is contentious and does not appear to be supported by the majority of those who say they are part of Anonymous. Operation Facebook, against popular belief, never showed any signs of itself. Facebook continued to run after the supposed Operation Facebook was to begin. On that day, Anonymous tweeted that they never announced Operation Facebook and that this was some guy's idea of a joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tsukayama|first=Hayley|title=Facebook 'operation' shows off Anonymous's cracks|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/faster-forward/post/facebook-operation-shows-off-anonymouss-cracks/2011/08/10/gIQAL55A7I_blog.html|accessdate=August 11, 2011|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=August 10, 2011|agency=[[The Washington Post Company]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation BART===
{{main|Bay Area Rapid Transit#2011 Charles Hill killing and aftermath}}
In August 2011, in response to [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]'s shutdown of cell phone service in an attempt to disconnect protesters from assembling in response to a police shooting, as well as the shooting itself, Anonymous sent out a mass email/fax bomb to BART personnel and organized multiple mass physical protests at the network's Civic Center station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Poeter |first=Damon |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2391160,00.asp |title=Anonymous BART Protest Shuts Down Several Underground Stations |publisher=PCMag.com |date=August 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous also hacked the BART website, releasing the personal information of 102 BART police officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chen |first=Caroline |url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2011/08/anonymous_hacks_bart_police_we.php |title=Anonymous Hacks BART Police Website, Releases Personal Information of 100 Officers - San Francisco - News - The Snitch |publisher=Blogs.sfweekly.com |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as account information for about 2,000 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=by Cecilia Vega |author2=Lilian Kim |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/san_francisco&amp;id=8306165 |title=Website for BART customers hacked by Anonymous; hundreds of passwords compromised &amp;#124; abc7news.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=August 14, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shooting Sheriffs Saturday===
In an event dubbed "Shooting Sheriffs Saturday," Anonymous hacked 70 (mostly rural) law enforcement websites and released 10 GB of leaked information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills |first=Elinor |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20089054-245/antisec-hackers-post-stolen-police-data-as-revenge-for-arrests |title=AntiSec hackers post stolen police data as revenge for arrests &amp;#124; InSecurity Complex - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=August 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is likely a reference to the song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" by [[Bob Marley]].

===Support of Occupy Wall Street===
Several contingents of Anonymous have given support to the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement, with members attending local protests and blogs run by members covering [[Occupy movement|the movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anonnews.org/?p=press&amp;a=item&amp;i=1185 |title=Everything Anonymous |publisher=AnonNews.org |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126095447/http://anonnews.org/?p=press |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anonops.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/601oSWNAe?url=http://anonops.blogspot.com/|archivedate=July 8, 2011 |title=AnonOps Communications |publisher=Anonops.blogspot.com |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anonywebz1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anonywebz.com/ |title=LNN - Breaking News &amp; Video News |publisher=Anonywebz.com |date=January 18, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Syria===
In early August, Anonymous hacked the [[Syria]]n [[Ministry of Defense (Syria)|Defense Ministry]] website and replaced it with a [[vector graphics|vector image]] of the pre-[[Ba'ath Party|Ba'athist]] flag, a symbol of the pro-democracy movement in the country, as well as a message supporting the [[2011 Syrian uprising]] and calling on members of the [[Syrian Army]] to defect to protect protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/08/08/139094501/syria-is-hacked-by-anonymous-and-pressed-by-gulf-allies|agency=National Public Radio|date=August 8, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2011|title=Syria Is Hacked By Anonymous, And Pressed By Gulf Allies|first=Bill|last=Chappell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition to Los Zetas===
On October 6, 2011, Anonymous released a video stating that [[Los Zetas]] had kidnapped one of the group's members, and threatened that unless the hostage was freed, they would publish personal information about members of the cartel and their collaborators in politics, police, military, and business, which might lead to their prosecution by Mexican authorities, or targeting by rival cartels. The website of Gustavo Rosario Torres, a former Tabasco state prosecutor, was subsequently defaced with a message suggesting his involvement with the organization.&lt;ref name="townnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.townnews.com/shared-content/subscription/authenticate/index.php?mode=start&amp;domain=lmtonline.com&amp;usereg=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2F%2F%2Farticles%2F2011%2F10%2F29%2Ffront%2Fnews%2Fdoc4eac61a84b8ed028891334.txt&amp;discover=0&amp;amex=0 |title=Town News |publisher=secure.townnews.com|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}{{dead link |date=February 2017 |fix-attempted=yes}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/155007/anonymous-tells-mexican-cartel-they-are-next/|title=Anonymous tells Mexican cartel they are next|author=Steven Hodson|date=October 29, 2011|publisher=Inquisitr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/10/anonymous-vs-zetas/ | title=Previous post Anonymous Threatens Mexico’s Murderous Drug Lords|author=Robert Beckhusen | date=October 30, 2011 | publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/242843/anonymous_takes_on_mexican_drug_cartel.html|title=Anonymous Takes On Mexican Drug Cartel|author=John P Mello Jr.|date=October 30, 2011|publisher=PC World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/10/30/mexico-video-threatens-to-disclose-zetas-allies|title=Mexico: Video threatens to disclose Zetas allies|agency=Associated Press|publisher=WorldNow/WLIO|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZL0E1J7wOg |title=Anonymous video copy (cited by previous references as the October 6 video by Anonymous) |publisher=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early November, Los Zetas reportedly freed the kidnapped victim without knowledge of its Anonymous affiliation, as announced on Anonymous Iberoamerica blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anonopsibero.blogspot.com/2011/11/comunicado-opcartel.html |title=Comunicado #OpCartel ~ Anonymous Iberoamerica |publisher=Anonopsibero.blogspot.com |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Albanesius |first=Chloe |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395863,00.asp |title=Drug Cartel Releases 'Anonymous' Hostage, But Battle Continues &amp;#124; News &amp; Opinion |publisher=PCMag.com |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following widespread news coverage of the video, reporters did not find evidence of a previous Anonymous action matching the description given, and found little evidence of support among Anonymous members, particularly in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/opcartel/|title=Anonymous Skeptical of Proposed Attack on Zetas Drug Cartel|author=Quinn Norton|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many blogs run by members of Anonymous also report on this.&lt;ref name="anonywebz1"/&gt;

===Attack on Stratfor===
On December 24, claims were made that Anonymous stole thousands of e-mail addresses and credit card information from security firm [[Stratfor]]. Reportedly, Anonymous commented that this is because the data was unencrypted, however Anonymous put out a press-release stating "This hack is most definitely not the work of Anonymous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16330396|title='Anonymous' hackers hit US security firm Stratfor|author=BBC News|date=December 26, 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Deepthroat===
Anonymous, along with 4chan's /b/ board, Reddit, Twitter and Funnyjunk, teamed together to make a raid on [[9gag]] called Operation Deepthroat. The raid was separated in multiple teams: The first team, the Alpha Team, spammed “horrifying” images of child pornography, gore, furries and scat on 9gag's site, followed by fake accounts made by 4chan, Anonymous, Reddit, Twitter and Funnyjunk voting the spam up, effectively overloading the servers. The second team, the Gold Team, used the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] and the [[High Orbit Ion Cannon]] (LOIC and HOIC, respectively), and fired on 9gag, which DDoS'd the entire site down. The third team, the Red Team, was tasked to spread the information of the OP on 4chan, Reddit, Twitter and Funnyjunk, and also supported the other teams. The fourth and final team, the White Team, was tasked with spamming chat sites such as Omegle and Chatroulette with inappropriate messages, such as “9gag.com is the place for Child Pornography!”, in order to tarnish 9gag's "wholesome" and "family-friendly” name. The reason behind this whole operation began when 9gag took several of 4chan's memes and called them theirs, followed by making a legion called the '9gag army', a ripoff of Anonymous. The operation began on December 21, 2011 at 12:00&amp;nbsp;AM, and ended at 11:59&amp;nbsp;PM. 9gag was mainly offline for the next few days, except for some servers which managed to protect themselves from the LOIC and HOIC. Prior to the operation, 4chan users used fake accounts to trick 9gaggers into DDoS'ing themselves, saying the coordinates were that of 4chan. The pre-raid attack was mostly ineffective, however, as only a few servers went down.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Occupy Nigeria===
In solidarity with [[Occupy Nigeria]], Anonymous has joined forces with the [[People's Liberation Front (group)|People's Liberation Front]] and the Naija Cyber Hactivists of Nigeria. Anonymous promised “a relentless and devastating assault upon the web assets of the Nigerian government” in support of Occupy Nigeria.
This was in protest to the removal of fuel subsidy that the majority of impoverished Nigerians depend upon for their very existence, causing the price of fuel and transportation to skyrocket and therefore extreme hardship for the majority of Nigerians. On January 13, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission website was hacked, with a false report of the arrest of people involved in the oil sector replacing the normal page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pmnewsnigeria.com/2012/01/13/subsidy-protest-efcc-site-hacked-with-false-arrests-oil-moguls/ |title=Subsidy Protest: EFCC site hacked with False arrests of oil moguls |publisher=P.M.

=== Hong Kong National Education ===
In mid-September 2012, Anonymous hackers threatened the Hong Kong government organization, known as National Education Centre.

The new syllabus has come under heavy criticism and international media attention, as it does not award students based on how much factual information is learned, but instead grades and evaluates students based on their level of emotional attachment and approval of the [[Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.dv.nextmedia.com/actionnews/local/20120916/18017424/20001202 攻陷國教網站　黑客匿名：要革命！].

=== Operation Single Gateway ===
After the failure of its single gateway system, the Thai government proposed amendments to the existing Computer Crime Act in May 2016, which they approved on December 16. Anonymous declared cyberwar on Thailand after the passing of these amendments.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The amendments allowed the government to censor websites and intercept private communications without a court order or warrant. Anonymous started a Facebook group called "citizens against single gateway" to protest against these acts.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Other anonymous members DDoSed several Thailand government websites. One of these F5-powered DDoS attacks hit Thailand's defense website on December 19. It was later revealed that hackers also breached the Thai Police Office website on December 17. The website of the Tourism and Sports was also targeted and attacked on December 23.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Several Thai citizens who were part of anonymous ranging from ages 17–20 were arrested.

=== Operation Darknet Relaunch ===
Visitors to more than 10,000 Tor-based websites were met with an alarming announcement on February 3, 11:50 AM EST: "Hello, Freedom Hosting II, you have been hacked." A group affiliating itself with Anonymous had compromised servers at Freedom Hosting II, a popular service for hosting websites accessible only through Tor.

The Anonymous hacktivists claimed over 50% of the data stored on the Freedom Hosting II servers contained child pornography. ''International Business Times'' reported that the hackers stole 75 GB worth of files and 2.6 GB of databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/anonymous-hackers-shut-down-freedom-hosting-ii-largest-host-dark-web-sites-1604834|title=Anonymous hackers shut down Freedom Hosting II, the largest host of dark web sites|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2017-02-04|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sarah Jamie Lewis, an independent anonymity and privacy researcher who spotted the mass hack as part of her regular scans of the Onion space (Dark Web sites running on the Tor network), Freedom Hosting II was hosting an estimated 20% of all websites on the Dark Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/3/14497992/freedom-hosting-ii-hacked-anonymous-dark-web-tor|title=An Anonymous group just took down a fifth of the dark web|last=Brandom|first=Russell|date=2017-02-03|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tracksuit''' is an article of [[clothing]] consisting of two parts: [[trousers]] and a [[jacket]] usually with front [[zipper]]. It was originally intended for use in [[sport]]s, mainly for [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]]s to wear over competition clothing (such as running [[shirt]] and [[shorts]] or a [[swimsuit]]) and to take off before competition. In modern times, it has become commonly worn in other contexts. The tracksuit was one of the earliest uses of synthetic fibers in sportswear.&lt;ref name="uniexposed"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craik, Jennifer |title=Uniforms Exposed (Dress, Body, Culture) |publisher= Berg Publishers |location=Oxford, UK |year=2005 |page=171 |isbn=1-85973-804-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A descendant of the tracksuit, the '''shell suit''', which arrived in the late 1980s, was popular with the hip hop and breakdancing scene of the era.&lt;ref name="I Love Shell Suits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveshellsuits.com/history.htm |title=History of The Shellsuit |publisher=Iloveshellsuits.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were manufactured from a mix of [[cellulose triacetate]] and [[polyester]] making them shiny on the outside, with distinctive combinations of colours.&lt;ref name="shellsuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fashion-era.com/fitness_fashion_after_1960.htm |title=Fitness Fashion History after 1960 |accessdate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most tracksuits have a mesh interior which allows the user to wear them without any undergarment such as underwear. This is much like a bathing suit. Many people wear it for [[physical exercise]] sessions. A [[sauna suit]] is a specialized form of tracksuit made of a waterproof fabric such as coated nylon or PVC that is designed to make the wearer sweat profusely.  Sauna suits are primarily used for temporary weight loss.

The tracksuit is also known as a '''warm-up suit''', or '''"warmups"''' for short, as they are intended for athletes to keep their bodies warm before or after competition, and during breaks, especially important in cold weather. In almost all cases, sports teams will wear these garments using a fabric that matches their official team, school, or country colors. The bottoms of tracksuits are also known as [[sweatpants]].

==Fashion history==
Tracksuits have come in and out of fashion over several decades. The period that featured tracksuits as sportswear that was acceptable to wear outside of the gym was the 1960s and 1970s. Tracksuits first became popular around 1975, made out of cotton, polyester, terry cloth, or a mix. In the late 1970s velour became popular, so much so that it became the most used form of fabric on a tracksuit. The trend of wearing athletic clothing continued into the early 1980s. Tracksuits were eventually replaced by shellsuits, which were made out of nylon, in the late 1980s. This trend was short-lived, lasting only a few years.

In the late 1990s, tracksuits made a comeback in mainstream fashion for both men and women. They returned to the fabrics of the 1970s, most notably polyester. The return of tracksuits can largely be credited to music, most notably Rapper [[Jay Z]] and Spice Girl [[Sporty Spice]]. The trend continued into the 2000s, where velour made a comeback, by the likes of [[Juicy Couture]] and other brands. This continued for most of the decade. Tracksuits briefly went out of fashion in the late 2000s, resurfacing in the 2010s with "[[athleisure]]" trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/10-times-celebrities-wore-tracksuits.html|title=Celebrities Wearing Tracksuits|last=Ma|first=Julie|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andriacheng/2018/02/09/here-are-some-more-signs-athleisure-trend-still-has-legs/#4a2ece3e33cb|title=The Athleisure Trend Isn't Taking A Rest|last=Cheng|first=Andria|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, prominent fashion designers have been asked to design tracksuits for the athletes of various [[Olympic games|Olympic]] teams, usually all the athletes representing one country. For example, designer [[Ralph Lauren]] created the USA uniforms for the 2010 [[Winter Olympic Games]] opening ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2012/07/olympics-2012-ralph-lauren-reveals-us-olympic-team-opening-ceremony-outfits.html |title=Olympics 2012: Ralph Lauren reveals U.S. team opening ceremony outfits |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2012-07-10 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sportswear company [[Adidas]] hired Stella McCartney to be the Creative Director for the 2012 GB Olympic Games (by Adidas)—the first time in the history of the games that a leading fashion designer has designed the apparel for a particular country’s team across all competitions for both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Zoe Beaty |url=http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/fashion/archive/2012/03/22/stella-mccartney-s-winning-olympic-kit-for-team-great-britain--first-look.htm |title=Stella McCartney Unveils 2012 Olympics Kit! &amp;#124; Grazia Fashion |publisher=Graziadaily.co.uk |date=2012-03-22 |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3668">'''Virtual archaeology''' is a term introduced in 1990 by archaeologist and computer scientist [[Paul Reilly (computer scientist)|Paul Reilly]] to describe the use of computer based simulations of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example.org 1], Reilly P., 1991. Towards a virtual archaeology. CAA’90. BAR Intern.s. Vol.565:133–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, scientific results related to virtual archaeology were annually discussed, among others, at Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example.org 2], САА https://caaconference.org/ocs/index.php?conference=caa&amp;schedConf=caa2015&lt;/ref&gt; The keyword "visualization" defined the aim of the virtual archaeology in the London Charter Initiative:
{{quote|It should be made clear to users what a computer-based visualisation seeks to represent, for example the existing state, an evidence-based restoration or an hypothetical reconstruction of a cultural heritage object or site, and the extent and nature of any factual uncertainty.|London Charter Initiative (2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example.org 3], [http://www.londoncharter.org/fileadmin/templates/main/docs/london_charter_2_1_en.pdf. London Charter for the computer-based visualisation of cultural heritage. Draft 2.1.]  Accessed 15 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Since its introduction, the focus of the term has been extended, and today it serves as an integration paradigm that allows many modern three-dimensional datasets to be analysed together, taking account preliminary reconstructions of archaeological sites and guiding further investigations, for example through archaeological prospection, historical research or excavation. In this iterative and incremental process, the interpretation and virtual representation of results is only one, albeit important, outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.example.org 4], Sideris A., 2008.

'''Étienne-Gaspard Robert''' (15 June 1763 – 2 July 1837), often known by the stage name of "'''Robertson'''", was a prominent [[Belgium|Belgian]] physicist, [[magic (illusion)|stage magician]] and influential developer of [[phantasmagoria]].  He was described by [[Charles Dickens]] as "an honourable and well-educated shows nolo se rickman".&lt;ref name="Zeitler"&gt;Zeitler, William.  "[http://www.glassarmonica.com/armonica/history/creative/robertson.php E.G. Robertson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612043656/http://www.glassarmonica.com/armonica/history/creative/robertson.php |date=12 June 2008 }}".  Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside his pioneering work on projection techniques for his shows Robert was also a physics lecturer and a keen [[balloon (aircraft)|balloonist]] at a time of great development in aviation.

==Early work==
Born in [[Liège (city)|Liège]] Robert studied at [[Leuven]] and became a professor of [[physics]] specialising in [[optics]].  He was an avid painter and intended to move to France to pursue a career in art.  He moved to Paris in the 1791 and maintained a living as a painter and draughtsman.  While there he attended lectures in [[natural science]] at the [[Collège de France]] as well as those by [[Jacques Charles]], a fellow scientist and important figure in ballooning history.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;  Charles would go on to become a mentor for Robert.

In 1796, during the [[French Revolution]] and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, Robert met with the French government and proposed a method of burning the invading ships of the British [[Royal Navy]].  Based on the myth of the [[Burning-glass|mirrors of Archimedes]] he wanted to employ enormous [[mirror]]s to direct intense amounts of sunlight onto the approaching vessels.  The government turned down his suggestion.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PreCinema"&gt;Burns, Paul.  "[http://www.precinemahistory.net/1750.htm The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750–1799]".  Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AiC"&gt;''Adventures in Cybersound''.  "[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHANTASMAGORIE.html Robertson's Phantasmagoria]".  Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert experimented with various areas of physics, giving public demonstrations about his research into [[galvanism]] and optics in the 1790s and early 19th century.&lt;ref name="AiC" /&gt;

==Phantasmagoria==
Robert attended a new form of [[illusion]] performance in 1793 in the form of a magic lantern show by [[Paul Philidor]] (then under the name of Paul de Philipsthal).  Philidor was one of the earliest known performers of such shows having adapted what he himself had seen by [[Johann Georg Schröpfer]].  With his understanding of optics, Robert realised the potential of what would become "[[phantasmagoria]]".  His further technological developments were combined with his skills in painting and showmanship, developing a [[precursors of film|pre-cinema]] horror show.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;

===Fantoscope===
Robert read the works of 17th-century scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] and was particularly interested in the [[magic lantern]], an early form of [[slide projector]].  He created his own version of the device with several improvements, adding adjustable lenses and a moveable carriage system that would allow the operator to change the size of the projected image.  He also made it possible to project several different images at once using more than one painted glass slider.  The resultant display had a very ghostly effect especially when in a smoky atmosphere.  Through this the operator had the ability to manipulate images projected from an unseen location.&lt;ref name="PrintsGeorge"&gt;''Prints George''.  "[http://www.printsgeorge.com/ArtEccles_Phantasmagoria.htm Phantasmagoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220133605/http://www.printsgeorge.com/ArtEccles_Phantasmagoria.htm |date=20 December 2005 }}".  Accessed 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1799, after further refining the system, he received a patent for his "magic lantern on wheels", naming it the Fantoscope.

===Shows===
[[File:Étienne-Gaspard Robert's ghost illusion.png|thumb|Robert's ghost illusion]]
{{rquote|right|''I am only satisfied if my spectators, shivering and shuddering, raise their hands or cover their eyes out of fear of ghosts and devils dashing towards them''|Étienne-Gaspard Robert&lt;ref name="AiC" /&gt;}}

Robert developed a phantasmagoria show based around his projection system and the use of other effects and techniques.  Robert scripted scenes that involved actors and [[ventriloquism]] alongside his projections, creating a convincing impression of the appearance of ghosts.&lt;ref name="Heard"&gt;Heard, Mervyn.  "[http://www.grand-illusions.com/articles/lantern_of_fear/ The Lantern of Fear]".  Accessed 11 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert used several projection devices in a variety of ways, including [[rear projection effect|rear projection]] and projection onto large pieces of wax-coated [[gauze]] (giving the image a more translucent appearance).&lt;ref name="PreCinema" /&gt;  He also used smoke and mirrors to further disguise the mechanisms behind his show.  His painting skills allowed him to create accurate depictions of famous French heroes such as [[Jean-Paul Marat]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AiC" /&gt;

Robert appeared at the Pavillon de l'Echiquier on 23 January 1798 and performed his first show.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;  His charisma and the never-before-seen visual effects left the audience convinced that they had seen real ghosts, with many left terrified by the performance.

After being investigated by the authorities, Robert's show was shut down in Paris.  He moved to [[Bordeaux]] and continued to perform, before returning to Paris a few weeks later.  It was during this trip to Bordeaux that Robert first experience balloon flight as a passenger – an experience that would have a massive influence on his life.  On his return to Paris Robert discovered that two of his former assistants had continued the performances without him.  He refined his show, making it more elaborate and inventive and started performing in a more permanent location from 3 January 1799.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;  The Gothic surroundings of the crumbling Convent des Capucines near the [[Place Vendôme]] gave Robert the ideal eerie home for his show.&lt;ref name="Heard" /&gt;

The shows began with the audience being shown [[optical illusion]]s and [[trompe-l'œil]] effects on their way to the showroom.  Inside the candlelit room the audience would be seated as audio effects emulate the sound of wind and thunder and an unseen [[glass harmonica]] plays unsettling music.  Robert would then enter the room and start a monologue about death and the afterlife.  He then began the show in earnest, creating smoky mix of [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] and [[aqua fortis]] before projecting his [[apparitional experience|ghostly apparitions]].&lt;ref name="AiC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrintsGeorge" /&gt;

The shows were performed at the Convent des Capucines for four years,&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt; and Robert went on to take the show around the world, visiting Russia, Spain, and the United States among others.&lt;ref name="Heard" /&gt;  During his travels he dedicated a lot of his time to ballooning.&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;

==Balloon flights==

[[File:Assiette robertson 1789.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative 18th century plate]]

Robert was a keen balloonist who designed and flew balloons in different countries around the world.  On 18 July 1803 in Hamburg he set an altitude record in a [[Montgolfier brothers|montgolfière]].&lt;ref name="Zeitler" /&gt;  He spent many flights investigating [[meteorology|meteorological activity]].&lt;ref name="NationalMuseet"&gt;National Museum of Denmark.

Rigasche Anzeigen. 35. Stuck - 29. Aug. 1804. Gemeinnutzige Beilage.&lt;/ref&gt; were claimed to be "scientific" by himself. In fact, he did numerous observations: Observations of barometer and thermometer, on shapes and altitudes of cloud formations, the behaviour of parachutes at different altitudes, the evaporation of [[Ether]], the electrical properties of different materials and the air, behavior of a magnetic needle, the boiling point of Water at great altitudes, sound propagation, influence of the high altitudes on animals ([[Pigeons]] and [[Butterflies]]), strength of solar radiation, the solar spectrum, gravity properties, chemical composition of the air and pressure of the air.

Nevertheless, close examination of the results shows, that many of them contradict with laws of physics, which were already known at the time of the flights. Prof. L.W. Gilbert discussed the results published by Robert in his [[Annalen der Physik]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;Gilbert, L.W. "[http://www.weltderphysik.de/intern/upload/annalen_der_physik/1804/Band_16_257.pdf" Annalen der Physik Volume 16, 1804, p.257-290]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}"&lt;/ref&gt; and showed why Robert was wrong. For example, Robert claimed, that a [[spring scale]] with attached weights showed a lower weight at altitude as compared to the ground. Such an effect is existing, but only becomes apparent at altitudes in excess of 70,000 feet (20,000 metres).

In 1806 an audience of 50,000, including the royal family, gathered at [[Rosenborg Castle]] in Copenhagen to see Robert and his balloon.  Robert flew all the way to [[Roskilde]] – a remarkable feat for the time.  The event made a lasting impression on [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], an influential Danish physicist who went on to write a series of poems about the flight.&lt;ref name="NationalMuseet" /&gt;
