The '''5AT Advanced Technology''' [[steam locomotive]] is a conceptual design conceived by the British engineer David Wardale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chapelon|first=Andre|title=La Locomotive a Vapeur (Translation by George. W. Carpenter C.Eng., M.I.Mech.E.|publisher=Camden Miniature Steam Services|year=2000|pages=615–616|isbn=0-9536523-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and first described in his definitive work on modern steam, ''The Red Devil and Other Tales from the Age of Steam.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wardale|first=David|title=The Red Devil and Other Tales from the Age of Steam|publisher=Published by the author|year=1998|isbn=0-9529998-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wardale's purpose in putting forward the "Super Class 5 [[4-6-0]]" design concept (as he then called it) was to offer a future for steam hauled trains on the main lines in the UK on which the use of heritage traction is likely to be gradually phased out as the speed and density of commercial rail traffic increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wardale|first=David|title=Steaming into the Future|publisher=Steam Railway Magazine|date=June 2002|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on the project was suspended in March 2012 following completion of a project Feasibility Study and subsequent failure to raise the finance needed to complete the detail design and construction of the locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wardale|first=David|title=End of the Line - Time is Called on the 5AT Project|publisher=Steam Railway Magazine|date=March 2012|pages=90–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==
Wardale's proposal was for a locomotive that would:

* be acceptable to the British railway authorities by conforming with the size and weight of the [[BR standard class 5|BR 5MT Class 4-6-0]] locomotives that have operated on British main lines since 1951;
* offer a level of performance needed to integrate steam-hauled charter trains into the modern high-speed rail-system without causing bottle-necks;
* offer much greater reliability and much lower operating costs than heritage steam locomotives.

The April 1998 edition of the Steam Railway magazine contained an article by Wardale titled "Whither Steam Now?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wardale|first=David|title=Whither Steam Now?|publisher=Steam Railway Issue 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included reference to a "locomotive of Class 5 4-6-0 format - calling it a 5GT - that would outperform any British [[4-6-2|Pacific]]."

Still described as the 5GT in a Feb 2001 [[Railway Magazine]] article titled "Wardale reveals £1.7 million 'new steam' proposal for the heritage market",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Wardale reveals £1.7 million 'new steam' proposal for the heritage market|publisher=Railway Magazine Feb 2001 Issue|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name 5AT first emerged in a letter from Alan Fozard to the editor of Steam Railway Magazine issue 259 in June–July 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=letter to editor from Dr. Alan Fozard|publisher=Steam Railway issue 259 June–July 2001|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided with the formation of the 5AT Project.&lt;ref name="5at.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5at.co.uk| title=The 5AT Group - Steaming Ahead with Advanced Technology| website=5AT.co.uk| publisher=5AT Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5AT in its final conceptual form remained almost identical in size and weight to the BR 5MT, sharing the axle spacings and being just 4 tonnes heavier, with axle loads of 20 tonnes on each driving axle and 10 tonnes on each bogie axle.  Where it differed in size from the 5MT was in its [[Tender (rail)|tender]] which was massively enlarged to carry large quantities of fuel and water to extend its operating range. Such a large tender would also have provided space for the locomotive-carried parts of advanced signalling systems such as [[ERTMS]]. The 5AT's four-axle tender would have had a gross weight of 80 tonnes with a fuel ([[diesel oil|light-oil]]) capacity of 7 tonnes and water capacity of 46 tonnes (12,000 US gallons).

==The 5AT Project==

The 5AT Project was established in 2001 with the aim of commercializing Wardale's 5AT locomotive concept and bringing it to reality.  The project was spearheaded by a small team of professional engineers, scientists and businessmen and women whose common purpose was to see steam traction continue in main-line operation into the foreseeable future.

===Design calculations===
The first task undertaken by the project team was to commission David Wardale to undertake the Fundamental Design Calculations for the locomotive.  The purpose of these calculations was to verify through detailed calculations that the conceptual design was viable in engineering terms and that it would meet the performance predictions that Wardale had made for it (see below). At the same time, a project website&lt;ref name="5at.co.uk"/&gt; was established.

Wardale completed the Fundamental Design Calculations for the locomotive in late 2004 after 2½ years of almost continuous labour. The work comprises 6100 lines of calculation divided into 26 sections as follows:

* Section 1.1 - General Calculations - Determination of the Target Power &amp; Tractive Effort-Speed Characteristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5at.co.uk/FDC.1.1.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209143154/http://www.5at.co.uk/FDC.1.1.pdf| archivedate=9 December 2008| title=General Calculations - Determination of the Target Power &amp; Tractive Effort-Speed Characteristics| last=Wardale| first=D.| publisher=Wardale Engineering &amp; Associates| date=14 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business plan===
Since the completion of the Fundamental Design Calculations, the 5AT Project team focussed on the development of a [[business plan]] to attract investment in the project.  This proved to be a difficult task because of the high development costs that were anticipated for designing and gaining railway approvals for a prototype locomotive, and the limited returns that might be expected from the locomotive's use on tourist and "cruise" trains.   It was concluded that the cost of building the locomotive could only be justified if its initial development costs were "written off".

===Research===
The project team also undertook extensive research into the possibilities of developing alternative designs based around the high efficiency and low maintenance concepts of the 5AT.  Particular focus was placed on the possibilities for ([[coal]]-fired) steam traction for coal transportation in developing countries such as [[Indonesia]], for which the operating costs were estimated to have been substantially lower than for [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric]] traction.

== 5AT Locomotive Performance ==

===Predictions===
The performance predicted for the 5AT locomotive are summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wardale|first=David|title=GENERAL CALCULATIONS, 1.3.F. PRELIMINARY BASIC CALCULATIONS (final version).|publisher=unpublished|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Max continuous operating speed 180&amp;nbsp;km/h/113&amp;nbsp;mph (with a maximum design speed 200&amp;nbsp;km/h/125&amp;nbsp;mph);
* Max draw-bar power of 1890&amp;nbsp;kW/2535&amp;nbsp;hp at 113&amp;nbsp;km/h/70&amp;nbsp;mph;
* Power-to-weight ratio of 12&amp;nbsp;kW per tonne (at the draw bar);
* Max draw-bar thermal efficiency 11.8% (14% indicated efficiency);
* Operating range between fuel fills {{convert|925|km|mi|abbr=on}} and between water fills {{convert|610|km|mi|abbr=on}} under "average conditions";
* Operating range between fuel fills {{convert|552|km|mi|abbr=on}} and between water fills {{convert|367|km|mi|abbr=on}} at a maximum operating speed and power.

===Technical advances===
The above performance predictions were predicated on several technical advances, mostly developed by [[L.D. Porta|Ing. L.D. Porta]], all of which have been proven in practice, in most cases on Wardale's [[South African Class 26 4-8-4|SAR Class 26 "The Red Devil"]] and described in Wardale's book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.5at.co.uk/Red-Devil-book.shtml| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206130158/http://www.5at.co.uk/Red-Devil-book.shtml| archivedate=6 February 2010| title=The Red Devil and Other Tales from the Age of Steam| website=5AT.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject. These advances are summarized as follows:

* High boiler pressure: 2100 kPa (305 psi);
* High superheat temperature: 450&amp;nbsp;°C;
* Lempor exhaust system to minimize cylinder back-pressure;
* Feedwater pre-heating;
* Combustion air pre-heating;
* Large streamlined steam pipes, passages and steam chests;
* Large valves and valve ports to facilitate free steam-flow in and out of cylinders;
* Long piston stroke to minimize piston mass and steam leakage;
* Pistons and valves fitted with diesel-quality rings to reduce steam leakage;
* Tight tolerances throughout (equivalent to modern diesel standards);
* Super-high quality insulation, permanently secured in place, to minimize heat losses;
* Air sanding system and enhanced-adhesion wheel-rim profiles to control wheel slip;
* Clasp brakes on all wheels to improve braking performance to reduce stopping distances;
* Ultra light-weight motion (rods, pistons and piston valves) to minimize inertia forces and thus balancing requirements (and thus hammer blow on the track).

===Design features===
In addition, the locomotive would have incorporated the following features that would have minimized its maintenance requirements and increased its reliability:

* Improved component design using CAD/CAM to ensure tight tolerances and exact fit-up;
* Finite Element stress analysis of all critical components to accurately determine stress levels in critical components;
* Better materials – including bearings, lubricants, wear components, insulation etc.;
* Replacement of bolts and rivets wherever possible with welded connections, eliminating the possibility of components becoming loose.
* Simple two-cylinder design to minimize number of moving components.
* No inaccessible components.
* The use of AAR rules where appropriate, American Association of Railroads rules being generally the most robust design rules where empirical methods have to be used.
* Roller bearings on all axles, crankpins, motion and valve gear, giving near-zero wear and minimal vibration;
* Self-adjusting wedges on all driving and coupled axleboxes to eliminate axlebox-frame gaps, to prevent pounding and vibration associated with axlebox wear;
* Robust horn stays to minimize risks of frame cracking at top-corners of horns;
* Improved valve and cylinder tribology to minimize wear of rings and liners;
* Tail rods on pistons to reduce piston ring and cylinder wear;
* All-welded boiler – eliminates problems caused by riveted seams and screwed stays. No possibility of leakage or [[caustic embrittlement]];
* Effective boiler water treatment that practically eliminates boiler maintenance.
* Superior firebox stay design to minimize incidence of fractured stays;
* Rigid engine-tender drawgear to eliminate ‘stamping’ and vibrations;
* ‘Drop-type’ firebox fusible plugs - safer than the usual lead-filled plugs;
* Corrosion-resistant steel for tender and smokebox;
* Improved boiler/frame connections to increase rigidity and reduce frame flexing;
* Clasp brakes to minimize axle and axle bearing loads due to braking forces;
* Centralized lubricant dispensing system for automatic lubrication of all sliding surfaces etc.;
* Valve liners cooled with saturated steam to protect lubricants from extreme temperatures associated with high-superheated steam.

== Project Suspension ==
In March 2012, after eleven years of development, the decision was made to suspend the project due to lack of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AT5 - Steaming Ahead with Advanced Technology|url=http://www.5at.co.uk/|website=AT5.co.uk|publisher=5AT Group|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the project Feasibility Study, it was estimated that the funding required to complete the detail design, manufacture, assembly, testing and main-line approvals for a prototype locomotive was slightly over £10 million ($16M) at 2010 prices.  However subsequent "production" locomotives were estimated to cost in the order of £2.5M ($4M), a cost that could have been justified by the anticipated returns from the haulage of luxury high-speed cruise and tour trains for which the concept was targeted.  Following suspension of the project the design group re-formed as the ''Advanced Steam Traction Trust'' to provide engineering resources for alternative projects either in the form of new designs or in improvements to existing designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATS Group|url=http://www.advanced-steam.org/|website=Advanced Steam Traction Trust|publisher=AST Group|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11839">Formed in December 1999, '''Acción de Lucha Anti-Petrola (ADELA)''' is a [[Costa Rican]] [[grassroots]] environmental group created to oppose offshore [[oil exploration]] and drilling.&lt;ref name="ADELA 2003"&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=17&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration;] Mark Engler &amp; Nadia Martinez, "True Gold of Our Future," ''New Internationalist'', Oct. 2003, at 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translated into English as "Anti-Petroleum Action,"&lt;ref&gt;Mark Engler &amp; Nadia Martinez, "True Gold of Our Future," ''New Internationalist'', Oct. 2003, at 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ADELA is named after a local indigenous woman who was "struggling to defend her culture and local environment against outside forces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macalester.edu/environmentalstudies/MacEnvReview/costarica.htm/ Michael Gelardi, ''Environment, Economy, and Energy in Costa Rica: The Case Study of Petroleum Exploration in the Province of Límon'' (May 2001).] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614164157/http://www.macalester.edu/environmentalstudies/MacEnvReview/costarica.htm/ |date=June 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ADELA initially consisted of 30 local citizen's groups ranging from farmers' organizations and the fisherman's union, to religious groups, small business owners, and marine biologists.&lt;ref name="ADELA 2003"/&gt;  ADELA now comprises over 100 local citizens' organizations.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=17&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The various groups came together to form ADELA after becoming aware of the negative environmental impact of [[seismic reflection]] explorations being conducted by [[HKN, Inc.|Harken Costa Rica Holdings]] in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=17&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration;] [http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=6&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, Welcome to ADELA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The primary goal of ADELA is to effectuate a complete national moratorium on oil exploration.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org"&gt;[http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=12773/ IFAW, Latest Updates on ADELA!, 8 May 2002: A Victory for the Environment and People of Costa Rica.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231107/http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/general/default.aspx?oid=12773%2F |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In carrying out its mission, ADLEA informs and educates both the [[Caribbean]] community and political actors about the environmental risks the oil industry poses for Costa Rica, as well as for the Caribbean generally.  ADELA also works with members of local communities to promote [[sustainable development]], and to develop more environmentally friendly energy practices and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=6&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, Welcome to ADELA.]&lt;/ref&gt;

With little material resources, ADELA largely relied on the grassroots efforts of its own members until 2001.&lt;ref name="nrdc.org"&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/02fal/field.asp/ Sam Martin, "No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W. Bush," ''OnEarth'', Fall 2002.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204224649/http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/02fal/field.asp/ |date=December 4, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ADLEA was largely successful in its efforts, and managed to stage protests, voice their opinions over the radio, and even bring lawsuits in the Costa Rican national court.&lt;ref name="nrdc.org"/&gt;  After recognizing that their message was not reaching the United States, home of the oil companies seeking to drill off the Costa Rican shoreline, ADELA contacted the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) in early 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/02fal/field.asp/ Sam Martin, "No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W.

Much of the oil exploration to date has occurred in the {{convert|1300|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} region of Costa Rica known as Talamanca.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=17&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration;] [http://www.nrdc.org/OnEarth/02fal/field.asp/ Sam Martin, "No Rigs Allowed: Costa Rica Gives the Boot to a Texas Oil Company with Ties to George W.

Talamanca's marine resources include [[coral reefs]], [[mangroves]], rare [[manatees]], over 100 species of fish, and [[sea turtle]] nesting beaches.&lt;ref name="elaw.org"/&gt;  In fact, Costa Rica's Caribbean coast is a migratory pathway for at least three [[endangered species]] of sea turtles, and sea turtles are recognized as being especially susceptible to oil pollution.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/02/01/costa.rica.oil/index.html/ Gary Strieker, "Texas Oil a Slippery Issue in Costa Rica Vote," CNN.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325190819/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/02/01/costa.rica.oil/index.html/ |date=March 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protection of the sea turtles is a primary concern for conservationists, but it is likely that mangroves and wetlands, generally, would not be able to recover from an oil spill.&lt;ref name="foe.org"/&gt;  Oil pollution would also significantly impact the coastal communities and local economic infrastructure, as it would likely result in hundreds of fishing jobs being lost and a decrease in eco-tourism.&lt;ref name="foe.org"/&gt;  Eco-tourism remains Costa Rica's primary source of revenue from other countries.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt;

== Efforts to halt exploration and drilling by Harken Costa Rica Holdings ==

=== Background ===
In 1994, the Costa Rican legislature passed a Hydrocarbons Law which divided the country into 27 blocks for oil and natural gas exploration, and it allowed firms of foreign countries to bid for oil concessions.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;  In July 1998, Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguex (1998–2002) granted one concession of four exploration blocks to MKJ Xploration Inc. (MKJ), a small Louisiana-based company.  Located in Talamanca, the four blocks were to be used for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;

In November 1998, [[Harken Energy Corporation]] (Harkan) of Dallas, Texas, purchased 40% of the concession rights from MKJ, and the two companies combined to create Harken Costa Rica Holdings (HCRH).&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;  In March 1999, Costa Rica's National Technical Environmental Secretariat (SETENA) approved an environmental impact study (EIA) submitted by HCRH to conduct marine seismic reflection blasting.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;

Between October and December 1999, HCRH began using seismic reflection blasting to map possible oil reserves.  Such blasting was in derogation of a condition in the EIA that restricted blasting to the months of January and July, so as to minimize the impact on marine life.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;  The blasting significantly disrupted the local Costa Rican fishing industry.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;  ADELA formed in December 1999 to oppose the actions of HCRH.

=== Efforts of ADELA ===
In January 2000, ADELA was a party in a lawsuit seeking an injunction and annulment of the HCRH exploration concessions.  In September of that year, the Costa Rican Constitutional Court ruled in ADELA's favor, and granted an annulment of the four-block HCRH concession.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;  The Court's ruling was based on International Labor Organization [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Convention 169]], "Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries," to which Costa Rica is bound.  The Court later modified the ruling in November 2000, however, and nullified only those blocks affecting indigenous territory.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;

In September 2001, SETENA convened a public hearing in Limón to debate issues concerning oil development.  HCHR bused in approximately 100 people who they paid to attend the hearing, yet they were outnumbered by ADELA members.  More than 300 people are reported to have supported ADELA's campaign with banners and posters.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt; In addition, marine biologists and environmental organizations who support ADELA gave presentations about various social, economic, and environmental adverse impacts that could result from oil exploration and drilling.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;

On February 28, 2002, SETENA rejected HCRH's EIA as not being environmentally or socially viable, and SETENA listed 50 reasons for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grupoadela.org/newsite/index.php?page=17&amp;lang=eng/ ADELA, A Story of Local, National, and International Resistance to Oil Exploration;] [http://www.elaw.org/news/advocate/default.asp?issue=2002-2/ E-LAW Advocate, Protecting Costa Rica's Tropical Coastline.]&lt;/ref&gt;  HCRH's appeal was rejected by Elizabeth Odio, then-Costa Rican Minister of the Environment.&lt;ref name="ifaw.org"/&gt;

In 2005, the Costa Rican President notified HCHR that their contract had been terminated, due to HCHR's failure to obtain an approved EIA pursuant to Costa Rican environmental law.&lt;ref name="grupoadela.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7490">The '''American Association of Woodturners''' (AAW) is the principal organization in the United States supporting the art and craft of [[woodturning]]. It is sometimes stylized as '''American Association of Wood Turners''' (AAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pawoodturners.com/ |title=South Central Pennsylvania Wood Turners |quote=Established in 1993 by Valen Frye and Dick Diehl, the South Central Pennsylvania Wood Turners is a charter member of the American Association of Wood Turners.  American Association of Wood Turners membership is not required but it is recommended.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1986&lt;ref name="Sager2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Joy Sager|title=Creative Careers in Crafts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3ib9orvjMEC&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=15 April 2010|date=1 August 2004|publisher=Allworth Communications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-58115-362-0|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headquartered in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], the organization encompasses more than 15,000 members in the United States and many foreign nations. As of 2013, the AAW was affiliated with nearly 350 local chapters worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodturner.org/info/history.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225144019/http://www.woodturner.org/info/history.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-25 }} History&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sponsoring an annual national symposium, the AAW provides support to local clubs for outreach and education. The 25th anniversary of the AAW was celebrated in 2011 at the annual symposium held in Saint Paul. Phil McDonald is executive director of the organization.

==Mission and background==
The AAW states: "''Our purpose is to foster a wider understanding and appreciation of lathe-turning as a traditional and contemporary craft and a form of art among the general public and amateur, part-time, and professional woodturners. This will be accomplished by providing education, information, organization, technical assistance, and publications related to woodturning''." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.woodturner.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodturning, which has experienced exceptional growth and interest since AAW's founding, is a pursuit that goes back 4,000 years in human history – using craft’s most organic material, wood, as its primary medium. Woodturners create utilitarian, artistic, and sculptural wooden objects on mechanical lathes. The craft differs from most other forms of woodworking in that the wood stock rotates rapidly while sharpened cutting skews, gouges, and other tools are maneuvered by hand to shape the material.

Membership in AAW brings a variety of benefits, including a bimonthly magazine, insurance coverage, scholarships, national symposiums, educational opportunities for newcomers and youth, and a website where turners can display and market their woodturnings.

The AAW was founded at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts[http://www.arrowmont.org] in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and remains closely affiliated with that institution, as well as with the John C. Campbell Folk School[http://www.folkschool.org] in Brasstown, North Carolina, and the Anderson Ranch[http://www.andersonranch.org] in Snowmass Village, Colorado.

==Organization==
The AAW, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, is administered by a nine-member Board of Directors, all volunteers who serve three-year terms. Three board members are elected by the full membership each year and begin their terms in January. The Board employs an executive director and an editor, and appoints a Board of Advisors along with various committee members serving specific purposes, such as organizing the national symposium and overseeing AAW financial grants to clubs and individuals.

==''American Woodturner'' Journal==
The AAW magazine, ''American Woodturner'', is published in print and online editions six times a year. Subscriptions to the journal are included with AAW membership, and individual copies are available on newsstands. Members may view all issues online. The publication contains articles aimed at both novice woodturners as well as intermediate craftspersons and professionals.

==Chapters==
The AAW is affiliated with more than 350 local chapters, or clubs, and three "virtual" chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodturner.org/community/chapters/LocalChapters.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140039/http://www.woodturner.org/community/chapters/LocalChapters.asp |archive-date=2010-03-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local chapters are primarily in the United States but encompass groups in many other nations, including Canada, England, New Zealand, Taiwan, [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]. Virtual chapters are not geographically based but are organized around specific woodturning techniques. The three virtual chapters include the Ornamental Turners International, Segmented Woodturners, and Pen Turners [http://www.principallypens.com www.principallypens.com]. Ornamental woodturners specialize in the use of an [[Lathe#Ornamental_turning_lathes|ornamental lathe]] such as the [[Rose engine lathe]]. [[Segmented turning|Segmented woodturning]] involves joining individual pieces of wood together prior to turning to create intricate patterns and dramatic visual effects. Pen turners specialize in making pens and other writing instruments out of both wood and synthetic materials.

==Symposium==
Annual symposiums have been sponsored and organized by the AAW each year since 1987, alternating in cities around the United States. The first symposium was held in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]] in 1987. The symposium will be in Kansas City in 2017 and Portland in 2018. The gathering typically includes live presentations, an auction of selected woodturnings, an instant gallery that showcases current woodturning craft, a rotation of how-to and hands-on demonstrations, the world's largest trade show of commercial woodturning vendors, and a youth training center.

==AAW Gallery of Wood Art==
[[File:Gallery of Wood Art.jpg|thumb|right|The AAW Gallery of Wood Art]]
The AAW operates the '''AAW Gallery of Wood Art''' [http://www.galleryofwoodart.org www.galleryofwoodart.org] in Saint Paul's historic [[Landmark Center (St. Paul)|Landmark Center]]. The gallery features changing exhibits of art of all kinds made from wood, and there also is a gift shop. Admission is free to the gallery, which is open daily except Monday and Saturday.
The AAW works in partnership with Collectors of Wood Art[http://www.collectorsofwoodart.org] to promote the development and appreciation of studio wood art among collectors, artists, educators, art critics, galleries, museums, and the general public.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[granular material]] is the steepest angle of descent or [[Strike and dip|dip]]  relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. The morphology of the material affects the angle of repose; smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. The angle of repose can also be affected by additions of solvents. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase the angle of repose, and related quantities such as the [[bearing capacity|soil strength]].

When bulk granular materials are poured onto a horizontal surface, a [[cone (geometry)|conical]] pile will form. The internal angle between the surface of the pile and the horizontal surface is known as the angle of repose and is related to the [[density]], [[surface area]] and shapes of the particles, and the [[coefficient of friction]] of the material. Material with a low angle of repose forms flatter piles than material with a high angle of repose.

The term has a related usage in [[mechanics]], where it refers to the maximum angle at which an object can rest on an [[inclined plane]] without sliding down. This angle is equal to the [[arctangent]] of the [[coefficient of static friction]] ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; between the surfaces.

== Applications of theory ==
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|280px|Talus cones on north shore of [[Isfjord (Svalbard)|Isfjord]], [[Svalbard]], [[Norway]], showing angle of repose for coarse [[sediment]]]]

The angle of repose is sometimes used in the design of equipment for the processing of particulate solids. For example, it may be used to design an appropriate [[chute (gravity)|hopper]] or [[silo]] to store the material, or to size a [[conveyor belt]] for transporting the material. It can also be used in determining whether or not a slope (of a stockpile, or uncompacted gravel bank, for example) will likely collapse; the [[scree|talus]] slope is derived from angle of repose and represents the steepest slope a pile of granular material will take. This angle of repose is also crucial in correctly calculating [[slope stability|stability]] in vessels.

It is also commonly used by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]] as a factor in analysing [[avalanche]] danger in mountainous areas.{{citation needed |date=December 2016}}

== Measurement ==
There are numerous methods for measuring angle of repose and each produces slightly different results. Results are also sensitive to the exact methodology of the experimenter. As a result, data from different labs are not always comparable. One method is the [[triaxial shear test]], another is the [[direct shear test]].

If the coefficient of static friction is known of a material, then a good approximation of the angle of repose can be made with the following function. This function is somewhat accurate for piles where individual objects in the pile are minuscule and piled in random order.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\theta)} \approx \mu_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of static friction, and ''θ'' is the angle of repose.

=== Methods in determining the angle of repose ===
The measured angle of repose may vary with the method used.

==== Tilting box method ====
This method is appropriate for fine-grained, non-cohesive materials with individual particle size less than 10&amp;nbsp;mm. The material is placed within a box with a transparent side to observe the granular test material. It should initially be level and parallel to the base of the box. The box is slowly tilted until the material begins to slide in bulk, and the angle of the tilt is measured.

==== Fixed funnel method ====
The material is poured through a funnel to form a cone. The tip of the funnel should be held close to the growing cone and slowly raised as the pile grows, to minimize the impact of falling particles. Stop pouring the material when the pile reaches a predetermined height or the base a predetermined width. Rather than attempt to measure the angle of the resulting cone directly, divide the height by half the width of the base of the cone. The inverse tangent of this ratio is the angle of repose.

==== Revolving cylinder method ====
The material is placed within a cylinder with at least one transparent end. The cylinder is rotated at a fixed speed and the observer watches the material moving within the rotating cylinder. The effect is similar to watching clothes tumble over one another in a slowly rotating clothes dryer. The granular material will assume a certain angle as it flows within the rotating cylinder. This method is recommended for obtaining the dynamic angle of repose, and may vary from the static angle of repose measured by other methods.

== Exploitation by antlion and wormlion (Vermileonidae) larvae ==
[[File:Antlion trap.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Sand pit trap of the antlion]]

The larvae of the [[antlion]]s and the unrelated wormlions [[Vermileonidae]] trap small insects such as ants by digging conical pits in loose sand, such that the slope of the walls is effectively at the critical angle of repose for the sand.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They achieve this by flinging the loose sand out of the pit and permitting the sand to settle at its critical angle of repose as it falls back. Thus, when a small insect, commonly an ant, blunders into the pit, its weight causes the sand to collapse below it, drawing the victim toward the center where the predator that dug the pit lies in wait under a thin layer of loose sand. The larva assists this process by vigorously flicking sand out from the center of the pit when it detects a disturbance. This undermines the pit walls and causes them to collapse toward the center. The sand that the larva flings also pelts the prey with so much loose, rolling material as to prevent it from getting any foothold on the easier slopes that the initial collapse of the slope has presented. The combined effect is to bring the prey down to within grasp of the larva, which then can inject venom and digestive fluids.

The '''British thermal unit''' ('''Btu''' or '''BTU''') is a traditional unit of [[heat]]; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one [[pound (mass)|pound]] of water by one degree [[Fahrenheit]]. It is part of the [[United States customary units]].&lt;ref&gt;In a short note, Woledge notes that the actual technical term "British thermal unit" apparently originated in the United States, and was subsequently adopted in Great Britain.

While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work, they are still important in many fields. As examples, in the United States the [[Natural gas prices|price of natural gas]] is quoted in dollars per million BTUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |url=https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801191040/https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdm.htm |archivedate=1 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HenryHub /&gt;

== Definitions ==
A BTU was originally defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 [[avoirdupois]] pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics |edition=6 |last1=Smith |first1=J.

This reflects the fact that the temperature change of a mass of water due to the addition of a specific amount of heat (calculated in energy units, usually joules) depends slightly upon the water's initial temperature. As seen in the table below, definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures vary by up to 0.5%. In the table, thermochemical and steam table (IT) values, which are now defined in terms of exact values in joules, have been rounded to four decimal places.

| Originally, the thermochemical BTU was defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water from its freezing point to its boiling point, divided by the temperature difference (180&amp;nbsp;°F). The similar, ''thermochemical [[calorie]]'' was defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from freezing to boiling divided by the temperature difference in Celsius (100&amp;nbsp;°C). The International Standards Organization now redefines the thermochemical calorie as exactly 4.184&amp;nbsp;J.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; The thermochemical BTU is then defined using the conversions from grams to pounds and from Celsius to Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name=convert&gt;The pound is now defined as 453.59237 grams; see {{Cite web

| An early effort to define heat units directly in terms of energy units, and hence to remove the direct association with the properties of water, was taken by the International Steam Table Conferences. These conferences originally adopted the simplified definition that 860 "IT" calories corresponded exactly to 1 watt-hour; the watt-hour is an energy unit. This definition ultimately became the statement that 1 IT calorie is exactly 4.1868&amp;nbsp;J.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;

===Prefixes===
Units kBtu are used in building energy use tracking and heating system sizing. Energy Use Index (EUI) represents kBtu per square foot of conditioned floor area. "k" stands for 1,000.

The units '''MBtu''' and '''MMBtu''' are used in the natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 and 1,000,000 BTUs, respectively.&lt;ref name="EIA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{cite book |last=Price |first=Gary D. |title=Power Systems and Renewable Energy: Design, Operation, and Systems Analysis |publisher=Momentum Press |date=2014 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=skICBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ambiguity in that the metric system uses the prefix "M" to indicate one million (1,000,000), and "MBtu" is also used to indicate one million BTUs.&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Energy Units |url=https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/energy/units.cfm |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |access-date=2016-12-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231123621/http://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/energy/units.cfm |archivedate=31 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this ambiguity, some authors have deprecated the use of MBtu.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

Energy analysts accustomed to the metric "k" for 1,000 are more likely to use MBtu to represent one million, especially in documents where M represents one million in other energy or cost units, such as MW, MWh and $.

The unit ''[[therm]]'' is used to represent 100,000 (or 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;BTUs.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=45&amp;t=8 |title=What are Mcf, Btu, and therms?

The unit ''[[quad (unit)|quad]]'' is commonly used to represent one quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) BTUs.&lt;ref name="APS" /&gt;

== Conversions ==
One Btu is approximately:
* 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilo[[joule]]s)
* 0.2931 W⋅h ([[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]])
* 252 to 253&amp;nbsp;cal ([[calorie]]s, or "little calories")
* 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, "large calories", or "food calories")
* 25,031 to 25,160&amp;nbsp;ft⋅pdl ([[foot-poundal]])
* 778 to 782&amp;nbsp;ft⋅lbf ([[foot-pound (energy)|foot-pounds-force]])
* 5.40395 (lbf/in&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)⋅ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

A Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a {{convert|1|lb|spell=in|adj=on}} weight {{Convert|778|ft|m|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;Energy and the Environment. Ristinen, Robert A. c. 2006, pp 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For natural gas ===
{{main|Natural gas prices}}
* In [[natural gas]] pricing, the Canadian definition is that 1&amp;nbsp;MMBtu ≡ {{val|1000000}}&amp;nbsp;Btu ≡ 1.054615&amp;nbsp;GJ.&lt;ref name=Alberta&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/about_us/1132.asp | title=Energy Measurements | access-date=2017-01-07 | publisher=Government of Alberta Province | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120191331/http://www.energy.gov.ab.ca/About_Us/1132.asp | archivedate=20 January 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The energy content (high or low heating value) of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas, which means there is no universal conversion factor for the number of Btu to volume. 1 standard cubic foot of average natural gas yields ≈ 1030&amp;nbsp;Btu (between 1010&amp;nbsp;Btu and 1070&amp;nbsp;Btu, depending on quality, when burned)
* As a coarse approximation, 1000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of natural gas yields ≈ 1&amp;nbsp;MMBtu ≈ 1&amp;nbsp;GJ
* For natural gas price conversion 1000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 36.906&amp;nbsp;MMBtu and 1&amp;nbsp;MMBtu ≈ 27.096&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

=== As a unit of power ===
When used as a unit of [[Power (physics)|power]] for heating and cooling systems, Btu ''per hour'' (Btu/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just "Btu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masonry Heaters: Designing, Building, and Living with a Piece of the Sun|author=Ken Matesz|p=148|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''MBH''—thousands of Btus per hour—is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/11156/what-is-difference-between-btu-and-mbh-for-house-furnaces|title=What is difference between BTU and MBH for house furnaces?|website=Home Improvement Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1000&amp;nbsp;Btu/h is approximately 293.1&amp;nbsp;W
* 1 [[horsepower]] is approximately 2544&amp;nbsp;Btu/h, or &lt;math&gt;1 \over \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; Btu/s

== Associated units ==
* 1 ''[[Ton of refrigeration|ton of cooling]]'', a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is {{convert|12,000|Btu/h|kW|2|abbr=on}}. It is the rate of heat transfer needed to freeze {{convert|1|ST|kg|0}} of water into ice in 24 hours.
* In the US, the [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] that describes the performance of thermal insulation is typically quoted in ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅°F⋅hr/Btu. For one square foot of the insulation, one BTU per hour of heat flows across the insulator for each degree of temperature difference across it.
* 1 ''[[therm]]'' is defined in the United States and European Union as 100,000&amp;nbsp;Btu—but the U.S. uses the Btu&lt;sub&gt;59&amp;nbsp;°F&lt;/sub&gt; while the EU uses the Btu&lt;sub&gt;IT&lt;/sub&gt;. The therm is used in natural gas pricing in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/gas/wholesale-market/gb-gas-wholesale-market|publisher=[[Office of Gas and Electricity Markets]]|title=The GB gas wholesale market|quote=The wholesale gas market in Britain has one price for gas irrespective of where the gas comes from.

* 1 ''[[Quad (unit)|quad]]'' (short for [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1015|quadrillion]]&amp;nbsp;Btu) is 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Btu, which is about 1 exajoule ({{val|1.055|e=18|u=J}}). Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Husher |first1=John Durbin |title=Crises of the 21st Century: Start Drilling-The Year 2020 Is Coming Fast |publisher=iUniverse |date=2009 |page=376 |oclc=610004375 |isbn=9781440140549}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts.

The Btu should not be confused with the [[Kilowatt hour|Board of Trade Unit]] (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy ({{convert|1|kW.h|Btu|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

The Btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in Btu required to generate 1&amp;nbsp;kW⋅h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at {{val|10500}}&amp;nbsp;Btu/kW⋅h, an efficiency of 32–33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf |title=Electric Generation Efficiency |publisher=[[National Petroleum Council (US)|National Petroleum Council]] (NPC) |editor1-first=David K. |editor1-last=Bellman |date=July 18, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120094040/http://www.npc.org/Study_Topic_Papers/4-DTG-ElectricEfficiency.pdf |archivedate=20 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }} Working Document of the NPC Global Oil &amp; Gas Study.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centigrade heat unit (CHU) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree [[Celsius]]. It is equal to 1.8&amp;nbsp;BTU or 1899 joules.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/c/e/centigrade%20heat%20unit/source.html#.WJ0QuB1AqFo  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225090911/http://www.diracdelta.co.uk/science/source/c/e/centigrade%20heat%20unit/source.html |date=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This unit was sometimes used in the United Kingdom as an alternative to BTU but is now obsolete.

The '''Chesapeake Bay Foundation''' (CBF) is a [[non-profit organization]] devoted to the restoration and protection of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in the [[United States]].  It was founded in 1967 and has headquarters offices in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. The foundation has field offices in [[Salisbury, Maryland]]; [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]]; [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF). Annapolis, MD. [http://www.cbf.org/Page.aspx?pid=387 "Mission and Vision."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330081754/http://www.cbf.org/Page.aspx?pid=387 |date=2010-03-30 }} Accessed 2010-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBF offers an [[outdoor education]] program that has introduced several generations of school children to the Chesapeake Bay through several idyllic outposts along the Bay's shores, such as Fox Island, Smith Island, Bishop's Head and others. Children learn the fragile nature of the Bay's [[ecosystem]], and the extent of its [[drainage basin|watershed]], much of which includes their own homes in [[suburb]]ia. CBF also lobbies [[State governments of the United States|state]] and [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] on [[regulation]]s intended to protect the health of the Bay.

Along with education and advocacy, the CBF also moves to make the Bay cleaner through restoration and litigation. Their mission is to restore the Bay to balance in environmental programs such as planting trees and other greenery, along with restoring oyster populations. In litigation, the CBF makes it their mission to hold environmentally negligent companies and organizations accountable for their actions.

== New headquarters building ==
In 2001, CBF moved from a walkable [[downtown]] location in Annapolis to a new headquarters building, the [[Philip Merrill Environmental Center]], about 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) outside of town. The new building, at the former site of the Bay Ridge Inn on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, is a [[green building]] that demonstrates a number of energy-saving and other [[Sustainability|sustainable]] features. It was the first building to receive the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) "Platinum" rating from the [[United States Green Building Council]].&lt;ref&gt;CBF. [http://www.cbf.org/Page.aspx?pid=389 "The Philip Merrill Center: CBF's Headquarters."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234104/http://www.cbf.org/page.aspx?pid=389# |date=2012-02-07 }} Accessed 2010-03-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new headquarters is not accessible by [[public transportation]]. The foundation's choice for a new headquarters site symbolizes a dilemma of the modern environmental movement: how to be connected to the environment without despoiling it. In this case, the enlarged [[Ecological footprint|footprint]] of employees and visitors forced to drive to the building was offset by its reduced [[Impervious surface|imperviousness]] compared to the former inn, use of [[recycling|recycled materials]], re-use of [[wastewater]] on-site, and use of [[composting toilet]]s. The building was an early adopter of green building principles, but apart from [[automobile]]s and [[bicycle]]s, remains inaccessible by other modes of transportation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16762">'''Combustion instabilities''' are physical phenomena occurring in a reacting flow (e.g., a [[flame]]) in which some perturbations, even very small ones, grow and then become large enough to alter the features of the flow in some particular way&lt;ref name="culick-06"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsteady Motions in Combustion Chambers for Propulsion Systems|year=2006|publisher=NATO Research and Technology Organization|author=Culick, F. E. and Kuentzmann, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="lieuwen-12"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsteady Combustor Physics|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Lieuwen, T.

[[File:combustion_instabilities_stability_map.jpg|thumb|Stability map of a hypothetical combustor.  This combustor operates at conditions in which no dangerous combustion-instabilities will happen.]]

In many practical cases, the appearance of combustion instabilities is undesirable.  For instance, thermoacoustic instabilities are a major hazard to [[gas turbines]] and [[rocket engines]].&lt;ref name="culick-06" /&gt;  Moreover, flame blowoff of an aero-gas-turbine engine in mid-flight is clearly dangerous (see [[flameout]]).  

Because of these hazards, the [[engineering design process]] of engines involves the determination of a stability [[map]] (see figure).  This process identifies a combustion-instability region and attempts to either eliminate this region or moved the operating region away from it.  This is a very costly iterative process.  For example, the numerous tests required to develop rocket engines &lt;ref name="pempie-01"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pempie, P. and Vernin, H.|title=Liquid rocket engine test plan comparison |journal=AIAA Paper 2001-3256}}&lt;/ref&gt; are largely in part due to the need to eliminate or reduce the impact of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities.

==Classification of combustion instabilities==

In applications directed towards engines, combustion instability has been classified into three categories, not entirely distinct. This classification was first introduced by Marcel Barrère and [[Forman A. Williams]] in 1969&lt;ref&gt;Barrere, M., &amp; Williams, F. A. (1969, January). Comparison of combustion instabilities found in various types of combustion chambers. In Symposium (International) on Combustion (Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 169-181). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;. The three categories are&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Forman A. Combustion theory. CRC Press, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Chamber instabilities''' - instabilities arising due to the occurrence of  combustion inside a chamber (acoustic instabilities, shock instabilities, fluid-dynamic instabilities associated with the chamber, etc.,)
* '''Intrinsic instabilities''' - instabilities arising irrespective of whether combustion occurs in a chamber (chemical-kinetic instabilities, diffusive-thermal instabilities, hydrodynamics instabilities, etc.,)
* '''System instabilities''' - instabilities arising due to the interaction between combustion processes in the chamber and anywhere else in the system (feed-system interactions, exhaust-system interactions, etc.,)

==Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities==

In this type of instabilities the perturbations that grow and alter the features of the flow are of an [[acoustics]] nature.  Their associated pressure oscillations can have well defined [[frequencies]] with amplitudes high enough to pose a serious hazard to combustion systems.&lt;ref name="culick-06" /&gt;  For example, in rocket engines, such as the [[Rocketdyne F-1]] rocket engine &lt;ref name="oefelein-93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oefelein, J. C. and Yang, V.|title=Comprehensive review of liquid-propellant combustion instabilities in F-1 engines|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|year=1993|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Saturn V]] program, instabilities can lead to massive damage of the combustion chamber and surrounding components (see [[rocket engines]]).  Furthermore, instabilities are known to destroy gas-turbine-engine components during testing.&lt;ref name="lieuwen-05"&gt;{{cite book|title=Combustion instabilities in gas turbine engines|year=2005|publisher=AIAA|author=Lieuwen, T. C. and Yang, V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They represent a hazard to any type of combustion system.

Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities can be explained by distinguishing the following physical processes:
&lt;!-- or by taking a dynamical-system viewpoint&lt;ref name="mcmanus-93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus, K. R. and Poinsot, T. and Candel, S. M.|title=A review of active control of combustion instabilities|journal=Progress in energy and combustion science|year=1993|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="jahnke-94"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jahnke, C. C. and Culick, F. E. C. |title=Application of dynamical systems theory to nonlinear combustion instabilities|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|year=1994|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
the feedback between heat-release fluctuations (or flame fluctuations) with the combustor or combustion chamber acoustics; the coupling of these two processes in space-time; the strength of this coupling in comparison with acoustic losses; and, the physical mechanisms behind the heat-release fluctuations.

The simplest example of a thermoacoustic combustion instability is perhaps that happening in a horizontal [[Rijke tube]] (see also [[thermoacoustics]]): Consider the flow through a horizontal tube open at both ends, in which a flat flame sits at a distance of one-quarter the tube length from the leftmost end. In a similar way to an [[organ pipe]], [[acoustic wave]]s travel up and down the tube producing a particular pattern of [[standing wave]]s. Such a pattern also forms in actual combustors, but takes a more complex form.&lt;ref name="poinsot-05"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theoretical and numerical combustion|year=2005|publisher=RT Edwards|author=Poinsot, T. and Veynante, D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acoustic waves perturb the flame.  In turn, the flame affects the acoustics. This feedback between the acoustic waves in the combustor and the heat-release fluctuations from the flame is a hallmark of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities. It is typically represented with a [[block diagram]] (see figure).  Under some conditions, the perturbations will grow and then saturate, producing a particular noise. In fact, it is said that the flame of a Rijke tube sings.

[[File:Combustion instabilities feeback loop.jpg|thumb|Combustion instabilities represented with a block diagram as a feedback amplifier.]]

The conditions under which perturbations will grow are given by Rayleigh's ([[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]]) criterion:&lt;ref name="rayleigh-96"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theory of Sound Volume 2|year=1896|publisher=Dover Publications|author=Rayleigh, J. W. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities will occur if the volume integral of the correlation of pressure and heat-release fluctuations over the whole tube is larger than zero (see also [[thermoacoustics]]).  In other words, instabilities will happen if heat-release fluctuations are coupled with acoustical pressure fluctuations in space-time (see figure).  However, this condition is not sufficient for the instability to occur.

[[File:Combustion instabilitites rogers 018 animation.gif|thumb|Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities happening in a bluff-body-flame-stabilized combustor.  Dark regions indicated strong release of heat, and large deformations indicated high pressure.  Notice that whenever and wherever large deformations happen, dark regions are seen.  This is the hallmark coupling of pressure and heat-release seen in thermoacoustic combustion instabilities.]]

Another necessary condition for the establishment of a combustion instability is that the driving of the instability from the above coupling must be larger than the sum of the acoustic losses.&lt;ref name="nicoud-05"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicoud, F. and Poinsot, T.|title=Thermoacoustic instabilities: Should the Rayleigh criterion be extended to include entropy changes?|journal=Combustion and Flame|year=2005|volume=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These losses happen through the tube's boundaries, or are due to viscous [[dissipation]].  

Combining the above two conditions, and for simplicity assuming here small fluctuations and an [[inviscid flow]], leads to the extended Rayleigh's criterion.  Mathematically, this criterion is given by the next inequality:
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{T} \int_{V} p' q' dV dt &gt; \int_{0}^{T} \int_{S} p' \mathbf{u'} \cdot \mathbf{n}  dS dt . &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 
Here p' represents pressure fluctuations, q' heat release fluctuations, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u'} &lt;/math&gt; velocity fluctuations, T is a long enough time interval, V denotes volume, S surface, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt; is a normal to the surface boundaries.  The left hand side denotes the coupling between heat-release fluctuations and acoustic pressure fluctuations, and the right hand side represents the loss of acoustic energy at the tube boundaries.  

[[File:Graphical extended Rayleigh criterion.jpg|thumb|Graphical representation of the extended Rayleigh's criterion for some combustor showing a region where gains exceeds losses and the combustor response is strong.  This suggests a strong likelihood of having a combustion instability.  This figure is adapted from &lt;ref name="culick-06" /&gt;.]]

Graphically, for a particular combustor, the extended Rayleigh's criterion is represented in the figure on the right as a function of frequency.  The left hand side of the above inequality is called gains, and the right hand side losses.  Notice that there is a region where the gains exceeds the losses.  In other words, the above inequality is satisfied.  Furthermore, note that in this region the response of the combustor to acoustic fluctuations peaks.  Thus, the likelihood of a combustion instability in this region is high, making it a region to avoid in the operation of the combustor.  This graphical representation of a hypothetical combustor allows to group three methods to prevent combustion instabilities &lt;ref name="culick-06" /&gt;:  increase the losses; reduce the gains; or move the combustor's peak response away from the region where gains exceed losses.

To clarify further the role of the coupling between heat-release fluctuations and pressure fluctuations in producing and driving an instability, it is useful to make a comparison with the operation of an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE).  In a ICE, a higher [[thermal efficiency]] is achieved by releasing the heat via combustion at a higher pressure.  Likewise, a stronger driving of a combustion instability happens when the heat is released at a higher pressure.  But while high heat release and high pressure coincide (roughly) throughout the combustion chamber in an ICE, they coincide at a particular region or regions during a combustion instability.  Furthermore, whereas in an ICE the high pressure is achieved through mechanical compression with a [[piston]] or a [[compressor]], in a combustion instability high pressure regions form when a standing acoustic wave is formed.

The physical mechanisms producing the above heat-release fluctuations are numerous.&lt;ref name="culick-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lieuwen-05" /&gt;  Nonetheless, they can be roughly divided into three groups:  heat-release fluctuations due to mixture inhomogeneities; those due to hydrodynamic instabilities; and, those due to static combustion instabilities.
To picture heat-release fluctuations due to mixture inhomogeneities, consider a pulsating stream of gaseous fuel upstream of a flame-holder.
&lt;!-- TODO: Add figure. --&gt;
Such a pulsating stream may well be produced by acoustic oscillations in the combustion chamber that are coupled with the fuel-feed system.  Many other causes are possible.  The fuel mixes with the ambient air in a way that an inhomogeneous mixture reaches the flame, e.g., the blobs of fuel-and-air that reach the flame could alternate between rich and lean.  As a result, heat-release fluctuations occur.  
Heat-release fluctuations produced by hydrodynamic instabilities happen, for example, in bluff-body-stabilized combustors when [[vortices]] interact with the flame (see previous figure) &lt;ref name="schadow-92"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schadow, K. C. and Gutmark, E.|title=Combustion instability related to vortex shedding in dump combustors and their passive control|journal=Progress in Energy and Combustion Science|year=1992|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;!-- TODO: Explain HRR due to static instabilities. --&gt;
Lastly, heat-release fluctuations due to static instabilities are related to the mechanisms explained in the next section.

==Static instability or flame blow-off==

[[File:Webp.net-gifmaker (1).gif|thumb|Flame from a swirl-stabilized, premixed, academic combustor undergoing blow-off.  The flow is from right to left.  The fuel-air ratio is decreased.  This makes the flame to change its shape,  then become unstable, and eventually blow-off.]]

Static instability &lt;ref name="lieuwen-12" /&gt; or flame blow-off refer to phenomena involving the interaction between the chemical composition of the fuel-oxidizer mixture and the flow environment of the flame &lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Combustion|year=2014|publisher=Academic Press|author=Glassman, I. and Yetter, R. A. and Glumac, N. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  To explain these phenomena, consider a flame that is stabilized with swirl, as in a gas-turbine [[combustor]], or with a bluff-body.  Moreover, say that the chemical composition and flow conditions are such that the flame is burning vigorously, and that the former is set by the fuel-oxidizer ratio (see [[air-fuel ratio]]) and the latter by the oncoming velocity.  For a fixed oncoming velocity, decreasing the fuel-oxidizer ratio makes the flame change its shape, and by decreasing it further the flame oscillates or moves intermittently.  In practice, these are undesirable conditions.  Further decreasing the fuel-oxidizer ratio blows-off the flame.  This is clearly an operational failure.  For a fixed fuel-oxidizer ratio, increasing the oncoming velocity makes the flame behave in a similar way to the one just described.

[[File:S-shape-curve-combustion.jpg|thumb|S-shape curve resulting from the solution of an homogeneous reactor model representing a flame.]]

Even though the processes just described are studied with experiments or with [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]], it is instructive to explain them with a simpler analysis.  In this analysis, the interaction of the flame with the flow environment is modeled as a perfectly-mixed [[chemical reactor]] &lt;ref name="peters"&gt;{{cite book|title=Turbulent Combustion|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Peters, N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  With this model, the governing parameter is the ratio between a flow time-scale (or residence time in the reactor) and a chemical-time scale, and the key observable is the reactor's maximum temperature.  The relationship between parameter and observable is given by the so-called S-shape curve (see figure).  This curve results from the solution of the governing equations of the reactor model.  It has three branches:  an upper branch in which the flame is burning vigorously, i.e., it is "stable"; a middle branch in which the flame is "unstable" (the probability for solutions of the reactor-model equations to be in this unstable branch is small); and a lower branch in which there is no flame but a cold fuel-oxidizer mixture.  The decrease of the fuel-oxidizer ratio or increase of oncoming velocity mentioned above correspond to a decrease of the ratio of the flow and chemical time scales.  This in turn corresponds to a movement towards the left in the S-shape curve.  In this way, a flame that is burning vigorously is represented by the upper branch, and its blow-off is the movement towards the left along this branch towards the quenching point Q.  Once this point is passed, the flame enters the middle branch, becoming thus "unstable", or blows off.  This is how this simple model captures qualitatively the more complex behavior explained in the above example of a swirl or  bluff-body-stabilized flame.

==Intrinsic flame instabilities==

In contrast with thermoacoustic combustion instabilities, where the role of acoustics is dominant, intrinsic flame instabilities refer to instabilities produced by differential and preferential diffusion, thermal expansion, buoyancy, and heat losses.  Examples of these instabilities include the [[Darrieus–Landau instability]], the [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability]], and thermal-diffusive instabilities (see [[Double diffusive convection]]).

'''Differential tariff''' is an example of [[Energy demand management|demand side management]] where the price per unit of energy varies with the consumption. If a power utility uses differential tariff, it may change the rate per kWH of energy used during different times, such as raising the price during times of high energy consumption and lowering the price during times of low energy consumption. This helps balance the rate at which power is used and the rate at which power is created.

==Background==
A differential tariff creates a balance in production and consumption of power by utilizing customer demand. For instance, if there is time where energy is being used faster than can be supplied, a differential tariff can be used: raising the price at that specific time to balance load on the system.

==Differential Tariff==
To implement the above-mentioned method of flattening the [[load curve]], this technique is employed. As the load decreases and increases, the supplier must install his equipment in a way which will be capable of supplying the peak consumer load. During low periods, the equipment will be underutilized, thereby decreasing the [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of the equipment. Therefore, the supplier will try to ensure that the equipment is used at its rated capacity so as not to waste resources, which cost money. With this type of tariff, the consumer will try to consume more energy during the low periods and avoid energy consumption during peak hours because they are more expensive.

==Examples==
===United Kingdom===
Since the 1970s, tariffs such as [[Economy 7]] and 'White Meter' have offered domestic consumers cheaper electricity in off-peak hours, usually for a fixed, continuous period of between 7 and 8.5 hours overnight. Typically such tariffs are used in conjunction with [[storage heater]]s, which charge up cheaply overnight and release heat slowly during the following day.

While many such installations use a simple timeswitch, households may also be fitted with a [[radio teleswitch]] which allows more dynamic switching. For example, the supplier EDF advertises its Economy 7 service in the London area as offering 7 hours of off-peak electricity between midnight and 8.00am;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edfenergy.com/sme-business/help-advice/faqs&lt;/ref&gt; the precise start and finish times can be varied to smooth out peak demand.

Bespoke local off-peak tariffs have also been created to help manage demand. For example, the electricity company [[MANWEB]] found its supply network in Mid Wales overstretched in the early 1990s due to high peak demand for electric heating overnight. In response, it created a bespoke tariff and used radio teleswitches to stagger off-peak heating times and better distribute loads across the day. Now known as TwinHeat, the tariff saved the company over a million pounds in network reinforcement costs.&lt;ref&gt;http://manweb-remembered.co.uk/May%2094.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1383">'''Dimer acids''', or '''dimerized fatty acids''', are [[dicarboxylic acid]]s prepared by [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]izing [[unsaturated fatty acid]]s obtained from [[tall oil]], usually on [[clay]] [[catalyst]]s. The [[CAS number]] of the material is [61788-89-4]. Dimer acids are used primarily for synthesis of [[polyamide]] [[resin]]s and polyamide [[hot melt adhesive]]s. They are also used in [[alkyd resin]]s, [[adhesive]]s, [[surfactant]]s, as [[fuel oil]] additives, [[lubricant]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kodia.com.cn/DIMER_ACID.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204062424/http://www.kodia.com.cn/DIMER_ACID.htm |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a light yellow or yellow viscous transparent liquid. It is non-toxic.

Dimer acid usually contains predominantly a dimer of [[stearic acid]]. It is also called '''C36 dimer acid'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB51011196.htm C36 Dimer acid | 61788-89-4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trimer acid''' is a corresponding material where the resulting molecule consists of three fatty acid molecules. Its CAS number is [68937-90-6].

Dimer acids can be converted to '''dimer amines''' by reaction with ammonia and subsequent reduction.

'''Dunnite''', also known as '''Explosive D''' or systematically as '''ammonium picrate''', is an explosive developed in 1906 by US Army Major Beverly W. Dunn, who later served as the chief inspector of the Bureau of Transportation Explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= War Records Committee of the Alumni Association |title= Technology's War Record: An Interpretation of the Contribution Made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, its Staff, its Former Students and its Undergraduates to the Cause of the United States and the Allied Powers in the Great War, 1914-1919 |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location= Cambridge, MA |page= 364 |date= 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1907/08/18/104992996.pdf Dunnite Smashes Strongest Armor], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium picrate is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] formed by reacting [[picric acid]] and [[ammonia]]. It is chemically related to the more stable explosive [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT).

== History ==
It was the first explosive used in an aerial bombing operation in military history, performed by Italian pilots in [[Libya]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[http://piste.blogspot.com/2011/03/ultime-notizie-bombardiamo-la-libia.html], [[La Stampa]], November 2, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;
It was used extensively by the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/dunnite.htm Dunnite], Firstworldwar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Dunnite was generally considered an insensitive substance, by 1911 the [[United States Army]] had abandoned its use in favor of other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/08/08/104873365.pdf Ridicule Spy Story: Army Abandoned the Use of Dunnite Years Ago, Officers Say], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 8, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Navy|Navy]], however, used it in [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing artillery shells]] and projectiles, and in coastal defense.

Dunnite typically did not detonate on striking heavy armor. Rather, the shell encasing it would penetrate the armor, after which the charge would be triggered by a base [[fuze]].

In 2008 caches of discarded Dunnite in remote locations were mistaken for rusty rocks at [[Cape Porcupine, Labrador|Cape Porcupine]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/family-makes-explosive-discovery-on-labrador-shore/article955359/1 Family makes explosive discovery on Labrador shore], ''The Globe and Mail'', Toronto, Ontario, September 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/beachcombing-labrador-family-carries-home-wartime-explosive-1.757030 | title=Beachcombing Labrador family carries home wartime explosive | publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=2008-09-10 | accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunnite can be used as a precursor to the highly stable explosive [[TATB]] (1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), by first dehydrating it to form [[picramide]] (attaching the ammonia as an amine group instead of an ion) and then further aminating it.

A phase II trial on the effect of Edelfosine on advanced non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma had a “remarkable” “high proportion of patients with stationary tumor status” as result, stable disease after initial progression in 50% of the patients.&lt;ref name="asco.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Drings-1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drings|first=P|author2=Günther I |author3=Gatzmeier U |author4=ulbrich F |title=Final Evaluation of a Phase II Study on the Effect of Edelfosine (an Ether Lipid) in Advanced Non-Small-Cell Bronchogenic Carcinoma.|journal=Onkologie|year=1992|volume=15|pages=375–382|doi=10.1159/000217391|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
In animal tests the main toxic effect was gastrointestinal irritation. There were no significant negative systemic side effects observed. It showed that edelfosine can be given over a long period safely. Most important, in contrast to many DNA-directed anti-cancer drugs, no bone marrow toxicity was ''in vivo'' observed. Those findings in animals were confirmed in clinical trials.  No mutagenic or cytogenetic effects were observed.&lt;ref name=Mollinedo-2002 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Houlihan-1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houlihan|first=WJ|author2=Lohmeyer M |author3=Workman P |author4= Cheon SH |title=Phospholipid antitumor agents.|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews.|year=1995|volume=15|issue=3|pages=157–223|pmid=7658750|doi=10.1002/med.2610150302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1960s Herbert Fischer and Paul Gerhard in Freiburg, Germany, found that [[Lysophosphatidylcholine|lysolecitin]] (2-lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC) increases the phagocytotic activity of [[macrophages]].
Since LPC had a short half-life, synthetic LPC-analogues were tested by Fischer, Otto Westphal, Hans Ulrich Weltzien and Paul Gerhard Munder.  Unexpectedly, some of the substances showed strong anti-tumor activity and among them Edelfosine was the most effective. It is therefore considered to be the prototype of synthetic anti-cancer lipids.&lt;ref name=Houlihan-1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=munder-1969&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munder|first=PG|author2=Ferber E |author3=Modolell M |author4= Fischer H. |title=The influence of various adjuvants on the metabolism of phospholipids in macrophages.|journal=International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology.|year=1969|volume=36|issue=1|pages=117–28|doi=10.1159/000230731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Energiewende''''' ([[German language|German]] for '''[[energy transition]]''') is the planned transition by [[Germany]] to a [[Low-carbon economy|low carbon]], environmentally sound, reliable, and affordable energy supply.&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |author2 = Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) |title = Energy concept for an environmentally sound, reliable and affordable energy supply |date = 28 September 2010 |publisher = Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) |place = Berlin, Germany |url = http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept,property=pdf,bereich=bmwi,sprache=en,rwb=true.pdf |access-date = 2016-05-01 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161006040920/http://www.bmwi.de/English/Redaktion/Pdf/energy-concept%2Cproperty%3Dpdf%2Cbereich%3Dbmwi%2Csprache%3Den%2Crwb%3Dtrue.pdf |archivedate = 6 October 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislative support for the ''Energiewende'' was passed in late 2010 and includes [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) reductions of 80–95% by 2050 (relative to 1990) and a [[renewable energy]] target of 60% by 2050.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Energy of the Future: Fourth "Energy Transition" Monitoring Report — Summary | date = November 2015 | publisher = Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) | place = Berlin, Germany

Germany has made significant progress on its GHG [[emissions reduction]] target, achieving a 27% decrease between 1990 and 2014. 
However the country will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3.5% per year to reach its ''Energiewende'' goal, equal to the maximum historical value thus far.&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-etal-2015"&gt;

As of 2013, Germany spends €1.5{{nbsp}}billion per year on energy research in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition.&lt;ref name="schiermeier-2013"&gt;{{cite news | first = Quirin | last = Schiermeier | title = Renewable power: Germany's energy gamble: an ambitious plan to slash greenhouse-gas emissions must clear some high technical and economic hurdles | date = 10 April 2013 | work = Nature

== The term ''Energiewende'' ==

[[File:Biogas Photovoltaik Wind.jpg|thumb|The main renewable energy sources in Germany: [[biomass]], [[wind energy]], and [[photovoltaics]]]]

The term ''Energiewende'' was first contained in the title of a 1980 publication by the German [[Öko-Institut]], calling for the complete abandonment of nuclear and petroleum energy.&lt;ref name="krause-etal-1980"&gt;

}} In support of the claim that Krause et al (1980) was the first use of the term ''Energiewende''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}}
The most groundbreaking claim was that economic growth was possible without increased energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;https://book.energytransition.org/origin-term-energiewende&lt;/ref&gt;  On 16{{nbsp}}February 1980, the German Federal Ministry of the Environment also hosted a symposium in Berlin, called ''Energiewende – Atomausstieg und Klimaschutz'' (Energy Transition: Nuclear Phase-Out and Climate Protection).  The Institute for Applied Ecology was funded by both environmental and religious organizations, and the importance of religious and conservative figures like Wolf von Fabeck and Peter Ahmels was crucial.  In the following decades, the term ''Energiewende'' expanded in scope – in its present form it dates back to at least 2002.

''Energiewende'' designates a significant change in [[energy policy]].  The term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation (for example, producing heat and power in small cogeneration units), which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency.

In a broader sense, this transition also entails a [[democratization]] of energy.&lt;ref name="paulitz"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the traditional energy industry, a few large companies with large centralized power stations dominate the market as an oligopoly and consequently amass a worrisome level of both economic and political power. Renewable energies, in contrast, can, as a rule, be established in a decentralized manner.  Public wind farms and solar parks can involve many citizens directly in energy production.&lt;ref name="dnr-2011"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Photovoltaic systems can even be set up by individuals.  Municipal utilities can also benefit citizens financially, while the conventional energy industry profits a relatively small number of shareholders.  Also significant, the decentralized structure of renewable energies enables creation of value locally and minimizes capital outflows from a region.  Renewable energy sources therefore play an increasingly important role in municipal energy policy, and local governments often promote them.

== Status ==

The key policy document outlining the ''Energiewende'' was published by the German government in September 2010, some six months before the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima nuclear accident]].&lt;ref name="bmwi-and-bmu-2010"/&gt;  Legislative support was passed in September 2010.  On 6 June 2011, following Fukushima, the government removed the use of nuclear power as a bridging technology as part of their policy.&lt;ref name="bmu-2011"&gt;

After the 2013 federal elections, the new [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]/[[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] coalition government continued the ''Energiewende'', with only minor modification of its goals in the coalition agreement.  An intermediate target was introduced of a 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption in 2035.&lt;ref name="german-energy-blog-2013"&gt;

These targets go well beyond [[European Union]] legislation and the national policies of other European states.  The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables, particularly wind power. Germany's share of renewables has increased from around 5% in 1999 to 22.9% in 2012, surpassing the OECD average of 18% usage of renewables.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"&gt;

Producers have been guaranteed a fixed [[feed-in tariff]] for 20 years, guaranteeing a fixed income. Energy co-operatives have been created, and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits.  The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market.  However, in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low [[Return on investment|returns]], and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality.&lt;ref name="latsch-etal-2014"&gt;

Nuclear power plants were closed, and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned, in 2022.

One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market. It is believed 8,300&amp;nbsp;km of power lines must be built or upgraded.&lt;ref name="economist-2012"/&gt;  The different [[States of Germany|German States]] have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines. Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the ''Energiewende'' have been passed on to consumers, who have had rising electricity bills. Germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity [[price]]s (including taxes) in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey conducted by TNS Emnid for the German Renewable Energies Agency among 1015 respondents, 94 per cent of the Germans support the enforced expansion of Renewable Energies.

On 1 August 2014, a revised [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates ([[feed-in tariff]]s) will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-a"/&gt;

Among other things, wind and PV cannot be principally refinanced under the current [[marginal cost]] based market.  Carbon pricing is also central to the ''Energiewende'' and the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS) needs to be reformed to create a genuine [[scarcity]] of certificates.&lt;ref name="agora-2015-b"&gt;

Most of the computer scenarios used to analyse the ''Energiewende'' rely on a substantial carbon price to drive the transition to low-carbon technologies.

Coal-fired generation needs to be retired as part of the ''Energiewende''.  Some argue for an explicit negotiated phase-out of coal plants, along the lines of the well-publicized nuclear phase-out.&lt;ref name="agora-2016a"&gt;

Coal comprised 42% of electricity generation in 2015.  If Germany is to limit its contribution to a [[Global Warming|global temperature increase]] to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels, as declared in the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]], a complete phase-out of fossil fuels together with a shift to [[100% renewable energy]] is required by about 2040.&lt;ref name="quaschning-2016"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency.  German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

An official federal government report on progress under the ''Energiewende'', updated for 2014, notes that:&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015-b"/&gt;

* energy consumption fell by 4.7% in 2014 (from 2013) and at {{val|13132}}{{nbsp}}petajoules reached it lowest level since 1990
* renewable generation is the number-one source of electricity
* energy efficiency increased by an average annual 1.6% between 2008 and 2014
* final energy consumption in the transport sector was 1.7% higher in 2014 than in 2005

Analysis by Agora Energiewende in late-2016 suggests that Germany will probably miss several of its key ''Energiewende'' targets, despite recent reforms to the [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] and the wholesale electricity market.  The goal to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 "will most likely be missed{{nbsp}}... if no further measures are taken" and the 55–60% share of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2035 is "unachievable" with the current plans for renewables expansion.&lt;ref name="clew-2016a"&gt;

The plan states that the energy supply must be "almost completely decarbonised" by 2050, with renewables as its main source.  For the electricity sector, "in the long-term, electricity generation must be based almost entirely on renewable energies" and "the share of wind and solar power in total electricity production will rise significantly".

The fifth monitoring report on the ''Energiewende'' for 2015 was published in December 2016.  The expert commission which wrote the report warns that Germany will probably miss its 2020 climate targets and believes that this could threaten the credibility of the entire endeavor.  The commission puts forward a number of measures to address the slowdown, including a flat national {{CO2}} price imposed across all sectors, a greater focus on transport, and full market exposure for renewable generation.  Regarding the carbon price, the commission thinks that a reformed [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU{{nbsp}}ETS]] would be better, but that achieving agreement across Europe is unlikely.&lt;ref name="egenter-and-wehrmann-2016"&gt;

== Citizen support and participation ==

{{as of|2016}}, citizen support for the ''Energiewende'' remains high, with recent surveys indicating that about 80–90% of the public are in favor.&lt;ref name="amelang-and-wettengel-2016"&gt;{{cite news | first1 = Sören | last1 = Amelang | first2 = Julian | last2 = Wettengel	 | title = Polls reveal citizens' support for Energiewende | date = 4 May 2016 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/polls-reveal-citizens-support-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One reason for the high acceptance is the substantial participation of German citizens in the ''Energiewende'', as private households, land owners, or members of energy cooperatives (''Genossenschaft'').&lt;ref name="borchert-2015"&gt;{{cite news | first = Lars | last = Borchert	 | title = Germany between citizens' energy and Nimbyism | date = 10 March 2015 | website = Clean Energy Wire (CLEW) | location = Berlin, Germany | url = https://www.cleanenergywire.org/dossiers/peoples-energiewende | access-date = 2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer studies ==

Much of the policy development for the ''Energiewende'' is underpinned by [[computer simulation|computer models]], run mostly by universities and research institutes.  The models are usually based on [[scenario analysis]] and are used to investigate different assumptions regarding the stability, sustainability, cost, efficiency, and public acceptability of various sets of technologies.  Some models cover the entire [[energy sector]], while others are confined to [[electricity generation]] and consumption.  A 2016 book investigates the usefulness and limitations of energy scenarios and energy models within the context of the ''Energiewende''.&lt;ref name="dieckhoff-and-leuschner-2016"&gt;&lt;!-- publishers url: www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-3171-5 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of computer studies confirm the feasibility of the German electricity system being 100% renewable in 2050.  Some investigate the prospect of the entire energy system (all energy carriers) being fully renewable too.

=== 2009 WWF study ===

In 2009 [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Germany published a quantitative study prepared by the [[Öko-Institut]], Prognos, and Hans-Joachim Ziesing.&lt;ref name="wwf-germany-2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The study presumes a 95% reduction in [[greenhouse gas]]es by the year 2050 and covers all sectors.  The study shows that the transformation from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy is possible and  affordable.  It notes that by committing to this transformation  path, Germany could become a model for other countries.

=== 2011 German Advisory Council on the Environment study ===

A 2011 report from the [[:de:Sachverständigenrat für Umweltfragen|German Advisory Council on the Environment]] (SRU) concludes that Germany can attain 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050.&lt;ref name="sru-2010"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) REMix high-resolution energy model was used for the analysis.  A range of scenarios were investigated and a cost-competitive transition with good security of supply is possible.

The authors presume that the transmission network will continue to be reinforced and that cooperation with Norway and Sweden would allow their hydro generation to be utilized for storage.  The transition does not require Germany's [[Nuclear power phase-out#Germany|nuclear phase-out]] (''{{lang|de|Atomausstieg}}'') to be extended nor the construction of coal-fired plants with [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  Conventional generation assets need not be stranded and an orderly transition should prevail.  Stringent energy efficiency and energy saving programs can bring down the future costs of electricity.

=== 2015 Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project study ===

The [[Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project]] (DDPP) aims to demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems by 2050 in order to achieve a [[low-carbon economy]].
The 2015 German country report, produced in association with the [[Wuppertal Institute]], examines the official target of reducing domestic GHG emissions by 80% to 95% by 2050 (compared with 1990).&lt;ref name="hillebrandt-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Decarbonization  pathways  for  Germany  are  illustrated  by  means  of  three  ambitious scenarios with energy-related emission reductions between 1990 and 2050 varying between 80%  and  more  than  90%.  Three strategies strongly contribute to GHG emission reduction: 
* energy efficiency improvements (in all sectors but especially in buildings)
* increased use of domestic renewables (with a focus on electricity generation)
* electrification  and  (in  two  of  the  scenarios  also)  use  of  renewable  electricity-based synthetic fuels (especially in the transport and industry sector)
In addition, some scenarios use controversially:
* final energy demand reductions through behavioral changes ([[mode of transport|modal shift]] in transport, changes in eating and heating habits)
* net imports of electricity from renewable sources or of [[bioenergy]]
* use of [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology to reduce industry sector GHG emissions (including cement production)
Potential co-benefits for Germany include increased energy security, higher competitiveness of and global business opportunities for companies, job creation, stronger GDP growth, smaller energy bills for households, and less air pollution.

&lt;/ref&gt;  The guiding question of the study is: how can a cost-optimised transformation of the German energy system — with consideration of all [[energy carrier]]s and consumer sectors — be achieved while meeting the declared [[climate protection]] targets and ensuring a secure energy supply at all times.  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) is explicitly excluded from the scenarios.  A future energy scenario emitting 85% less CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions than 1990 levels is compared with a reference scenario, which assumes that the German energy system operates in 2050 the same way as it does today.  Under this comparison, primary energy supply drops 42%.  The total cumulative costs depend on the future prices for carbon and oil.  If the penalty for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions increases to €100/tonne by 2030 and thereafter remains constant and fossil fuel prices increase annually by 2%, then the total cumulative costs of today's energy system are 8% higher than the costs required for the minus 85% scenario up to 2050.  The report also notes:

{{quote|From the macroeconomic perspective, the transformation of Germany's energy system demands a significant shift in cash flow, moving the cash spent on energy imports today to spend it instead on new investments in systems, their operation and maintenance.  In this respect a transformed energy system requires a large expenditure for local added value, a factor which also does not appear in the shown cost analysis.&lt;ref name="henning-and-palzer-2015"/&gt;{{rp|8}}}}

=== 2015 DIW study ===

A 2015 study uses DIETER or Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables, developed by the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), Berlin, Germany.  The study examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly on biomass availability.  The model is fully described in the study report.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Set in 2050, several scenarios use [[gas turbine#industrial gas turbines for power generation|gas power plants]] to stabilise the backbone of energy system, ensuring supply security during several weeks of low wind and solar radiation.  Other scenarios investigate a 100% renewable system and show these to be possible but more costly.  Flexible consumption and storage control ([[energy demand management|demand-side management]]) in households and the industrial sector is the most cost-efficient means of balancing short-term power fluctuations.  Long-term storage systems, based on [[power-to-X]], are only viable if carbon emissions are to be reduced by more than 80%.  On the question of costs, the study notes:

{{quote|Assuming that the price of emissions allowances in 2050 will significantly surpass its current level, a power generation system boasting a high percentage of wind and photovoltaics will, as a rule, come  cheaper  than  a  system  dominated by fossil fuel power plants.&lt;ref name="acatech-2016"/&gt;{{rp|7}}}}

Using biomass as a fuel produces [[air pollution]] in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants. However, since the beginning of the Energiewende the balance of biomass vs other forms of renewable energy has shifted; biomass made up 7.0% of Germany's power generation mix in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://energytransition.org/2018/01/german-energy-consumption-2017/|title=Germany’s energy consumption in 2017|date=2018-01-11|work=Energy Transition|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass has the potential to be a [[carbon-neutral]] fuel because growing biomass absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and a portion of the carbon absorbed remains in the ground after harvest.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Biomass contains less sulfur than coal and so produces much less sulfur dioxide than coal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pfpi.net/air-pollution-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|title=Proposed biomass plant: Better than coal?|author=Eartha Jane Melzer|date=January 26, 2010|work=The Michigan Messenger|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal|archivedate=2010-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Faraday cup''' is a [[metal]] (conductive) cup designed to catch [[charged particle]]s in [[vacuum]]. The resulting current can be measured and used to determine the number of [[ion]]s or [[electron]]s hitting the cup.&lt;ref name='1.1715674'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Faraday-Cup Monitors for High-Energy Electron Beams |journal=Review of Scientific Instruments |date=September 1956 |first=K.

==Principle of operation==

When a beam or packet of [[ion]]s hits the metal it gains a small net charge while the ions are neutralized. The metal can then be discharged to measure a small current proportional to the number of impinging ions. Essentially the Faraday cup is part of a [[electrical circuit|circuit]] where ions are the charge carriers in vacuum and the Faraday cup is the interface to the solid metal where electrons act as the [[charge carrier]]s (as in most circuits). By measuring the [[current (electricity)|electric current]] (the number of electrons flowing through the circuit per second) in the metal part of the circuit the number of charges being carried by the ions in the vacuum part of the circuit can be determined. For a continuous beam of ions (each with a single charge)

[[Image:faraday cup.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Faraday cup with an electron-suppressor plate in front]]

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {N}{t} = \frac {I}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of ions observed in a time t (in seconds), I is the measured current (in [[amperes]]) and e is the [[elementary charge]] (about 1.60 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; [[coulomb|C]]). Thus, a measured current of one nanoamp (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; A) corresponds to about 6 billion ions striking the faraday cup each second.

Similarly, a Faraday cup can act as a collector for electrons in a vacuum (for instance from an [[electron beam]]). In this case electrons simply hit the metal plate/cup and a current is produced. Faraday cups are not as sensitive as [[electron multiplier]] detectors, but are highly regarded for accuracy because of the direct relation between the measured current and number of ions.This device is considered a universal charge detector because of its independence from the energy, mass, chemistry, etc. of the analyte.

==In plasma diagnostics==
The Faraday cup utilizes a physical principle according to which the electrical charges delivered to the inner surface of a hollow conductor are redistributed around its outer surface due to mutual self-repelling of charges of the same sign – a phenomenon discovered by [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank A. J. L. James |title=Faraday, Michael (1791–1867) |journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |volume= 1|issue= |pages= |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9153|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faraday Cup for Plasma Diagnostics.tif|безрамки|thumb|Fig. 1. Faraday cup for [[plasma diagnostics]]]]

The conventional Faraday cup is applied for measurements of ion (or electron) flows from plasma boundaries and comprises a metallic cylindrical receiver-cup – 1 (Fig. 1) closed with, and insulated from, a washer-type metallic electron-suppressor lid – 2 provided with the round axial through enter-hollow of an aperture with a surface area &lt;math&gt;S_F=\pi D^2_F/4&lt;/math&gt;.  Both the receiver cup and the electron-suppressor lid are enveloped in, and insulated from, a grounded cylindrical shield – 3 having an axial round hole coinciding with the hole in the electron-suppressor lid – 2. The electron-suppressor lid is connected by 50 Ω RF cable with the source &lt;math&gt;B_{es}&lt;/math&gt;  of variable DC voltage &lt;math&gt;U_{es}&lt;/math&gt;. The receiver-cup is connected by 50 Ω RF cable through the load resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; with a sweep generator producing saw-type pulses &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Electric capacity  &lt;math&gt;C_F&lt;/math&gt;   is formed of the capacity of the receiver-cup – 1 to the grounded shield – 3 and the capacity of the RF cable. The signal from &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; enables an observer to acquire an [[I-V characteristic]] of the Faraday cup by oscilloscope. Proper operating conditions: &lt;math&gt;h\geq D_F&lt;/math&gt;  (due to possible potential sag) and &lt;math&gt;h\ll \lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ion free path. Signal from &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; is the Faraday cup [[I-V characteristic]]  which can be observed and memorized by oscilloscope

&lt;math&gt;i_\Sigma(U_g)=i_i(U_g)-C_F\frac{dU_g}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;.     (1)

In Fig. 1: 1 – cup-receiver, metal (stainless steel). 2 – electron-suppressor lid, metal (stainless steel). 3 – grounded shield, metal (stainless steel). 4 – insulator (teflon, ceramic). &lt;math&gt;C_F&lt;/math&gt; – capacity of Faraday cup. &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; – load resistor.

Thus we measure the sum &lt;math&gt;i_\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;  of the electric currents through the load resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;math&gt;i_i&lt;/math&gt; (Faraday cup current) plus the current &lt;math&gt;i_c(U_g)=-C_F(dU_g/ dt)&lt;/math&gt;  induced through the capacitor &lt;math&gt;C_F&lt;/math&gt; by the saw-type voltage &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;of the sweep-generator:
The current component &lt;math&gt;i_c(U_g)&lt;/math&gt; can be measured at the absence of the ion flow and can be subtracted further from the total current &lt;math&gt;i_\Sigma(U_g)&lt;/math&gt; measured with plasma to obtain the actual Faraday cup [[I-V characteristic]] &lt;math&gt;i_i(U_g)&lt;/math&gt; for processing. 
All of the Faraday cup elements and their assembly that interact with plasma are fabricated usually of temperature-resistant materials (often these are stainless steel and teflon or ceramic for insulators). 
For processing of the Faraday cup [[I-V characteristic]], we are going to assume that the Faraday cup is installed far enough away from an investigated plasma source where the flow of ions could be considered as the flow of particles with parallel velocities directed exactly along the Faraday cup axis. In this case, the elementary particle current &lt;math&gt;di_i&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the ion density differential &lt;math&gt;dn(v)&lt;/math&gt; in the range of velocities between &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v+dv&lt;/math&gt; of ions flowing in through operating aperture &lt;math&gt;S_F&lt;/math&gt; of the electron-suppressor can be written in the form

&lt;math&gt;di_i=eZ_i S_F vdn(v)&lt;/math&gt;,     (2)

where

&lt;math&gt;dn(v)=nf(v)dv&lt;/math&gt;,            (3)

&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is elementary electric charge, &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt; is the ion charge state, and &lt;math&gt;f(v)&lt;/math&gt; is the one-dimensional distribution function of ions over velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, the ion current at the ion-decelerating voltage &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt; of the Faraday cup can be calculated by integrating Eq. (2) after substituting in it Eq. (3)

&lt;math&gt;i_i(U_g)=eZ_i n_i S_F\int\limits_{\sqrt{2eZ_i U_g /M_i}}^{\infty} f(v)vdv&lt;/math&gt;,       (4)

where the lower integration limit is defined from the obvious equation &lt;math&gt;M_iv^2 _{i,s}/2=eZ_i U_g&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v_{i,s}&lt;/math&gt;  is the velocity of the ion stopped by the decelerating potential  &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;  is the ion mass. Thus the expression (4) represents the [[I-V characteristic]] of the Faraday cup. 
Differentiating Eq. (4) with respect to &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;, one can obtain the relation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{di_i(U_g)}{dU_g} = -en_i S_F \frac{eZ_i}{M_i}f\left(\sqrt{2eZ_i U_g /M_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,        (5)

where the value  &lt;math&gt; -n_i S_F (eZ_i/M_i ) = C_i &lt;/math&gt;  is an invariable constant for each measurement. Therefore, the average velocity  &lt;math&gt;\langle v_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt; of ions arriving into the Faraday cup and their average energy &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{E}_i \rangle&lt;/math&gt;  can be calculated (under the assumption that we operate with a single type of ion) by the expressions

&lt;math&gt;\langle v_i \rangle = 1.389\times10^6 \sqrt{\frac{Z_i}{M_A}}\int\limits_0^\infty i^\prime _i (U_g)dU_g \left ( \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{i^\prime _i}{\sqrt{U_g}}dU_g \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;      [cm/s],      (6)

&lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{E}_i \rangle = \int\limits_0^\infty i^\prime _i (U_g) \sqrt{U_g}dU_g \left ( \int\limits_0^\infty \frac{i^\prime _i}{\sqrt{U_g}}dU_g \right )^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;                      [eV],     (7)

where  &lt;math&gt;M_A&lt;/math&gt;  is the ion mass in atomic units. The ion concentration &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;  in the ion flow at the Faraday cup vicinity can be calculated by the formula

&lt;math&gt;n_i = \frac{i_i (0)}{eZ_i \langle v_i \rangle S_F}&lt;/math&gt;    (8)

which follows from Eq. (4)  at &lt;math&gt;U_g = 0&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_0^\infty f(v)vdv = \langle v \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,      (9)

[[File:Faraday Cup Fig. 02.tif|безрамки|thumb|Fig, 2. Faraday cup I-V characteristic]]

and from the conventional condition for distribution function normalizing

The value of the electron-suppressor voltage (accelerating the ions) was set experimentally at &lt;math&gt;U_{es} = - 170 V&lt;/math&gt;, near the point of suppression of the [[secondary electron emission]] from the inner surface of the Faraday cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=E.

==Error sources==
The counting of charges collected per unit time is impacted by two error sources: 1) the emission of low-energy [[secondary electrons]] from the surface struck by the incident charge and 2) [[backscattering]] (~180 degree scattering) of the incident particle, which causes it to leave the collecting surface, at least temporarily. Especially with electrons, it is fundamentally impossible to distinguish between a fresh new incident electron and one that has been backscattered or even a fast secondary electron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23750">{{about|the business model for making [[integrated circuits]]|other uses of the term '''foundry'''|foundry (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=September 2015}}
In [[microelectronics]], the '''foundry model''' refers to the separation of a [[semiconductor fabrication plant]] operation (foundry) from an [[integrated circuit design]] operation, into separate companies or business units.

==Overview==
Although many companies continue to both design and manufacture integrated circuits (achieving [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] through [[vertical integration]]), these [[integrated device manufacturer]]s (IDMs) are not alone in the [[marketplace]]. [[Economic]] forces have led to the existence of many companies that only design devices, known as [[fabless semiconductor company|fabless semiconductor companies]], as well as '''merchant foundries''' that only manufacture devices under [[contract]] by other companies, without designing them.

Integrated circuit production facilities are expensive to build and maintain. Unless they can be kept at nearly full utilization, they will become a drain on the [[finances]] of the company that owns them. The foundry [[Business model|model]] uses two methods to avoid these costs: fabless companies avoid costs by not owning such facilities. Merchant foundries, on the other hand, find work from the worldwide pool of fabless companies, and by careful [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], [[pricing]], and contracting keep their plants at full utilization.

==History==
Originally, microelectronic devices were manufactured by companies that both designed and produced the devices. This was necessary because manufacturing involved [[tweaking]] [[parameter]]s, precise understanding of the manufacturing processes being used, and the occasional need to redesign. These manufacturers were involved in both the [[research and development]] of manufacturing processes and the research and development of [[microcircuit]] design.

However, as manufacturing techniques developed, microelectronic devices became more standardised allowing them to be used by more than a single manufacturer. This standardization allowed design to be split from manufacture. A design that obeyed the appropriate [[design rules]] could be manufactured by different companies that had compatible manufacturing methods. An important development that allowed this was the introduction of advances in [[electronic design automation]] (EDA), which allowed circuit designers to exchange design data with other designers using different foundries.

Because of the separation of manufacture and design, new types of companies were founded. One type of company is called a ''fabless'' semiconductor company. These companies do not have any semiconductor manufacturing capability but rather contract production from a manufacturer. This manufacturer is called a ''merchant foundry''. The fabless company concentrates on the research and development of an IC-product; the foundry concentrates on fabricating and [[Test method|testing]] the physical product. If the foundry does not have any semiconductor design capability, it is called a ''pure-play semiconductor foundry''.

An absolute separation into fabless and foundry companies is not necessary. Some companies continue to exist which perform both operations and benefit from the close coupling of their skills. Some companies manufacture some of their own designs and contract out to have others manufactured or designed, in cases where they see [[Value (marketing)|value]] or seek special [[skills]]. The '''foundry model''' is a business vision that seeks to optimize [[productivity]].

===MOSIS===
The very first merchant foundries were part of the [[MOSIS]] service. The MOSIS service gave limited production-access to designers with limited means, such as [[students]], [[researchers]] at [[university|universities]], and [[engineers]] at small [[Startup company|startups]].&lt;ref name="BergerLester2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Suzanne Berger|author2=Richard K. Lester|title=Global Taiwan: Building Competitive Strengths in a New International Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHCmBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-46970-4|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer submitted designs and these submissions were manufactured with the commercial company's extra capacity. Manufacturers could insert some [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] for a MOSIS design into a collection of their own wafers when a processing step was compatible with both operations. The commercial company (serving as foundry) was already running the process, so they were effectively being paid by MOSIS for something they were already doing. A factory with excess capacity during slow periods could also run MOSIS designs in order to avoid having expensive [[Capital (economics)|capital]] equipment standing idle.

Under-utilization of an expensive manufacturing plant could lead to the financial ruin of the owner, so selling surplus [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] capacity was a way to maximize the fab's utilization. Hence, economic factors created a [[climate]] where fab operators wanted to sell surplus wafer-manufacturing capacity, and designers wanted to purchase manufacturing capacity rather than try to build it.

Although MOSIS opened the doors to some fabless customers, earning additional [[revenue]] for the foundry and providing inexpensive service to the [[customer]], running a business around MOSIS production was difficult. The merchant foundries sold wafer capacity on a surplus basis, as a secondary business activity. Services to the customers were secondary to the commercial business, with little [[guarantee]] of support. The choice of [[merchant]] dictated the design, development flow, and available techniques to the fabless customer. Merchant foundries might require [[Property|proprietary]] and non-portable preparation steps. Foundries concerned with protecting what they considered [[trade secret]]s of their [[methodologies]] might only be willing to release data to designers after an onerous [[nondisclosure agreement|nondisclosure]] procedure.

===Dedicated foundry===
In 1987, the world's first dedicated merchant foundry opened its doors: ''[[TSMC|Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]]''.&lt;ref name="HirakawaLal2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hitoshi Hirakawa|author2=Kaushalesh Lal|author3=Shinkai Naoko|title=Servitization, IT-ization and Innovation Models: Two-stage Industrial Cluster Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkNXCLjxJsoC&amp;pg=PA34|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-63945-3|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction of 'dedicated' is in reference to the typical merchant foundry of the era, whose primary business activity was building and selling of its own IC-products. The dedicated foundry offers several key advantages to its customers: first, it does not sell finished IC-products into the [[supply (economics)|supply]] channel; thus a dedicated foundry will never compete directly with its fabless customers (obviating a common concern of fabless companies). Second, the dedicated foundry can scale production capacity to a customer's needs, offering low-quantity [[Multi-project wafer service|shuttle]] services in addition to full-scale [[Mass production|production]] lines. Finally, the dedicated foundry offers a "COT-flow" (customer owned tooling) based on industry-standard [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] systems, whereas many IDM merchants required its customers to use proprietary (non-portable) development tools. The COT advantage gave the customer complete control over the design process, from concept to final design.

==Financial and IP issues==
Like all industries, the semiconductor industry faces upcoming challenges and obstacles.

The cost to stay on the leading edge has steadily increased with each generation of chips. The financial strain is being felt by both large merchant foundries and their fabless customers. The cost of a new foundry exceeds $1 billion. These costs must be passed on to customers. Many merchant foundries have entered into [[joint ventures]] with their competitors in an effort to split research and design expenditures and fab-maintenance expenses.

Chip design companies sometimes avoid other companies' patents simply by purchasing the products from a licensed foundry with broad cross-license agreements with the patent owner.&lt;ref&gt;

 | doi = 10.1109/CMPCON.1994.282907
 | isbn = 0-8186-5380-9
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stolen design data is also a concern; data is rarely directly copied, because blatant copies are easily identified by distinctive features in the chip,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

placed there either for this purpose or as a byproduct of the design process. However, the data including any procedure, process system, method of operation or concept may be sold to a competitor, who may save months or years of tedious [[reverse engineering]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9180">A '''helium mass spectrometer''' is an instrument commonly used to detect and locate small leaks. It was initially developed in the [[Manhattan Project]] during World War II to find extremely small leaks in the [[Gaseous diffusion|gas diffusion process]] of [[enriched uranium|uranium enrichment plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=LEAK DETECTION|author=N. Hilleret|publisher=[[CERN]]|place=[[Geneva, Switzerland]]|quote=At the origin of the helium leak detection method was the ”Manhattan Project” and the unprecedented leak-tightness requirements needed by the uranium enrichment plants. The required sensitivity needed for the leak checking led to the choice of a mass spectrometer designed by Dr. A.O.C. Nier tuned on the helium mass. Because of its industrial use, the material choice (originally glass) turned out to be unbearably fragile and after many complaints by the users, a new metallic version was developed and constructed. The sensitivity of the apparatus was in 1946 ~10{{sup|−7}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} and it increased to ~10{{sup|−10}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} by 1970. Nowadays the quoted sensitivity of the most sensitive detectors is ~10{{sup|−13}} Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}, a factor 10{{sup|6}} gain within 50 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically uses a [[vacuum chamber]] in which a sealed container filled with helium is placed. Helium leaks out of the container, and the rate of the leak is detected by a [[mass spectrometer]].

== Detection technique ==
Helium is used as a [[Flow tracer|tracer]] because it penetrates small leaks rapidly. Helium has also the property of being non-toxic, [[inert gas|chemically inert]] and present in the atmosphere only in minute quantities (5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]]). Typically a helium leak detector will be used to measure leaks in the range of 10{{sup|−5}} to 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·[[metre|m]]{{sup|3}}·[[second|s]]{{sup|−1}}.

A flow of 10{{sup|−5}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} is slightly less than 1 ml per minute at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP).

A flow of 10{{sup|−13}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} is slightly less than 3 ml per century at STP.

== Types of leaks ==
Typically there are two types of leaks in the detection of helium as a ''[[Flow tracer|tracer]]'' for leak detection: residual leak and virtual leak. A residual leak is a real leak due to an imperfect seal, a puncture, or some other hole in the system. A virtual leak is the semblance of a leak in a vacuum system caused by [[outgassing]] of chemicals trapped or adhered to the interior of a system that is actually sealed. As the gases are released into the chamber, they can create a [[false positive]] indication of a residual leak in the system.

== Uses ==
Helium mass spectrometer leak detectors are used in production line industries such as [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]], automotive parts, [[Beverage can|carbonated beverage containers]] food packages and [[aerosol spray|aerosol]] packaging, as well as in the manufacture of steam products, [[gas bottle]]s, [[fire extinguisher]]s, [[tire]] valves, and numerous other products including all [[vacuum]] systems.

== Test methods ==
=== Global helium spray ===
This method requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested will be located in some kind of a tent in which the helium concentration will be raised to 100% helium.

If the part is small the vacuum system included in the leak testing instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.

If the size of the part is too large, an additional vacuum pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.

If leakage is encountered the small and "agile" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered.

=== Local helium spray ===
This method is a small variation from the one above.
It still requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested is sprayed with a localized stream of helium tracer gas.

If the part is small the vacuum system included in the instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation.

If the size of the part is too large, an additional pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation.

If leakage is encountered the small and "agile" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium spray head will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area.

=== Helium charged vacuum test ===
In this case the part is pressurized (sometime this test is combined with a burst test, i.e. at 40 bar) with helium while sitting in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is connected to a vacuum pumping system and a leak detector. Once the vacuum has reached the mass spectrometer operating pressure, any helium leakage will be measured.
This test method applies to a lot of components that will operate under pressure: airbag canisters, evaporators, condensers, high-voltage SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; filled switchgear.

=== Partial vacuum method (ultra sniffer test) ===
In contrast to the Helium charged sniffer test, the partial vacuum method, the ultra sniffer test gas method (UST-method) uses the partial vacuum effect, so that the gas tightness of test sample can be detected at normal pressure with the same sensitivity as the helium charged vacuum test with helium gas helium. The method has a sensitivity of 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}.
Similar to the classical Helium charged sniffer test the test sample is enclosed in a bag, but in contrast to the classic method, the bag is exposed with a helium-free gas, so that the helium concentration inside the bag can reduced from 5·10{{sup|−7}} to 10{{sup|−12}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}}. This sensitivity corresponds to a theoretical gas loss of 1 cm{{sup|3}} in 3000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=UST method |author=Robert Brockmann |publisher=researchgate |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Brockmann/contributions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UST method can be used very economically for the ad hoc testing of test samples. The test system can be set up easily, with normal pneumatic items, such as valves and plastic hoses. For the embedding of the test samples, a simple plastic bag is sufficient. The UST method was also used for the leak testing of component of the [[Fusion power|fusion experiment]] [[Wendelstein 7-X]] in Germany.

=== Bombing test ===
This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed.

First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a "bombing" chamber.

If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device.

Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured.

This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices.

This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down.

=== Helium charged sniffer test ===
In this last case the part is pressurized with helium. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a special device, a sniffer probe, that allows it to sample air (and tracer gas when confronted with a leak) at atmospheric pressure and to bring it into the mass spectrometer.

This mode of operation is frequently used to locate a leak that has been detected by other methods, in order to allow for parts repair. Modern machines can digitally remove the helium two decades below the background level and thus it is now possible detect leaks as small as 5·10{{sup|−10}}&amp;nbsp;Pa·m{{sup|3}}·s{{sup|−1}} in sniffing mode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Home Energy Station''' is the name of [[Honda]]'s heat and [[electricity generator]] for the home as well as a fuel provider for [[hydrogen]]-powered [[fuel cell]] vehicles. HES IV is able to supply a sufficient amount of hydrogen to power a fuel cell vehicle, such as the [[Honda FCX]], for daily operation while providing electricity for an average-sized household on an average days usage of energy.

The system [[Steam reforming|reforms]] [[natural gas]] to extract up to 3 normal cubic meters per hour (Nm3/hr) of hydrogen, which is stored in an internal [[hydrogen tank|tank]]. This hydrogen is stored for later use by the vehicle, and can also be supplied to hydrogen appliances or fuel cells within the home. The heat generated by the reforming process can also provide hot water to the home.

In addition to providing as much as 5 [[kilowatt]]s of electrical power to the home, the Home Energy Station is also able to function as a backup power generation system during power outages.

'''Indian Airlines Flight 440''' was a flight on 31 May 1973 that crashed while on approach to [[Palam Airport]] killing 48 of the 65 passengers and crew on board.

==The crash==
Flight 440 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from [[Madras]] (now Chennai), [[Tamil Nadu]] to New Delhi. A Boeing 737 named ''Saranga'' was used for the flight. As Flight 440 approached [[Palam International Airport]] in driving dust and a rainstorm, the aircraft struck high tension wires during a [[Non-directional beacon|NDB approach]] with visibility below minimal. The aircraft crashed and caught fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19730531-0|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 737-2A8 VT-EAM Delhi-Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL )|website=[[Aviation Safety Network]] |publisher=[[Flight Safety Foundation]] |access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48 of the 65 passengers and crew on board Flight 440 perished in the accident.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_pszAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zTIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5529,2776816&amp;dq=new+delhi+indian+airlines+crash&amp;hl=en Airline crash in New Delhi]."

The '''Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR)''' is a design for a [[small modular reactor]] (SMR) that employs [[molten salt reactor]] technology being developed by the Canadian company Terrestrial Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terrestrial Energy Inc.|url=http://www.terrestrialenergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is based closely on the [[denatured molten salt reactor]] (DMSR), a reactor design from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and also incorporates elements found in the SmAHTR, a later design from the same laboratory. 
The IMSR belongs to the DMSR class of [[molten salt reactor]]s (MSR) and hence is a "[[burner reactor|burner]]" reactor that employs a liquid fuel rather than a conventional solid fuel; this liquid contains the [[nuclear fuel]] and also serves as primary [[coolant]].

In 2016, Terrestrial Energy engaged in a pre-licensing [[design review]] for the IMSR with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]]&lt;ref name=nsppr3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/reactors/power-plants/pre-licensing-vendor-design-review/index.cfm#R3 |title=Pre-Licensing Vendor Design Review - Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission |publisher=Nuclearsafety.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Terrestrial-Energy-to-complete-US-loan-guarantee-application-1409167.html |title= Terrestrial Energy to complete US loan guarantee application |website= world-nuclear-news.org |date= 2016-09-14 |accessdate= 2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the second phase of this process in October 2018 after successfully completing the first stage in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Integrated-Molten-Salt-Reactor-passes-pre-licensing-milestone-0911177.html |title= Integrated Molten Salt Reactor passes pre-licensing milestone |website= world-nuclear-news.org |date= 2017-11-09 |accessdate= 2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WNN201810 /&gt;

The Integral Molten Salt Reactor is so called because it integrates into a compact, sealed and replaceable nuclear reactor unit, called the IMSR Core-unit. 
The unit include all the primary components of the nuclear reactor that operate on the liquid molten fluoride salt fuel: moderator, primary heat exchangers, pumps and shutdown rods.&lt;ref name=arisimsr400 /&gt;
The Core-unit forms the heart of the IMSR system. In the Core-unit, the fuel salt is circulated between the graphite core and heat exchangers. 
The Core-unit itself is placed inside a surrounding vessel called the guard vessel. The entire Core-unit module can be lifted out for replacement. The guard vessel that surrounds the Core-unit acts as a [[containment vessel]]. In turn, a shielded silo surrounds the guard vessel.

The IMSR belongs to the [[denatured molten salt reactor]] (DMSR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ORNL-TM-7207 |first1=J.R. |last1=Engel, |first2=W.W. |last2=Grimes, |first3=H.F. |last3=Bauman, |first4=H.E. |last4=McCoy |first5=J.F. |last5=Bearing |first6=W.A. |last6=Rhoades |title=Conceptual design characteristics of a denatured molten salt reactor with once-through fueling|url=http://moltensalt.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/references/static/downloads/pdf/ORNL-TM-7207.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; class of [[molten salt reactor]]s (MSR). 
It is designed to have all the safety features associated with the Molten Salt class of reactors including low pressure operation (the reactor and primary coolant is operated near normal atmospheric pressure), the inability to loose primary coolant (the fuel is the coolant), the inability to suffer a melt down accident (the fuel operates in an already molten state) and the robust chemical binding of the fission products within the primary coolant salt (reduced pathway for accidental release of fission products).

The design uses standard assay [[Enriched uranium|low-enriched uranium]] fuel, with less than 5% U&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt; with a simple converter (also known as a "burner") [[Nuclear fuel cycle|fuel cycle]] objective (as do most operating power reactors today). The proposed fuel is in the form of [[uranium tetrafluoride]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} (UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) blended with carrier salts. These salts are also fluorides, such as [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), [[sodium fluoride]] (NaF) and/or [[beryllium fluoride]] (BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). These carrier salts increase the [[heat capacity]] of the fuel and lower the fuel's melting point. 
The fuel salt blend also acts as the primary coolant for the reactor.

The IMSR is a [[thermal-neutron reactor]] moderated by vertical [[graphite]] tubular elements. 
The molten salt fuel-coolant mixture flows upward through these tubular elements where it goes critical. 
After heating up in this moderated core the liquid fuel flows upward through a central common chimney and is then pulled downward by pumps through heat exchanges positioned inside the reactor vessel. 
The liquid fuel then flow down the outer edge of the reactor core to repeat the cycle. 
All the primary components, heat exchangers, pumps etc. are positioned inside the reactor vessel. 
The reactor’s integrated architecture avoids the use of external piping for the fuel that could leak or break.   

The piping external to the reactor vessel contain two additional salt loops in series: a secondary, nonradioactive coolant salt, followed by another (third) coolant salt. 
These salt loops act as additional barriers to any radionuclides and improve the system's heat capacity. It also allows easier integration with the heat sink end of the plant; either process heat or power applications using standard industrial grade [[steam turbine]] plants are envisioned by Terrestrial Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://terrestrialenergy.com/technology/how-it-works/ |title=How it Works |publisher=Terrestrial Energy |date= |accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMSR Core-unit is designed to be completely replaced after a 7-year period of operation. This ensures that a sufficient operational lifetime of materials used in the IMSR reactor core can be achieved. During  operation, small fresh fuel/salt batches are periodically added to the reactor system. This online refueling process does not require the mechanical refueling machinery required for solid fuel reactor systems.

Many of these design features are based on two previous molten salt designs from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) – the ORNL denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) from 1980 and the solid fuel/liquid salt cooled, small modular advanced high temperature reactor (SmAHTR), a 2010 design. The DMSR, as carried into the IMSR design, proposed to use molten salt fuel and graphite moderator in a simplified converter design using [[Low-enriched uranium|LEU]] , with periodic additions of LEU fuel. Most previous proposals for molten salt reactors all bred more fuel than needed to operate, so were called breeders. Converter or "burner" reactors like the IMSR and DMSR can also utilize plutonium from existing spent fuel as their makeup fuel source. The more recent SmAHTR proposal was for a small, modular, molten salt cooled but solid [[TRISO]] fuelled reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SmAHTR presentation by Sherrell Greene|url=https://web.ornl.gov/fhr/presentations/SmAHTR_Greene.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replaceable Core-unit==
The design uses a '''replaceable Core-unit'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=John Laurie|title=IMSR animation|date=2016-05-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObxAl-0IeoI|accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the graphite moderator's lifetime exposure to [[neutron]] flux causes it to start distorting beyond acceptable limits, rather than remove and replace the graphite moderator, the entire IMSR Core-unit is replaced as a unit. This includes the pumps, pump [[motor]]s, shutdown rods, heat exchangers and graphite moderator, all of which are either inside the vessel or directly attached to it. To facilitate a replacement, the design employs two reactor [[silo]]s in the reactor building, one operating and one idle or with a previous, empty, spent Core-unit in cool-down. After 7 years of operation, the core-unit is shut down and cools in place to allow short lived [[radionuclides]] to decay. After that cool-down period, the spent core-unit is lifted out and eventually replaced.

Simultaneously, a new Core-unit is installed and activated in the second silo. This entails connection to the secondary (coolant) salt piping, placement of the containment head and [[biological shield]] and loading with fresh fuel salt. The containment head provides double containment (the first being the sealed reactor vessel itself). The new Core-unit can now start its 7 years of power operations.

The IMSR vendor accumulates sealed, spent IMSR Core-units and [[spent fuel]] salt tanks in onsite, below grade silos. This operational mode reduces uncertainties with respect to long service life of materials and equipment, replacing them by design rather than allowing age-related issues such as [[creep (deformation)|creep]] or [[corrosion]] to accumulate.

The IMSR employs online fueling. While operating, small fresh fuel salt batches are periodically added to the reactor system. As the reactor uses circulating liquid fuel this process does not require complex mechanical refueling machinery. The reactor vessel is never opened, thereby ensuring a clean operating environment. During the 7 years, no fuel is removed from the reactor; this differs from solid fuel reactors which must remove fuel to make room for any new fuel assemblies, limiting fuel utilization.

==Safety==
Nuclear power reactors have three fundamental safety requirements: control, cooling, and containment.

=== Control ===
Nuclear reactors require control over the [[criticality (status)|critical]] [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As such, the design must provide for exact control over the reaction rate of the core, and must enable reliable shut-down when needed. Under routine operations, the IMSR relies on intrinsic stability for reactivity control; there are no control rods. This behavior is known as [[Negative feedback|negative power feedback]] - the reactor is self-stabilizing in power output and temperature, and is characterized as a load-following reactor. Reactor power is controlled by the amount of heat removed from the reactor: increased heat removal results in a drop in fuel salt temperature, resulting in increased reactivity and in turn increased power. Conversely, reducing heat removal will increase reactor temperature at first, lowering reactivity and subsequently reducing reactor power. If all heat removal is lost, the reactor power will drop to a very low power level.

As backup (and shutdown method for maintenance), the IMSR employs shutdown rods filled with [[neutron absorber]]. As with other molten salt reactors, the reactor can also be shut down by draining the fuel salt from the Core-unit into storage tanks.

=== Cooling ===
[[File:IRVACS.png|thumb|Description of the IMSR passive closed cooling system, IRVACS.|thumb|The IMSR uses a passive, always-on backup cooling system for the reactor. A cooling path is provided between the outside of the guard vessel that surrounds the Core-unit. Any heatup of the Core-unit will increase heat transfer to the guard vessel, in turn increasing heat loss to the natural circulation gas. The heated gas is cooled by the reactor building metal roof, and is returned to the guard vessel to be heated again. Click on image to enlarge.]]

A nuclear reactor is a [[thermal]] power system—it generates [[heat]], transports it and eventually converts it to [[mechanical energy]] in a [[heat engine]], in this case a [[steam turbine]]. 
Such systems require that the heat is removed, transported and converted at the same rate it is generated.

A fundamental issue for nuclear reactors is that even when the nuclear fission process is halted, heat continues to be generated at significant levels by the [[radioactive decay]] of the [[fission products]] for days and even months. 
This is known as [[decay heat]] and is the major safety driver behind the cooling of nuclear reactors, because this decay heat must be removed. 
For conventional [[light water reactor]]s the flow of cooling water must continue in all foreseeable circumstances, otherwise damage and melting of the (solid) fuel can result. 
Light water reactors operate with a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] coolant, requiring high pressure operation and depressurization in an emergency.

The IMSR instead uses liquid fuel at low pressure. 
IMSR does not rely on bringing coolant to the reactor or depressurizing the reactor, using instead passive cooling. 
Heat continuously dissipates from the Core-unit. 
During normal operation, heat loss is reduced by the moderate temperature of the reactor vessel in normal operation, combined with the stagnant air between the Core-unit and guard vessel, which only allows radiant heat transfer. Radiant heat transfer is a strong function of temperature; any increase in the temperature of the Core-unit will rapidly increase heat loss. 
Upon shutdown of the primary salt pumps, the reactor passively drops power to a very small level. 
It can still heat up slowly by the small but constant [[decay heat]] as previously described. Due to the large heat capacity of the graphite and the salts, this increase in temperature is slow. 
The higher temperatures slowly increase thermal radiant heat loss, and subsequent heat loss from the guard vessel itself to the outside air. 
Low pressure nitrogen flows by [[natural convection]] over the outside of the guard vessel, transporting heat to the metal reactor building roof. 
This roof provides the passive heat loss required, acting as a giant radiator to the outside air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://public.ornl.gov/conferences/MSR2016/docs/Presentations/MSR2016-day2-03-TEI-LEBLANC-ORNL-An-Overview-of-the-IMSR.pdf |title=Presentations |website=public.ornl.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result, heat loss is increased while decay heat naturally drops; an equilibrium is reached where temperatures peak and then drop. 
The thermal dynamics and inertia of the entire system of the Core-unit in its containment silo is sufficient to absorb and disperse decay heat. 
In the long term, as decay heat dissipates almost completely, and the plant is still not recovered, the reactor would increase power to the level of the heat loss to IRVACS, and stay at that low power level (and normal temperature) indefinitely.

The molten salts are excellent heat transfer fluids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energyfromthorium.com/pdf/FFR_chap12.pdf|title="Chemical Aspects of Molten Fluoride Salt Reactor Fuels." Fluid Fuel Reactors.|last=Lane|first=James|date=1958|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with volumetric heat capacities close to water, and good [[thermal conductivity]].

=== Containment ===
All molten salt reactors have features that contribute to containment safety. These mostly have to do with the properties of the salt itself. The salts are chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]]. They do not burn and are not combustible. The salts have low [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (high boiling point around 1400&amp;nbsp;°C), allowing a low operating pressure of the core and cooling loops. This provides a large margin above the normal operating temperature of some 600 to 700&amp;nbsp;°C. This makes it possible to operate at low pressures without risk of coolant/fuel boiling.

The high [[chemical stability]] of the salt precludes energetic [[chemical reactions]] such as [[hydrogen]] gas generation/[[detonation]] and [[sodium]] combustion, that can challenge the design and operations of other reactor types. The fluoride salt reacts with many fission products to produce chemically stable, non-volatile [[fluorides]], such as [[cesium fluoride]]. Similarly, the majority of other high risk fission products such as [[iodine]], dissolve into the fuel salt, bound up as [[iodide]] salts.  However, for the [[MSRE]] "of the order of
one-fourth to one-third of the iodine has not been
adequately accounted for.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fission product behavior in the MSRE|url=http://web.ornl.gov/info/reports/1975/3445605698493.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some uncertainty as to whether this is a measurement error, as the concentrations are small and other fission products also had similar accounting problems. See [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]] and [[molten salt reactor]] for more information.

The IMSR also has multiple physical containment barriers. It uses a sealed, integral reactor unit, the Core-unit. The Core-unit is surrounded by the guard vessel on its side and bottom, itself surrounded by a gas-tight structural steel and concrete silo. The Core-unit is covered up from the top by a steel containment head which is itself covered by thick round steel and concrete plates. The plates serve as radiation shield and provide protection against external hazards such as explosions or aircraft crash penetration. The [[Containment building|reactor building]] provides an additional layer of protection against such external hazards, as well as a controlled, filtered-air confinement area.

Most molten salt reactors use a [[gravity]] drain tank as an emergency storage reservoir for the molten fuel salt. The IMSR deliberately avoids this drain tank. The IMSR design is simpler and eliminates the bottom drain line and accompanying risks from low level vessel penetrations. The result is a more compact, robust design with fewer parts and few failure scenarios.

Relative to light water reactors the scale of the containment building is significantly reduced as there is no need to deal with the phase change risk associated with a water based coolant.

== Economics ==

The economics of nuclear reactors are dominated by the capital cost—the cost to build and finance the construction of the facility. Fuel and operating cost are relatively low.

Due to the dominance of capital cost, most nuclear power reactors have sought to reduce cost per Watt by increasing the total power output of the reactor system. However, this often leads to very large projects that are difficult to finance, manage and to standardize.

Terrestrial Energy is arguing for a different approach: to produce a more compact, more efficient reactor system.

=== Safety Approach ===
A large part of the cost of nuclear power reactors is related to safety and the resulting quality and regulatory requirements that can drive costs up. 
The IMSR approach is to rely on inherent and passive safety features rather than complex active systems, potentially reducing costs in this important area, while increasing the safety profile.

*For control, inherent reactor power control by reactivity feedback, rather than a reactor control system with actively positioning control rods is used.
*For cooling, the always-on, passive cooling system based on heat loss, enabling safety-grade decay heat removal. Unlike conventional reactors the IMSR decay cooling mechanism does not require backup electric power. 
*For containment, the salt properties provide a key difference with water-cooled reactors. The salts have low vapor pressures and high boiling points, and are chemically stable. High pressures and hydrogen threats are thereby eliminated from the containment design, reducing the required containment volume, design pressure, and attendant costs. The high cesium retention of the salt reduces the available source term in an accident, further reducing the fundamental risk profile.

=== Efficiency ===
Traditional nuclear reactors, such as pressurized and boiling water reactors, feature relatively low efficiency, typically around 32-34%. 
This is due to the relatively low temperature heat produced. 
The higher salt temperature of the IMSR provides heat at higher temperatures that results in an efficiency in the 45-48% range.&lt;ref name=arisimsr400&gt;https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/IMSR400.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The IMSR produces around 1.4 times more electricity per unit reactor heat output compared to traditional commercial reactors.

Nuclear efficiency is less important to economics, as fuel costs in a nuclear facility are low.
However, the higher temperature of the IMSR allows for the use of lower-cost turbine systems, already in common use with coal fired power stations, as opposed to traditional nuclear power plant that usually need specialized low-temperature turbines. 
This helps to further lower the capital cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aris.iaea.org/PDF/IMSR400.pdf |title=Data |website=aris.iaea.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modularity ===

A key cost driver is in the nature of the equipment used. Standardized, manufactured components are lower cost than specialized, or even custom components. The compact Core-unit forms the basic modularity of the IMSR system. Core-units are identical and small enough to be fabricated in a controlled in-door environment.

=== Reactor Pressure ===

High pressure is a cost driver for any component, as it increases both quality requirements and required materials (thickness). Large, high pressure components require heavy weldings and forgings that have limited availability. A typical operating pressure for a PWR is over 150 atmospheres. Due to the low vapor pressure and high boiling point of the salt, the Core-unit operates at or near atmospheric pressure (other than a few atmospheres of pressure from the [[hydrostatic]] weight of the salt), despite the higher operating temperature. This results in lighter, thinner components that are easier to manufacture and modularize.

=== Other Markets ===

Various non-electric applications exist that have a large market demand for energy: steam reforming, paper and pulp production, chemicals and plastics, etc. Light water reactors are less suitable to most of these markets due to the low operating temperature of around 300&amp;nbsp;°C, and the large size of the reactors. The IMSR's smaller size and higher operating temperature (around 700&amp;nbsp;°C) could potentially open up new markets in these [[process heat]] applications. In addition, [[cogeneration]], the production of both heat and electricity, are also potentially attractive.

==Licensing==
Terrestrial Energy was founded in Canada in 2013 with the objective of commercialising the IMSR, and is currently working to license (in both Canada and the USA) an IMSR design with a thermal power capacity of 400 [[megawatt|MW]] (equivalent to 190 MW electrical).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hlregulation.com/2016/12/12/advanced-reactor-designer-terrestrial-energy-plans-to-file-license-application-with-nrc-in-2019/&lt;/ref&gt; 
As standard industrial grade steam turbines are proposed, cogeneration, or [[combined heat and power]], is also possible. 

In 2016, Terrestrial Energy engaged in a pre-licensing [[design review]] for the IMSR with the [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]].&lt;ref name=nsppr3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/reactors/power-plants/pre-licensing-vendor-design-review/index.cfm#R3 |title=Pre-Licensing Vendor Design Review - Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission |publisher=Nuclearsafety.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Terrestrial-Energy-to-complete-US-loan-guarantee-application-1409167.html |title= Terrestrial Energy to complete US loan guarantee application |website= world-nuclear-news.org |date= 2016-09-14 |accessdate= 2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It successfully completed the first stage of this process in late 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Integrated-Molten-Salt-Reactor-passes-pre-licensing-milestone-0911177.html |title= Integrated Molten Salt Reactor passes pre-licensing milestone |website= world-nuclear-news.org |date= 2017-11-09 |accessdate= 2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered the second phase of the design review in October 2018.&lt;ref name=WNN201810&gt;{{cite news |title=IMSR starts second stage of Canadian design review - World Nuclear News |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/IMSR-starts-second-stage-of-Canadian-design-review |accessdate=17 October 2018 |work=www.world-nuclear-news.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Terrestrial Energy claims it will have its first commercial IMSRs licensed and operating in the 2020s.&lt;ref name=WNN201810 /&gt;

Terrestrial Energy had previously proposed designs in 3 other sizes, generating 80 MW, 300 MW and 600 MW thermal power, and 33, 141, and 291 MW of electricity respectively, using standard industrial grade steam turbines. However it has not sought to take these alternate designs through the licensing process.

During 2016, Vyasi Dam and Hathiari Power Station were being constructed simultaneously, and Lakhwar Dam was planned to be constructed after the completion of Vyasi dam,&lt;ref name=kat9/&gt; due to the lack of funds.&lt;ref name=kat8&gt;[http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/uttarakhands-new-cm-t-s-rawat-seeks-release-of-funds-for-lakhwar-dam/57764933 Uttarakhand's new CM TS Rawat seeks release of funds for Lakhwar dam], [[Times of India]], 22 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; All approvals are in place for the whole project including the Lakhwar Dam, except for the funding from the union government (c. 2017).&lt;ref name=kat8/&gt;&lt;ref name=kat12&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/A-%E2%80%98green%E2%80%99-rap-on-the-knuckles/article14616003.ece A ‘green’ rap on the knuckles ], [[The Hindu]], 22 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, things were expedited when [[Government of India]], under Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]], granted clearance for the release of funding for the whole project at an estimated cost of INR39.7 billion (3966.51 crore), including INR25 billion (2578.23 crore) for the irrigation component to build dam and canals and  INR13,9 billion (1388.28 crore) for the power generation component.&lt;ref name=kat7&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/government-press-release/status-of-lakhwar-dam-116120100759_1.html Status of Lakhwar Dam], Business Standard, 2 Dec 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in January 2018, bid for the construction of Lakhwar dam and 300MW power station was called by the Uttrakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited.&lt;ref name=kat4&gt;[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/haryana-to-rejuvenate-the-existing-canal-system/articleshow/62415505.cms Haryana to rejuvenate the existing canal system], [[Times of India]], 8 Jan 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after in early 2018, Prime Minister Modi laid the foundation stone, and construction commenced after contracts were awarded with a target completion deadline of 4 years by December 2022.&lt;ref name=harkrishi1&gt;[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/KRISHI%20SAMVAD%20October%202018.pdf Kirishi Samvad], Oct 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limnoforming''' (from Greek: limnee, "lake"; Latin: formo, "to shape", as in shaping, fashioning, molding, modeling) is the process of  manipulating the physical or chemical properties of a body of water by introducing organisms which facilitate higher level biological activity, thus impacting the overall [[ecology]] of a given body of water, and eventually adjacent [[ecosystems]]. 
	
Limnoforming is a process using living organisms to enhance a habitat's [[abiotic component]], ultimately rendering it more conducive to a higher ecological quality. This could be accomplished by introducing a population of organisms, e.g., [[invertebrates]] or [[microorganisms|microbes]], en masse to the substrate of a body of water.  These organisms would then physically and/or chemically alter the underwater environment to furnish a more suitable substrate for a wider range of biological activity; the result being an increased ecological function (e.g., in [[Food web|trophic dynamics]]), and thus a higher quality ecological state. Ultimately, limnoforming aims to accelerate the rate of ecological succession in distressed aquatic systems (e.g., lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan), so as to produce a biologically complex climax community in a comparatively short amount of time.
	
The concept of limnoforming originated from the [[benthic ecology]] laboratory of Dr. Jerry L. Kaster, School of Freshwater Sciences, University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. Limnoforming was partially inspired by, and is similar in several aspects to, the concept of [[terraforming]]. The two concepts' main similarity is that both aim to accelerate the rate of change occurring in a given environment, in terms of its habitability for a given species or for a number of species, and furthermore, the overall function of its ecology. Instead of creating a habitable ecosystem or biosphere from scratch, limnoforming simply aims to amend degradated Earthly aqueous environments less apt to harboring a high quality ecological community into an environment which does support an ecologically flourishing system. Limnoforming differs from traditional habitat rehabilitation or restoration in that limnoforming is driven by an early [[Seral community|sere]] biological succession process that modifies the physical substrate making it better suited for later seres, whereas rehabilitation/restoration is generally driven by targeting a terminal sere that is poorly adapted at re-forming habitat upon which it depends.
	
The initial limnoforming study, in [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay, Lake Michigan]], uses freshwater [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]] to re-consolidate highly fluid [[gyttja]] substrate (organic black ooze) found extensively in lower Green Bay. The goal is to modify substrate suitability for the [[mayfly]] ''Hexagenia''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaster, et al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, this mayfly was found in abundance but the [[eutrophication]] of the bay led to their demise in first half of the 20th century.

'''Linenizing''' is the process of impressing a [[linen]]-like pattern onto the surface of [[paper]], [[cloth]] or other [[malleable]] substance.

Linenizing is most frequently done on paper products and its use on paper products goes back to the early part of the 20th century.

==Process==
A paper roll is threaded between two hard rollers, usually made from [[steel]]. One or both of the steel rollers has a linen pattern [[engraving|engraved]] on it. As the nip pressure between the two hard rollers increases, the pattern from the engraved roller(s) is pressed into the paper. The end result is a pattern that looks like a linen table cloth or linen dress.

Various patterns and depths of those patterns have been developed throughout the years. Generally, the pattern is a series of vertical and horizontal lines with distances varying between those lines.

'''Lion Air Flight 583''' (JT 583) was a scheduled passenger flight from [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]], Jakarta to [[Juanda International Airport]] in Surabaya with a stopover at [[Adi Sumarmo Airport]], [[Surakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. On 30 November 2004, the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 overran the runway of [[Adi Sumarmo Airport]] and crashed onto a cemetery on landing. The Captain, a flight attendant and 23 passengers were killed in the crash.
Investigation conducted by the Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee]] concluded that the crash was caused by hydroplaning, which was aggravated by wind shear.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, with serial number 49189, made its first flight in November 1984 and was operated by another airline before being acquired by Lion Air in 2002 and registered as PK-LMN. Lion Air had sold the aircraft to another airline for delivery in January 2005.&lt;ref name="registration"&gt;[http://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-md80-49189.htm Lion Air PK-LMN (Airfleets)]. Retrieved: 20 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==
Flight 583 took off from [[Jakarta]] at 17:00 local time (West Indonesian Time) carrying 146 passengers and 7 crew members. Most of the passengers were members of the Nahdlatul Ulama, who were attending a national meeting held after the victorious result of the 2004 Indonesian Presidential Election. The flight was piloted by Captain Dwi Mawastoro, who was a former military  pilot, and First Officer Stephen Lesdek under instrument flight regulations. The flight was uneventful until its landing.&lt;ref name="SU"&gt;{{citeweb|title=Lion Air Nyungsep di Solo, 23 Tewas|url=http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/01/nas01.htm|publisher=''Suara Merdeka''|access-date=2017-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623070354/http://www.suaramerdeka.com/harian/0412/01/nas01.htm|archive-date=2017-06-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flight arrived at the airport during dusk, at around 18:00 local time in heavy rain. A thunderstorm was reportedly present during the landing.&lt;ref name="SU"/&gt;

Flight 583 was configured appropriately for landing, touched down "smoothly", according to most passengers, and the thrust reversers were deployed.   
The aircraft, however, failed to slow adequately, overran the runway and slammed into an embankment. The impact caused the floor of the front portion of the plane to collapse, reportedly killing many of the passengers. The aircraft split into two sections, coming to rest in the end of the Runway and fuel began to leak. Passengers had difficulty locating emergency exits in the waning light. Some of the passengers self-evacuated through the opening in the fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Lion Air Terpeleset di Solo, 10 Tewas.|url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/news/2004/11/30/05551921/lion-air-terpeleset-di-solo-10-tewas|publisher=''Tempo''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate aftermath===
The airport was closed and emergency services were notified. Injured passengers were transported by police vehicles and ambulances to numerous hospitals across Solo. At least 14 of the dead were transported to the Pabelan Hospital. 6 people, 2 dead and 4 injured, were transported to Panti Waluyo Hospital. Others were transported to Oen Kandangsapi, Brayat Minulya, Kasih Ibu, Oen Solo Baru and PKU Muhammadiyah, as well as facilities in Boyolali and Karanganyar. Survivors with minor injuries were treated inside the airport VIP terminal.&lt;ref name="SU"/&gt;

Ultimately 25 persons were listed by authorities as killed and 59 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=31 killed in Indonesian plane crash|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/31-killed-in-Indonesian-plane-crash/2004/12/01/1101577515548.html|publisher=''The Sydney Morning Herald''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SU"/&gt;

==Passengers and crew==
Most of the passengers were Indonesian, while airport officials confirmed that one Singaporean woman was among the injured. The pilot at the controls of the plane during the landing and subsequent crash was Captain Dwi Mawastoro; his co-pilot was First Officer Stephen Lesdek. Captain Dwi died in the crash while First Officer Lesdek survived with serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Duka Menyelimuti Keluarga Dwi Mawastoro|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/90931/duka-menyelimuti-keluarga-dwi-mawastoro|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
The newly elected Indonesian President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] ordered an immediate investigation onto the cause of the crash of Flight 583 and stated that the investigation should be open to the public to prevent unwanted rumors in the aftermath of the crash. Minister of Transportation Hatta Radjasa stated that the Transportation Department would evaluate the Indonesian airline operations in response to the crash of Flight 583 in addition to two other similar incidents which occurred on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Menhub Berjanji Mempercepat Investigasi Kecelakaan Lion Air|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/90943/menhub-berjanji-mempercepat-investigasi-kecelakaan-lion-air|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Flight recorders|black box]] was subsequently found on 1 December 2004 and was transported to the Adi Sumarmo Emergency Operations Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Kotak Hitam Pesawat Lion Air Ditemukan|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/90941/kotak-hitam-pesawat-lion-air-ditemukan?id=90941|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness to the crash claimed that lightning struck the plane during its landing phase. According to him, the landing light and the interior lighting were extinguished after the strike.&lt;ref name="SU"/&gt;

[[Lion Air]] "claimed responsibility" for the crash and stated that they would pay the hospital bills of the survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Lion Air Menyatakan Bertanggung Jawab|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/90921/lion-air-menyatakan-bertanggung-jawab?id=90921|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they denied that the crash was caused by the airline's misconduct and stated that weather was the main factor. According to them, Flight 583 experienced a tailwind during its landing, which explained why the plane didn't stop. Others claimed that the brakes or the thrust reversers malfunctioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Lion Air Membantah Menyalahi Prosedur Penerbangan|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/90940/lion-air-membantah-menyalahi-prosedur-penerbangan|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preliminary report was published in 2005. Investigators stated that the plane's braking system was not at its optimum level. This condition was aggravated by weather conditions during the accident. Investigators also identified a faulty thrust reverser as one of the cause of the crash; they subsequently issued several recommendations to Lion Air.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Kecelakaan Lion Air di Solo Terkuak|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/95280/kecelakaan-lion-air-di-solo-terkuak|publisher=''Liputan 6''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''low-emission vehicle''' is a [[motor vehicle]] that emits relatively low levels of [[motor vehicle emissions]]. The term may be used in a general sense, but in some countries it is defined in [[air quality]] statutes.
Different groups of people ("go greens", "go with the flow" and "no greens") show different interest in low emission vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knez|first1=Matjaz|last2=Jereb|first2=Borut|last3=Obrecht|first3=Matevz|title=Factors influencing the purchasing decisions of low emission cars : a study of Slovenia|journal=Transportation research part D|date=2014|volume=30|pages=53–61|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920914000339|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2014.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8057">The '''Lunnasting stone''' is a stone bearing an [[ogham]] inscription, found at [[Lunnasting]], [[Shetland]]  and donated to the [[Museum of Scotland|National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] in 1876.

==Discovery==
[[File:Lunnasting stone.jpg|thumb|Ogham inscription on the Lunnasting stone]]
It was found by Rev. J.C. Roger in a cottage, who stated that the stone had been unearthed from a "moss" (i.e. a [[peat]] bog) in April 1876, having been originally discovered five feet (1.5 m) below the surface.&lt;ref name=ucl&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/lting_1.html "LTING/1"] [[University College London]], quoting [[Katherine Forsyth|Forsyth, K.]] (1996) "The Ogham Inscriptions of Scotland: An Edited Corpus". Unpublished PhD. Harvard University. Retrieved 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone is made of slate and is {{convert|44|in|m}} long, by about {{convert|13|in|m}} in breadth and {{convert|1|in|cm}} thick with the inscription on the flat surface. In addition to the ogham letters which are arranged down a centre line, there is a small cruciform mark near the top  of the stone, which may be a [[rune|runic]] letter or a Christian cross. It is unknown whether this mark and the ogham are contemporary, or whether the former was later added to a pre-existing standing stone.&lt;ref name=ucl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goudie, Gilbert (11 December 1876) [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/.../12_020_032.pdf "On Two Monumental Stones with Ogham Inscriptions Recently Discovered in Shetland"] (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. '''12''' pp. 20&amp;ndash;32. Archaeology Data Service. Retrieved 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscription and date==
The [[Pictish language|Pictish]]  inscription has been read as:

:''ttocuhetts: ahehhttmnnn: hccvvevv: nehhton''  by Allen and Anderson (1903)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/lting_1.html "LTING/1"] [[University College London]], quoting Allen, J. R. and J. Anderson (1903) "The Early Christian Monuments of Scotland". Part III. Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Retrieved 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''ettecuhetts: ahehhttannn: hccvvevv: nehhtons'' by Forsyth (1996)&lt;ref name=ucl/&gt;

The script probably contains the personal name "Nechton", and Diack (1925) took the view that the last two words mean “the vassal of Nehtonn“&lt;ref&gt;Diack, Francis (1924-25) [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/.../59_257_269.pdf “The Old-Celtic Inscribed and Sculptured Stone at AuquHollie, Kincardineshire, and Ogam in Scotland”.] (pdf) ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''. '''59''' pp. 257&amp;ndash;69. Archaeology Data Service. Retrieved 12 July 2009. Diack wrote in a footnote: “The spelling hccvvevv looks uncouth, but it is so only in the same way as foreigners speaking their own language are described as "jabbering" by those unfamiliar with it. The orthographical practice in late ogams in Scotland is usually to write all consonants double, whether historically double or not, except when beginning a word and except m and s. Aspiration is sometimes indicated by writing h before the aspirated consonant, not after it as in the later texts and to-day. We write the word here, therefore, in unaspirated form, cvev, which stands for older qvev or gev according to the orthography employed (usually in the inscriptions the labialised q is written merely q, not qv). The word qev, "vassal, servant," occurs so spelt in an unpublished ogam from northern Scotland, of date before A.D. 600. The modern Gaelic, descending from qev by regular phonetic law, is ce, "companion, spouse," the same semantic development as is seen in celi above, which gives to-day ceile, of the same meaning. It may be remarked in passing that this Old Gaelic inscription of Lunnasting was specially selected by Bhys to "challenge" the possibility of its being explained by "any
Aryan language" (Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot., vol. xxxii. p. 325).”&lt;/ref&gt;
but it is otherwise without certain interpretation. Forsyth suggests ''Ahehhttannn'' is also a personal name.&lt;ref name=ucl/&gt;

Other recent attempts include:
:"King Nechtan of the kin of Ahehhtmnnn"
:"The widow of Kenneth made (these as) testimonials on her part".&lt;ref&gt;Schei (2006) p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The word-dividing dots suggest [[Old Norse|Norse]] influence, but this could pre-date the Viking occupation of Shetland, and an eighth- or ninth-century origin is likely for the ogham work.&lt;ref name=ucl/&gt;

==Other theories==
The difficulties of providing a clear interpretation of the script has led to a number of other suggestions.

Vincent (1896) suggests that the stone may have been erected by "Irish missionary monks not earlier than A.D. 580" and quotes an unnamed expert's transcription of the ogham as:
:''eattuicheatts maheadttannn hccffstff ncdtons''.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, W.T. (1896) [http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/In-Search-Of-Gravestones-Old-And-Curious2/#p171 "In Search Of Gravestones Old And Curious"] Part 2. London. Mitchell and Hughes. Retrieved 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockwood (1975) writes that "the last word is clearly the commonly occurring name Nechton, but the rest, even allowing for the perhaps arbitrary doubling of consonants in Ogam, appears so exotic that philologists conclude that Pictish was a non-Indo-European language of unknown affinities".&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, W.B. (1975) ''Languages of The British Isles, Past And Present.'' André Deutsch. {{ISBN|0-233-96666-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was also taken of the ogham inscribed on the [[Orkney|Orcadian]] [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]] until its 1995 interpretation as [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Katherine Forsyth|Forsyth, Katherine]] (1995) "The ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl from Buckquoy: evidence for the Irish language in pre-Viking Orkney?", in ''The  Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.'' '''125''' pp. 677&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt;

A language of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin has also been suggested as providing a solution:

:''etxekoez aiekoan nahigabe ba nengoen'' (English: "The one of the house found me without will in the pain.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~levarre/clanmac/clanmac.htm "Clan MacNaughton"] Ancestry.com. Retrieved 12 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
although the original speculations in 1968 by Henri Guiter do not appear convincing and were not well received academically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~legneref/bronze/scotogam.htm "Scotland's Ogam Inscriptions".] University of California, Riverside. Retrieved 12 July 2009. This paper quotes a 1969 radio talk by Douglas Gifford of the Department of Spanish of St. Andrew’s University, who said that Guiter had "twisted the evidence", but also suggested that the Basque connection was worth a further look.&lt;/ref&gt; The eminent [[Vasconic languages|Vasconist]] [[Larry Trask]] says about Guiter's attempts that "like the majority of such dramatic announcements, this one has been universally rejected. Pictish specialists dismiss it out of hand, and vasconists have been no more impressed". The criticisms focus on random readings being assigned to Ogam letters, alleged complete decipherment of inscriptions too weathered to be read with certainty, the use of 20th century Basque rather than reconstructed [[Proto-Basque]] forms, disregarding syntax and highly fanciful translations.&lt;ref name=Trask&gt;[[Larry Trask|Trask, L.]] ''The History of Basque'' Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mad Max''''' is a 1979 Australian [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[action film]] directed by [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]], produced by [[Byron Kennedy]], and starring [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Max Rockatansky|"Mad" Max Rockatansky]], [[Joanne Samuel]], [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]], [[Steve Bisley]], Tim Burns, and [[Roger Ward]]. James McCausland and Miller wrote the screenplay from a story by Miller and Kennedy. The film presents a tale of [[societal collapse]], murder, and [[revenge]] set in a future Australia, in which an unhinged policeman becomes embroiled in a violent feud with a savage motorcycle gang. [[Principal photography]] took place in and around [[Melbourne]], Australia, and lasted six weeks.

The film initially received a polarized reception upon its release in April 1979, although it won three [[AACTA Awards]] and attracted a [[cult following]], while its critical reputation has grown since. Filmed on a budget of  [[Australian dollar|A$]]0.4 million, it earned more than [[USD|US$]]100 million worldwide in gross revenue, and held the ''[[Guinness Record Book|Guinness]]'' record for most profitable film. The success of ''Mad Max'' has been credited for further opening up the global market to [[Australian New Wave]] films. The film became the first in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' series]], giving rise to three sequels, ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (1981), ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|Beyond Thunderdome]]'' (1985), and ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road|Fury Road]]'' (2015).

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries are 400 to 700 words. Words such as "realise", "recognise", or anything that relates to Australian English should NOT be changed to their American or British English versions without viewing the WP:ENGVAR guidelines. --&gt;
"A few years from now", when society is teetering upon the brink of collapse, [[Berserker#Modern context|berserk]] [[motorbike gang]] member Crawford "Nightrider" Montazano steals a [[Pursuit Special]], which he uses to escape from police custody after killing a rookie officer of an Australian highway patrol called the Main Force Patrol (MFP). Even though he manages to elude other MFP officers, the MFP's top pursuit man [[Max Rockatansky]] then engages the less-skilled Nightrider in a high-speed chase. Crawford breaks off first, but then is unable to recover his concentration before he and his girlfriend are killed in a fiery crash.

At the MFP garage, Max is shown what one of the MFP mechanics has been working on: a [[Supercharger|supercharged]] black Pursuit Special, the last of the [[V8 engine|V8]] Interceptors.

Meanwhile, Nightrider's motorbike gang, led by Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti, run roughshod over a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel, and terrorising the population. They trap a young couple in a car, destroy the car, and it is implied that they rape the couple. Max and fellow officer Jim Goose arrest Toecutter's young protégé Johnny the Boy at the scene. When neither the rape victims nor any of the townspeople show for Johnny's trial, the federal courts close the case, Johnny's attorneys releasing him into Bubba's custody over Goose's furious objections.

While Goose visits a nightclub in the city the next day, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike in the parking lot. After being thrown into a field at high speed uninjured during a ride, Goose borrows a [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] to haul his damaged bike back to the MFP. However, Johnny ambushes Goose off the road by throwing a [[drum brake|brake drum]] through his windshield, and, at Toecutter's insistence, throws a match into the wreck of the ute, igniting the gasoline and burning Goose alive. After seeing Goose's charred body in a hospital [[intensive care unit|intensive-care unit]], Max becomes disillusioned with the MFP, and informs his superior Fifi Macaffee that he will resign to maintain what sanity he has left. Fifi convinces Max to take a vacation first before he submits his final letter of resignation.

Max takes his wife Jessie and their infant son Sprog on vacation in a panel van. When they stop to fix the spare tyre, Jessie takes Sprog to buy ice cream. They encounter Toecutter and his gang, who attempt to molest Jessie, but Jessie kicks Toecutter in the crotch, picking up Sprog and escaping into the car. They flee to a remote farm owned by an elderly friend named May Swaisey. Toecutter's gang follows them there and ambushes Jessie in the woods. With May's help, Jessie and Sprog escape, but when they try to drive away, the van overheats and they are run over by the gang while trying to escape on foot. Max arrives too late as Sprog is instantly killed while Jessie eventually dies while in a hospital ICU.

The loss of his family ultimately drives Max into a rage as he dons his police uniform and takes the black Pursuit Special from the MFP garage to pursue and eliminate the gang. He rams several gang members off a bridge at high speed, kills Bubba during an ambush, and forces Toecutter into the path of a speeding semi-trailer truck. Finally, Max locates Johnny at a car wreck stealing the boots of its dead driver. Max handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked vehicle, and sets a crude time-delay fuse involving a slow petrol leak and Johnny's lighter. Max throws Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs or his ankle in order to escape. The vehicle explodes as Max drives away.

==Production==

===Development===
[[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|medical doctor]] in [[Sydney]], working in a hospital [[Emergency department|emergency room]] where he saw many injuries and deaths of the types depicted in the film. He also witnessed many car accidents growing up in rural [[Queensland]] and lost at least three friends to accidents as a teenager.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Scott Murray &amp; Peter Beilby, "George Miller: Director", ''Cinema Papers'', May–June 1979 p369-371&lt;/ref&gt;

While in residency at a Sydney hospital, Miller met amateur filmmaker [[Byron Kennedy]] at a summer film school in 1971. The duo produced a [[short film]], ''Violence in the Cinema, Part 1'', which was screened at a number of [[film festival]]s and won several awards. Eight years later, the duo produced ''Mad Max'', working with first-time [[screenwriter]] James McCausland (who appears in the film as the bearded man in an apron in front of the diner).

According to Miller, his interest while writing ''Mad Max'' was "a [[Silent film|silent movie]] with sound", employing highly kinetic images reminiscent of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Harold Lloyd]] while the narrative itself was basic and simple. Miller believed that audiences would find his violent story more believable if set in a bleak dystopian future.&lt;ref name=aso/&gt; Screenwriter McCausland drew heavily from his observations of the [[1973 oil crisis]]' effects on Australian motorists:

{{quote|Yet there were further signs of the desperate measures individuals would take to ensure mobility. A couple of oil strikes that hit many pumps revealed the ferocity with which Australians would defend their right to fill a tank. Long queues formed at the stations with petrol—and anyone who tried to sneak ahead in the queue met raw violence. ... George and I wrote the [''Mad Max''] script based on the thesis that people would do almost anything to keep vehicles moving and the assumption that nations would not consider the huge costs of providing infrastructure for alternative energy until it was too late.|sign=James McCausland|source=writing on [[peak oil]] in ''The Courier-Mail'', 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James McCausland |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20870561-3122,00.html |title=Scientists' warnings unheeded | work=The Courier-Mail |publisher=News.com.au |date=4 December 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kennedy and Miller first took the film to Graham Burke of Roadshow, who was enthusiastic. The producers felt they would be unable to raise money from the government bodies "because Australian producers were making art films, and the corporations and commissions seemed to endorse them whole-heartedly", according to Kennedy.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;Peter Beilby &amp; Scott Murray, "Byron Kennedy", ''Cinema Papers'', May–June 1979 p366&lt;/ref&gt;

They designed a 40-page presentation, circulated it widely, and eventually raised the money. Kennedy and Miller also contributed funds themselves by doing three months of emergency medical calls, with Kennedy driving the car while Miller did the doctoring.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; Miller claimed the final budget was between $350,000 and $400,000.&lt;ref name="stratton"/&gt; His brother [[Bill Miller (film producer)|Bill Miller]] was an associate producer on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max Tail Credits|url=http://www.ozmovies.com.au/uploads/media/credit/0001/61/a797d7132d139cdd5013f10690c98235b89e3074.pdf|website=Ozmovies|accessdate=15 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515040740/http://www.ozmovies.com.au/uploads/media/credit/0001/61/a797d7132d139cdd5013f10690c98235b89e3074.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
George Miller had considered an American actor to "get the film seen as widely as possible" and even travelled to Los Angeles, but eventually opted to not do so as "the whole budget would be taken up by a so-called American name."&lt;ref name=aso/&gt; So instead the cast would deliberately feature lesser known actors so they did not carry past associations with them.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt; Miller's first choice for the role of Max was the Irish-born [[James Healey (actor)|James Healey]], who at the time worked at a Melbourne [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] and was seeking a new acting job. Upon reading the script Healey declined, finding the meager, terse dialogue too unappealing.&lt;ref name=mel/&gt;

Casting director Mitch Mathews invited for ''Mad Max'' a class of recent [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] graduates, specifically asking a NIDA teacher for "spunky young guys". Among these actors was [[Mel Gibson]], whose audition impressed Miller and Matthews and earned him the role of Max. An apocryphal tale stated that Gibson went to auditions in poor shape following a fight, but this has been denied by both Matthews and Miller. Gibson's friend and classmate [[Steve Bisley]], who worked with him in his only screen role, 1976's ''[[Summer City]]'', became Max's partner Jim Goose. A classmate of both, [[Judy Davis]], was said to have auditioned and passed over,&lt;ref name=mel&gt;{{cite book|title=Mel Gibson - Man on a Mission|first=Wensley|last=Clarkson|chapter=6|publisher=John Blake Publishing|year=2005|ISBN=1784184756}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Miller has declared she was only in Matthews' studio to accompany Gibson and Bisley.&lt;ref name=aso/&gt;

Most of the biker gang extras were members of actual Australian outlaw motorcycle clubs and rode their own motorcycles in the film. They were even forced to ride the motorcycles from their residence in Sydney to the shooting locations in Melbourne because the budget did not allow for aerial transport.&lt;ref name=aso&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/people/George_Miller_1/interview/|title=Filmmaker interviews - George Miller on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online|website=aso.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the main cast members (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Roger Ward and Vincent Gil) had previously appeared in ''[[Stone (1974 film)|Stone]]'', a 1974 film about biker gangs that is said to have inspired Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/12/stone-rewatched-the-australian-bikie-movie-that-inspired-mad-max|title=Stone rewatched: the Australian bikie movie that inspired Mad Max|first=Luke|last=Buckmaster|date=11 July 2015|website=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most memorable car, Max's black ''[[Pursuit Special]]'' was a [[Ford Falcon (Australia)#XB|1973 Ford XB Falcon GT351]], a limited edition hardtop (sold in Australia from December 1973 to August 1976), which was primarily modified by Murray Smith, Peter Arcadipane, and Ray Beckerley. The main modifications are the Concorde front end and the supercharger protruding through the bonnet (for looks only; it was not functional). The Concorde front was a fairly new accessory at the time, designed by Peter Arcadipane at Ford Australia as a showpiece, and later became available to the general public because of its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmaxmovies.com/cars/interceptor/history1.html |title='&amp;#39;Mad Max'&amp;#39; Movies – The History of the '&amp;#39;Interceptor'&amp;#39;, Part 1 |publisher=Madmaxmovies.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After filming of the first movie was completed, the car went up for sale, but no buyers were found; eventually it was given to Smith.

When production of ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' began, Miller brought the car back for use in the sequel. Once filming was over the car was left at a wrecking yard in [[Adelaide]] since it again found no buyers, and was bought and restored by Bob Forsenko. Eventually it was sold again and was put on display in the [[Cars of the Stars Motor Museum]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. When the museum closed, the car went to a collection in the Dezer Museum in [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carsofthestars.com/ |title=Cars of the Stars Motor Museum |publisher=Carsofthestars.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pursuit Special Replica.jpg|thumb|Replica Mad Max [[Pursuit Special]] vehicle outside the [[Silverton, New South Wales|''Silverton Hotel'']]]]
The Nightrider's vehicle, another Pursuit Special, was a [[Holden Monaro|1972 Holden HQ Monaro LS coupe]], also tuned but deliberately damaged to look like it had been involved in crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmaxmovies.com/cars/madmax/Nightrider/index.html |title='&amp;#39;Mad Max'&amp;#39; Cars – The Nightrider's Monaro |publisher=Madmaxmovies.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The car driven by the young couple that is vandalised and then finally destroyed by the bikers is a [[Chevrolet Bel Air|1959 Chevrolet Bel Air Sedan]], also modified to look like a hot-rod car with fake fuel injection stacks, fat tires, and a flame red paint job.

Of the motorcycles that appear in the film, 14 were [[Kawasaki Kz1000]] donated by a local Kawasaki dealer. All were modified in appearance by Melbourne business La Parisienne — one as the MFP bike ridden by 'The Goose' and the balance for members of the Toecutter's gang, played in the film by members of a local Victorian motorcycle club, the Vigilantes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmaxmovies.com/cast/MadMax/Bikers/index.html |title='&amp;#39;Mad Max'&amp;#39; Cars – Toecutter's Gang (Bikers) |publisher=Madmaxmovies.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of filming, fourteen vehicles had been destroyed in the chase and crash scenes, including the director's personal [[Mazda Bongo]] (the small, blue van that spins uncontrollably after being struck by the ''Big Bopper'' in the film's opening chase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyttelton|first1=Oliver|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About 'Mad Max'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-mad-max-33-years-to-the-day-after-it-hit-theaters-20120412|website=[[Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms]]|accessdate=14 May 2015|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Originally, filming was scheduled to take ten weeks—six weeks of first unit, and four weeks on stunt and chase sequences. However, four days into shooting, Rosie Bailey, who was originally cast as Max's wife, was injured in a bike accident. Production was halted, and Bailey was replaced by Joanne Samuel, causing a two-week delay.

In the end, the shoot took six weeks over November and December 1977, with a further six-week second unit. The unit reconvened two months later, in May 1978, and spent another two weeks doing second unit shots and re-staging some stunts.&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; Miller described the whole experience as "[[guerrilla filmmaking]]", where the crew would close roads without [[filming permit]]s, not use walkie-talkies because their frequency coincided with the [[police radio]], and after filming was done Miller and Kennedy would even sweep down the roads. Still, as filming progressed the [[Victoria Police]] became interested in the production, helping the crew by closing down roads and escorting the vehicles.&lt;ref name=aso/&gt; Because of the film's low budget, all but one of the police uniforms in the film were made of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl leather]], with only one genuine leather uniform made for stunt sequences involving Bisley and Gibson.

Shooting took place in and around [[Melbourne]]. Many of the car chase scenes for ''Mad Max'' were filmed near the town of [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]], northeast of [[Geelong]]. The early town scenes with the Toe Cutter Gang were filmed in the main street of [[Clunes, Victoria|Clunes]], north of Ballarat. Much of the streetscape remains unchanged. Some scenes were filmed at [[Stockton Beach#Tin City|Tin City]] at [[Stockton Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliot|first1=Tim|title=Welcome to Tin City, Stockton|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2013518/welcome-to-tin-city-stockton/|website=[[The Newcastle Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110044051/http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2013518/welcome-to-tin-city-stockton/|archivedate=10 November 2014|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin City, Stockton Beach|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20130827018|website=[[Parliament of New South Wales]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630125907/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LA20130827018|archivedate=30 June 2015|date=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "execution of the mannequin" scene was filmed at Seaford Beach in [[Seaford, Victoria]].

''Mad Max'' was one of the first Australian films to be shot with a [[Anamorphic widescreen|widescreen anamorphic]] lens,&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p241-243&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' (1974) was shot in anamorphic four years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harland Smith |first1=Richard |title=The Cars That Ate Paris |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&amp;id=982841%7c708979&amp;name=The-Cars-That-Ate-Paris |website=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] |accessdate=14 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514223733/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&amp;id=982841%7C708979&amp;name=The-Cars-That-Ate-Paris |archivedate=14 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller's desire to shoot in anamorphic made him seek a set of [[Todd-AO]] [[wide angle lens]]es used by [[Sam Peckinpah]] to film ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972), which were damaged enough in that shoot to get discarded in Australia. The only one which worked properly was a 35mm lens which was employed in the whole of ''Mad Max''.&lt;ref name=aso/&gt;

===Post-production===
The film's post-production was done at a friend's apartment in North Melbourne, with Wilson and Kennedy editing the film in the small lounge room on a home-built editing machine that Kennedy's father, an engineer, had designed for them. Wilson and Kennedy also performed [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editing]] there.

Tony Patterson edited the film for four months, then had to leave because he was contracted to make ''[[Dimboola (1979 film)|Dimboola]]'' (1979). George Miller took over editing with Cliff Hayes, and they worked on it for three months. Kennedy and Miller did the final cut,&lt;ref name="kennedy"/&gt; in a process Miller described as "he would cut sound in the lounge room and I’d cut picture in the kitchen." Professional sound engineer [[Roger Savage]] would perform the sound mixing in the studio he worked after finishing his work with [[Little River Band]], and employed [[SMPTE timecode|timecoding]] techniques that were unseen in Australian cinema.&lt;ref name=aso/&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Mad Max (soundtrack)}}
The [[Film score|musical score]] for ''Mad Max'' was composed and conducted by Australian composer [[Brian May (composer)|Brian May]] (not to be confused with [[Brian May|the guitarist]] of the English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]). Miller wanted a Gothic, [[Bernard Herrmann]]–type score and hired May after hearing his work for ''[[Patrick (1978 film)|Patrick]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt; "With the little budget that we had we went ahead and did it, and spent a lot of time on it," said May. "George was marvelous to work with; he had a lot of ideas about what he wanted although he wasn’t a musician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Graeme|title=A Conversation with Brian May|journal=CinemaScore|date=14 May 2015|publication-date=1983|issue=11/12|url=http://www.runmovies.eu/?p=5512|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023151412/http://www.runmovies.eu/?p=5512|archive-date=23 October 2013|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A soundtrack album was released in 1980 by [[Varèse Sarabande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Jerry|title=Movie/TV Soundtracks and Original Cast Recordings Price and Reference Guide|date=2010|publisher=Osborne Enterprises Publishing|location=[[Port Townsend, Washington]]|isbn=0932117376|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Mad Max'' was first released in Australia through Roadshow Film Distributors (now [[Village Roadshow Pictures]]) in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KU9wKR0DbRoC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=%22Mad+Max%22+-+Roadshow&amp;hl=en|last1=Moran|first1=Albert|last2=Vieth|first2=Errol|title=Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema|chapter=Kennedy Miller Productions|page=174|isbn=0-8108-5459-7|year=2005|accessdate=3 August 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press ([[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was sold overseas for $1.8 million, with [[American International Pictures]] releasing in the United States and [[Warner Bros.]] handling the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="stratton" /&gt; The film was banned in [[New Zealand]] and [[Sweden]], in the former because of the scene where Goose is burned alive inside his vehicle: it unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before the film's release. It was later shown in New Zealand in 1983 after the success of the sequel, with an 18 certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll |first=Larry |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604110/20090202/story.jhtml |title=Greatest Movie Badasses Of All Time: Mad Max – Movie News Story &amp;#124; MTV Movie News |publisher=Mtv.com |date=3 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban in Sweden was removed in 2005, and it has since been shown on television and sold on home media there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/04/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-mad-max-252553/|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About ‘Mad Max’|first=Oliver|last=Lyttelton|date=12 April 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When shown in the United States during 1980, the original Australian dialogue was redubbed by an American crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herx|first=Henry|title=The Family Guide to Movies on Video|chapter=Mad Max|page=163 (pre-release version)|isbn=0-8245-0816-5|year=1988|publisher=The Crossroad Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; American International Pictures distributed this dub after it underwent a management re-organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpUCVjhvrFgC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Mad+Max%22+-+American+International&amp;hl=en|last=McFarlane|first=Brian|title=Australian Cinema|page=30|isbn=0-231-06728-3|year=1988|accessdate=3 August 2011|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian slang]] and terminology was also replaced with American usages (examples: "Oi!" became "Hey!", "See looks!" became "See what I see?", "windscreen" became "windshield", "very toey" became "super hot", and "proby"—probationary officer—became "rookie"). AIP also altered the operator's duty call on Jim Goose's bike in the beginning of the film (it ended with "Come on, Goose, where are you?"). The only dubbing exceptions were the voice of the singer in the Sugartown Cabaret (played by Robina Chaffey), the voice of Charlie (played by John Ley) through the mechanical voice box, and Officer Jim Goose ([[Steve Bisley]]), singing as he drives a truck before being ambushed. Since Mel Gibson was not well known to American audiences at the time, trailers and television spots in the United States emphasised the film's action content. The original Australian dialogue track was finally released in [[North America]] in 2000 in a [[Limited release|limited theatrical reissue]] by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], the film's current rights holders. It has since been released in the US on DVD with the US and Australian soundtracks on separate tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zad|first1=Martie|title=Gibson's Voice Returns on New 'Mad Max' DVD|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/29/entertainment/et-zad29|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=14 May 2015|archiveurl=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/29/entertainment/et-zad29|archivedate=20 December 2012|date=29 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/30657/Mad-Max/overview|title=Mad Max (1979)|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, the film polarized critics. In a 1979 review, the Australian [[Social commentary|social commentator]] and film producer [[Phillip Adams]] condemned ''Mad Max'', saying that it had "all the emotional uplift of ''[[Mein Kampf]]''{{-"}} and would be "a special favourite of rapists, sadists, child murderers and incipient [[Charles Manson|[Charles] Mansons]]".&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Adams, ''[[The Bulletin]]'', 1 May 1979; cited by [http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=5602&amp;s=reviews ''urban cinefile'', 2010, "Mad Max"]. Adams has since remained a prominent opponent of screen violence. He has also been consistent in his criticism of Mel Gibson's political and social opinions.&lt;/ref&gt; After its United States release, Tom Buckley of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "ugly and incoherent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173BBB2CA7494CC6B6799C836896 |title=Mad Max |publisher=The New York Times |first=Tom |last=Buckley |date=14 June 1980 |accessdate=2010-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521024820/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173BBB2CA7494CC6B6799C836896 |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen King]], writing in ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]],'' called the film a "turkey." However, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine praised the directorial debut by Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117792854.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |title=Mad Max Review – Read Variety's Analysis Of The Movie Mad Max |publisher=Variety.com |date= 1979-01-01|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by the [[Australian Film Institute]]. The film also won the Special Jury Award at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|79501|section=awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mad Max'' holds a 90% "Fresh" rating on review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 61 positive critic reviews, with consensus being "Staging the improbable car stunts and crashes to perfection, director George Miller succeeds completely in bringing the violent, post-apocalyptic world of ''Mad Max'' to visceral life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mad Max (1979)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_max/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been included in "best films of all time" lists by ''The New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/movies/1000best.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made | date=29 April 2003 | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/1000-films-to-see-before-you-die|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=1000 films to see before you die|date=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[particle physics]], '''majorons''' (named after [[Ettore Majorana]]) are a hypothetical type of [[Goldstone boson]] that are theorized to mediate the [[neutrino]] [[mass]] violation of [[lepton]] number or [[B−L|''B'' − ''L'']] in certain high energy collisions such as

: {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|W boson-}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|W boson-}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|Majoron}}

Where two [[electrons]] collide to form two [[W and Z bosons|W bosons]] and the majoron J. The U(1)&lt;sub&gt;B–L&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry is assumed to be global so that the majoron is not "eaten up"{{clarify|date=December 2013}} by the gauge boson and spontaneously broken. Majorons were originally formulated in four [[dimension]]s by [[Y. Chikashige]], [[Rabindra Mohapatra|R. N. Mohapatra]] and [[Roberto Peccei|R. D. Peccei]] to understand neutrino masses by the [[seesaw mechanism]] and are being searched for in the neutrino-less [[double beta decay]] process. There are theoretical extensions of this idea into [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories and theories involving extra compactified dimensions. By propagating through the extra [[spatial dimension]]s the detectable number of majoron creation events vary accordingly. Mathematically, majorons may be modeled by allowing them to propagate through a material while all other [[Standard Model]] [[force]]s are fixed to an [[orbifold]] point.

== Searches ==

'''Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Dallas''' (NWIRP) was a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facility which had the mission of designing, fabricating, and testing prototype weapons and equipment, and is located in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref name=Kalthoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalthoff|first=Ken|title=Government Peddles Property as Congress Fights Over Debt|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/politics/Government-Peddles-Property-as-Congress-Fights-Over-Debt-126425633.html|publisher=[[KXAS]]|accessdate=10 July 2013|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the plant was sold to a private corporation for $357,500.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Excess Properties|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/fiscal/excess-property-map|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located for most of its time next to [[Naval Air Station Dallas]], now known as the '''Grand Prairie Armed Forces Reserve Complex'''.

==History as a military facility==
The '''Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant, Dallas''' was a property where the U.S. military crafted fighter planes during both World War II and the Cold War.  NASA also used this site for the space exploration program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcma.mil/News_Room/headlines/2015/081715.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nozzle''' is a device designed to control the direction or characteristics of a [[fluid]] flow (especially to increase velocity) as it exits (or enters) an enclosed chamber or [[pipe (material)|pipe]].

A nozzle is often a pipe or tube of varying cross sectional area, and it can be used to direct or modify the flow of a fluid ([[liquid]] or [[gas]]). Nozzles are frequently used to control the rate of flow, speed, direction, mass, shape, and/or the pressure of the stream that emerges from them. In a nozzle, the velocity of fluid increases at the expense of its pressure energy.

==Types==

===Jet===
A '''gas jet''', '''fluid jet''', or '''hydro jet''' is a nozzle intended to eject gas or fluid in a coherent stream into a surrounding medium. Gas jets are commonly found in [[gas stove]]s, [[oven]]s, or [[barbecue]]s. Gas jets were commonly used for [[Gas lighting|light]] before the development of [[electric light]]. Other types of fluid jets are found in [[carburetor]]s, where smooth [[calibrated orifice]]s are used to regulate the flow of [[gasoline|fuel]] into an engine, and in [[jacuzzi]]s or [[spa]]s.

Another specialized jet is the [[Laminar flow|laminar]] jet. This is a water jet that contains devices to smooth out the pressure and flow, and gives [[laminar flow]], as its name suggests. This gives better results for [[fountain]]s.

The foam jet is another type of jet which uses foam instead of a gas or fluid.

Nozzles used for feeding [[hot blast]] into a [[blast furnace]] or [[forge]] are called [[tuyere]]s.

Jet nozzles are also used in large rooms where the distribution of air via ceiling diffusers is not possible or not practical. Diffusers that uses jet nozzles are called jet diffuser where it will be arranged in the side wall areas in order to distribute air. When the temperature difference between the supply air and the room air changes, the supply air stream is deflected upwards, to supply warm air, or downwards, to supply cold air.&lt;ref&gt;"Jet nozzles, Type DUK" from TROX company, retrieved 15 October 2013 from http://www.troxaustralia.com/xpool/download/en/technical_documents/diffusers/leaflets/t_1_2_2_duk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===High velocity===
[[File:Raketendüse.jpg|thumb|A nozzle from the Ariane-5 rocket]]

Frequently, the goal of a nozzle is to increase the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing medium at the expense of its [[pressure]] and [[internal energy]].

Nozzles can be described as ''convergent'' (narrowing down from a wide diameter to a smaller diameter in the direction of the flow) or ''divergent'' (expanding from a smaller diameter to a larger one). A [[de Laval nozzle]] has a convergent section followed by a divergent section and is often called a [[convergent-divergent nozzle]] ("con-di nozzle").

Convergent nozzles accelerate subsonic fluids. If the nozzle pressure ratio is high enough, then the flow will reach sonic velocity at the narrowest point (i.e. the ''nozzle throat''). In this situation, the nozzle is said to be ''choked''.

Increasing the nozzle pressure ratio further will not increase the throat [[Mach number]] above one. Downstream (i.e. external to the nozzle) the flow is free to expand to supersonic velocities; however, Mach 1 can be a very high speed for a hot gas because the [[speed of sound]] varies as the square root of absolute temperature. This fact is used extensively in rocketry where [[hypersonic]] flows are required and where propellant mixtures are deliberately chosen to further increase the sonic speed.

Divergent nozzles slow fluids if the flow is subsonic, but they accelerate sonic or supersonic fluids.

[[de laval nozzle|Convergent-divergent nozzles]] can therefore accelerate fluids that have choked in the convergent section to supersonic speeds. This CD process is more efficient than allowing a convergent nozzle to expand supersonically externally.
The shape of the divergent section also ensures that the direction of the escaping gases is directly backwards, as any
sideways component would not contribute to thrust.

===Propelling===
{{main|Propelling nozzle}}
A jet exhaust produces a net thrust from the energy obtained from combusting fuel which is added to the inducted air. This hot air passes through a high speed nozzle, a ''propelling nozzle'', which enormously increases its kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;GFC Rogers, and Cohen, H. ''Gas Turbine Theory'', p.108 (5th Edition), HIH Saravanamuttoo&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing exhaust velocity increases thrust for a given mass flow, but matching the exhaust velocity to the air speed provides the best energy efficiency.  However, momentum considerations prevent jet aircraft from maintaining velocity while exceeding their exhaust jet speed.  The engines of supersonic jet aircraft, such as those of [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] and [[Supersonic transport|SST]] aircraft (e.g. [[Concorde]]) almost always achieve the high exhaust speeds necessary for supersonic flight by using a CD nozzle despite weight and cost penalties; conversely, subsonic jet engines employ relatively low, subsonic, exhaust velocities and therefore employ simple convergent nozzle, or even [[bypass ratio|bypass]] nozzles at even lower speeds.

[[Rocket motor]]s maximise thrust and exhaust velocity by using convergent-divergent nozzles with very large area ratios and therefore extremely high pressure ratios. Mass flow is at a premium because all the propulsive mass is carried with vehicle, and very high exhaust speeds are desirable.

===Magnetic===
[[Magnetic nozzle]]s have also been proposed for some types of propulsion, such as [[Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket|VASIMR]], in which the flow of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is directed by [[magnetic field]]s instead of walls made of solid matter.

===Spray===
{{main|Spray nozzle}}
Many nozzles produce a very fine spray of liquids.
* '''[[Atomizer nozzle]]s''' are used for spray painting, perfumes, [[carburetor]]s for [[internal combustion engine]]s, spray on [[deodorant]]s, [[antiperspirant]]s and many other similar uses.
* '''Air-Aspirating Nozzle '''uses an opening in the cone shaped nozzle to inject air into a stream of water based foam (CAFS/AFFF/FFFP) to make the concentrate "foam up". Most commonly found on foam extinguishers and foam handlines.
* '''Swirl nozzles''' inject the liquid in tangentially, and it spirals into the center and then exits through the central hole. Due to the vortexing this causes the spray to come out in a cone shape.

===Vacuum===
[[Vacuum cleaner]] nozzles come in several different shapes. Vacuum Nozzles are used in vacuum cleaners.

===Shaping===
Some nozzles are shaped to produce a stream that is of a particular shape. For example, [[extrusion molding]] is a way of producing lengths of metals or plastics or other materials with a particular cross-section. This nozzle is typically referred to as a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]].

[[File:Rolvenden, St Mary 's font 3273.JPG|thumb|The oyster-like effect of yew wood cut across the grain]]
'''Oystering''' or '''oyster veneer''' is a decorative form of [[Wood veneer|veneer]]ing, a type of [[parquetry]].&lt;ref name="colorado"&gt;[http://blog.coloradostyle.com/furniture-craftsmanship/furniture-construction/oyster-veneer/ Oyster Veneer - Coloradostyle.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is using thin slices of wood branches or roots cut in cross-section, usually from small branches of [[juglans|walnut]], [[olive]], [[kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] and less commonly [[laburnum]], [[yew]] and [[cocus]].&lt;ref name="colorado" /&gt; The resulting circular or oval pieces of veneer are laid side by side in furniture to produce various decorative patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitalcrispin.com/veneer_terminology.aspx Veneer terminology]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the shape formed resembles an oyster shell the technique acquired the name of oyster veneering.&lt;ref name="terms"&gt;[http://www.antique-marks.com/antique-terms-o.html Antique terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rau"&gt;[http://www.rauantiques.com/library/Did%20you%20Know/oyster-veneer-1633.html Oyster Veneer - Rau Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

This technique is likely to have been developed by English cabinet-makers in the 1660s, immediately after the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]] of the monarchy, first being used on furniture such as the cocuswood cabinet on stand which bears the cipher of [[Queen Henrietta Maria]], constructed in c.1661-65, and now at [[Windsor Castle]]. Early oyster veneered cabinets were invariably in [[cocus]] or [[kingwood (wood)|kingwood]]. Contemporary [[longcase clock]] cases were similarly veneered.

By around the early 1670s softer and more cheaply available woods such as olive and walnut began to be used for oyster veneering, the fashion for such furniture becoming widespread and also spreading to Holland by around the mid-1670s. Oyster veneering fell out of fashion from c.1710. The chest illustrated here, if it is not a later reproduction, therefore appears to be an unusually late example.

[[File:Pele's hair.JPG|thumb|Strands of Pele's hair under microscope view]]
'''Pele's hair''' is a form of [[lava]]. It is named after [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian]] goddess of [[volcanoes]]. It can be defined as [[volcanic glass]] fibers or thin strands of volcanic glass.&lt;ref name="Shimozuru94"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00279606 | title=Physical parameters governing the formation of Pele's hair and tears | last=Shimozuru | first=Daisuke | journal=Bulletin of Volcanology | year=1994 | volume=56 | pages=217–219 | doi=10.1007/BF00279606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strands are formed through the stretching of molten [[basalt]]ic glass from lava, usually from [[lava fountain]]s, lava cascades, and vigorous lava flows.

Wind often carries the light fibers high into the air and to places several kilometers away from the vent. It is common to find strands of Pele's hair on high places like treetops, radio antennas, and electric poles.

Pele's hair does not only occur in Hawaii. It can be found near other volcanoes around the world, for example in Nicaragua ([[Masaya_Volcano|Masaya]]), Italy ([[Mount_Etna|Etna]]), Ethiopia ([[Erta_Ale|Erta’ Ale]]), and Iceland, where it is known as "nornahár" ("witches' hair").&lt;ref name="Duffield77"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/journal/1977/vol5issue1/report.pdf | last1=Duffield | first1=W. A. | last2=Gibson Jr. | first2=E. K. | last3=Heiken | first3=G. H. | title=Some characteristics of Pele’s hair | journal=Journal of Research of the [[USGS|U. S. Geological Survey]] | year=1977 | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=93–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually found in gaps in the ground, mostly near vents, skylights, ocean entry, or in corners where Pele's hair can accumulate.

It is not recommended to touch Pele's hair, because it is very brittle and very sharp, and small broken pieces can enter the skin. Gloves should be worn while examining it.

[[Pele's tears]] might occur with Pele's hair.&lt;ref name="Duffield77"/&gt; They can tell [[Volcanology|volcanologists]] a lot of information about the eruption, such as the temperatures and the magma's path to the surface. Plagioclase starts to crystallize from the magma of Pele's hair at around 1,160&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Katsura67"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/GJ/pdf/0104/01040157.PDF | title=Pele's hair as a liquid of Hawaiian tholeiitic basalts | author=Katsura, Takashi | journal=Geochemical Journal | year=1967 | volume=1 | pages=157–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the shape of the tears can provide an indication of the velocity of the eruption, and the bubbles of gas and particles trapped within the tears can provide information about the composition of the magma chamber.[[File:peleshair on antenna.jpg|thumb|Pele's hair caught on a radio antenna mounted on the south rim of [[Puʻu ʻŌʻō|Pu{{okina}}u {{okina}}Ō{{okina}}ō]], [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], July 22, 2005]]

== Formation ==

[[File:Pele's hair, Santiago Crater, Nindiri Volcano, Masaya Volcano National Park, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|upright|Pele's hair, Santiago Crater, Nindiri Volcano, [[Masaya Volcano]] National Park, [[Nicaragua]]]]
The strands are created when molten lava is ejected into the air and form tiny droplets, which elongate perfectly straight. It usually forms in lava fountains, lava cascades, and vigorous lava flows.&lt;ref name="Duffield77"/&gt;

== Features ==
Pele's hair has a golden yellow color and looks like human hair or dry straw. In sunlight, it has a shimmering gold color. Length varies considerably, but is typically 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm, and can be up to 2&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Herzog09"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703709003846 | title=Isotopic and elemental abundances of copper and zinc in lunar samples, Zagami, Pele’s hairs, and a terrestrial basalt | author=Herzog, G. F et al. | journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta | year=2009 | volume=73 | pages=5884–5904 | doi=10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hair diameter ranges from about 1 to 300&amp;nbsp;µm (0.001 to 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm), and therefore weight is accordingly low.

== Applications ==
A manufactured version of Pele's hair made from basalt rock and recycled slag from steel manufacturing called [[mineral wool]] or stone wool is commonly used as a non-combustible, durable, dimensionally stable, UV stable, hydrophobic, vapour-permeable building insulation for residential, commercial, and high rise buildings.

A hydrophilic version is used as a low water usage, high yield, soil substitute for hydroponic agriculture.

== Traditional beliefs ==
Pele is known as the goddess of fire, lightning, wind, dance and volcanoes. The legends that tell how Pele first came to the Hawaiian Islands have a lot of versions, but it is believed that Pele's spirit lives in the crater of the Kilauea volcano, on the island of Hawaii. Pele appears as a spirit in many forms, and she is considered a negative harbinger. Most native Hawaiians state that they have had at least one encounter with her.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Hawaiians traditionally believe that they must live in harmony with all natural things, and that Pele will curse with bad luck people who take lava rock, sand, seashells, or other natural parts of the islands away with them, until they return these items to their rightful place. Additionally, federal law prohibits taking anything out of a national park. Each year large quantities of such objects are mailed back to Hawaii by people who believe they have received such bad luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mythicalrealm.com/mythical-gods-legends/pele-goddess-of-fire-hawaii/|title=Pele, Hawaii Goddess of Fire: Hawaiian Legend ⋆ Mythical Realm|date=22 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertshawaii.com/blog/legend-behind-hawaii’s-goddess-fire|title=The Legend Behind Hawaii’s Goddess of Fire|work=Roberts Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goddessschool.com/projects/Amaris/L1FPPele.html|title=Hawai'ian Volcano Goddess, Madame Pele|first=Grandmother|last=Moon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Meisen''' was born in San Diego, California, and is a graduate (1976) of the [[University of California, San Diego]] with an Applied Mechanics and Engineering Sciences degree. In 1983, he co-founded SHARE (Self Help and Resource Exchange), North America's largest private food distribution program. Meisen founded [[Global Energy Network Institute]], GENI, [http://www.geni.org geni.org] in 1989, to conduct research and to educate world leaders to the strategy of linking renewable energy resources around the world. He is an internationally recognized speaker on the global issues of renewable energy, transmission and distribution of electricity, quality of life and its relationship to electricity, the environment and sustainable development.

Meisen is an active member of the IEEE and in the 90s chaired panels on the feasibility of high voltage, long distance transmission and also tapping remote renewables, both of which were featured in the IEEE Power Engineering Review.  He also participates regularly either with an exhibit or as a presenter at ACORE, the World Energy Conference, ISDE, CERES, and Rotary International.

In 2005, Meisen was a co-creator in partnership with KLD [http://www.kld.com kld.com], of the Global Climate 100 (GC100) - a sustainable index for [[socially responsible investing]].

A supersonic expansion fan, technically known as '''Prandtl–Meyer expansion fan''', is a centred expansion process that occurs when a supersonic flow turns around a [[Convex set|convex]] corner. The fan consists of an infinite number of [[Mach wave]]s, diverging from a sharp corner. When a flow turns around a smooth and circular corner, these waves can be extended backwards to meet at a point. 

Each wave in the expansion fan turns the flow gradually (in small steps). It is physically impossible for the flow to turn through a single "shock" wave because this would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="shockExpansion" &gt;[[Image:Shock expansion.png|thumb|300px|An expansion process through a single "shock" is impossible, because it will violate the second law of thermodynamics.]] '''Impossibility of expanding a flow through a single "shock" wave:''' 
Consider the scenario shown in the adjacent figure. As a supersonic flow turns, the normal component of the velocity increases (&lt;math&gt; w_2 &gt; w_1 &lt;/math&gt;), while the tangential component remains constant (&lt;math&gt; v_2 = v_1 &lt;/math&gt;). The corresponding change is the entropy (&lt;math&gt;\Delta s = s_2-s_1&lt;/math&gt;) can be expressed as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac{\Delta s}{R} 
&amp; = ln \bigg[ \bigg( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \bigg)^{1/(\gamma-1)} \bigg( \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} \bigg)^{-\gamma/(\gamma-1)} \bigg] \\
&amp; \approx \frac{\gamma+1}{12\gamma^2} \bigg( \frac{p_2 - p_1}{p_1} \bigg)^3 \\
&amp; \approx \frac{\gamma+1}{12\gamma^2} \bigg[ \frac{\rho_1 w_1^2}{p_1} \bigg( 1-\frac{w_2}{w_1}\bigg) \bigg]^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the universal gas constant, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of specific heat capacities, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the static density, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the static pressure, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy, and  &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the component of flow velocity normal to the "shock". The suffix "1" and "2" refer to the initial and final conditions respectively.

Since &lt;math&gt; w_2 &gt; w_1 &lt;/math&gt;, this would mean that &lt;math&gt;\Delta s &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is not possible, it means that it is impossible to turn a flow through a single shock wave. The argument may be further extended to show that such an expansion process can occur only if we consider a turn through infinite number of expansion waves in the limit &lt;math&gt; \Delta s \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;. Accordingly, an expansion process is an [[isentropic process]].
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Across the expansion fan, the flow accelerates (velocity increases) and the [[Mach number]] increases, while the [[static pressure]], [[temperature]] and [[density]] decrease. Since the process is [[isentropic]], the [[stagnation point|stagnation]] properties (e.g. the total pressure and total temperature) remain constant across the fan.

The theory was described by [[Theodor Meyer]] on his thesis dissertation in 1908, along with his advisor [[Ludwig Prandtl]], who had already discussed the problem a year before&lt;ref&gt;Meyer T. (1908) Über zweidimensionale Bewegungsvorgänge in einem Gas, das mit Überschallgeschwindigkeit strömt. Doctoral dissertation, Georg-August Universität, Göttingen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl, L. (1907). Neue Untersuchungen über die strömende Bewegung der Gase und Dämpfe. Physikalische Zeitschrift, 8, 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Flow properties ==
The expansion fan consists of an infinite number of expansion waves or [[Mach line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Image:Mach angle.jpg|thumb|300px|For an object moving at supersonic speeds (&lt;math&gt;u &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;) as it moves from point A to B (distance u·t), the disturbances originating from point A travel a distance c·t. The corresponding angle is known as a Mach angle and the lines enclosing the disturbed region are known as Mach lines (in 2-D case) or Mach cone (in 3-D).]] '''Mach lines (cone) and Mach angle:'''

'''Mach lines''' are a concept usually encountered in 2-D supersonic flows (i.e. &lt;math&gt;M \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;). They are a pair of bounding lines which separate the region of disturbed flow from the undisturbed part of the flow. These lines occur in pairs and are oriented at an angle 
:&lt;math&gt; \textstyle \mu = \arcsin \left( \frac{c}{u} \right) = \arcsin \left( \frac{1}{M} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 
with respect to the direction of motion (also known as the '''Mach angle'''). In case of 3-D flow field, these lines form a surface known as '''Mach cone''', with Mach angle as the half angle of the cone.

To understand the concept better, consider the case sketched in the figure. We know that when an object moves in a flow, it causes pressure disturbances (which travel at the speed of sound, also known as [[Mach wave]]s). The figure shows an object moving from point A to B along the line AB at supersonic speeds (&lt;math&gt;u &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;). By the time the object reaches point B, the pressure disturbances from point A have travelled a distance c·t and are now at circumference of the circle (with centre at point A). There are infinite such circles with their centre on the line AB, each representing the location of the disturbances due to the motion of the object. The lines propagating outwards from point B and tangent to all these circles are known as Mach lines.

''Note:'' These concepts have a physical meaning only for supersonic flows (&lt;math&gt;u \ge c&lt;/math&gt;). In case of subsonic flows, the disturbances will travel faster than the source and the argument of the &lt;math&gt;\arcsin( )&lt;/math&gt; function will be greater than one.

&lt;/ref&gt; The first Mach line is at an angle &lt;math&gt;\mu_1 = \arcsin \left( \frac{1}{M_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the flow direction, and the last Mach line is at an angle &lt;math&gt;\mu_2 = \arcsin \left( \frac{1}{M_2} \right)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to final flow direction. Since the flow turns in small angles and the changes across each expansion wave are small, the whole process is isentropic.&lt;ref name="shockExpansion" /&gt; This simplifies the calculations of the flow properties significantly. Since the flow is isentropic, the [[stagnation point|stagnation]] properties like [[stagnation pressure]] (&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;), [[stagnation temperature]] (&lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt;) and stagnation density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt;) remain constant. The final static properties are a function of the final flow Mach number (&lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;) and can be related to the initial flow conditions as follows,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{lcl}
\cfrac{T_2}{T_1} &amp;= &amp; \bigg( \cfrac{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_1^2}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_2^2} \bigg) \\
\\
\cfrac{p_2}{p_1} &amp;= &amp; \bigg( \cfrac{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_1^2}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_2^2} \bigg)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)} \\
\\
\cfrac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} &amp;= &amp;\bigg( \cfrac{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_1^2}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M_2^2} \bigg)^{1/(\gamma-1)}.
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The Mach number after the turn (&lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;) is related to the initial Mach number (&lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;) and the turn angle (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) by,

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \nu(M_2) - \nu(M_1) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;\nu(M) \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl–Meyer function]]. This function determines the angle through which a sonic flow ([[Mach number|M]] = 1) must turn to reach a particular Mach number (M). Mathematically,

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \nu(M) 
&amp; = \int \frac{\sqrt{M^2-1}}{1+\frac{\gamma -1}{2}M^2}\frac{\,dM}{M} \\
&amp; = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma -1}} \cdot \arctan \sqrt{\frac{\gamma -1}{\gamma +1} (M^2 -1)} - \arctan \sqrt{M^2 -1}. \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

By convention, &lt;math&gt;\nu(1) = 0. \,&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, given the initial Mach number (&lt;math&gt; M_1 &lt;/math&gt;), one can calculate &lt;math&gt;\nu(M_1) \,&lt;/math&gt; and using the turn angle find &lt;math&gt;\nu(M_2) \,&lt;/math&gt;. From the value of &lt;math&gt;\nu(M_2) \,&lt;/math&gt; one can obtain the final Mach number (&lt;math&gt; M_2 &lt;/math&gt;) and the other flow properties.

== Maximum turn angle ==
[[Image:Maximum turning angle.png|thumb|300px|There is a limit on the maximum angle (&lt;math&gt;\theta_{max}&lt;/math&gt;) through which a supersonic flow can turn.]]

As Mach number varies from 1 to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\nu \,&lt;/math&gt; takes values from 0 to &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{max} \,&lt;/math&gt;, where
: &lt;math&gt;\nu_\text{max} = \frac{\pi}{2} \bigg( \sqrt{\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}} -1 \bigg).&lt;/math&gt;

This places a limit on how much a supersonic flow can turn through, with the maximum turn angle given by,

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{max} = \nu_\text{max} - \nu(M_1). \,&lt;/math&gt;

One can also look at it as follows. A flow has to turn so that it can satisfy the boundary conditions. In an ideal flow, there are two kinds of boundary condition that the flow has to satisfy,
# Velocity boundary condition, which dictates that the component of the flow velocity [[normal component|normal]] to the wall be zero. It is also known as no-penetration boundary condition.
# Pressure boundary condition, which states that there cannot be a discontinuity in the static pressure inside the flow (since there are no shocks in the flow).

If the flow turns enough so that it becomes parallel to the wall, we do not need to worry about pressure boundary condition. However, as the flow turns, its static pressure decreases (as described earlier). If there is not enough pressure to start with, the flow won't be able to complete the turn and will not be parallel to the wall. This shows up as the maximum angle through which a flow can turn. The lower the Mach number is to start with (i.e. small &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;), the greater the maximum angle through which the flow can turn.

The [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]] which separates the final flow direction and the wall is known as a '''slipstream''' (shown as the dashed line in the figure). Across this line there is a jump in the temperature, density and [[tangential component]] of the velocity (normal component being zero). Beyond the slipstream the flow is stagnant (which automatically satisfies the velocity boundary condition at the wall). In case of real flow, a shear layer is observed instead of a slipstream, because of the additional [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary condition]].

==History==
[[File:Riverside Methodist Hospital 1.jpg|thumb|Front of Riverside Methodist Hospital]]
The hospital was founded on June 2, 1892 as the Protestant Hospital.  Located in a 15-room house on Dennison Avenue, Columbus, the Hospital could accommodate up to 40 patients.&lt;ref name="Tebben"&gt;

'''Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov''' ({{lang-ru|Станисла́в Евгра́фович Петро́в}}; 7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a [[lieutenant colonel]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] who became known as "the man who single-handedly saved the world from nuclear war" for his role in the [[1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident]]. 

On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]], Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the [[Oko]] nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the [[United States]], followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a [[false alarm]],&lt;ref name="AWC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldcitizens.org/petrov2.html | title=The Man Who Saved the World Finally Recognized | publisher=Association of World Citizens | accessdate=7 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000030/http://www.worldcitizens.org/petrov2.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his decision to disobey orders, against Soviet military protocol,&lt;ref name=BBC2013/&gt; is credited with having prevented an erroneous [[second strike|retaliatory nuclear attack]] on the United States and its [[NATO]] allies that could have resulted in large-scale [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. Investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tony |last=Long |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=The Man Who Saved the World by Doing ...

==Early life and military career==
Petrov was born on 7 September 1939 near [[Vladivostok]]. His father, Yevgraf, flew [[fighter aircraft]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanislav Petrov, Soviet Officer Who Helped Avert Nuclear War, Is Dead at 77|date=18 September 2017|accessdate=18 September 2017|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/stanislav-petrov-nuclear-war-dead.html|last=Chan|first=Sewell}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a nurse.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Petrov enrolled at the [[Kiev Military Aviation Engineering Academy|Kiev Higher Engineering Radio-Technical College]] of the [[Soviet Air Forces]], and after graduating in 1972 he joined the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2017/09/19/petrov|publisher=Lenta.Ru|date=19 September 2017|title=Смерть предотвратившего ядерную войну офицера Петрова подтвердили|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, he was assigned to the organization that oversaw the new early warning system intended to detect [[ballistic missile]] attacks from [[NATO]] countries.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/18/stanislav-petrov-the-man-who-quietly-saved-the-world-has-died-aged-77-6937015/|title=Stanislav Petrov - the man who quietly saved the world - has died aged 77|date=18 September 2017|work=Metro|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrov was married to Raisa, and had a son, Dmitri, and a daughter, Yelena. His wife died of cancer in 1997.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Incident==
{{main|1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident}}
According to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the UN{{spnd}}on 19 January 2006, over 22 years after the incident{{spnd}}nuclear retaliation requires that multiple sources confirm an attack.&lt;ref name="Russian Federation" /&gt; In any case, the incident exposed a serious flaw in the Soviet early warning system. Petrov has said that he was neither rewarded nor punished for his actions.&lt;ref name="lenta"&gt;[http://lenta.ru/news/2006/01/20/petrov/ В Нью-Йорке россиянина наградили за спасение мира]. Lenta.ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Had Petrov reported incoming American missiles, his superiors might have launched an assault against the United States,&lt;ref name=BBC2013&gt;(26 September 2013) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24280831 Stanislav Petrov: The man who may have saved the world] BBC News Europe. Retrieved 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; precipitating a corresponding nuclear response from the United States. Petrov declared the system's indication a false alarm. Later, it was apparent that he was right: no missiles were approaching and the computer detection system was malfunctioning. It was subsequently determined that the false alarm had been created by a rare alignment of sunlight on [[List of cloud types|high-altitude clouds]] above North Dakota and the [[Molniya orbit]]s of the satellites, an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Molniya%20orbit|title=Molniya orbit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brink&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ciy5R-tLiE "1983 The Brink of Apocalypse" Channel 4. Sequence on Petrov starts at 29.06 mins]&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrov later indicated that the influences on his decision included that he was informed a U.S. strike would be [[pre-emptive nuclear strike|all-out]], so five missiles seemed an illogical start;&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt; that the launch detection system was new and, in his view, not yet wholly trustworthy; that the message passed through 30 layers of verification too quickly;&lt;ref name="economist2017"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that ground radar failed to pick up corroborative evidence, even after minutes of delay.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm |title=I Had A Funny Feeling in My Gut |first=David |last=Hoffman |work=The Washington Post |date=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 2013 interview, Petrov said at the time he was never sure that the alarm was erroneous. He felt that his civilian training helped him make the right decision. He said that his colleagues were all professional soldiers with purely military training and, following instructions, would have reported a missile launch if they had been on his shift.&lt;ref name=BBC2013/&gt;

Petrov underwent intense questioning by his superiors about his judgment. Initially, he was praised for his decision.&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt; General [[Yury Votintsev]], then commander of the Soviet Air Defense's Missile Defense Units, who was the first to hear Petrov's report of the incident (and the first to reveal it to the public in the 1990s), states that Petrov's "correct actions" were "duly noted".&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt; Petrov himself states he was initially praised by Votintsev and promised a reward,&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moskovskiye"&gt;[http://www.flb.ru/info/27637.html Тот, который не нажал]. ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; but recalls that he was also reprimanded for improper filing of paperwork because he had not described the incident in the [[war diary]].&lt;ref name="moskovskiye"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

He received no reward. According to Petrov, this was because the incident and other bugs found in the missile detection system embarrassed his superiors and the influential scientists who were responsible for it, so that if he had been officially rewarded, they would have had to be punished.&lt;ref name="AWC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lenta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moskovskiye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;BBC TV Interview, BBC Moscow correspondent Allan Little, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He was reassigned to a less sensitive post,&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; took early retirement (although he emphasized that he was not "forced out" of the army, as is sometimes claimed by Western sources),&lt;ref name="moskovskiye" /&gt; and suffered a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

In a later interview, Petrov stated that the famous red button has never worked, as military psychologists did not want to put the decision about a nuclear war into the hands of one single person.&lt;ref name="FAZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/menschen/offizier-petrow-im-gespraech-der-rote-knopf-hat-nie-funktioniert-12084911.html |title=Der rote Knopf hat nie funktioniert |work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |date=18 February 2013 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident became known publicly in the 1990s upon the publication of Votintsev's memoirs. Widespread media reports since then have increased public awareness of Petrov's actions.{{citation needed|date= June 2018}}

There is some confusion as to precisely what Petrov's military role was in this incident. Petrov, as an individual, was not in a position where he could single-handedly have launched any of the Soviet missile arsenal. His sole duty was to monitor satellite surveillance equipment and report missile attack warnings up the chain of command; top Soviet leadership would have decided whether to launch a retaliatory attack against the West. But Petrov's role was crucial in providing information to make that decision.&lt;ref name="Quotes" /&gt; According to [[Bruce G. Blair|Bruce Blair]], a Cold War nuclear strategies expert and nuclear disarmament advocate, formerly with the [[Center for Defense Information]], "The top leadership, given only a couple of minutes to decide, told that an attack had been launched, would make a decision to retaliate."&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite news |title=War Games |publisher=Burrelle's Information Services (Dateline NBC), 12 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrov later said "I had obviously never imagined that I would ever face that situation. It was the first and, as far as I know, also the last time that such a thing had happened, except for simulated practice scenarios."&lt;ref name="Quotes" /&gt;

==Later career==
In the aftermath of the incident, the Soviet government investigated the incident and determined that Petrov had insufficiently documented his actions during the crisis. He explained it as "Because I had a phone in one hand and the intercom in the other, and I don’t have a third hand"; nevertheless, Petrov received a reprimand.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 1984, Petrov left the military and got a job at the research institute that had developed the Soviet Union's early warning system. He later retired after his wife was diagnosed with cancer so he could care for her.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  A BBC report in 1998 stated Petrov had suffered a mental breakdown and quoted Petrov as saying, "I was made a scapegoat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Little|first1=Allan|title=How I Stopped Nuclear War|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/198173.stm|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=''BBC News''|date=21 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrov died on 19 May 2017 from [[hypostatic pneumonia]], though it was not widely reported until September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/18/551792129/stanislav-petrov-the-man-who-saved-the-world-dies-at-77|title=Stanislav Petrov, 'The Man Who Saved The World,' Dies At 77|publisher=NPR|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.rt.com/document/59be6fbbfc7e9399638b456a/amp/403625-nuclear-soviet-officer-died | accessdate = 17 September 2017 | title = 'I was just doing my job': Soviet officer who averted nuclear war dies at age 77 | date= 17 September 2017 | publisher = RT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanislav Petrov, who averted possible nuclear war, dies at 77|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-41314948|accessdate=19 September 2017|publisher=BBC|date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and commendations==
On 21 May 2004, the [[San Francisco]]-based Association of World Citizens gave Petrov its [[World Citizen Award]] along with a trophy and $1,000 "in recognition of the part he played in averting a catastrophe."&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightstarsound.com/ |publisher=Bright Star Sound |title=Stanislav Petrov Averts a Worldwide Nuclear War |accessdate=27 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DresdenAwardRT/&gt;

In January 2006, Petrov travelled to the United States where he was honored in a meeting at the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City]]. There the Association of World Citizens presented Petrov with a second special World Citizen Award.&lt;ref name="mosnews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2006/01/20/petrovaward.shtml |title=Russian Colonel Who Averted Nuclear War Receives World Citizen Award |work=[[Moscow News]] |date=20 January 2006 |accessdate=27 September 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Petrov met American journalist [[Walter Cronkite]] at his [[CBS]] office in New York City.

That interview, in addition to other highlights of Petrov's trip to the United States, was filmed for ''[[The Man Who Saved the World (film)|The Man Who Saved the World]]'',&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;&lt;ref name="StatementFilm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statementfilm.com/ |title=Statement Film website |publisher=Statement Film ApS}}&lt;/ref&gt; a narrative feature and documentary film, directed by Peter Anthony of Denmark. It premiered in October 2014 at the [[Woodstock Film Festival]] in Woodstock, New York, winning "Honorable Mention: Audience Award Winner for Best Narrative Feature" and "Honorable Mention: James Lyons Award for Best Editing of a Narrative Feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/2014-woodstock-film-festival-honors-darren-aronofsky-announces-audience-awards-20141021|title=2014 Woodstock Film Festival Honors Darren Aronofsky, Ann|first=Rachel|last=Bernstein|date=21 October 2014|work=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his actions in averting a potential nuclear war in 1983, Petrov was awarded the Dresden Peace Prize in [[Dresden]], Germany, on 17 February 2013. The award included €25,000.&lt;ref name=DresdenAwardRT&gt;{{cite news | title = Soviet officer who 'saved the world from WWIII' gets Dresden Peace Prize | url = https://www.rt.com/news/soviet-officer-awarded-dresden-530/ | publisher = [[RT (TV network)|RT]] | date = 18 February 2013 | access-date = 17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dresdner-friedenspreis.de/preistraeger/|title=Preisträger – Dresden-Preis (Prize winners - Dresden Prize)|website=Internationaler Friedenspreis|language=de-DE|dead-url=|access-date=28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 February 2012, he was given the 2011 German Media Award, presented to him at a ceremony in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany.&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.deutscher-medienpreis.de/deutscher-medienpreis-20011-an-yacoobi-raheb-petrow-mukwege/|title=Deutscher Medienpreis 2011 an Dr. Sakena Yacoobi, Dr. Mitri Raheb, Stanislaw Petrow &amp; Dr. Denis Mukwege|work=Deutscher Medienpreis|access-date=28 September 2018|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day that Petrov was honored at the United Nations in New York City, the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations issued a press release contending that a single person could not have started or prevented a nuclear war, stating in part, "Under no circumstances a decision to use nuclear weapons could be made or even considered in the Soviet Union or in the United States on the basis of data from a single source or a system. For this to happen, a confirmation is necessary from several systems: ground-based radars, early warning satellites, intelligence reports, etc."&lt;ref name="Russian Federation"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215000000*/http://www.un.int/russia/other/060119eprel.pdf |publisher=Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations |title=On Presentation of the World Citizens Award to Stanislav Petrov |date=19 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; But nuclear security expert [[Bruce G. Blair|Bruce Blair]] has said that at that time, the U.S.–Soviet relationship "had deteriorated to the point where the Soviet Union as a system—not just the Kremlin, not just Andropov, not just the KGB—but as a system, was geared to expect an attack and to retaliate very quickly to it. It was on hair-trigger alert. It was very nervous and prone to mistakes and accidents.... The false alarm that happened on Petrov's watch could not have come at a more dangerous, intense phase in U.S.–Soviet relations."&lt;ref name="Quotes" /&gt; At that time, according to [[Oleg Kalugin]], a former KGB chief of foreign counterintelligence, “The danger was in the Soviet leadership thinking, ‘The Americans may attack, so we better attack first.’ ”&lt;ref name="Kalugin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html#bombs9-5-03 |work=The Baltimore Sun |title=The Nuclear War that Almost Happened in 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petrov said he did not know whether he should have regarded himself as a hero for what he did that day.&lt;ref name="Quotes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightstarsound.com/world_hero/insight.html |publisher=Bright Star Sound |title=Important Insight |quote=It is nice of them to consider me a hero. I don't know that I am. Since I am the only one in this country who has found himself in this situation, it is difficult to know if others would have acted differently.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for the film ''The Man Who Saved the World'', Petrov says, "All that happened didn't matter to me—it was my job. I was simply doing my job, and I was the right person at the right time, that's all. My late wife for 10 years knew nothing about it. 'So what did you do?' she asked me. 'Nothing. I did nothing.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Quotes"/&gt;

'''Tetrahydroxyborate''' (systematically named '''tetrahydroxyboranuide''' and '''tetrahydroxidoborate(1−)''') is an [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[ion|anion]] with the [[chemical formula]] {{Chem|[B(OH)|4|]|−}} (also written as {{Chem|B(OH)|4|−}} or {{Chem|BH|4|O|4|−}}). It contributes no colour to tetrahydroxyborate salts. It is found in the mineral hexahydroborite, Ca(B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{hydrate|2}} (originally formulated CaB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;{{hydrate|6}}).&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Geology,5th edition, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0922152766}}  ed. by Julia A. Jackson, James P. Mehl, Klaus K. E. Neuendorf, American Geological Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as a [[weak base]].

== Chemical properties ==

=== Basicity ===

Tetrahydroxyborate can assimilate a proton into the anion by recombination:
{{NumBlk|:|{{big|{{Chem|B(OH)|4|−}} + {{H+}} → {{Chem|B(OH)|3}} + {{H2O}}}}|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
Because of this capture of a [[proton]] ({{Chem|H|+}}), tetrahydroxyborate has Arrhenius-basic character. Its protonation product is [[boric acid]]. In aqueous solution, most tetrahydroxyborate ions are undissociated.{{Citation needed|reason=boric acid to tetrahydroxyborate pK = 9.14 |date=March 2016}}
{{NumBlk|:|{{big|{{Chem|B(OH)|4|−}}}} {{EqmL}} {{big|{{Chem|B(OH)|3}} + {{OH-}}}}|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

=== Structure ===

It is a [[boron]] [[oxyanion|oxoanion]] with a [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] [[molecular geometry|geometry]].&lt;ref name="G&amp;E"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw|page=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[isoelectronic]] with the hypothetical compound [[orthocarbonic acid]].

=== Chemical reactions ===

Tetrahydroxyborate undergoes the typical [[chemical reaction]]s of a hydroxyborate. Upon treatment with a standard acid, it converts to [[boric acid]] and a metal salt. Oxidation of tetrahydroxyborate gives perborate. When heated to a high temperature, tetrahydroxyborate salts decompose to produce metaborate salts and water, or to produce boric acid and a metal hydroxide:
:''n''&amp;nbsp;[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → (BO&lt;small&gt;{{Su|b=2|p=−}}&lt;/small&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n''&amp;nbsp;{{H2O}}
:[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

== Production ==

Tetrahydroxyborate is produced by boric acid alkalinisation. In this process boric acid and hydroxide anions react to produce tetrahydroxyborate according to the following reaction:
:B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → [B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
This process also involves aquatrihydroxyboron as an intermediate, and occurs in two steps. No [[catalyst]] is needed for alkalinisation (step 2).
#B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{H2O}} → [B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]
#[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → [B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + {{H2O}}
Catalytic amounts of water are used for the process. By altering the process conditions, other borate anions may also be produced on the same production site.

== Uses ==

Tetrahydroxyborate can be used as a cross-link in polymers.

== Occurrence ==

The tetrahydroxyborate [[anion]] is found in Na[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | journal = [[Acta Crystallogr.

'''Trillo Nuclear Power Plant''' is a [[nuclear power station]] in [[Spain]].

It consists of one [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) of 1066&amp;nbsp;MWe. Construction of unit one began in 1979, and first criticality was on 14&amp;nbsp;May 1988.

A planned second identical unit was cancelled soon after construction began following a change of government in 1983.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

The '''Waste Framework Directive (WFD)''' is a [[European Union]] [[Regulation (European Union)|Directive]] of 17 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Directive [2008/98/EC] of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Waste Framework Directive dates back to 1975&lt;ref&gt;(Directive 75/442/EEC)&lt;/ref&gt; and was substantially amended in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;(91/156/EEC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the WFD was to lay the basis to turn the EU into a recycling society.

One of the features of the WFD is the [[European Waste Hierarchy]].

A '''woodie''' is a type of [[station wagon]] where the rear car bodywork is constructed of wood or is styled to resemble wood elements.

Originally, wood framework augmented the car's structure. Over time manufacturers supplanted wood construction with a variety of materials and methods evoking wood construction &amp;mdash; including infill metal panels, metal framework, or simulated wood-grain sheet vinyl bordered with three-dimensional, simulated framework. In 2008, wood construction was evoked abstractly on the [[Ford Flex]] with a series of side and rear horizontal grooves.&lt;ref name="flex evoke"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Driven: Ford Flex
 |quote       = Reminiscent of the infamous "woodie wagons" of the ‘50s, the Flex's aesthetic is notable for referencing a previous era without resorting to obvious retro styling cues. Woodie wagons, such as the type-defining 1953 Buick Roadmaster estate, featured wooden exterior panels towards the rear of the car. The Flex reinterprets this through four distinctive horizontal grooves set into the lower half of both front and rear door panels, and a brushed-aluminum tailgate finish.

==History==

===1930s and 40s===
As a variant of [[body-on-frame]] construction, the woodie as a utility vehicle or [[station wagon]] originated from the early practice of manufacturing the passenger compartment portion of a vehicle in hardwood. Woodies were popular in the [[United States]] and were produced as variants of sedans and convertibles as well as station wagons, from basic to luxury. They were typically manufactured as third-party conversions of regular vehicles—some by large, reputable [[coachbuilder|coachbuilding]] firms and others by local [[carpenter]]s and craftsmen for individual customers. They could be austere vehicles, with side curtains in lieu of roll-up windows (e.g., the [[1932 Ford]])&lt;ref&gt;''Street Rodder'', 7/94, p.90 caption.&lt;/ref&gt;—and sold in limited numbers (e.g., [[Ford]] sold 1654 woodie wagons).&lt;ref&gt;''Hot Rod'' Magazine, 7/90, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, bodies constructed entirely in steel supplanted wood construction—for reasons of strength, cost, safety, and durability.&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, this benefited [[furniture]] makers, who previously had been outbid for the best wood. [[Georgano, G. N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886–1930''. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 60s===

In 1950, [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] discontinued their woodie station wagon. Buick's 1953 [[Buick Estate|Super Estate]] Wagon and 1953 Roadmaster Estate Wagon were the last production American station wagons to retain real wood construction. Other marques by then were touting the advantages of "all-steel" construction to the buying public. By 1955, only [[Ford]], [[Mercury Colony Park|Mercury]], joined in 1965 by [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country (1941–1988)|Chrysler]] offered a "woodie" appearance, evoking real wood with other materials including steel, [[plastic]]s and [[DI-NOC]] (a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] product). As the appearance became popular, Ford, GM, and Chrysler offered multiple models with the woodgrain appearance until the early 1990s.

The British Motor Corporation [[British Motor Corporation|(BMC)]] offered the [[Morris Minor|Morris Minor Traveller]] (1953–71) with wood structural components and painted aluminum infill panels—the last true mass-produced woodie.  Morris' subsequent [[Mini#Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman (1961–1969)|Mini Traveller]] (1961–9) employed steel infill panels and faux wood structural members.

==Simulated woodgrain==
{{see also|Skeuomorph}}
After the demise of models using actual wood construction, manufacturers continued to evoke wood construction with sheet-vinyl appliques of simulated wood grain, sometimes augmented with three-dimensional, simulated framework, and later by a simple series of indented grooves in the bodywork.

The 1966 [[Chevrolet Caprice]] in its second season, added to the four-door hardtop [[body style]] a full line of models including a [[DI-NOC|vinyl-wood]] trimmed station wagon, the Caprice Estate. [[Dodge]] also reintroduced simulated wood the same year.

[[Ford]] marketed the [[Ford Pinto]] Squire with vinyl simulated wood trim in the early 1970s.  When Chevrolet proposed a simulated woodgrain option for the [[Chevy Vega|Chevy Vega Kammback wagon]] for the 1973 model year, after a gap of four years of applying woodgrain film on the [[Chevrolet Caprice|Caprice]], the Vega's production schedule made smooth application of the applique difficult without wrinkles and heavy scrappage &amp;mdash; requiring retraining by the film supplier, [[3M]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Little-known Vega Development stories by John Hinckley, GMAD-Lordstown Vega Launch Coordinator&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent [[Badge engineering|rebadged]] variants of the Vega (marketed as "Woody"),&lt;ref&gt;1973 Chevrolet Vega brochure Jan. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Chevrolet Vega#Vega variants|Pontiac Astre]] Safari, [[Chevrolet Monza#1975–1980|Chevrolet Monza]] Estate and [[Pontiac Sunbird]] Safari, also offered simulated wood trim. Chevrolet offered a simulated woodie version of the [[Chevrolet Chevette|Chevette]] in 1976, and [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] offered the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]] wagon with optional simulated wood trim in 1977.

Ford also marketed version of their [[Ford Ranchero|Ranchero]] model, a [[coupe utility]] produced between 1957 and 1979 with an open bed like a [[pickup truck]] but from a [[station wagon]] platform, with simulated woodgrain siding. In 1973, Ford produced a minivan prototype that offered a woodgrain appearance the preceded the Chrysler minivan, called the [[Ford Carousel]], but it was not put into production.

Introduced in 1981, the [[Ford Escort (North America)#First generation (1981–1990)|Ford Escort]] and [[Mercury Lynx]] four-door wagons offered optional simulated wood trim. [[General Motors|GM]] offered its full-size wagons in wood trim versions until their final year in 1996.  From 1982 to 1988, Chrysler used the Town &amp; Country name on a station wagon version of the K-based, front wheel drive LeBaron, featuring plastic woodgrain exterior trim with three dimensional simulated framework. As the station wagon declined in [[North America]], manufacturers offered faux wood trim on [[SUV]]s and [[minivans]] (e.g., the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]] and [[Chrysler minivans]]). Chrysler offered simulated wood as an option for the [[Chrysler PT Cruiser]], introduced in 2000—and [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] firms offered kits as well.

Japanese carmakers shied away from the appearance, although Mazda equipped the 1972-1977 [[Mazda Luce#LA2/LA3 series (1972–1977)|Mazda Luce/RX-4]] optionally, Honda briefly offered the 1980 [[Honda Civic (second generation)|Honda Civic]] station wagon, and Nissan offered the appearance on the 1983-1987 [[Nissan Cedric#Sixth generation Y30|Nissan Cedric V20E SGL]] and [[Nissan Gloria#Seventh generation Y30|Nissan Gloria V20E SGL]] top trim package station wagons to Japanese customers only.

In 2010, [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] created a woodie version of the [[Smart Fortwo]], an aftermarket firm offered a simulated wood kit for the same car,&lt;ref name="barris"&gt;{{cite news

Introduced in 2008, the [[Ford Flex]] featured a series of side and rear horizontal grooves intended to evoke a woodie look—without either wood or simulated wood. [[Car Design News]] said the styling references "a previous era without resorting to obvious retro styling cues."&lt;ref name="flex evoke"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Columbia Pictures' top-grossing film for the 1940s--director John Stahl's 1945 "Leave Her to Heaven" starring Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde--features a "woodie" station wagon early in the film. Many other American movies from the 1940s also feature woodies.

The woodie was also closely associated with [[Surf-rock]], e.g., “I bought a ’34 wagon and we call it a woodie" from the classic [[Surf City (song)|Surf City]] by [[Jan and Dean]] or the 1963 instrumental "Boogie Woodie" by [[The Beach Boys]].

In 1995, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 15 cent stamp commemorating the woodie wagon .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stamp Series |publisher=United States Postal Service |url=http://beyondtheperf.com/stamp-series |accessdate=Sep 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810160707/http://beyondtheperf.com/stamp-series |archivedate=August 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Future Council.jpg|thumb|right|300px]]
The '''World Future Council''' ('''WFC''') is an independent body formally founded in [[Hamburg, Germany]] on 10 May 2007.&lt;ref name=bolo&gt;[http://news.boloji.com/200705/05606.htm "Vandana Shiva elected to World Future Council"], Boloji.com&lt;/ref&gt; "Formed to speak on behalf of [[policy]] solutions that serve the interests of [[future generations]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/articles/121/1/ECI-Congratulates-the-World-Future-Council/Page1.html ECI Congratulates the World Future Council]&lt;/ref&gt; it includes members active in governmental bodies, civil society, business, science and the arts. The WFC's primary focus has been climate security,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6317414.html "WFC accuses industrial nations of putting brakes on climate talks"], People's Daily Online, 8 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; promoting laws such as the [[renewable energy]] [[Feed-in tariff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oekonews.at/index.php?mdoc_id=1047617 "Klimaschutzfinanzierung: IWF greift Vorschlag des World Future Council auf"], Oekonews.at, 2 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The World Future Council has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/ecosoc6613.doc.htm "Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations Recommends Status for Nine Entities, Defers 33"], un.org, 22 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annual General Meeting 2011.jpg|thumb| Annual General Meeting 2011]]

==History==
The World Future Council was founded by the Swedish writer and activist [[Jakob von Uexkull]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2483175,00.html "We are taxing the lives of future generations"] Deutsche Welle, 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea for a global council was first aired on German radio in 1998. In October 2004 the organisation began in [[London]] with funding from private donors in Germany, Switzerland, USA and the UK. Since 2006, the organisation headquarters is based in [[Hamburg]], where the World Future Council is politically independent and operates and is registered as a charitable foundation. Further offices are located in London, Geneva, Windhoek and Beijing. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/contact/&lt;/ref&gt; The Council meets once a year at the Annual General Meeting.&lt;ref name="self"&gt;http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hamburg Call to Action==
The Hamburg Call to Action was unanimously agreed upon by all Councillors present at the Founding Ceremony of the World Future Council, 9–13 May 2007.&lt;ref name=bolo/&gt; It calls for the preservation of the environment and the health of communities, the promotion of "systems and institutions based on equity and justice", safeguarding traditional indigenous tribal rights, the protection of present and future generations from war crimes and crimes against humanity, a sustainable production, trade, financial and monetary system, the revival of local democracies and economies, and a universal ban on nuclear and depleted uranium weapons, cluster ammunition and landmines. It aims to generate governmental support for renewable energy technologies, the protection of forests and oceans, secure healthy food and water supplies, environmental security, healthcare, education and shelter, and a strengthened [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="self"/&gt;

==Activities==
https://www.futurepolicy.org/
[[File:World Future Council's Future Policy Award.jpg|Future Policy Award|thumb]]
* '''Future Policy Award''' 
The Future Policy Award celebrates policies that create better living conditions for current and future generations. The aim of the award is to raise global awareness for these exemplary policies and speed up policy action towards just, sustainable and peaceful societies. The Future Policy Award is the first award that celebrates policies rather than people on an international level. Each year the World Future Council chooses one topic on which policy progress is particularly urgent. In 2009, the Future Policy Award highlighted exemplary policies for food security. In the International Year on Biodiversity, the Future Policy Award 2010 celebrated the world's best biodiversity policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/25/costa-rica-biodiversity&lt;/ref&gt; In the International Year of Forests, the Future Policy Award 2011 celebrated successful policies that protect, enhance and sustainably utilize forests for people, and thus contribute to a better world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/forest/best-forest-policies-crowned.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vov.com/videos/2011-future-policy-award-celebrating-the-worlds-best-forest-policies&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Future Policy Award celebrated the world’s most inspiring, innovative and influential policies on the protection of oceans and coasts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icriforum.org/news/2012/06/future-policy-award-celebrates-solutions-save-oceans-and-coasts&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the question was which existing disbarment policies contribute most effectively to the achievement of peace, sustainable development, and security? &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/p/2013-disarmament/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014the Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that address one of the most pervasive human rights abuses that humanitz is facing: violence against women and girls. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/p/2014-ending-violence-against-women/&lt;/ref&gt; The Future Policy Award in 2015 committed to policies that contributed to protecting and strengthening the rights of boys and girls. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/p/future-policy-award-2015//&lt;/ref&gt; In the most recent year, 2017 the Future Policy Award was dedicated to policies that effectively addressed land and soil degradation, and the related risks to food security and livelihoods, and help secure a sustainable and just future for people living in the world's drylands. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/p/future-policy-award-2015//&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Zanzibar International Children Rights Conference ''''''
From 28-30 November 2017, the WFC hosted an international child rights conference in Zanzibar to explore the positive impacts of Zanzibar's Children's Act and share success stories on child protection, children friendly justice and participation from around the world. Across three days, over 100 participants took part in a varied schedule of workshops, presentations and field visits looking at how to translate child rights laws onto paper into national and location programmes that improve the experiences of children and young people on the ground and effectively tackle child abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The conference was convened with the support of Janina Özen-Otto, the JUA Foundation, and the Michael Otto Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/sharing-best-practices-on-child-protection-zanzibar/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Global Policy Action Plan ''''''
The Global Policy Action Plan (GPACT) is a set of 22 interlinked, proven policy reforms that together, build sustainable, peaceful, and just societies and help to realise international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The "best" policies identified by the World Future Council are those that meet the seven Principles for Future-Just Law-Making. A coherent best policy guide that brings together working innovative policy solutions and forward-thinking practical tools. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/gpact/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Expert Commission on Cities and Climate Change'''
Together, the WFC and [[Hamburg]] HafenCity University, founded the international Expert  Commission on Cities and [[Climate Change]] in 2008. The commission comprises 20 experts in the field of [[regenerative city]] development including architects, city planners and representatives of [[UN Habitat]], the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. Holding direct advisory mandates for UN Habitat’s World Urban Campaign, the WFC provided the Campaign’s network with a catalogue of criteria for future just policies.{{fact|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/impact/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Implementation of Feed-in Tariff Laws'''
Feed-In Tariff (FIT) laws to speed up renewable energy production have been introduced in several countries e.g. the UK, Australia, several US states, among them California, as well as in Ontario (Canada), with the support of the World Future Council. In establishing the Alliance for Renewable Energy, the World Future Council has created a coalition to spread renewable energies and contributed to the implementation of Feed-in Tariffs in the United States.{{fact|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/world-future-council-feed-tariffs-way-global-energy-climate-crisis/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Nuclear Abolition Forum'''
With the support of the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Sergio Duarte, the World Future Council launched in 2011 the Nuclear Abolition Forum – a joint-project of 8 leading organizations in the disarmament field, hosted by the WFC. The Forum aims to examine critique and debate key nuclear disarmament issues, thereby paving the way for building the framework for achieving and sustaining a nuclear weapon-free world. To this end, it offers a website for posting articles and discussing key nuclear abolition aspects and initiatives, and a periodical which will focus on specific nuclear disarmament themes or elements.{{fact|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/nuclear-abolition-forum/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Implementing the rights of persons with disabilities'''
The World Future Council has undertaken research on exemplary laws and policies implementing the rights of persons with disabilities. Together with the Essl Foundation, the WFC gathered more than 240 decision-makers from 34 countries at the first International Conference on Good Policies for Persons with Disabilities in January 2012 in Vienna, closed with the keynote speech of Dr Christian Strohal, Vice-President of the [[UN Human Rights Council]]. The WFC and the Essl Foundation currently agreed a five-year cooperation, under the name Zero Project.{{fact|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''African Renewable Energy Alliance'''
The World Future Council founded the African Renewable Energy Alliance (AREA) in October 2009. It is a network comprising about 760 members from 70 countries (in February 2012). In order to promote renewable energies in Africa, AREA has co-organized international conferences and meetings on "Renewable Energy for Sustainable African Development" in South Africa, Ghana, Cape Verde, Nigeria and Morocco.{{fact|date=September 2013}} &lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/african-renewable-energy-alliance-celebrates-2nd-birthday/&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations'''
The WFC has embarked on a Campaign for Ombudspersons for Future Generations on all governance levels. For the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, or ‘Rio+20’ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012 the WFC was calling for the establishment of Ombudspersons for Future Generations, as a concrete solution under the second theme of the Summit ‘Institutional Framework for Sustainable Development’.&lt;ref&gt;http://peacemealproject.com/2012/06/21/the-world-future-councils-bread-tank-project/&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=September 2013}} 

* '''FuturePolicy.org'''
The internet platform https://www.futurepolicy.org/ presents political solutions and assists decision-makers in developing and implementing future just policies. It now contains policies, for example on renewable energies, energy efficiency, sustainable cities and food production in the era of climate change, that have been promoted in WFC publications, films and hearings.{{fact|date=September 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.futurepolicy.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Councillors==
The World Future Council (WFC) consists of 50 eminent global change-makers from governments, parliaments, civil societies, academia, the arts, and the business world. Together they form a voice for the rights of future generations on all five continents.

During the 1930s, American engineer [[Harold Eugene Edgerton|Harold Edgerton]] began exploring [[strobe light]] technology for [[High-speed photography|high speed photography]]. This led him to the invention of the xenon [[Flashtube|flash lamp]] in which light is generated by passing brief electric current through a tube filled with xenon gas. In 1934, Edgerton was able to generate flashes as brief as one [[microsecond]] with this method.&lt;ref name="burke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1939, American physician [[Albert R. Behnke]] Jr. began exploring the causes of "drunkenness" in deep-sea divers. He tested the effects of varying the breathing mixtures on his subjects, and discovered that this caused the divers to perceive a change in depth. From his results, he deduced that xenon gas could serve as an [[Anesthesia|anesthetic]]. Although Russian toxicologist [[Nikolay Lazarev|Nikolay V. Lazarev]] apparently studied xenon anesthesia in 1941, the first published report confirming xenon anesthesia was in 1946 by American medical researcher John H. Lawrence, who experimented on mice. Xenon was first used as a surgical anesthetic in 1951 by American anesthesiologist Stuart C. Cullen, who successfully used it with two patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form [[chemical compound|compounds]]. However, while teaching at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Neil Bartlett (chemist)|Neil Bartlett]] discovered that the gas [[platinum hexafluoride]] (PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) was a powerful [[Redox|oxidizing]] agent that could oxidize oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form [[dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate]] ({{chem|O|2|+|[PtF|6|]|-}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate (V), {{chem|O|2|+|[PtF|6|]|-}}

In November 1989, [[IBM]] scientists demonstrated a technology capable of manipulating individual [[atom]]s. The program, called [[IBM (atoms)|IBM in atoms]], used a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of [[nickel]] to spell out the three letter company initialism. It was the first time atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Malcolm W.

Solid xenon changes from [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) to [[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close packed]] (hcp) crystal phase under pressure and begins to turn metallic at about 140&amp;nbsp;GPa, with no noticeable volume change in the hcp phase. It is completely metallic at 155&amp;nbsp;GPa. When metallized, xenon appears sky blue because it absorbs red light and transmits other visible frequencies. Such behavior is unusual for a metal and is explained by the relatively small width of the electron bands in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=E.|last=Fontes

Liquid or solid xenon nanoparticles can be formed at room temperature by implanting Xe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe.

Xenon is a member of the zero-[[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] elements that are called [[noble gas|noble]] or [[inert gas]]es. It is inert to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the outer [[valence shell]] contains eight electrons.

Xenon is obtained commercially as a by-product of the [[air separation|separation of air]] into [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. After this separation, generally performed by [[fractional distillation]] in a double-column plant, the [[liquid oxygen]] produced will contain small quantities of krypton and xenon. By additional fractional distillation, the liquid oxygen may be enriched to contain 0.1–0.2% of a krypton/xenon mixture, which is extracted either by absorption onto [[silica gel]] or by distillation. Finally, the krypton/xenon mixture may be separated into [[krypton]] and xenon by further distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in [[meteorite]]s are a powerful tool for studying the [[formation of the Solar System]]. The [[Iodine–xenon dating|iodine–xenon method]] of [[Radiometric dating|dating]] gives the time elapsed between [[nucleosynthesis]] and the condensation of a solid object from the [[solar nebula]]. In 1960, physicist [[John Reynolds (physicist)|John H. Reynolds]] discovered that certain [[meteorite]]s contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a [[decay product]] of radioactive [[iodine-129]]. This isotope is produced slowly by [[cosmic ray spallation]] and [[nuclear fission]], but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the [[Solar System]], because the &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Compounds==

After Neil Bartlett's discovery in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, a large number of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the [[electronegative]] atoms fluorine or oxygen. The chemistry of xenon in each oxidation state is analogous to that of the neighboring element [[iodine]] in the immediately lower oxidation state.&lt;ref name="harding1"/&gt;

Barium perxenate, when treated with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]], yields gaseous xenon tetroxide:&lt;ref name="scott1" /&gt;

: {{chem|Ba|2|XeO|6}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|SO|4}} → 2 {{chem|BaSO|4}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} + {{chem|XeO|4}}

To prevent decomposition, the xenon tetroxide thus formed is quickly cooled to form a pale-yellow solid. It explodes above −35.9&amp;nbsp;°C into xenon and oxygen gas.

A number of xenon oxyfluorides are known, including {{chem|XeOF|2}}, [[xenon oxytetrafluoride|{{chem|XeOF|4}}]], {{chem|XeO|2|F|2}}, and {{chem|XeO|3|F|2}}. {{chem|XeOF|2}} is formed by reacting [[oxygen difluoride|{{chem|OF|2}}]] with xenon gas at low temperatures. It may also be obtained by partial hydrolysis of {{chem|XeF|4}}. It disproportionates at −20&amp;nbsp;°C into {{chem|XeF|2}} and {{chem|XeO|2|F|2}}.&lt;ref name="mackay1"&gt;{{cite book

===Clathrates and excimers===
In addition to compounds where xenon forms a [[chemical bond]], xenon can form [[clathrate]]s—substances where xenon atoms or pairs are trapped by the [[Crystal structure|crystalline lattice]] of another compound.

Xenon can also form [[endohedral fullerene]] compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a [[fullerene]] molecule. The xenon atom trapped in the fullerene can be observed by &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive [[chemical shift]] of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations are not without caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When xenon atoms are in the [[stationary state|ground energy state]], they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an [[excimer]] (excited dimer) until the electrons return to the [[ground state]]. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost [[Electron shell|electronic shell]] by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1–5&amp;nbsp;ns, and the decay releases [[photon]]s with [[wavelength]]s of about 150 and 173&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Xenon is used as a "starter gas" in [[Sodium vapor lamp|high pressure sodium lamps]]. It has the lowest [[thermal conductivity]] and lowest [[ionization potential]] of all the non-radioactive noble gases. As a noble gas, it does not interfere with the chemical reactions occurring in the operating lamp. The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the [[breakdown voltage]] of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Xenon interacts with many different receptors and ion channels, and like many theoretically multi-modal inhalation anesthetics, these interactions are likely complementary. Xenon is a high-affinity glycine-site [[NMDA receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref name=nmda&gt;{{cite journal|title=Competitive inhibition at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mediates xenon neuroprotection against hypoxia-ischemia|journal=Anesthesiology|pmid=20124979|date=2010|last1=Banks|first1=P.|last2=Franks|first2=N.

Xenon is a competitive inhibitor of the serotonin [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]. While neither anesthetic nor antinociceptive, this reduces anesthesia-emergent nausea and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The diverse actions of volatile and gaseous anesthetics on human-cloned 5-hydroxytryptamine&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; receptors expressed in ''Xenopus'' oocytes|journal=Anesthesiology|pmid=11873047|date=2002|last1=Suzuki|first1=T.|last2=Koyama|first2=H.|last3=Sugimoto|first3=M.|last4=Uchida|first4=I.|last5=Mashimo|first5=T.|volume=96|issue=3|pages=699–704|doi=10.1097/00000542-200203000-00028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenon has a [[minimum alveolar concentration]] (MAC) of 72% at age 40, making it 44% more potent than N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as an anesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nickalls |first=R. W.

====Neuroprotectant====
Xenon induces robust [[cardioprotection]] and [[neuroprotection]] through a variety of mechanisms. Through its influence on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, KATP\HIF, and NMDA antagonism, xenon is neuroprotective when administered before, during and after [[Ischemia|ischemic]] insults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Xenon Attenuates Cerebral Damage after Ischemia in Pigs|date=May 2005 | volume = 102 |issue= 5 |pages= 929–936 |doi=10.1097/00000542-200505000-00011 |pmid=15851879 |journal=Anesthesiology|last1=Schmidt |first1=Michael |last2=Marx |first2=Thomas |last3=Glöggl |first3=Egon |last4=Reinelt |first4=Helmut |last5=Schirmer |first5=Uwe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Xenon Provides Short-Term Neuroprotection in Neonatal Rats When Administered After Hypoxia-Ischemia|journal=Stroke|pmid=16373643|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000198867.31134.ac|date=2006|last1=Dingley|first1=J.|last2=Tooley|first2=J.|last3=Porter|first3=H.|last4=Thoresen|first4=M.|volume=37|issue=2|pages=501–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenon is a high affinity antagonist at the NMDA receptor glycine site.&lt;ref name=nmda /&gt; Xenon is cardioprotective in ischemia-reperfusion conditions by inducing [[Pharmacology|pharmacologic]] non-ischemic preconditioning.

====Sports doping====
Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture activates production of the [[transcription factor]] [[HIF1A|HIF-1-alpha]], which may lead to increased production of [[erythropoietin]]. The latter hormone is known to increase [[red blood cell]] production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation has been used in Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breathe it in |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21595890-obscure-gas-improves-athletes-performance-breathe-it |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2014, the [[World Anti Doping Agency]] (WADA) added xenon (and [[argon]]) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WADA amends Section S.2.1 of 2014 Prohibited List |url=https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/2014-05/wada-amends-section-s21-of-2014-prohibited-list#.VARJ3WNqOIl |date=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jelkmann | first=W. | title=Xenon Misuse in Sports  | journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift  für Sportmedizin | publisher=Deutsche Zeitschrift Fur Sportmedizin/German Journal of Sports Medicine | volume=2014 | issue=10 | year=2014 | pages=267–271 | doi=10.5960/dzsm.2014.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imaging====
[[gamma ray|Gamma]] emission from the [[radioisotope]] &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe of xenon can be used to image the heart, lungs, and brain, for example, by means of [[single photon emission computed tomography]]. &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Xe has also been used to measure [[blood flow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===NMR spectroscopy===
Because of the xenon atom's large, flexible outer electron shell, the [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] spectrum changes in response to surrounding conditions and can be used to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, xenon dissolved in water, xenon dissolved in hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Hyperpolarized xenon can be used by [[Surface science|surface chemists]]. Normally, it is difficult to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are overwhelmed by signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by [[Proton Enhanced Nuclear Induction Spectroscopy|transferring spin polarization to them]] from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.

Xenon is the preferred [[propellant]] for [[ion propulsion]] of [[spacecraft]] because it has low [[ionization potential]] per [[Atomic mass|atomic weight]] and can be stored as a liquid at near [[room temperature]] (under high pressure), yet easily evaporated to feed the engine. Xenon is inert, environmentally friendly, and less corrosive to an [[ion engine]] than other fuels such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[caesium]].

Because they are strongly [[oxidative]], many oxygen-[[xenon compounds]] are toxic; they are also explosive (highly [[Exothermic process|exothermic]]), breaking down to elemental xenon and [[Diatomic molecule|diatomic]] oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.&lt;ref name="finkel68"&gt;{{cite web

Xenon gas can be safely kept in normal sealed glass or metal containers at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{

The [[speed of sound]] in xenon gas (169&amp;nbsp;m/s) is less than that in air&lt;ref&gt;169.44&amp;nbsp;m/s in xenon (at 0°C and 107&amp;nbsp;kPa), compared to 344&amp;nbsp;m/s in air. See: {{cite journal

Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the [[vocal tract|vocal cords]] when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in [[helium]]. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas [[sulfur hexafluoride]] is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Dense gases such as xenon and sulfur hexafluoride can be breathed safely when mixed with at least 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% concentration along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and has been used for this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate at the bottom of the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
