      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5301">'''Abraham S. Luchins''' (March 8, 1914 – December 27, 2005) was one of the most important American Gestalt Psychologists and a pioneer of [[group psychotherapy]]. He was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and died in [[Albany, New York|Albany]].

== Biography ==
Luchins was a student and staff member of [[Max Wertheimer]], the main originator of [[Gestalt Psychology]]. After Max Wertheimer fled to the USA and started lecturing at the [[New School for Social Research]],  Luchins worked as his assistant and became one of his closest collaborators from 1936 till 1942. 
(In the 1970s he and his wife [[Edith Hirsch]] published a series of transcripts and reports on Wertheimer's advanced seminars and workshops.)

He is well known for his research on the role of a ''mental set'' ([[Einstellung effect]]) in the use of the various water jar refill problems.
The idea was to find out, to what extent the successful use of a problem solving strategy has a negative effect when the task cannot be solved by the previous strategy.

Other fields of research were group psychotherapy and research methods and strategies.

Luchins lectured at [[Yeshiva University]] (New York), [[McGill University]] (Montreal), the [[University of Oregon]], the [[University of Miami]].
From 1962 on he was professor of psychology at the [[University at Albany, State University of New York]] and professor emeritus from 1984.

In 1993 he became an honorary member of the international ''Society for Gestalt Theory and its Applications (GTA)'' - ''Gesellschaft für Gestalttheorie und ihre Anwendungen (GTA)''.&lt;ref&gt;see: [http://www.gestalttheory.net/cms/index.php?page=roll-of-honour GTA Roll of Honor]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1062">In 1915 before the United States' formal entry into [[World War I]], teams of surgeons and their support staff had already been deployed to France. The surgeons' service at the '''Ambulance Américaine''' in Paris and at other smaller hospital facilities in the French countryside often close to the front lines brought about the efficient integration of civilian American medicine into World War I's military structure. Under the leadership of [[George Washington Crile]] and [[Harvey Cushing]], this early American surgical presence in France during the war pioneered the organizational structure and procedural advances of modern military medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Rutkow, E.I. and I.M.

'''Capital punishment in Moldova''' has been abolished in 2005.

[[Moldova]] has not executed anyone since its independence. The death penalty was first abolished in 1995, but, until 2006, the Constitution retained it for crimes committed during war or during an inevitable threat of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/policyareas/foreign_policy/CFSP_statements/Abolition_of_the_death_penalty_in_Moldova/#.Ul8f61NedO4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019064909/http://www.eu-norway.org/eu/policyareas/foreign_policy/CFSP_statements/Abolition_of_the_death_penalty_in_Moldova/ |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Moldova is a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. It has also signed and ratified Protocol no.13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Liste complète|work=Bureau des Traités}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[partially recognized state]] of [[Transnistria]], which [[political status of Transnistria|declared its independence]] in 1990, retains the capital punishment, but has placed it under [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID%3D11376%26Language%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050451/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11376&amp;Language=en |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cementum is the part of the [[periodontium]] that attaches the teeth to the [[alveolar bone]] by anchoring the [[periodontal ligament]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Human tooth diagram-en.svg|thumb|Cementum situated around a human molar]]
The cells of cementum are the entrapped cementoblasts, the cementocytes. Each cementocyte lies in its [[Wikt:lacuna|lacuna]], similar to the pattern noted in bone. These lacunae also have canaliculi or canals. Unlike those in bone, however, these canals in cementum do not contain nerves, nor do they radiate outward. Instead, the canals are oriented toward the periodontal ligament and contain cementocytic processes that exist to diffuse nutrients from the ligament because it is vascularized.

After the apposition of cementum in layers, the cementoblasts that do not become entrapped in cementum line up along the cemental surface along the length of the outer covering of the periodontal ligament. These cementoblasts can form subsequent layers of cementum if the tooth is injured.

[[Sharpey's fibers|Sharpey fibers]] are part of the principal collagenous fibers of the [[periodontal ligament]] embedded in the cementum and [[alveolar bone]] to attach the tooth to the alveolus.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Cementoenamel junction===
{{main|Cementoenamel junction}}
The cementum joins the enamel to form the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ), which is referred to as the ''cervical line''.

Three possible types of transitional interfaces may be present at the CEJ. The traditional view was that certain interfaces dominated in certain oral cavities. The CEJ may exhibit all of these interfaces in an individual's oral cavity, and there is even considerable variation when one tooth is traced circumferentially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Dentinocemental junction===
When the cementoid reaches the full thickness needed, the cementoid surrounding the cementocytes becomes mineralized, or matured, and is then considered cementum. Because of the apposition of cementum over the dentin, the dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is formed. This interface is not as defined, either clinically or histologically, as that of the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), given that cementum and dentin are of common embryological background, unlike that of enamel and dentin.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is a relatively smooth area in the permanent tooth, and attachment of cementum to the dentin is firm but not understood completely.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Dieter D. Bosshardt, Knut A. Selvig|title= Dental cementum: the dynamic tissue covering of the root|journal=Periodontol 2000|year= 1997|volume=13|pages=41–75|url=http://www.fodonto.uncu.edu.ar/upload/41-75.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0757.1997.tb00095.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
Two kinds of cementum are formed: acellular and cellular, and fibers can be intrinsic or extrinsic, resulting in four possible permutations; the first cementum to be formed during tooth development is acellular extrinsic fiber cementum.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AAP 2010 In-Service Examination, question A-9&lt;/ref&gt; The acellular layer of cementum is living tissue that does not incorporate cells into its structure and usually predominates on the coronal half of the root; cellular cementum occurs more frequently on the apical half.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Composition===
Cementum is slightly softer than [[dentin]] and consists of about 45% to 50% inorganic material ([[hydroxylapatite]]) by weight and 50% to 55% [[organic matter]] and water by weight.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy of Periodontology 2010 In-Service Exam, question A-38&lt;/ref&gt; The organic portion is composed primarily of [[collagen]] and [[proteoglycans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kumar|first1=G.|title=Orban's Oral Histology &amp; Embryology|date=15 Jul 2011|publisher=Elsevier India|isbn=9788131228197|page=152|edition=13th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=061EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=what+is+protein+polysaccharides+in+cementum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DnZFSRcP3s&amp;sig=b_ahEFEiN4183HtUGrmLunAtVWg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SKh8VJecPIKRoQTm9YD4Cg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20is%20protein%20polysaccharides%20in%20cementum&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cementum is avascular, receiving its nutrition through its own imbedded cells from the surrounding vascular [[periodontal ligament]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The cementum is light yellow and slightly lighter in color than [[dentin]]. It has the highest fluoride content of all mineralized tissue. Cementum also is permeable to a variety of materials. It is formed continuously throughout life because a new layer of cementum is deposited to keep the attachment intact as the superficial layer of cementum ages. Cementum on the root ends surrounds the apical foramen and may extend slightly onto the inner wall of the pulp canal.

===Development===
{{main|Cementogenesis}}
Cementum is secreted by cells called [[cementoblasts]] within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. These cementoblasts develop from undifferentiated [[mesenchymal cell]]s in the connective tissue of the [[dental follicle]] or sac.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Unlike [[ameloblast]]s and [[odontoblast]]s, which leave no cellular bodies in their secreted products, during the later steps within the stage of [[wiktionary:apposition|apposition]], many of the cementoblasts become entrapped by the cementum they produce, becoming cementocytes. Thus again, cementum is more similar to alveolar bone, with its osteoblasts becoming entrapped [[osteocyte]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Cementum is capable of repairing itself to a limited degree, but not regenerate. and is not resorbed under normal conditions.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ten Cate's Oral Histology|author=Nanci A|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013| pages=205–207|isbn=978-0-323-07846-7|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
* Some [[root resorption]] of the apical portion of the root may occur, however, if orthodontic pressures are excessive and movement is too fast. Some experts also agree on a third type of cementum, ''afibrillar cementum'', which sometimes extends onto the enamel of the tooth. 
* The excessive buildup of cementum on the roots of a tooth is a pathological condition known as [[hypercementosis]]. Cementum thickness can increase on the root end to compensate for attritional wear of the occlusal/incisal surface and passive eruption of the tooth.&lt;ref name="dental.pitt.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author= Max A. Listgarten|publisher= University of Pennsylvania and Temple University|url=http://www.dental.pitt.edu/informatics/periohistology/en/gu0509.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709013900/http://www.dental.pitt.edu/informatics/periohistology/en/gu0509.htm|archivedate=9 July 2013|title=Histology of the Periodontum - Developmental Anomalies}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* When cementum is exposed through gingival recession, it quickly undergoes abrasion by mechanical friction because of its low mineral content and thinness. The exposure of the deeper dentin can lead to problems such as extrinsic staining and dentinal hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 
* The incidence of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival decline occurs from either trauma or periodontal illness. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root's cementum and then dentin to cause a chronic infection of the pulp. Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative obstacles and increased tooth loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
* [[Cementicle]]s are small, spherical or ovoid [[Calcification|calcified]] masses embedded within or attached to the cementum layer on the root surface of a tooth, or lying free within the [[periodontal ligament]].&lt;ref name="Chiego2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chiego Jr. DJ|title=Essentials of Oral Histology and Embryology: A Clinical Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LMrsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|date=14 April 2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-29100-2|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bath-Balogh2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bath-Balogh M|author2=Fehrenbach MJ|title=Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPMLBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174|date=10 December 2010|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-1-4377-2934-4|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cemental spurs can be found at or near the CEJ. These are symmetrical spheres of cementum attached to the cemental root surface, similar to enamel pearls. Cemental spurs result from irregular deposition of cementum on the root. They can present some clinical problems in differentiation from calculus and may be noted on radiographs; yet, because they are hard dental tissue, they are not easily removed, and thus may also interfere with periodontal treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===DNA studies===
A 2010 archeological study has found that cementum has five times the amount of [[mitochondrial DNA]] compared to [[dentine|dentin]], which is commonly sampled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adler|first=C.J.|author2=Haak, W.|author3=Donlon, D.|author4=Cooper, A.|title=Survival and recovery of DNA from ancient teeth and bones|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|year=2010|volume=38|issue=5|pages=956–964|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teeth are increasingly utilized as a source of nuclear DNA to aid identification of human remains. DNA extraction and the results of genetic analysis from the tissue are extremely variable and to some extent unpredictable. However, the quantity of DNA available in dentin is affected by age and dental disease, whereas that in cementum is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Denice Higginsa, John Kaidonisa, Jeremy Austinb, Grant Townsenda, Helen Jamesa &amp; Toby Hughes|title=Dentine and cementum as sources of nuclear DNA for use in human identification|journal=Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences|volume=43|issue=4|year=2011|doi=10.1080/00450618.2011.583278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dushantsi Dam 4.jpg|thumb|right|Dushantsi Reservoir]]

The '''Dushantsi''' [[reservoir]] ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian:]] Душанци язовир) is settled in the [[Balkan Mountains]], [[Bulgaria]].

The dam wall can be easily reached by car, driving along the old road to [[Burgas]]. The area around the reservoir is used for outgoings, picnics, water sports and fishing.

The [[Topolnitsa River]] feeds the reservoir, and is another suitable place for fishing.

Two recent studies showed that 26 % (24/94) and 25.3 % (38/150) of a series of patients with unexplained GI symptoms had SIFO. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas.

Typical microbial colonies found on or in the body are normally benign or [[probiotic|beneficial]].

When this balance is disturbed, these colonies exhibit a decreased ability to check each other's growth, which can then lead to overgrowth of one or more of the disturbed colonies which may further damage some of the other smaller beneficial ones in a [[vicious cycle]]. As more beneficial colonies are damaged, making the imbalance more pronounced, more overgrowth issues occur because the damaged colonies are less able to check the growth of the overgrowing ones.  If this goes unchecked long enough, a pervasive and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] imbalance between colonies will set in, which ultimately minimizes the beneficial nature of these colonies as a whole.

Microbial colonies also excrete many different types of waste byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carding S, Verbeke K, Vipond DT, Corfe BM, Owen LJ | title = Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in disease | journal = Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease | volume = 26 | pages = 26191 | date = 2015-02-02 | pmid = 25651997 | pmc = 4315779 | doi = 10.3402/mehd.v26.26191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using different waste removal mechanisms, under normal circumstances the body effectively manages these byproducts with little or no trouble. Unfortunately, oversized and inappropriately large colonies, due to their increased numbers, excrete increased amounts of these byproducts. As the amount of microbial byproducts increases, the higher waste byproducts levels can overburden the body's waste removal mechanisms.

It is the combination of these two negative outcomes that causes many of the negative health symptoms observed when dysbiosis is present.

== Associated Illnesses ==
Disruptions in the microbiome can allow outside factors or even pathogenic members of the microbiome to take hold in the gut environment.

=== Cancer ===
Sustained periods of dysbiosis lead to extended amounts of stress and inflammation in the gut microbiome, which can in turn promote the production of carcinogenic metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheflin AM, Whitney AK, Weir TL | title = Cancer-promoting effects of microbial dysbiosis | journal = Current Oncology Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 406 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25123079 | pmc = 4180221 | doi = 10.1007/s11912-014-0406-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodontitis is an oral infection that can damage the bones supporting teeth and lead to tooth loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/periodontitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354473|title=Periodontitis - Symptoms and causes|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major risk factors for periodontitis is the disruption of the oral microbiome such that there is an accumulation of pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name="Nath 2013 543–545"/&gt;

== Treatments ==

=== Antibiotics ===
Because of the complex interactions in the microbiome, not much data exists on the efficacy of using antibiotics to treat dysbiosis. However, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that has low impact on the intestinal gut microbiome called rifixin, has been shown to be effective in improving several of the ailments associated with dysbiosis, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharara AI, Aoun E, Abdul-Baki H, Mounzer R, Sidani S, Elhajj I | title = A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of rifaximin in patients with abdominal bloating and flatulence | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 326–33 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16454838 | doi = 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00458.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulcerative Coilitis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guslandi M, Petrone MC, Testoni PA | title = Rifaximin for active ulcerative colitis | journal = Inflammatory Bowel Diseases | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 335 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16633057 | doi = 10.1097/01.MIB.0000215092.85116.6c | url = https://academic.oup.com/ibdjournal/article-abstract/12/4/335/4682699?redirectedFrom=fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crohn's Disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shafran I, Johnson LK | title = An open-label evaluation of rifaximin in the treatment of active Crohn's disease | journal = Current Medical Research and Opinion | volume = 21 | issue = 8 | pages = 1165–9 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16083525 | doi = 10.1185/030079905X53252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) ===
FMTs use the same line of reasoning as probiotics; to recreate a healthy balance of microbiota in the microbiome by inserting beneficial microbes into the environment. FMT accomplishes this by taking a donation of fecal matter from a healthy individual, diluted, strained and introduced to a diseased patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thefecaltransplantfoundation.org/what-is-fecal-transplant/ | title=What is FMT? – The Fecal Transplant Foundation|website=thefecaltransplantfoundation.org |access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMTs are currently used to treat patients with Clostridium Difficile infections, who have proved resistant to other therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith MB, Kelly C, Alm EJ | title = Policy: How to regulate faecal transplants | journal = Nature | volume = 506 | issue = 7488 | pages = 290–1 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24558658 | doi = 10.1038/506290a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the process is not sterile and contaminations can pass from donor to patient, there is a push to isolate key microbiota and culture them independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupont HL | title = Diagnosis and management of Clostridium difficile infection | language = English | journal = Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 1216–23; quiz e73 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23542332 | doi = 10.1016/j.cgh.2013.03.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probiotics ===
The World Health Organization defines probiotics as "live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host."&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; World Health Organization. Health and Nutritional Properties of Probiotics in Food Including Powder Milk with Live Lactic Acid Bacteria.Córdoba, Argentina: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization; 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of using probiotics to treat dysbiosis related diseases lies in its ability to treat the underlying cause of said diseases. Some benefits include their ability to suppress inflammation in the microbiome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drakes M, Blanchard T, Czinn S | title = Bacterial probiotic modulation of dendritic cells | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 72 | issue = 6 | pages = 3299–309 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15155633 | pmc = 415669 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.72.6.3299-3309.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim SO, Sheikh HI, Ha SD, Martins A, Reid G | title = G-CSF-mediated inhibition of JNK is a key mechanism for Lactobacillus rhamnosus-induced suppression of TNF production in macrophages | journal = Cellular Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 1958–71 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16889627 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2006.00763.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and disrupt colonization by pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kendall MM, Sperandio V | title = Quorum sensing by enteric pathogens | journal = Current Opinion in Gastroenterology | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–5 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17133078 | doi = 10.1097/MOG.0b013e3280118289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3882">{{distinguish|Ferguson effect}}
The '''Ferguson reflex''' (also called the foetal ejection reflex) is the neuroendocrine reflex comprising the self-sustaining cycle of uterine contractions initiated by pressure at the [[cervix]] or [[vagina|vaginal walls]]. It is an example of [[positive feedback]] in biology. The Ferguson reflex occurs in mammals.

== Mechanism ==
Upon application of pressure to the internal end of the cervix, [[oxytocin]] is released(therefore increase in contractile proteins), which stimulates uterine contractions, which in turn increases pressure on the cervix (thereby increasing oxytocin release, etc.), until the baby is delivered.

Sensory information regarding mechanical stretch of the cervix is carried in a sensory neuron, which synapses in the dorsal horn before ascending to the brain in the anterolateral columns (ipsilateral and contralateral routes). Via the median forebrain bundle, the efferent reaches the [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|PVN]] and [[Supraoptic nucleus|SON]] of the hypothalamus. The posterior pituitary releases oxytocin due to increased firing in the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypothalamo-hypophyseal tract]]. Oxytocin acts on the [[myometrium]], on receptors which have been upregulated by a functional increase of the estrogen-progesterone ratio. This functional ratio change is mediated by a decrease in myometrial sensitivity to progesterone, due to an increase in [[progesterone receptor|progesterone receptor A]], and a concurrent increase in myometrial sensitivity to estrogen, due to an increase in [[estrogen receptor alpha|estrogen receptor α]]. This causes myometrial contraction and further positive feedback on the reflex.&lt;ref&gt;Martin H. Johnson, Essential Reproduction 6th edition (2007). Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
It was originally studied among anesthetized rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, J.K.W. A study of the motility of the intact uterus at term. Surg Gynecol Obstet 1941. 73: 359-66&lt;/ref&gt; Studies among ewes demonstrated that it is blocked by epidural anesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Flint AP, Forsling ML, Mitchell MD. Blockade of the Ferguson reflex by lumbar epidural anaesthesia in the parturient sheep: effects on oxytocin secretion and uterine venous prostaglandin F levels. Horm Metab Res. 1978 Nov;10(6):545-7&lt;/ref&gt; In their studies among mice, Niles Newton and colleagues demonstrated the importance of cortical influences.&lt;ref&gt;Newton N, Foshee D, Newton M. Experimental inhibition of labor through environmental disturbance. Obstetrics and Gynecology 1967; 371-377&lt;/ref&gt; They enlarged to topic by introducing the term ''fetus ejection reflex''.

The concept of cortical influences provided reasons to raise questions about the process of parturition among humans, characterized by a high encephalization quotient. Odent had observed that, in situations that are exceptionally rare, women can occasionally experience such a reflex, characterized by a birth after a short series of irresistible and powerful contractions without any room for voluntary movements. For such a hormonal cascade to occur, requires sufficient psychological safety, as occurs in normal or [https://sarahbuckley.com undisturbed birth].  The higher the intervention rate, such as induction or caesarian section, the lower the likelihood of the Ferguson Reflex occurring.  In contrast, the lower the incidence of intervention, such as is found in those [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/277741/Place-of-birth-in-Europe.pdf?ua=1 countries with high rate of home births,]and birth centres worldwide, the higher the likelihood of the Ferguson Reflex occurring.  This may explain the lack of research, considering the public health benefits of such education to both hospitals and the general public.

==Role==
Usually privately owned and commercially operated businesses, the funeral directors to the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] do not have more than an occasional role, although they will be called upon if a death occurs in the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] to assist in arranging the funeral arrangements. 

The same companies are normally used to assist during [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state or ceremonial funerals]] of eminent people outside the Royal Family, for example [[Sir Winston Churchill]] or [[Margaret Thatcher]].

Although comparable in their role and function to [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant holders]], the funeral directors serving the Royal Household do traditionally not advertise the fact that they work for the Royal Family.

==History==
It is not known when the [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|Royal Household]] of the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] of the [[United Kingdom]] began to employ privately owned and commercially operated [[funeral directors]]' companies. In the early 19th century, the royal undertakers were the family business of [[William Banting]] of St. James’s Street, London. The Banting family conducted the funerals of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] in 1820, [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] in 1830, the [[Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]] in 1834, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in 1852, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1861, [[Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Leopold]] in 1884, [[Queen Victoria]] in 1901, and [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westport Banting.&lt;ref name=ToddVanBeck&gt;Todd Van Beck, "The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill", part II, in ''Canadian Funeral News'' (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10  ([http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316212850/http://www.otcommunications.com/images/issue/oct12cfn.pdf |date=2014-03-16 }})&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Banting family had ceased to operate as royal funeral directors in 1928, several society undertaking firms lobbied for the warrant. It was finally awarded to the socially and politically well-connected Sir Harold Vaughan Kenyon, who also served six terms as Mayor of Paddington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Brian |title=JH Kenyon: A Short History |publisher=Brian Parsons | year=2014 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His company had been established in 1880 by his father, James Harold Kenyon (1841-91) and was incorporated under the name of ''J. H. Kenyon Ltd'' in 1899. It was this company which oversaw the funerals of [[George VI|King George VI]] in 1952, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1953, and [[Sir Winston Churchill]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=christopherhenley&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://christopherhenleylimited.com/inmemoriam.htm|title=In memoriam Desmond C.

In 1991, the royal undertaking warrant passed to ''Leverton &amp; Sons'', a 200-year-old family firm of funeral directors.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1570141/Queens-undertakers-have-first-call-coffin.html|title= Queen's undertakers have 'first call coffin'|work= Felix Lowe and agencies |publisher= www.telegraph.co.uk, 22 Nov 2007|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leverton &amp; Sons was established in St Pancras in 1763 by Devonshire carpenter John Leverton.

The company also organised the funerals of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] in 2002, [[Princess Margaret]] in 2002 and [[Baroness Thatcher]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=Thatcher&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/10005860/After-Lady-Thatchers-funeral-I-toasted-her-at-home-with-a-single-malt.html|title= 'After Lady Thatcher's funeral, I toasted her at home with a single malt’|work= Joe Shute |publisher= www.telegraph.co.uk, 22 Nov 2007|accessdate=19 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New South Wales '''Health Care Complaints Commission''' (commonly referred to as the {{'}}'''HCCC'''{{'}}), is an independent [[Statutory authority|statutory body]] created by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], [[Australia]] to receive, assess, resolve or prosecute complaints relating to [[Health professional|health service providers]] in New South Wales.&lt;ref name="NSWLegislature"&gt;''Health Care Complaints Act'' (NSW) 1993, s3, current version for 4 July 2014 to date (accessed 13 January 2015 at 12:32): http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/maintop/view/inforce/act+105+1993+cd+0+N&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The Health Care Complaints Commission's purpose is stated in the [http://legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/1993/105 ''Health Care Complaints Act 1993 ''(NSW)] which establishes it as "protection of the health and safety of the public must be the paramount consideration".&lt;ref name="NSWLegislature"/&gt;

The Commission receives consistent media attention for its actions. Recent attention includes criticism of its performance with a major [[Sydney]] newspaper, the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald|Sydney Morning Herald]], ''reporting that new "statistics expos[ed] a dramatic decline in investigations despite complaints from the public being at an all-time high."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/health-care-complaints-commission-in-crisis-20140619-zsem0.html|title = Health Care Complaints Commission in Crisis|date = 20 June 2014|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald|last = Duff|first = Eamon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Health Care Complaints Commission was formed in 1994 after the [[Chelmsford Royal Commission]] which investigated the 'deep sleep therapy' performed at the Chelmsford Hospital in Sydney.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A '''health record trust''' (also '''independent health record trust''' or '''health record data bank''') provides a secure and protected place for individuals to create, use, and maintain their lifetime [[electronic health record]] (EHR). The health record trust takes [[personal health record]]s one step further by combining an individual's electronic health record with the personal health record.  A health record trust protects patient privacy by establishing that the patient is the owner of his or her health care records. It gives patients authority to access and review the entire record at any time as well as the authority to allow health care professionals, facilities, and organizations to view all of the records or a limited portion of the records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kendall |first=David B. |title=Protecting patient privacy through health record trust|journal=Health Affairs|date=March 2009 |volume=28 |issue= |pages=444-446 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.444 |pmid=19276001 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/2/444.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently{{When|date=April 2014}} a record is left at each facility a patient seeks care. The health record trust allows for all of the information to be in one central document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.healthbanking.org/|work=Health Record Banks|publisher=Health Record Banking Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients cannot alter their health records but instead add notes and request corrections. They can also view every provider who downloads their EHR.

== Public policy ==
Legislation was introduced in the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]] to establish a regulatory framework for the establishment of health record trusts. The Independent Health Record Trust Act of 2007 (H.R. 2991) was introduced by Rep. [[Dennis Moore (politician)|Dennis Moore]] (D-KS) and Rep. [[Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) on July 11, 2007. The legislation seeks to give people control over their lifetime health records, with the broader goal of reducing [[health care costs]] that result from inefficiency, medical errors, inappropriate care, and incomplete information. This legislation provides standards for the use of health record trusts, including certifications and interoperability of independent health record trusts. HR 2991 was referred to the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[House Committee on Ways and Means]]. The bill died in committee and has not been reintroduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of H.R. 2991|url=https://govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr2991|work=GovTrack}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the availability of a longitudinal health record protected by a health record trust, patients receive better quality of care and are able to pass along their medical records to future generations. Health record trusts promote wellness and improve patient care through quick and easy access to critical health information.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Implementations ==
[[Arizona]]'s eHealthTrust health record bank launched in 2010 with a [[freemium]] pricing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Enrado |first=Patty |date=16 November 2010 |title=First large-scale health record bank goes live in Arizona |website=Healthcare IT News |publisher=HIMSS Media |url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/first-large-scale-health-record-bank-goes-live-arizona }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Harvard University]]'s [[Data Privacy Lab]] launched MyDataCan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yasnoff |first=William |date=20 April 2012 |title=Why Harvard's Health Record Bank could be a turning point |website=Healthcare IT News |publisher=HIMSS Media |url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/why-harvards-health-record-bank-could-be-turning-point }}&lt;/ref&gt; offering free data storage and distribution with optional integration for third-party app, both free and paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |website=MyDataCan |publisher=Harvard University |url=https://mydatacan.org/about.html |access-date=9 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthcare in Sierra'''  is generally charged for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Sierra Leone  | publisher = The Kambia Appeal  | url = http://www.kambia.org.uk/information_about/sierra_leone.htm  | accessdate = 2008-01-24  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20110511054708/http://www.kambia.org.uk/information_about/sierra_leone.htm  | archivedate = 2011-05-11  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is provided by a mixture of government, private and non-governmental organizations ([[NGOs]]).  There are over 100 [[NGOs]] operating in the health care sector in Sierra Leone.   The [[Ministry of Health and Sanitation]] is responsible for organizing health care and after the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] the ministry changed to a decentralized structure of health provision to try to increase its coverage.&lt;ref name=PHChand&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Primary Health Care Hand Book Policing  | publisher = Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation  | date = 2007-05-25  | url = http://www.health.sl/drwebsite/publish/healthcare.shtml  | format = doc  | accessdate = 2008-01-24  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217052144/http://www.health.sl/drwebsite/publish/healthcare.shtml  | archivedate = 2008-02-17  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
Sierra Leone is divided into 13 health districts that correspond to the [[districts of Sierra Leone]] except for the Western Area Rural and Western Area Urban districts which are combined into the Western Area Health district.  Each district has a health management team and an average of 50 peripheral health units (PHU) and over 100 technical staff.  The management team is responsible for planning, organizing and monitoring health provision, training personnel, working with communities and supplying equipment and drugs.&lt;ref name=PHChand&gt;{{cite web  | title = The Primary Health Care Hand Book Policing  | publisher = Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation  | date = 2007-05-25  | url = http://www.health.sl/drwebsite/publish/healthcare.shtml  | format = doc  | accessdate = 2008-01-24  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217052144/http://www.health.sl/drwebsite/publish/healthcare.shtml  | archivedate = 2008-02-17  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PHUs are designed to be the delivery point for [[primary health care]] in the country and there are three main types.

* The community health centre carries out health prevention measures, cures and health promotion activities and is in charge of overseeing the other PHUs in the area.  It is planned that each chiefdom, the unit of local government in Sierra Leone below the level of district, should have at least one community health centre.&lt;ref name=PHChand/&gt;
* Community health posts perform a similar function to community health centres but have fewer facilities and are used to refer patients to the health centre or the district [[hospital]].&lt;ref name=PHChand/&gt;
* Maternal and Child Health posts are the first level of contact on the ground and are located in smaller towns of with populations between 500-2000.  Much of the health care infrastructure was decimated during the Civil War and the health service is still in the process of being organised with hospitals and PHU being rebuilt or created and staff being trained.&lt;ref name=PHChand/&gt;

==Free healthcare scheme==
In April 2010 Sierra Leone launched "Free Health Care Medical Insurance", a system of free healthcare for pregnant and breast-feeding women and children under five.&lt;ref name="sierra"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/7548 |title=April 27, 2010 Sierra Leone’s Independence and Semi-Health Care Reform Day |date=24 April 2010 |publisher=Sierra Express Media |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004091114/http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/7548 |archivedate=October 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8645968.stm|title= Sierra Leone starts free care for mothers and children|date=27 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A UN population Fund representative said that medical equipment had been ordered and some drugs distributed as part of the new healthcare scheme but the coverage was not yet 100%.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  The initial set up cost of the scheme was $19 million and it is expected to save the lives of more than a million mothers and children.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

Healthcare workers had gone on strike over the plans in March 2010 arguing that free healthcare would increase their workload and working hours, the government settled the dispute with pay rises of 200-500%.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  Observers argue that many of the women concerned do not even know they have a right for free medical care and that the law would remain a paper tiger if more earnings from the extractive sector was not invested in the countries healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wealth, but no health |author=Anne Jung |publisher=D+C Development and Cooperation/ dandc.eu |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/sierra-leones-health-services-do-not-deliver-official-promises}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme is funded mainly by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United Nations]] who have paid to refurbish hospitals, supply drugs and pay healthcare professionals' wages.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;  The UK alone has agreed to pay for a years worth of drugs for the program and the [[World Health Organization]] has provided [[blood bank]]s in each major town.&lt;ref name="BBC 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8643965.stm|title= Sierra Leone gives new hope to mothers and children|date=27 April 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British government's funding came from the [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) and amounted to $22.6 million to fund the scheme for the next three years from a total allocation of  $70.5 million for the 10-year-long "Reproduction and Child Health Care" plan.&lt;ref name="Global Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/africa/100426/sierra-leone-boosts-infant-health-care|title=Sierra Leone boosts infant health care|last=Johnson|first=Kimberley S.|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Global Post|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] also received $7 million from DFID to provide medicines for pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Global Post"/&gt;

===Traditional medicine===
[[Traditional medicine]] forms part of the primary health care system in  Sierra Leone.  The traditional medicine programme, run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, has constructed a training school at [[Makeni]], a healing centre at [[Kono District|Kono]] and conducted [[workshops]] to promote co-operation between traditional medicine practitioners and orthodox medical workers.  Members of the programme have also located and collected plants from throughout Sierra Leone used for medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Mission, Objective, Achievements and Aims of the Traditional Medicine Programme  | publisher = Ministry of Health &amp; Sanitation  | date = 2006-08-11  | url = http://www.health.sl/drwebsite/publish/page_69.shtml  | accessdate = 2008-01-24  }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indian Genetic Disease Database''' ('''IGDD''') is the first patient based "[[genetic disease]]" [[database]] of India. It is being developed and maintained at  [[Indian Institute of Chemical Biology]] (IICB) a unit of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]].

The first version of the database has been published online. It has been divided into 19 disease categories in the 1st version of the database. It includes: Blood Related Disorders, Bone and Joints Related Growth Disorders, Eye Disorders, Gastro-Intestinal Disorders, Hearing Disorders, Lysosomal Disorders, Multi-system Disorders, Muscle Related Disorders, Neurological Disorders, Pigmentary Disorders, and Skin Related Disorders.

India is a country with many communities where there is high load of genetic disorders. It is due to [[consanguineous]] marriage or marriages between close relatives practiced in the community. This database keeps track of mutations in the causal genes for that genetic diseases common in India. The database will be helpful to the Physicians, Geneticists and other professionals in India and abroad related to genetic disorders to retrieve and use the information for the benefit of mankind.

==Features==

The database had been launched and updated in August 2010. From this database, one can obtain patient-based data with respect to the patient's Geographical location, Age, Sex, and Ethnic Group. One can also compare the occurrence of that disease with other parts of the world through this database. The mode of inheritance of a particular disease is also known from this database. One can also get an overall picture of a particular disease occurrence in India and all its details from this database.

Each disease is represented with [[Gene (name)|Gene name]], [[Chromosome|Chromosome location]], [[Mutations]], [[Geospatial]] distribution for the disease.

In the 1st version of the database, there had been 52 diseases with information on 5,760 individuals in the database.&lt;ref name="pmid21037256"/&gt; Now there are information about 109 genetic diseases.

==Achievements==
The Publication has been selected as featured Article in Nucleic Acid research peer reviewed international journal( NAR ) in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32955">'''Institutional abuse''' is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) from a system of [[Power (social and political)|power]].&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L. |author2=A. Mooney |author3=M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based child abuse, such as neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and hunger, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior. Institutional abuse occurs within emergency care facilities such as foster homes, group homes, kinship care homes, and pre-adoptive homes. Children, who are placed in this type of out of home care, are typically in the custody of the state. The maltreatment is usually caused by an employee of the facility. Out of home placement care is meant to be temporary; however, it can be permanent (Colorado Department of Human Services){{Citation needed|reason=Author assumes that we all know what is being talked about the parenthetical example. I do not, and I can not find a reference to what is being stated.|date=April 2017}}. Many solutions are underway in preventing and protecting institutionally abused children (Denvergov.org).

==Background==
Institutional abuse can typically occur in a [[care home]], [[nursing home]], acute hospital or in-patient setting and can be any of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Institutional+abuse?opendocument |title=Institutional abuse |publisher=Surreycc.gov.uk |date=2007-01-18 |accessdate=2010-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[discrimination|discriminatory abuse]]
* [[#Financial abuse|financial abuse]]
* [[neglect]]
* [[physical abuse]]
* [[emotional abuse|psychological and emotional abuse]]
* [[sexual abuse]]
* [[verbal abuse]]
}}Typical of the institutionalized bigotry that coincides with abuse, it is said that it can be considered to mainly apply to four categories of people:&lt;ref&gt;Manthorpe J, Penhale B, Stanley N ''Institutional Abuse: Perspectives Across the Life Course'' (1999){{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* children - see also [[child abuse]]
* adults with [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]]
* adults with mental health problems
* older people - see also [[elder abuse]].
This perspective often written into educational material seeks to excuse perpetrators with the "explanation" that the abused adults are all somehow mentally inept. This encourages the trend.

Institutional abuse can be divided into three categories:&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; 
* '''overt abuse''' - similar to familial abuse in its overt physical, sexual, or emotional abuse by a foster parent or child care worker
* '''program abuse''' - unique to an institutional situation, in which a program must operate below acceptable conditions or improperly use power to modify the behavior of person
* '''system abuse''' - involves an entire care system that is stretched beyond capacity, and causes maltreatment through inadequate resources.

These issues range from personal abuses to situational maltreatment, and differ greatly in their causes. Most institutional abuses are the result of difficult and stressful working environments, where those with the least training often have the most contact with the participants, and have the hardest schedules, least payment, and most undesirable working conditions.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; The high-stress working environments of care workers combined with low-quality hiring and screening practices of workers can create abusive situations through lack of experience or knowledge on the worker's part.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; Lack of proper training for workers can conflict or hurt institutional goals for patients through improper implementation of treatments, compounded by organizational structure that only has doctors and psychologists on site for short hours.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; In overstressed situations, power over the patients can bring feelings of control and significance, leading to stress being a predictor of abuse in institutional and familial settings.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; isolation from the community can have similar effects.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

Often complicating worker issues is lack of organizational goals or policy. In childcare situations, lack of curricular recreation for children can lead to more acting out behavior, causing more stress for workers, and more inclination toward mistreatment.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt; Patients can often be difficult to manage through inability or behavioral issues, and those who are more difficult for staff to work with are often the victims of abusive situations. It is proposed that most abuse rises of out frustration and lack of ability to properly control the patient, not intentional maltreatment.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

There is a lack of state legislation defining or prosecuting institutional abuse, leading to difficulty in investigation or dealing with abusive situations.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Historical perspective ==
Institutional abuse is also present in situations outside those of child and elder care. The [[Nuremberg Code]] was developed during the [[Nuremberg Trials]] to create a universal ethical code for the treatment of humans from an institutional standpoint.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lopez-Munoz|first=F.|author2=C. Alamo |author3=M. Dudley |author4=G. Rubio |author5=P. García-García |author6=J. D. Molina |author7=A. Okasha |title=Psychiatry and political–institutional abuse from the historical perspective: The ethical lessons of the Nuremberg Trial on their 60th anniversary|journal=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=31|pages=791–806 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.12.007 |pmid=17223241 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this Code is not formally adopted by any organization, its standard for human rights has been used as a guide for more specific ethical codes.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; However, history has still shown the abuse of the vulnerable members of society through medical and psychiatric institutions.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; Under the Nazi regime of the early 1940s, this abuse took the form of sterilization of those purported to be "mentally ill", and general medical experimentation without consent or will to leave, and eugenics.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; The political nature of these policies lead to them being enforced by law under an ideology of purifying race of genetic deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; Eugenics and sterilization campaigns have also been run outside of political dictatorship, including a number of states in the United States, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; But it is the shift from sterilization to euthanasia of the mentally ill or other politically undesirable groups in Nazi Germany that lead to the actions of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; Japanese soldiers of the time also would use these groups as research subjects for infectious diseases and poisons, while Stalin's regime in Russia used the guise of mental illness to torture and punish political dissidents.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt;

The Army and CIA of the United States also have histories of testing psychiatric drugs on unwilling patients or soldiers. LSD was tested by using prostitutes to trick men into taking the drug, and various combinations of depressants, hallucinogens, and stimulants would be given to unconsenting soldiers for observation of the effects.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt; In response to many of these unethical experiments, specific ethical codes were developed to protect the rights of the participant, and require informed consent.&lt;ref name=Lopez /&gt;

==Abuse of children==
Abuse in childcare institutions falls most commonly into the categories of overt abuse, program abuse, and system abuse, which arise from the staff, program, or childcare system.&lt;ref name=Nunno&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunno|first=M. A.|title=Institutional abuse: The role of leadership, authority, and the environment in social sciences literature|journal=Early Child Development and Care|year=1997|volume=133|page=21|doi=10.1080/0300443971330103}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children are still in development as institutional abuse occurs, the definition of institutional abuse for children is often widened to include harming a child's development, altering a child's identity, or devaluing them as a person.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; Child maltreatment is also often defined as foreseeable or probable harm or injury to a child's physical, social, emotional, or developmental well-being.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; Researchers found incidents ranging from 39 to 85 abuse cases per 100 children living in full-time housing, with only 85 in 1000 cases being reported to authorities.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; Children in mental disorder clinics were more likely to report abuse than those in mental disability clinics.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt;

===Model of abuse===
A number of researchers have tried to model the factors that cause abuse and maltreatment in childcare facilities. The acting factors in this model are the caregivers, children, the caregiving environment, and any other exogenic factors.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; Risk factors towards abuse are associated with each of these, such as the stress of the working environment can be to caregivers.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; These factors have all be organized into a model of concentric circles, with maltreatment at the center, and each circle further out influencing those within.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; There are ordered from inside out: maltreatment, child factors, caretaker factors, organization and environment factors, and exogenous factors.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt;

====Caretaker risk factors====
A number of high-risk factors for the institutional abuse of children include lack of caretaker competence or training and adherence to only one treatment methodology, lack of supervision of caretakers, and lots of time for unstructured activities.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt; The probability of a caretaker to be abusive is positively correlated with their job stress, age, lack of [[job satisfaction]] and facility status.

====Child risk factors====
Children who are more likely to be abused often display characteristics of being difficult for workers to deal with and needing more one-on-one supervision, isolation from their family, and previous victims of abuse. Male children are more likely to be abused, and are more often abused physically and neglectfully, while females are more likely to be sexually abused.&lt;ref name=Nunno /&gt;

====Other factors====
Incidents of abuse are most often reported at the beginning and end of the school year, and there are conflicting reports as to unemployment rates' influence on abuse.

==Abuse of older adults==
There is not a definitive definition of institutional abuse of older adults, with psychologists differing with legal definitions, and differing depending on the measures used.&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt; Definitions often include institutionally caused physical, psychological, financial, or sexual abuse or neglect.&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt;
Among the abuse that happens among elders, most is concentrated on those who are more frail and need more assistance.&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|first=Lynn |author2=Beaulieu, M. |author3=Harbison, J. |author4=Hirst, S. |author5=Lowenstein, A. |author6=Podnieks, E. |author7=Wahl, J. |title=Institutional Abuse of Older Adults: What We Know, What We Need to Know|journal=Journal of Elder Abuse &amp; Neglect|date=1 April 2012|volume=24|issue=2|pages=138–160|doi=10.1080/08946566.2011.646512|pmid=22471513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Canadian assistance homes, over 70% of workers reported acting in an abusive way towards patients, frequently in the form of psychological abuse or neglect.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; In a study of American assistance homes, there was a rate of 20% for employees stealing from residents, with employees acknowledging that it was the residents that were more difficult or abusive that were more likely to be robbed.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Further, in Sweden, assistance home employees reported witnessing abuse at 11%, while participating in elder abuse at 2% rates.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; This abuse was most commonly physical abuse, followed by psychological abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Rates of abuse differ across surveys, countries, and homes, but certain facts are consistent across studies. Victims of abuse are also susceptible to threefold greater mortality rates than their peers.&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|first=L.|title=Elder abuse and neglect in Canada: the glass is still half full|journal=Canadian Journal on Aging|year=2011|volume=30|issue=3|pages=437–65|doi=10.1017/s0714980811000286|pmid=21910956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several frameworks have been developed to model the risk factors for institutional elder abuse. In one model, risk factors are divided into three categories:validated factors, possible factors, and contested factors. Factors that have been shown to be risks for abuse include lack of consistent organizational policies, low-quality enforcement of standards, lack of trained staff, [[vulnerability]] due to [[dementia]].&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt; Possible factors include gender, personality of the victim, and race.&lt;ref name=Canada /&gt;

Sexual abuse is one of the lower occurring and under-reported forms of institutional abuse. Women are disproportionately represented among victims, and most often abused by other residents of the home.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; The majority of victims also suffered from a form of dementia or cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; However, institution-based sexual abuse crossed all gender, race, and cultural barriers.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

Risk factors of institutional abuse of older adults has been found to be related to the size of the housing, with larger organizations more susceptible to abuse.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Staff factors such as unionization, short staffing, and work stress are also predictors of abuse.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Patients with severe dementia are also more susceptible to maltreatment such as being constrained.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;

Researchers do not have a definitive answer for the cause of elder abuse. Workers in assistance homes have suggested that program factors such as understaffing, focus on making money over human welfare, and agism contributing to institutional abuse, aggravated by patients who may be difficult or struggling with mental health issues.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; Most studies have focused on the interaction of stressed workers with difficult patients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4474">The '''International AIDS Vaccine Initiative''' (known as IAVI) is a global [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit]], [[public-private partnership]] working to accelerate the development of [[vaccines]] to prevent [[HIV]] infection and [[AIDS]]. IAVI researches and develops vaccine candidates, conducts policy analyses, serves as an advocate for the HIV prevention field and engages communities in the trial process and AIDS vaccine education. The organization takes a comprehensive approach to HIV and AIDS that supports existing HIV prevention and treatment programs while emphasizing the need for new AIDS prevention tools. It also works to ensure that future vaccines will be accessible to all who need them.&lt;ref name= "Innovations"&gt;Berkley, Seth. (2006). Ending an epidemic: the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative pioneers a public-private partnership. ''Innovations'', Vol. 1, No. 1. 52–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IAVI LOGO.png|right]]

==History==
In 1994, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] convened an international meeting of AIDS researchers, vaccinologists, public health officials, and representatives from philanthropic organizations  in [[Bellagio, Italy]], to evaluate the challenges facing HIV/AIDS vaccine development and identify ways to jump-start research.&lt;ref name="TechImpact"&gt;Holtzman, J. (2009). International Aids Vaccine Initiative. ''TechImpact @ Yale'', 3(1), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
IAVI’s scientific team, drawn largely from private industry, researches and develops AIDS vaccine candidates and engages in clinical trials and research through partnerships with more than 50 academic, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and governmental institutions.&lt;ref name="Innovations" /&gt;

In September 2009, a global group of researchers led by IAVI published a study in the journal ''Science'' identifying PG9 and PG16, two highly powerful broadly neutralizing antibodies against a wide variety of HIV variants.&lt;ref name= "Antibodies"&gt;Cohen, Jon (2009). Potent Antibodies Spark Vaccine Hopes. ''Science'', Vol. 325. no. 5945, p. 1195&lt;/ref&gt; The site on the virus to which PG9 and PG16 attach revealed a vulnerability on HIV.&lt;ref name= "Theraclone"&gt;"[http://www.theraclone-sciences.com/pdf/Science_090309.pdf Two New Antibodies Found to Cripple HIV]," Theraclone Sciences news release. Sept. 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; PG9 and PG16 were the first new broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV discovered in more than a decade and are the result of a global effort launched in 2006.&lt;ref name="Renaissance"&gt;Phogat, Sanjay. "[http://www.globalhealthmagazine.com/aids_conference_blog_top_stories/iavi/ Antibody Discoveries Latest Advance in AIDS Vaccine Research Renaissance]," ''Global Health Magazine'' blog. July 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==
To address major obstacles in AIDS vaccine development, IAVI partners with HIV researchers from around the world. Its Neutralizing Antibody Consortium is a network dedicated to discovering and understanding broadly neutralizing [[antibodies]] against HIV and using that knowledge in the design of vaccines.&lt;ref name="TechImpact" /&gt;

IAVI is a founding member of the [[Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise]], an alliance of independent organizations working towards an AIDS vaccine.&lt;ref name="TechImpact" /&gt; It also partners with civil society organizations and other entities to advocate jointly for the development of AIDS vaccines, and is a member of the Global Health Technologies Coalition, an alliance of more than 30 non-profit groups that aims to increase awareness of the urgent need for technologies that save lives in developing countries.&lt;ref name="GHTC"&gt;[http://www.ghtcoalition.org/coalition-members.php Global Health Technologies Coalition] website.

'''John Edward Church''' (10 August 1899 - 29 September 1989),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Coming of the Rain: the Life of Dr Joe Church: a Personal Account of Revival in Rwanda.|last=Makower|first=Katharine|publisher=Paternoster Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=1–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as Joe Church was a British missionary who served with [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS). Dr. Joe Church served primarily in Rwanda and Uganda. He left England in 1927 and served as a missionary for 44 years, alternating between medical and evangelistic missions. He is widely known for playing a key role in the [[East African Revival]]. Additionally he served as a doctor in Rwanda for over a decade and constructed hospitals and a church. He has been recognized for his work by governments in East Africa and Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Early life ==
John Edward Church was born to Edward Joseph Church and Florence Edith Church in 1899.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Quest for the highest: an autobiographical account of the East African Revival|last=Church|first=J. E|publisher=The Paternoster Press|year=1981|isbn=0853643288|location=|pages=1–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a Cambridgeshire village named [[Burrough Green]] where his father served as a clergyman. He was the oldest of ten children and enjoyed a happy childhood in his small village where he often hunted and played cricket.

=== Education ===
At age 11, John Edward Church began attending the junior school at [[St Lawrence College, Ramsgate]] and later moved on to its senior school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/missiology/missionary-biography/c-d/church-john-edward-1899-1989/|title=Church, John Edward (1899-1989) {{!}} History of Missiology|website=www.bu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to attend this school at no cost because he was the son of a clergy. He did well academically and was well known for his shooting and hockey skills. In his senior year, he was enrolled into the officer cadet training camp of the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corp]] as a result of World War I. At 19 years old, he was ranked as Second Lieutenant and served with the Twentieth Battalion at Bovington in Dorset.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The war ended soon after this and through the British Army, he obtained a grant to attend [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]] at the University of Cambridge to study medicine. At Emmanuel College, John Edwards was heavily involved with [[Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union]] (CICCU) where he began a Bible class and was the club’s college representative. His interest in mission work stemmed from this club. Joe Church did his medical training at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital|St Bartholomew’s Hospital]] in London. In preparation for practicing medicine abroad, Joe Church pursued further training as a house surgeon and casualty officer at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. He received his Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1926.

=== Personal life ===
John Church married Decima Tracey, who was also a trained doctor, on May 19, 1930 in Uganda. The couple had five children: John, David, Robin, Michael, and Janine, all birthed in Rwanda or Uganda. Dr. Decima Tracey Church was an important part of Dr. Joe’s mission work and she often assisted with his medical work.

== Mission Work ==

=== Medical Missions ===
On October 28, 1927, Dr. Joe Church set sail for his mission in Rwanda. He first arrived in Kabale, Uganda where he received missions training from Church Mission Society (CMS) for five months. Once his training was completed, Dr Joe Church was sent to Gahini, Rwanda, a village in northeastern Rwanda. He immediately began planning to build a new hospital building since there was an overwhelming demand for medical care. Gahini, Rwanda was experiencing a famine when Dr. Joe first began his work so he dealt with many cases of skin sores and diarrhea. Dr. Joe Church wrote many appeals to the Belgian and British government for food supplies to Rwanda and Uganda, his pleas were heard and he was recognized by the local Gahini government for helping with the famine crisis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once Gahini Hospital was built, Dr. Joe worked there for eight years. He established a dispensary and often did life-saving surgeries and amputations. Dr. Joe was later given permission by the Rwandan government to establish more hospitals and dispensaries which he did in alliance with CMS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After eight years, Dr. Joe felt called to full time ministerial missions in Rwanda and Uganda and his younger brother, Dr. Bill Church, took over for him at Gahini Hospital.

=== Evangelical Missions ===
Dr. Joe Church and his family moved to Kabale, Uganda where he would focus on his evangelical missions for eight years. In his first year of full time evangelical missions, Dr. Joe wrote a book of Bible studies titled ''Every Man a Bible Student'' with over 40 studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dr. Joe used this book as a tool to train young men interested in ministry around Uganda and Rwanda. Aside from training future ministry workers, Dr. Joe also led many mission trips and held many conferences for the Anglican Church in Rwanda and Uganda. He organized and attended multiple revivals in other locations such as Tanzania, Angola, South Africa, India, and multiple South American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Ruanda_1951-1953_03/0?searchText=%22Church,%20Joe%22%7C%22Joe%20Church%22%7C%22John%20Edward%20Church%22&amp;goToHit=True#Articles.|title=Aug-Oct 1951, Ruanda Notes - Church Missionary Society Periodicals - Adam Matthew Digital|website=www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pioneer in establishing the [[Anglican Church]] in Rwanda and Uganda. In 1943, Dr. Joe Church was called back to medical missions because there was need for a doctor at Gahini Hospital. For about two years, he worked one out of every three months at Gahini Hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1947, Dr. Joe Church and his family officially moved back to Gahini, Rwanda where he served as a doctor and helped pastor the 300 village churches. He continued leading the revival in Rwanda and rebuilt the Gahini hospital during his time there.

== Legacy ==
Dr. Joe Church was affiliated with Church Mission Society (CMS) for the entirety of his mission work and they described him as a, “pioneer of missionary of the Rwanda Mission.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Partners_1987-1990_12/0?searchText=%22Church,%20Joe%22%7C%22Joe%20Church%22%7C%22John%20Edward%20Church%22&amp;goToHit=True#Articles|title=Dec 1989, Partners Together - Church Missionary Society Periodicals - Adam Matthew Digital|website=www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in East Africa, Dr. Church established [[Gahini|Gahini Hospital]], Kabarole Hospital, and constructed Toro Hospital with his son Robin Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk/Documents/Images/CMS_OX_Partners_1987-1990_12/0?searchText=%22Church,+Joe%22%7C%22Joe+Church%22%7C%22John+Edward+Church%22&amp;goToHit=True#Articles.|title=Dec 1989, Partners Together - Church Missionary Society Periodicals - Adam Matthew Digital|website=www.churchmissionarysociety.amdigital.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Uganda, he and other missionaries established Kabale Preparatory School as a school for missionary children in Rwanda. Dr. Joe was appointed as the Rwandan King’s physician and later on his son, John Church, was also the King’s physician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dr. Joe and Dr. Decie were recognized for their work by [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]] of the Belgians and were awarded the ‘medaille d’ or de l’ordre royal du Lion’. Dr. Joe Church published his autobiography, ''Quest for the Highest - an autobiographical account of the East African revival'' in 1981.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dr. Joe Church officially retired in 1972 in Little Shelford, England. Dr. Joe Church passed away, aged ninety, on September 29, 1989 in a Royston nursing home.

'''John of Alexandria''' ({{floruit|{{dash year|600|642}}}}) was a [[Byzantine]] medical writer who lived in [[Alexandria]], in present-day Egypt.

He is thought to be the author of a commentary on [[Galen]]'s ''De sectis'', a Latin version of which survives in several manuscripts. He wrote a commentary on [[Hippocrates]]' book about the foetus (''In Hippocratis De natura pueri commentarium''), which survives in one Greek manuscript and in a 13th-century Latin version made for [[Manfred, King of Sicily|King Manfred of Sicily]]. He also wrote a commentary on the sixth book of Hippocrates' ''Epidemics'' (''In Hippocratis Epidemiarum librum VI commentarii fragmenta''), known from an anonymous Latin translation and from extracts from the Greek original, entered in the margins of a Greek translation of an Arabic medical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=John of Alexandria Again: Greek Medical Philosophy in Latin Translation |first=Vivian |last=Nutton |authorlink=Vivian Nutton |journal=[[The Classical Quarterly]] |volume=41 |issue=2 |year=1991 |pages=509–519 |jstor=638916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/manuscripts/john_of_alexandria.htm |website=tertullian.org |title=John of Alexandria: the Manuscripts of his Commentaries on Hippocrates |first=Roger |last=Pearse |date=11 August 2002 |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{featured list}}

This article lists '''aircraft accidents and incidents which resulted in at least 50 fatalities''' in a single occurrence involving commercial passenger and cargo flights, military passenger and cargo flights, or general aviation flights that have been involved in a ground or mid-air collision with either a commercial or military passenger or cargo flight.

There have been 548&lt;!-- 548 incidents as of Lion Air Flight 610 crash on 29 October 2018. These precise calculations are made by copying all values in the "total deaths" column using the visual editor, then pasting the values into an automatic calculator on this website: http://calculla.com/columnar_add --&gt; such incidents, including terrorist or other attacks. Of these, 202 have involved at least 100 fatalities, 34 have had at least 200 fatalities, 8 have had at least 300 fatalities, and 4 have had at least 500 fatalities. Between 1923 (the first year an aircraft accident or incident exceeded 50 fatalities) and the present, these incidents have accounted for precisely 57,654&lt;!-- 57,654 fatalities as of Lion Air Flight 610 crash on 29 October 2018 --&gt; fatalities across all seven [[continent]]s and the three largest oceans.

==History==

Five years after the pioneering flight of the [[Wright brothers]] on 17 December 1903,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Brief History of the FAA |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/history/brief_history |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Selfridge]] became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during a demonstration of the [[Wright Model A]] at [[Fort Myer]], Virginia, on 17 September 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lancasteronline.com/blogs/flashbacklancaster/2008/09/17/fatal-plane-crash-1908 |title=Fatal plane crash, 1908 |date=17 September 2008 |publisher=Flashback Lancaster |accessdate=8 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005131939/http://lancasteronline.com/blogs/flashbacklancaster/2008/09/17/fatal-plane-crash-1908/ |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugène Lefebvre]] was the first pilot killed in a powered airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near [[Douai]], France, killing the pilot of each aircraft.&lt;ref name="Chisholm1913"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chisholm |first=Hugh |title=The Britannica Year Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VlBNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR29 |accessdate=21 March 2014 |year=1913 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company, Limited |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.

The first aviation incident to result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the [[Dixmude (airship)|''Dixmude'']], a [[rigid airship]] of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off [[Sicily]], Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed.&lt;ref name="The French Airship Catastrophe"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1924/1924%20-%200009.html |title=The French Airship Catastrophe |date=3 January 1924 |publisher=Flightglobal Archive |page=9 |number=784 |volume=XVI |accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 10 years later, the {{USS|Akron|ZRS-4|6}}, also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off [[Barnegat Light, New Jersey|Barnegat Light]], New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board.&lt;ref name=dirigible&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/08/nyregion/history-in-the-sea-dirigible-s-wreckage-found-off-jersey.html |title=History in the sea: Dirigible's wreckage found off Jersey |date=8 August 1986 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A [[Curtiss F11C Goshawk|Curtiss Hawk II]] crashed into spectator stands in the [[1938 Santa Ana air show disaster|Santa Ana air show disaster]]. 52 spectators were killed on the ground in addition to the pilot of the airplane.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1938/1938-28.htm |work=Plane Crash info.com |accessdate=7 February 2014 |title=Accident Details}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in [[Tokyo]] claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1938/1938-38.htm |work=Plane Crash info.com |accessdate=7 February 2014 |title=Accident Details}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[rotorcraft]] incident to result in more than 50 fatalities was the [[1977 Israeli Air Force Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion crash|1977 crash]] of a [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion]] in [[Israel]], which killed 54 people.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Yv8LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=S1gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6577,2025995&amp;dq=israel+sikorsky+crash|title=The Evening Independent - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 people died in the crash of [[Japan Airlines Flight 123]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aviation Safety Network Safety Database |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database |accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most fatalities in any aviation accident in history occurred during 1977 in the [[Tenerife airport disaster]] when 583 people were killed when two [[Boeing 747]]s collided on a [[runway]]. The greatest number of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the [[Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision]], to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes.&lt;ref name="libraryonline.erau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/miscellaneous-reports/Tenerife.pdf |title=Joint Report K.L.M.-P.A.A. 12.7.1978 |date=16 November 1978 |website=libraryonline.erau.edu |publisher=Minasterio de Transportes Y Comunicaciones |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 (9/11)]] coordinated attack of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims.&lt;ref name="aviation-safety"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20010911-0 |title=ASN Accident Description (American Airlines-11) |date=11 September 2001 |website=aviation-safety.net |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aviation-safety_a"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20010911-1 |title=ASN Accident Description (United Airlines-175) |date=11 September 2001 |website=aviation-safety.net |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Boeing]] released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths.&lt;ref name="boeing1pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/techissues/pdf/statsum.pdf |title=Statistical summary of commercial jet airplane accidents (1959–2011) |year=2012 |website=boeing.com |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boeing analysis suggests a decrease of commercial aviation accident fatality rates toward the end of the study period.

==Inclusion criteria==

Criteria for inclusion require at least 50 fatalities in a single occurrence involving commercial passenger and cargo flights, [[Military transport aircraft|military passenger and cargo flights]], or [[general aviation]] flights that have been involved in a ground or [[mid-air collision]] with either a commercial or military passenger or cargo flight.

The US [[Code of Federal Regulations]] defines an accident as "an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the aircraft receives substantial damage;" an incident as "an occurrence other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft, which affects or could affect the safety of operations;" and a fatal injury as one which results in death within 30 days of the accident.&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title49-vol7/pdf/CFR-2012-title49-vol7-subtitleB-chapVIII.pdf |title=Code of Federal Regulations (Title 49-Transportation) |year=2012 |page=626 |website=gpo.gov |publisher=Government Printing Office |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of accident, incident, and fatality in the Code of Federal Regulations, and used by the [[FAA]] and [[NTSB]] are generally consistent with those found in the [[ICAO]] [[Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation]] Annex 13.&lt;ref name="boeing1pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.caa.govt.nz/ICAO/ICAO_Compliance.htm |title=International Standards and Recommended Practices |year=2001 |website=caa.govt.nz |publisher=International Civil Aviation Organization |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes regarding table data columns==

===Deaths===
* '''Total (Tot)''': The total number of fatalities associated with the accident or incident.
* '''Crew (C)''': The number of crew fatalities.
* '''Passenger (P)''': The number of passenger fatalities.
* '''Ground (G)''': The number of ground (non-flying) fatalities.
* '''Notes (N)''': The presence of a cross ('''†''') denotes that all passengers and crew were killed. The presence of a one with an asterisk ('''1*''') indicates the accident or incident had a [[List of sole survivors of aviation accidents or incidents|sole survivor]].

===Type===
Occurrences have been coded to allow for identification and sorting by group membership (accidents and related incidents versus attacks).

====Accidents and related incidents====
* '''"COM"''': Commercial aircraft
* '''"MIL"''': Military aircraft
Any collision between a commercial and military aircraft is coded COM.

====Attacks and related incidents====
* '''"INB"''': Internal attack involving a pre-planned bomb (without hijacking).
* '''"INH"''': Internal attack to commandeer of aircraft. Use of weapons (including a bomb or other explosives) for this purpose is coded in this category.
* '''"EXG"''': External attack originating on the ground (e.g., [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827|ground to air missiles]], destruction of the aircraft [[EgyptAir Flight 648|while on the runway]]).
* '''"EXS"''': External attack originating in the sky (e.g., [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007|intentional downing by a military aircraft]]).

&lt;!-- Each accident or incident has been reviewed using [[Google Earth]] to find the location closest to the crash site. Whenever possible, the location closest to impact is [[Hyperlink|linked]]. In some cases, a sparsely populated district or region may be linked.--&gt;
To provide some indication of distance between the site and the nearest location, the following three descriptors are applied:
* '''none''': No descriptor appears before the location name. The site was within 20&amp;nbsp;km (12.5&amp;nbsp;mi) of the location.
* '''"off"''': Used only for those [[Water|aquatic]] crash sites within 20&amp;nbsp;km (12.5&amp;nbsp;mi) of the location.
* '''"near"''': The site was approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km to 50&amp;nbsp;km (12.5&amp;nbsp;mi to 31&amp;nbsp;mi) from the location.
* '''"area of"''': The crash site was over 50&amp;nbsp;km (31&amp;nbsp;mi) from the location provided.
The names of occurrence locations are based on their present-day names.

===Phases of flight===
The phases of flight are those defined by the joint Commercial Aviation Safety
Team/ICAO Common Taxonomy Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intlaviationstandards.org/Documents/PhaseofFlightDefinitions.pdf |title=Phase of Flight Definitions |year=2013 |website=www.intlaviationstandards.org |publisher=International Aviation Standards |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Standing (STD)''': Prior to pushback/taxi, after gate arrival, or stationary and parked.
* '''Taxi (TXI)''': Moving under own power, prior to takeoff or after landing.
* '''Take off (TOF)''': Initiation of takeoff power, [[rotation (aviation)|pulling back on controls]], through to 10&amp;nbsp;m (35&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude.
* '''Initial climb (ICL)''': End of TOF to the first of: initial prescribed power reduction, 300&amp;nbsp;m (1000&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude, or VFR pattern.
* '''En route (ENR)''': End of ICL, through descent, to initial approach ([[Instrument flight rules|IFR]]) or 300&amp;nbsp;m (1000&amp;nbsp;ft) above runway elevation ([[Visual flight rules|VFR]]).
* '''Maneuvering (MNV)''': Only for low altitude flight (observation, photography) or [[aerobatics]].
* '''Approach (APR)''': From [[Initial approach fix|IAF]] or 300&amp;nbsp;m (1000&amp;nbsp;ft) elevation to [[landing flare]].
* '''Landing (LDG)''': Landing flare through to exit from runway.
* '''Unknown (UNK)''': Unable to determine phase of flight.

===Airports and distance===
Airports associated with occurrences at all phases of flight (except ENR) are represented by their three-letter [[IATA airport code|IATA]] airport code. In some cases, no IATA code is reported/assigned in which case the four-letter [[ICAO airport code|ICAO]] code is used. In rare instances (e.g., active or decommissioned military bases or closed airports whose civil codes have been reassigned), no codes exist. These airports are represented with three asterisks "***" in place of letters. Distance from the point of impact to the airport runway is provided for occurrences during the initial climb (ICL) and approach (APR) phases. On occasion, distance is provided for occurrences during takeoff (TOF) and landing (LDG) if the aircraft impacted within the [[aerodrome]], but not on the runway.

==Summary==
Since 1923, spanning all seven continents and the three largest oceans, there have been 548 high fatality aircraft accidents, incidents, and attacks (as defined above) involving 580 aircraft resulting in 57,654 fatalities. [[List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities#Type|By type]], accidents/incidents (COM/MIL) account for 507 occurrences, 536 aircraft, and 50,365 fatalities. Attacks (INB/INH/EXG/EXS) account for 41 incidents, 44 aircraft, and 7,289 fatalities.&lt;!--updated as of Lion Air Flight 610 crash on 29 October 2018--&gt;

===Descriptive statistics (1923–2018)===
A brief review of the descriptive statistics of [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]], [[Rotorcraft|rotary-wing]], and [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] aircraft accidents and incidents between 1923 and 2018 suggests the following:
* ''by [[List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities#Type|type]]'', the two main categories of occurrences were accidents and related incidents (507; 92.5%) and attacks on aircraft (41; 7.5%). Sub-groupings of the first category include commercial (COM, 438; 86.4%) and military (MIL, 69; 13.6%). Sub-groupings of the second category include internal attacks with a bomb (INB, 15; 36.7%), internal attacks with hijacking (INH, 10; 24.4%), external attacks from the ground (EXG, 12; 29.3%), and external attacks from the sky (EXS, 4; 9.8%).
* ''by [[List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities#Deaths|fatality rate (FR)]]'', 381 (69.5%) of occurrences had a 100% FR, and an additional 73 (13.3%) had above 90% FR; note the high [[selection bias]] of this statistic, since incidents with less than 50 fatalities, likely to have low FR,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} are excluded by definition.
* ''by [[List of aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities#Phases of flight|phase of flight]]'', the highest number  of occurrences took place while en route (251; 45.3%).
* ''by decade'', 1964–73 had the greatest number of occurrences (117; 21.4%) and pre-1944 the least (6; 1.1%). The highest number of fatalities (in large part due to the 9/11 attacks) occurred during 1994–2003 (12,831; 22.3%) and the lowest pre-1944 (426; 0.7%).
* ''by location'', the continents of Asia and [[Antarctica]] had the highest (186; 34.0%) and lowest (1; 0.2%) number of occurrences respectively. The United States (69; 12.6%), followed by the former Soviet Union (52; 9.5%) accounted for nearly one-quarter of all high fatality crashes. Aircraft impacted the water in 64 (11.7%) occurrences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3112">{{other uses|Minimisation (disambiguation){{!}}Minimisation}}
'''Minimisation''' is a method of adaptive [[stratified sampling]] that is used in [[clinical trials]], as described by [[Stuart Pocock|Pocock]] and Simon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pocock |first=Stuart J. |last2=Simon |first2=Richard |date=Mar 1975 |title=Sequential Treatment Assignment with Balancing for Prognostic Factors in the Controlled Clinical Trial |jstor=2529712 |journal=Biometrics |publisher=International Biometric Society |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=103–115 |doi=10.2307/2529712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7155/362 Minimisation: the platinum standard for trials?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of minimisation is to minimise the imbalance between the number of patients in each [[treatment group]] over a number of factors. Normally patients would be allocated to a treatment group [[Random sample|randomly]] and while this maintains a good overall balance, it can lead to imbalances within sub-groups. For example, if a majority of the patients who were receiving the active drug happened to be male, or smokers, the statistical usefulness of the study would be reduced.

The traditional method to avoid this problem, known as [[Randomized block design|blocked randomisation]], is to [[Stratify (clinical trials)|stratify]] patients according to a number of factors (e.g. male and female, or smokers and non-smokers) and to use a separate randomisation list for each group. Each randomisation list would be created such that after every block of x patients, there would be an equal number in each treatment group. The problem with this method is that the number of lists increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with the number of stratification factors.

Minimisation addresses this problem by calculating the imbalance within each factor should the patient be allocated to a particular treatment group. The various imbalances are added together to give the overall imbalance in the study. The treatment group that would minimise the imbalance can be chosen directly, or a random element may be added (perhaps allocating a higher chance to the groups that will minimise the imbalance, or perhaps only allocating a chance to groups that will minimise the imbalance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/sim.3710 | volume=28 | title=Randomization by minimization for unbalanced treatment allocation | year=2009 | journal=Statistics in Medicine | pages=3329–3346 | author=Han Baoguang, Enas Nathan H., McEntegart Damian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.ubc.ca/lib/FCKuserfiles/STAT527A.Minimization.Final.pdf A Review of Minimization: Methods and Practical Concerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

The imbalances can be weighted if necessary to give some factors more importance than others. Similarly a ratio can be applied to the number of patients in each treatment group.

In use, minimisation often maintains a better balance than traditional blocked randomisation, and its advantage rapidly increases with the number of stratification factors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6375">'''Mirror syndrome''' or '''triple edema''' or '''Ballantyne syndrome''' is a rare disorder affecting [[pregnancy|pregnant]] women. It describes the unusual association of [[fetus|fetal]]
and [[placenta]]l [[hydrops fetalis|hydrops]] with maternal [[Pre-eclampsia|preeclampsia]].&lt;ref name="Paternoster DM 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000089056 |vauthors=Paternoster DM, Manganelli F, Minucci D, Nanhornguè KN, Memmo A, Bertoldini M, Nicolini U | year = 2006 | title = Ballantyne Syndrome: a Case Report | url = | journal = Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 92–5 | pmid = 16354984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "mirror syndrome" refers to the similarity between maternal edema and fetal hydrops. It was first described in 1892 by [[John William Ballantyne]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/616.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

==Pathogenesis==
The [[Pathogenesis|etiopathogenetic]] mechanism of Ballantyne syndrome remains unknown.

==Signs and symptoms==
Ballantyne syndrome has several characteristics: 
* [[edema]], always a key feature
* [[albuminuria]] of the mother, usually mild
* [[Pre-eclampsia|preeclampsia]], unusual

The fetal symptoms are related to fluid retention, including [[ascites]] and [[polyhydramnios]].&lt;ref name="pmid12380459"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vidaeff AC, Pschirrer ER, Mastrobattista JM, Gilstrap LC, Ramin SM |title=Mirror syndrome. A case report |journal=The Journal of reproductive medicine |volume=47 |issue=9 |pages=770–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12380459 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fetal hydrops suggests the presence of an important and probably fatal fetal [[pathology]].

It can be associated with [[twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid17652930"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang YL, Chao AS, Hsu JJ, Chang SD, Soong YK |title=Selective fetocide reversed mirror syndrome in a dichorionic triplet pregnancy with severe twin-twin transfusion syndrome: a case report |journal=Fetal Diagn. Ther. |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=428–30 |year=2007 |pmid=17652930 |doi=10.1159/000106348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Although the exact etiopathogenetic mechanism of Ballantyne syndrome remains unknown, several authors have reported raised [[uric acid]] levels, [[anemia]], and low [[hematocrit]] without [[hemolysis]].&lt;ref name="Paternoster DM 2006"/&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==
The problem of distinguishing (or not) between Ballantyne syndrome and [[Pre-eclampsia|preeclampsia]] is reflected in the diversity of [[terminology]] used and in the debate that surrounds the subject. It seems much more likely that an etiology of severe fetal hydrops may cause Ballantyne syndrome when the fetal status greatly worsens and that the syndrome is only a manifestation of the extreme severity of the fetus-placental pathology. [[Platelet|Platelet count]], [[aspartate transaminase]], [[alanine transaminase]], and [[haptoglobin]] are usually unaffected and may be used to distinguish mirror syndrome from [[HELLP syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Van1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ejogrb.2003.12.011 |vauthors=Pirhonen JP, Hartgil TW | year = 2004 | title = Spontaneous reversal of mirror syndrome in a twin pregnancy after a single fetal death | url = | journal = European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 106–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gherman RB, Incerpi MH, Wing DA, Goodwin TM | year = 1998 | title = Ballantyne syndrome: is placental ischemia the etiology? | url = | journal = Journal of Maternal-Fetal Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 5| pages = 227–9 | pmid = 9775990 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6661(199809/10)7:5&lt;227::AID-MFM3&gt;3.0.CO;2-I }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heyborne KD, Chism DM | year = 2000 | title = Reversal of Ballantyne syndrome by selective second-trimester fetal termination.

==Treatment==
In most cases Ballantyne syndrome causes fetal or neonatal death and, in contrast, maternal involvement is limited at the most to [[preeclampsia]].

'''PATH Biobank''' ('''Patients’ Tumor Bank of Hope''') is a German [[biobank]] for [[breast cancer]], established in 2002 from patients for patients. PATH is an independent non-profit foundation with the purpose of supporting breast cancer research with high quality tumor tissue. In order to achieve this goal, PATH operates sample storage tanks with liquid nitrogen at seven German breast centers. Tumor tissue and blood serum from breast cancer patients are stored in these tanks. More than 7200 women have consented to the storage of their tissue since 2004 (as of January 2014). A centralized database complements the biobank with important patient information.
PATH is a joint venture of clinicians, scientists and patients. Via sample collection for cancer research, these partners aim to close the gap between basic science and fast implementation in the clinical practice.

==Concept==

===Making sample collection more efficient===
Establishing the infrastructure for sampling high quality tissue for basic and clinical research is time consuming and hence often impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann-Posch U.: ''Der Knoten über meinem Herzen'', Munich 1999, pp. 295&lt;/ref&gt; The property situation of the tumor tissue is often not clearly regulated, which further complicates the establishment of a tissue collection. This situation was pointed our by Prof. Dr. [[Axel Ullrich]] one of the inventors of [[Trastuzumab]] and member of the scientific advisory board of PATH.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stiftungpath.org/organisation/Scientific advisory board of PATH biobank] Website of PATH Biobank.&lt;/ref&gt; Gathering follow-up data from patients is often impossible for a scientist. PATH solves these problems via a centralized storage of the samples, transparent allocation criteria and routine follow-up surveys.

===Strategy===
In one of the cooperating clinical centers, the breast cancer patient is informed about the option to store her tissue a blood serum at PATH. In the case of her [[informed consent]], the tumor will be split into equal parts (aliquots) immediately after the surgery and routine diagnostic. One part is stored exclusively for the patient, the other samples are donated to PATH Biobank for research purposes. The samples are processed according to strict quality standards (cGCP) in all cooperating clinics and stored in the gas phase of liquid nitrogen (about -160&amp;nbsp;°C).

===Standardized and uniform sample processing===
The processing, labelling and storage of the tumor and normal tissue and the blood serum aliquots is performed according to standard operation procedures (SOPs), which have been developed specially for PATH. The size of the tissue samples and maximal ischemia times, as well as clotting times for the blood samples, are regulated by the SOPs and documented.

==Structure of PATH ==
The honorary board of the PATH Biobank consists of three individuals, according to the statute two of which need to have had breast cancer. In addition to the representation, e.g. at conferences and towards scientific partners, the board guides the activities and direction. The day-to-day business is organized by the PATH-office in Munich. The staff encompasses two permanent employees, which are supported by working students.

==Extensive documentation of patient data==

The PATH database encompasses a large amount of important information, which is crucial for using the samples for research. The database solution is located on a stand-alone-computer without internet access, in order to protect the data from unauthorized access. In addition to this, personal data are stored physically separated from further data. Under no circumstances are these personal data given to third parties. The database includes information about e.g. the number of samples, ischemia/clotting times of the samples before freezing, age and gender of the patient, potential pre-existing medical conditions, type and date of diagnosis, menopausal state, staging/grading, histopathology, receptor state (HER2/neu, ER- and PR-state), recommended therapies and already performed (neoadjuvant) therapies, survival state, events (locoregional relapse, distant metastases, therapy course).

[[Image:Coronary artery bypass surgery Image 657C-PH.jpg|thumb|right|320px|A '''perfusionist''' in front of a [[heart–lung machine]] (upper right) early in a [[coronary artery bypass surgery]].]] 
A '''perfusionist''', also known as a '''Clinical Perfusionist''', '''Cardiovascular Perfusionist''', '''Perfusiologist''', '''Clinical Perfusion Scientist''', or '''Medical Perfusionist''', is a [[healthcare professional]] who uses the [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine ([[heart–lung machine]]) during [[cardiac surgery]] and other surgeries that require cardiopulmonary bypass to manage the patient's physiological status. 

Perfusionists form part of the wider cardiothoracic surgical team which includes [[cardiac surgeon]]s, [[anesthesiologist]]s and [[physician assistant]]s. The perfusionist shares responsibility with the cardiac surgeon and anesthesiologist for the management of the physiological and metabolic needs of the cardiac surgical patient, so that the surgeon may operate on a still,or unbeating [[heart]] during certain procedures. The cardiac surgeon is in overall command of the operation. This is accomplished through the utilization of the [[heart–lung machine]], as well as its associated components of an [[oxygenator]], filters, reservoirs and tubing. The perfusionist is responsible for the management of circulatory and respiratory functions of the patient which has a great{{explain|date=October 2018}} effect on the patient systemic condition and allows the [[cardiac surgeon]] to focus on the actual surgical procedure and less on the immediate needs of the patient. Other responsibilities include [[autotransfusion|autologous blood]] collection and processing, implementation and management of the [[intra-aortic balloon pump]], and management of [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]], as well as monitoring of [[anticoagulation]], electrolyte, acid-base balance and blood-gas composition. In many tertiary hospitals, perfusionists are also key personnel in placing and managing patients on [[ventricular assist device]]s as a bridge to recovery or [[heart transplantation]] and supporting patients receiving [[lung transplantation|lung]] or [[liver transplant]]s. In some hospitals, perfusionists can be involved in procurement of cardiothoracic donor organs for transplantation.

==Training and certification==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2016}}
===United States===
In the [[United States]],There are only Certified Clinical Perfusionists who perform all perfusion, for cardiac Surgery. A [[bachelor's degree]] with concentrations in [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] is the prerequisite to be admitted to a perfusion program.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} As of 2005, there are 18 perfusion training programs in the United States, most offering a [[master's degree]] in perfusion sciences or circulatory sciences. Training typically consists of two years of academic and clinical education. Although the structure and training philosophies of perfusion programs differ, typically a perfusion student will begin his or her training in a [[Didactic method|didactic fashion]] in which the student will closely follow instructions from a ''certified clinical perfusionist'' in the confines of a cardiac surgery procedure. Academic coursework may be concurrent or precede this clinical instruction and is equally vital for their training. Early in their clinical training, the perfusion student may have little involvement outside of an observational role. However, as time progresses, more tasks may be incrementally delegated to them with the ultimate goal of producing a capable and competent perfusionist. Once a student graduates from a perfusion program, he or she must begin the certification process. In the interim, the perfusion graduate is typically referred to as board-eligible, which is sufficient for employment in cardiac surgery with the understanding that achieving certified status is required for long-term employment. Most employers have stipulations on the duration of board-eligible status.

A two-part exam is required to become certified and use the designation ''C.C.P''. In the United States, this exam is administered and evaluated by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion. Similar governing bodies exist in other countries with comparable examination processes. The first portion of the two-part process is the Perfusion Basic Science Exam, and the latter portion is the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam. In order to qualify for this examination process, a perfusion student must have either graduated from or be enrolled in an accredited perfusion program, as well as have participated in a minimum of 75 clinical procedures during the course of their training.&lt;ref name="ccp"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.abcp.org/certification.htm
 | title=Certification
 | publisher=American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion
 | accessdate=2010-02-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A perfusion student may qualify for the Perfusion Basic Science Exam before they actually matriculate from their respective training program. Once employment is provided, and the perfusionist has participated independently in a minimum of 50 clinical procedures, he or she can qualify for the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam.&lt;ref name="ccp" /&gt; Once the Clinical Applications in Perfusion Exam has been successfully passed, a perfusionist can use the designation ''C.C.P''.  In addition, there are recertification requirements for perfusionists in which proof of a minimum number of clinical procedures and attendance to scientific or educational meetings must be provided to a certifying body (''i.e.'' American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion). These recertification requirements and subsequent verification process occur every three years and are mandatory to maintain certified status to use the designation ''certified clinical perfusionist''.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]],There are only Certified Clinical Perfusionits who perform all perfusion, for cardiac Surgery.  There are three training programs: [[Burnaby]] in [[Western Canada]], and[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]] in [[Eastern Canada]]. [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] in Burnaby offers an advanced specialty certificate in cardiovascular perfusion to graduates of its two-year program. Applicants must be certified respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, or cardiac professionals with two years or more of current experience in cardiac critical care. Applicants to the [[The Michener Institute|Michener Institute]] program in Toronto must have a [[bachelor's degree]]. The training program is 16 months to two years. The perfusion program of the [[Université de Montréal]] is a three-year [[bachelor's degree]] of 90 credits in biomedical science of which 27 credits are specific to clinical perfusion and in addition a diplôme d’études supérieurs spécialisées (DESS) of 30 credits in clinical perfusion of one-year at the master level.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
There are only Clinical Perfusion Scientists who perform all perfusion, for cardiac Surgery.{{confusing|reason=is the training course prior to or whilst a trainee perfusionist?Which parts are paid?|date=February 2017}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], a bachelor's degree in a science subject (usually life or clinical sciences) is a pre-requisite to enrolment on the two-year perfusion training course. Employment as a trainee perfusionist is also required. Trainees must complete a two-year academic and practical course. They complete academic assessments (essays and exams), while in the workplace moving from a purely observational role to one in which they are capable of managing the patient while they are on cardiopulmonary system with minimal supervision. Once a trainee has been the primary perfusionist in 150 clinical procedures, they must undertake a practical exam. For this exam, the candidate is observed by two external examiners whilst building and priming a cardiopulmonary circuit, then using it during a surgical operation. After the practical exam, trainees must complete a 40-minute ''viva voce'' exam, which tests their academic knowledge. After this is successfully completed, they are awarded a postgraduate diploma and the status of qualified clinical perfusion scientist. They must maintain this by performing a minimum of 40 clinical procedures per year.

===Australia===
In Australia there are both Clinical and medical perfusionists.There are significantly more Clinical Perfusionists in Australia, who may be trained overseas, as well as Australia.. Clinical Perfusionists have the most experience in performing the majority of actual perfusion in cardiac surgery in Australia. Although Masters and PhD graduates have trained and become Clinical Perfusionist, the minimum qualification, is a science degree(usually Clinical/Health Sciences) as an entry requirement, before training. Clinical Perfusion training was at the Masters of Science level via an eLearning course at a university. Further didactic training is in a practical/clinical format. This is performed at a hospital, whilst doing a three-year multi-examined, multi-modular course via correspondence, with the Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists (ANZCP). A further final examination for Clinical Perfusionists, is administered by the ANZCP over two days. This involves a three hour written, two hour multiple choice and four half hour viva voce questions.

Significantly, up to this time, medical perfusionists are unqualified in perfusion.   A medical perfusionist is a medical doctor (usually an anaesthetist) Who may become university trained, in a new course, through part time eLearning and simulation to perform perfusion.  

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand there are only Clinical Perfusionists who perform perfusion in heart surgery.  A Clinical Perfusionist must have at least a science degree(usually Clinical/Health Sciences) as an entry requirement, before training. Further didactic training is in a practical/clinical format, at a hospital, whilst doing a three-year course via correspondence with the Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists. Final examination for a Clinical Perfusionists, is administered by the ANZCP over two days. This involves a three hour written, two hour multiple choice and four half hour viva voce questions. 

===Other countries===

The majority of perfusion in cardiac surgery, in the developed world, is performed by Clinical Perfusionists.In China, Egypt, and some South American countries a clinical perfusionist is a medical doctor who has completed subspecialty training.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
In [[Argentina]], a perfusionist is a medical doctor, usually a [[Cardiology|cardiologist]], who has undertaken additional sub-specialty training. They are often referred to as "hemodinamistas" (i. e. hemodynamics specialists).

===In India=== 

In India there are only Clinical Perfusionists who perform perfusion in heart surgery.There are different education programs for the education of Clinical Perfusionists. A three Year Bachelors degree program. Additionally, there is a two years post graduate diploma that is available to practice as a Clinical Perfusionist. A three and half year bachelor's degree program is also available, which includes six months internship. A two years post graduate diploma in some institutions (i. e. AIIMS Delhi,  SMSMC Jaipur) Recently The Board of Clinical Perfusionist of India introduced certification.


== Clinical procedures ==
Perfusionists can be involved in a number of cardiac surgical procedures, select vascular procedures and a few other surgical procedures in an ancillary role. In the realm of cardiac surgery, perfusionists perform cardiopulmonary bypass in adult and pediatric surgical procedures, which constitute the majority of procedures that perfusionists perform.

Perfusionists may participate in curative or staged palliative procedures to treat the following pediatric pathologies:

'''Picamilon''' (also known as '''N-nicotinoyl-GABA''', '''pycamilon''', and '''pikamilon''') is a drug formed by a synthetic combination of [[niacin]] and [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]]. It was developed in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1969&lt;ref name=" Some approaches to the directed search for new drugs based on nicotinic acid"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kopelevich VM, Gunar VI | title =  Some approaches to the directed search for new drugs based on nicotinic acid | journal = Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal | volume = 33 | issue = 4 | pages = 177–187 |date=April 1999 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02509934 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/r8430r0l4x596027/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further studied in both [[Russia]]&lt;ref name="pmid2707413"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirzoian RS, Gan'shina TS | title = [The new cerebrovascular preparation pikamilon] | language = Russian | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–6 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2707413 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Japan]] as a [[prodrug]] of GABA.&lt;ref name="pmid6529802"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuyama K, Yamashita C, Noda A, Goto S, Noda H, Ichimaru Y, Gomita Y | title = Evaluation of isonicotinoyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and nicotinoyl-GABA as pro-drugs of GABA | journal = Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 32 | issue = 10 | pages = 4089–95 | date = Oct 1984 | pmid = 6529802 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.32.4089 | url = http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=cpb1958&amp;cdvol=32&amp;noissue=10&amp;startpage=4089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, picamilon is sold as a prescription drug. The rights to the drug belong to the Russian pharmaceutical company NPK ECHO ("НПК ЭХО"). It is not approved for sale in the United States and has been deemed as an adulterating agent in [[dietary supplements]], with five American companies required to remove their picamilon products from the market in November, 2015.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Regulation/FDA-sends-five-warning-letters-over-supplements-containing-picamilon/?c=7InNqGv0AjdjxWpyk%2BfGQw%3D%3D&amp;p2= | title = FDA sends five warning letters over supplements containing picamilon | date = 2 December 2015 | publisher = NutraIngredients-USA.com, William Reed Business Media|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications==
One study in animals showed that picamilon permeated the [[blood–brain barrier]]&lt;ref name="pmid1884802"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dorofeev BF, Kholodov LE | title = [Pikamilon pharmacokinetics in animals] | language = Russian | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 66–9 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1884802 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then is [[hydrolyzed]] into GABA and niacin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://picamilon.org/|title=Technical Description of Picamilon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The released GABA in theory would activate [[GABA receptor]]s potentially producing an [[anxiolytic]] response.&lt;ref name="pmid2884549"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shephard RA | title = Behavioral effects of GABA agonists in relation to anxiety and benzodiazepine action | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 40 | issue = 25 | pages = 2429–36 | date = Jun 1987 | pmid = 2884549 | doi = 10.1016/0024-3205(87)90758-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second released component, [[niacin]], is a [[vasodilator]].&lt;ref name="pmid17705685"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gille A, Bodor ET, Ahmed K, Offermanns S | title = Nicotinic acid: pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 48 | issue =  | pages = 79–106 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17705685 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.48.113006.094746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15673472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prousky J, Seely D | title = The treatment of migraines and tension-type headaches with intravenous and oral niacin (nicotinic acid): systematic review of the literature | journal = Nutrition Journal | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15673472 | pmc = 548511 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2891-4-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection in biological fluids ==
Plasma picamilon concentrations are generally in the 500–3000 ''μ''g/L range during the first few hours after single oral doses of 50–200&amp;nbsp;mg with a [[half-life]] of 1–2 hours.&lt;ref name="cui"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui W, Chen X, Zhan Y, Zhang Z, Zhang Y, Zhong D | title = Determination of picamilon concentration in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry | journal = Journal of Chromatography B | volume = 878 | issue = 15-16 | pages = 1181–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20359966 | doi = 10.1016/j.jchromb.2010.03.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug undergoes hydrolysis to GABA and nicotinic acid. Urinary excretion of parent drug and the two metabolites accounts for up to 79% of a single dose.&lt;ref name="cui"/&gt;

[[File:Picamilon.jpg|thumb|alt=Picamilon|Picamilon 20 mg from Russia]]

== Regulation ==
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ruled in 2015 that picamilon does not fit any of the dietary ingredient categories in the [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]],&lt;ref name="nutra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Welch | first1 = Cara| name-list-format = vanc | title = Declaration of Dr. Cara Welch|url=https://blog.priceplow.com/wp-content/uploads/Picamilon-FDA_Ruling-20150928.pdf|publisher=Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely that it is not a [[vitamin]]; a [[dietary mineral]]; an [[herb]] or other [[botanical]]; an [[amino acid]]; a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above. This led to the removal of picamilon as a pure substance or from various supplements manufactured in the US.&lt;ref name="nutra"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Roberto | first1 = Mike | name-list-format = vanc | title = Picamilon Under FDA Attack | url = https://blog.priceplow.com/supplement-news/picamilon-fda|website=PricePlow | accessdate = 21 October 2015 | date = 13 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''placenta''' is a temporary [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] that connects the developing [[fetus]] via the [[umbilical cord]] to the [[Uterus|uterine]] wall to allow nutrient uptake, thermo-regulation, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply; to fight against internal infection; and to produce hormones which support pregnancy. Placentas are a defining characteristic of [[placental mammal]]s, but are also found in [[marsupials]] and some non-mammals with varying levels of development.&lt;ref name="Pou92"&gt;Pough ''et al.'' 1992. Herpetology: Third Edition. Pearson Prentice Hall:Pearson Education, Inc., 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The placenta functions as a fetomaternal organ with two components:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wishingclover.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-getting-know-placenta/#How_is_placenta_formed|title=How is Placenta Formed|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107060620/https://wishingclover.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-getting-know-placenta/#How_is_placenta_formed|archivedate=2017-11-07|deadurl=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''fetal placenta''' ([[Chorion frondosum]]), which develops from the same [[blastocyst]] that forms the fetus, and the '''maternal placenta''' ([[Decidua basalis]]), which develops from the maternal uterine tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/maternal+placenta Definitions of placental- related terms.]&lt;/ref&gt; It metabolizes a number of substances and can release metabolic products into maternal or fetal circulations. The placenta is expelled from the body upon [[birth]] of the fetus.

The word ''placenta''  comes from the [[Latin]] word for a type of [[placenta cake|cake]], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πλακόεντα/πλακοῦντα ''plakóenta/plakoúnta'', accusative of πλακόεις/πλακούς ''plakóeis/plakoús'', "flat, slab-like",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383445 Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405162717/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2383445 |date=2012-04-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=placenta "placenta"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130235904/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=placenta |date=2016-01-30 }}. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to its round, flat appearance in humans. The classical plural is ''placentae'', but the form ''placentas'' is common in modern English and probably has the wider currency at present.

==Structure==
Placental mammals, such as humans, have a chorioallantoic placenta that forms from the [[chorion]] and [[allantois]]. In humans, the placenta averages 22&amp;nbsp;cm (9&amp;nbsp;inch) in length and 2–2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.8–1&amp;nbsp;inch) in thickness, with the center being the thickest, and the edges being the thinnest. It typically weighs approximately 500&amp;nbsp;grams (just over 1&amp;nbsp;lb).  It has a dark reddish-blue or crimson color. It connects to the fetus by an [[umbilical cord]] of approximately 55–60&amp;nbsp;cm (22–24&amp;nbsp;inch) in length, which contains two [[umbilical artery|umbilical arteries]] and one [[umbilical vein]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/afp/980301ap/yetter.html Examination of the placenta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016175756/http://www.aafp.org/afp/980301ap/yetter.html |date=2011-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The umbilical cord inserts into the [[chorionic plate]] (has an eccentric attachment). Vessels branch out over the surface of the placenta and further divide to form a network covered by a thin layer of cells. This results in the formation of villous tree structures. On the maternal side, these villous tree structures are grouped into lobules called [[Cotyledon (placenta)|cotyledon]]s. In humans, the placenta usually has a disc shape, but size varies vastly between different mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/placenta/structure.html Placental Structure and Classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211110831/http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/reprod/placenta/structure.html |date=2016-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The placenta occasionally takes a form in which it comprises several distinct parts connected by blood vessels.&lt;ref name="pmid_5429965"&gt;{{Citation |last=Fujikura |first=Toshio |last2=Benson |first2=Ralph C |last3=Driscoll |first3=Shirley G |display-authors=etal |year=1970 |title=The bipartite placenta and its clinical features |journal= American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=107 |issue=7 |pages=1013–1017 |pmid=5429965 |doi=10.1016/0002-9378(70)90621-6 |quote=Bipartite placenta represented 4.2 per cent (366 of 8,505) of placentas of white women at the Boston Hospital for Women who were enrolled in the Collaborative Project. |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parts, called lobes, may number two, three, four, or more. Such placentas are described as bilobed/bilobular/bipartite, trilobed/trilobular/tripartite, and so on. If there is a clearly discernible main lobe and auxiliary lobe, the latter is called a succenturiate placenta. Sometimes the blood vessels connecting the lobes get in the way of fetal presentation during [[childbirth|labor]], which is called [[vasa praevia|vasa previa]].

=== Gene and protein expression ===

==Physiology==

===Development===
[[File:Placenta.png|thumb|Placenta]]
[[File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg|thumb|300px|The initial stages of [[human embryogenesis]].]]
{{Further|Placentation}}
The placenta begins to develop upon implantation of the [[blastocyst]] into the maternal [[endometrium]]. The outer layer of the blastocyst becomes the [[trophoblast]], which forms the outer layer of the placenta. This outer layer is divided into two further layers: the underlying cytotrophoblast layer and the overlying [[syncytiotrophoblast]] layer. The syncytiotrophoblast is a [[multinucleate]]d continuous cell layer that covers the surface of the placenta. It forms as a result of differentiation and fusion of the underlying [[cytotrophoblast]] cells, a process that continues throughout placental development. The syncytiotrophoblast (otherwise known as [[syncytium]]), thereby contributes to the barrier function of the placenta.

The placenta grows throughout [[pregnancy]]. Development of the maternal blood supply to the placenta is complete by the end of the first trimester of pregnancy week 14 (DM).

===Placental circulation===
[[File:Gray39.png|thumb|Maternal blood fills the [[intervillous space]], nutrients, water, and gases are actively and passively exchanged, then deoxygenated blood is displaced by the next maternal pulse.]]

====Maternal placental circulation====
In preparation for implantation of the blastocyst, the uterine endometrium undergoes "decidualisation". [[Spiral arteries]] in decidua are remodeled so that they become less convoluted and their diameter is increased. The increased diameter and straighter flow path both act to increase maternal blood flow to the placenta. There is relatively high pressure as the maternal blood fills [[intervillous space]] through these spiral arteries bathes the fetal [[Chorionic villi|villi]] in blood, allowing an exchange of gases to take place. In humans and other hemochorial placentals, the maternal blood comes into direct contact with the fetal [[chorion]], though no fluid is exchanged. As the pressure decreases between [[pulse]]s, the deoxygenated blood flows back through the endometrial veins.

Maternal blood flow is approximately 600–700&amp;nbsp;ml/min at term.

This begins at day 5 - day 12 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams book of obstretics|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fetoplacental circulation====
{{Further|Fetal circulation}}
Deoxygenated fetal blood passes through [[umbilical arteries]] to the placenta. At the junction of umbilical cord and placenta, the umbilical arteries branch radially to form [[chorionic arteries]]. Chorionic arteries, in turn, branch into [[cotyledon arteries]]. In the villi, these vessels eventually branch to form an extensive arterio-capillary-venous system, bringing the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood; but no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood occurs ("placental barrier").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/fplacenta/circulplac01.html#placentaire Placental blood circulation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928163956/http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/fplacenta/circulplac01.html |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endothelin]] and [[prostanoid]]s cause [[vasoconstriction]] in placental arteries, while [[nitric oxide]] causes [[vasodilation]].&lt;ref name=kiserud2004/&gt; On the other hand, there is no neural vascular regulation, and catecholamines have only little effect.&lt;ref name=kiserud2004&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kiserud T, Acharya G | title = The fetal circulation | journal = Prenatal Diagnosis | volume = 24 | issue = 13 | pages = 1049–1059 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15614842 | doi = 10.1002/pd.1062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fetoplacental circulation is vulnerable to persistent hypoxia or intermittent hypoxia and reoxygenation, which can lead to generation of excessive [[free radical]]s. This may contribute to [[pre-eclampsia]] and other [[pregnancy complications]].&lt;ref name="ReiterTan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiter|first1=R. J.|last2=Tan|first2=D.

This begins at day 17 - day 22 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams book of obsteritcis|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth===
{{Main|Placental expulsion}}
[[Placental expulsion]] begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The period from just after the child is born until just after the placenta is expelled is called the "third stage of labor". The placenta is usually expelled within 15–30&amp;nbsp;minutes of birth.

Placental expulsion can be managed actively, for example by giving [[oxytocin]] via intramuscular injection followed by cord traction to assist in delivering the placenta. Alternatively, it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Blood loss and the risk of [[postpartum bleeding]] may be reduced in women offered active management of the third stage of labour, however there may be adverse effects and more research is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Begley|first=Cecily M.|last2=Gyte|first2=Gillian M. L.|last3=Devane|first3=Declan|last4=McGuire|first4=William|last5=Weeks|first5=Andrew|date=2015-03-02|title=Active versus expectant management for women in the third stage of labour|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=3|pages=CD007412|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007412.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25730178|via=|pmc=4026059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The habit is to cut the cord immediately after birth, but it is theorised that there is no medical reason to do this; on the contrary, it is theorized that not cutting the cord helps the baby in its [[adaptation to extrauterine life]], especially in preterm infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mercer JS, Vohr BR, Erickson-Owens DA, Padbury JF, Oh W |title=Seven-month developmental outcomes of very low birth weight infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of delayed versus immediate cord clamping |journal=Journal of Perinatology |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=11–6 |year=2010 |pmid=19847185 |pmc=2799542 |doi=10.1038/jp.2009.170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbiome===
{{main|Placental microbiome}}
The placenta is traditionally thought to be [[Asepsis|sterile]], but recent research suggests that a resident, [[Nonpathogenic organisms|non-pathogenic]], and diverse population of [[microorganisms]] may be present in healthy tissue. However, whether these microbes exist or are clinically important is highly controversial and is the subject of active research.&lt;ref name="Per2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perez-Muñoz|first1=Maria Elisa|last2=Arrieta|first2=Marie-Claire|last3=Ramer-Tait|first3=Amanda E.|last4=Walter|first4=Jens|title=A critical assessment of the "sterile womb" and "in utero colonization" hypotheses: implications for research on the pioneer infant icrobiome|journal=Microbiome|volume=5|issue=1|year=2017|issn=2049-2618|doi=10.1186/s40168-017-0268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorKwon2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mor|first1=Gil|last2=Kwon|first2=Ja-Young|title=Trophoblast-microbiome interaction: a new paradigm on immune regulation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=213|issue=4|year=2015|pages=S131–S137|issn=0002-9378|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.06.039| pmid=26428492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrinceAntony2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prince|first1=Amanda L.|last2=Antony|first2=Kathleen M.|last3=Chu|first3=Derrick M.|last4=Aagaard|first4=Kjersti M.|title=The microbiome, parturition, and timing of birth: more questions than answers|journal=Journal of ReproductiveImmunology|volume=104–105|year=2014|pages=12–19|issn=0165-0378|doi=10.1016/j.jri.2014.03.006|pmid=24793619|pmc=4157949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hornef|first=M|last2=Penders|first2=J|date=2017|title=Does a prenatal bacterial microbiota exist?|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/mi.2016.141|journal=Mucosal Immunology|language=En|volume=10|issue=3|pages=598–601|doi=10.1038/mi.2016.141|pmid=28120852|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

===Nutrition===
[[File:Human placenta 01.JPG|thumb|Maternal side of a placenta shortly after birth.]]
The placenta intermediates the transfer of nutrients between mother and fetus. The perfusion of the intervillous spaces of the placenta with maternal blood allows the transfer of nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus and the transfer of waste products and [[Carbon dioxide#Human physiology|carbon dioxide]] back from the fetus to the maternal blood. Nutrient transfer to the fetus can occur via both [[Active transport|active]] and [[passive transport]].&lt;ref name="Kay2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Placenta: From Development to Disease|vauthors = Wright C,Sibley CP|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444333664|veditors = Kay H, Nelson M, Yuping W|pages=66|chapter=Placental Transfer in Health and Disease}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placental nutrient metabolism was found to play a key role in limiting the transfer of some nutrients.&lt;ref name="pmid27913585"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perazzolo S, Hirschmugl B, Wadsack C, Desoye G, Lewis RM, Sengers BG | title = The influence of placental metabolism on fatty acid transfer to the fetus | journal = J.

===Excretion===
Waste products excreted from the fetus such as [[urea]], [[uric acid]], and [[creatinine]] are transferred to the maternal blood by [[diffusion]] across the placenta.

===Immunity===
[[IgG antibodies]] can pass through the human placenta, thereby providing protection to the fetus ''in utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Simister N. E., Story C. M. | year = 1997 | title = Human placental Fc receptors and the transmission of antibodies from mother to fetus | url = | journal = Journal of Reproductive Immunology | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 1–23 | pmid = 9501287 | doi=10.1016/s0165-0378(97)00068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of antibodies begins as early as the 20th week of gestational age, and certainly by the 24th week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=apeLf0mPx1QC&amp;pg=PA202 Page 202] in: {{cite book |author=Pillitteri, Adele |title=Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstwon, MD |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-58255-999-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passive immunity lingers for several months after birth, thus providing the newborn with a carbon copy of the mother's long-term [[humoral immunity]] to see the infant through the crucial first months of extrauterine life. [[IgM]], however, cannot cross the placenta, which is why some infections acquired ''during'' pregnancy can be hazardous for the fetus.

Furthermore, the placenta functions as a selective maternal-fetal barrier against transmission of [[microbe]]s. However, insufficiency in this function may still cause [[mother-to-child transmission]] of infectious diseases.

===Endocrine function===
* The first hormone released by the placenta is called the [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] hormone. This is responsible for stopping the process at the end of menses when the [[Corpus luteum]] ceases activity and atrophies. If hCG did not interrupt this process, it would lead to spontaneous abortion of the fetus. The corpus luteum also produces and releases [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]], and hCG stimulates it to increase the amount that it releases. hCG is the indicator of pregnancy that pregnancy tests look for. These tests will work when menses has not occurred or after implantation has happened on days seven to ten. hCG may also have an anti-antibody effect, protecting it from being rejected by the mother’s body. hCG also assists the male fetus by stimulating the testes to produce testosterone, which is the hormone needed to allow the sex organs of the male to grow.
* [[Progesterone]] helps the embryo implant by assisting passage through the fallopian tubes. It also affects the [[Fallopian tube|fallopian]] tubes and the [[uterus]] by stimulating an increase in secretions necessary for fetal nutrition. Progesterone, like hCG, is necessary to prevent spontaneous abortion because it prevents contractions of the uterus, and is necessary for implantation.
* [[Estrogen]] is a crucial hormone in the process of proliferation. This involves the enlargement of the breasts and uterus, allowing for growth of the fetus and production of milk. Estrogen is also responsible for increased blood supply towards the end of pregnancy through [[vasodilation]]. The levels of estrogen during pregnancy can increase so that they are thirty times what a non-pregnant woman mid-cycles estrogen level would be.
* [[Human placental lactogen]] is a hormone used in pregnancy to develop fetal metabolism and general growth and development. Human placental lactogen works with [[Growth hormone]] to stimulate [[Insulin-like growth factor]] production and regulating intermediary metabolism. In the fetus, hPL acts on lactogenic receptors to modulate embryonic development, metabolism and stimulate production of IGF, [[insulin]], surfactant and [[Adrenocortical hormone|adrenocortical]] hormones. hPL values increase with multiple pregnancies, intact molar pregnancy, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and [[Rh incompatibility]]. They are decreased with [[Toxemia of pregnancy|toxemia]], [[choriocarcinoma]], and [[Placental insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handwerger S, Freemark M |title=The roles of placental growth hormone and placental lactogen in the regulation of human fetal growth and development |journal=Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=343–56 |year=2000 |pmid=10776988 |doi=10.1515/jpem.2000.13.4.343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucsfhealth, 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Placental Lactogen|url=https://www.ucsfhealth.org/tests/003915.html|website=www.ucsfhealth.org|accessdate=July 21, 2017|language=en|date=May 17, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429050115/https://www.ucsfhealth.org/tests/003915.html|archivedate=April 29, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloaking from immune system of mother===
{{Further|Immune tolerance in pregnancy}}
The placenta and fetus may be regarded as a foreign [[allotransplantation|allograft]] inside the mother, and thus must evade from attack by the mother's [[immune system]].

For this purpose, the placenta uses several mechanisms:
*It secretes [[Neurokinin&amp;nbsp;B]]-containing [[phosphocholine]] molecules. This is the same mechanism used by [[parasitic]] [[nematode]]s to avoid detection by the immune system of their [[host (biology)|host]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Placenta 'fools body's defences'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7081298.stm|date=10 November 2007|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/677CWy9QF?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7081298.stm|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There is presence of small lymphocytic suppressor cells in the fetus that inhibit maternal [[cytotoxic T&amp;nbsp;cell]]s by inhibiting the response to [[interleukin&amp;nbsp;2]].&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clark DA, Chaput A, Tutton D | title = Active suppression of host-vs-graft reaction in pregnant mice.

Immunol. | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1668–75 | date = March 1986 | pmid = 2936806 | doi =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Placental barrier is not the sole means to evade the immune system, as foreign fetal cells also persist in the maternal circulation, on the other side of the placental barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams Z, Zepf D, Longtine J, Anchan R, Broadman B, Missmer SA, Hornstein MD | title = Foreign fetal cells persist in the maternal circulation | journal = Fertil.

===Other===
The placenta also provides a reservoir of blood for the fetus, delivering blood to it in case of hypotension and vice versa, comparable to a [[capacitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Assad RS, Lee FY, Hanley FL | title = Placental compliance during fetal extracorporeal circulation | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 90 | issue = 5 | pages = 1882–1886 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11299282 | doi=10.1152/jappl.2001.90.5.1882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CMV placentitis1 mini.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Micrograph]] of a [[cytomegalovirus|cytomegalovirus (CMV)]] infection of the placenta (CMV [[placentitis]]). The characteristic large [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a CMV-infected [[cell (biology)|cell]] is seen off-centre at the bottom-right of the image. [[H&amp;E&amp;nbsp;stain]].]]
Numerous pathologies can affect the placenta.

* [[Placenta accreta]], when the placenta implants too deeply, all the way to the actual muscle of uterine wall (without penetrating it)
* [[Placenta praevia]], when the placement of the placenta is too close to or blocks the [[cervix]]
* [[Placental abruption]]/abruptio placentae, premature detachment of the placenta

Infections involving the placenta:
* Placentitis, such as the [[TORCH infections]].
* [[Chorioamnionitis]].

==Society and culture==

The placenta is believed by some communities to have power over the lives of the baby or its parents. The [[Kwakiutl]] of [[British Columbia]] bury girls' placentas to give the girl skill in digging clams, and expose boys' placentas to [[raven]]s to encourage future [[prophet]]ic visions. In [[Turkey]], the proper disposal of the placenta and umbilical cord is believed to promote devoutness in the child later in life. In [[Ukraine]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Japan]], interaction with a disposed placenta is thought to influence the parents' future fertility.

Several cultures believe the placenta to be or have been alive, often a relative of the baby. [[Nepal]]ese think of the placenta as a friend of the baby; Malaysian [[Orang Asli]] regard it as the baby's older sibling.&lt;ref name="mothering"/&gt; [[Native Hawaiians]] believe that the placenta is a part of the baby, and traditionally plant it with a tree that can then grow alongside the child.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;  Various cultures in [[Indonesia]], such as [[Javanese people|Javanese]], believe that the placenta has a spirit and needs to be buried outside the family house.

In some cultures, the placenta is eaten, a practice known as [[placentophagy]]. In some eastern cultures, such as [[China]], the dried placenta (''ziheche'' {{linktext|紫|河|車}}, literally "purple river cart") is thought to be a healthful restorative and is sometimes used in preparations of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and various health products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/eatplcnt.html|title=Medicinal Uses of the Placenta|last=Falcao|first=Ronnie|accessdate=25 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205030123/http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/eatplcnt.html|archivedate=5 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of [[human placentophagy]] has become a more recent trend in western cultures and is not without [[Human placentophagy#Controversy|controversy]]; its practice being considered [[cannibalism]] is debated.

Some cultures have [[alternative uses for placenta]] that include the manufacturing of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food.

According to the American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA), '''recreational therapy''' or '''therapeutic recreation''' ('''TR''') is a systematic process that utilizes recreation ([[leisure]]) and other interest activities as interventions to address the assessed needs of individuals with illnesses and/or disabling conditions, as a means to psychological and physical health, recovery and [[well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atra-online.com/displaycommon.cfm?an=12 What is TR? American Therapeutic Recreation Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Recreational therapy may also be simply referred to as ''recreation therapy'', in short it is the utilization and enhancement of leisure.&lt;ref&gt;http://cph.temple.edu/rs/therapeutic-recreation/what-therapeutic-recreation&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of recreational therapists differ from other professionals on the basis of using leisure activities alone to meet well-being goals, they work with clients to enhance motor, social and cognitive functioning, build confidence, develop coping skills, and integrate skills learned in treatment settings into community settings. Intervention areas vary widely and are based upon enjoyable and rewarding interests of the client. Examples of intervention modalities include creative arts (e.g., crafts, music, dance, drama, among others), games, sports like adventure programming, exercises like dance/movement, and skill enhancement activities (Motor, locomotion, sensory, cognition, communication, and behavior).

== Approaches ==

There are four approaches in therapeutic recreation:
* '''Recreation services''': Providing recreation services to people with disabilities for experiencing leisure and its benefits, often this takes a rehabilitation tone in approach for helping clients to reach an optimal level of health and well-being.
* '''Therapeutic approach''': The purpose of this approach is curative in nature. It attempts to lessen and ameliorate the effects of illness' and disabilities, it also can be prescriptive for improving certain functional capacities.
* '''Umbrella or combined approach''': Use of recreation as a subjective continuation of enjoyable activities as well as a recreation service for bringing purposeful change.
* '''Leisure ability approach''': An approach that operates leisure activities therapeutically and engages the clients fully for participation with good dissemination on the benefits of structured leisure/ leisure awareness education (Gun &amp; Peterson, 1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Kunstler|author2=Frances Stavola Daly|title=Therapeutic Recreation Leadership and Programming|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5e-ZAm-omZEC&amp;pg=PA29|year=2010|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6855-0|pages=29-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight domains of leisure are: leisure awareness, leisure attitudes, leisure skills, community integration skills, community participation, cultural and social behaviors, interpersonal skills.

== Educational programs ==

A [[bachelor's degree]] in recreational therapy is required for most entry-level positions. These programs typically cover areas such as treatment and program planning, [[human body]], [[physiology]], [[kinesiology]], and [[professional ethics]]. Some programs offer the opportunity to specialize in [[occupational therapy]], and in the intervention of those that are mentally or physically challenged. Most employers prefer to hire candidates who are Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists (CTRS). Therapists become certified through the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) or through a provincial regulatory body such as, Therapeutic Recreation Ontario (TRO). To qualify for [[certification]] under the Academic Path, applicants must have a bachelor's degree in TR, complete an [[internship]] under the supervision of a CTRS, and pass a written exam. There is also an Equivalency Path A and B for certification. The requirements are slightly different and include a bachelor's degree outside of TR, paid work experience, and successful completion of the written exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctrc.org/newapplication.htm#equivalency NCTRC Certification Paths A and B]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuing Education ===
Recreation Therapists with the Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist (CTRS) credential are required to complete 50 clock hours (5.0 CEUs) of continuing education within a 5 year span as part of the overall requirements to renew national certification through [http://www.NCTRC.org NCTRC]. 

NCTRC has outlined several ways a CTRS can earn continuing education [http://nctrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MM7-continuing-education-information1.pdf Continuing Education]. 

These include:  

a.) '''Academic Courses'''

b.) '''Teleconferences/Audio Seminars''' like [https://www.atra-online.org ATRA]'s webinar series.  

c.) '''Internet Course Programs''': Some online programs identified are on the Therapeutic Recreation Directory website: [https://www.recreationtherapy.com/ceu.htm Therapeutic Recreation Directory: CEU Opportunities]. These include websites like [http://www.smartceushub.com SMART CEUs Hub: Success Makers Are Rec Therapists] and [http://www.dannypettry.com DannyPettry.com]

d.) '''Conferences''': American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA) and state branches of ATRA. Recreation therapists can attend conferences provided by related professional organizations and earn CEUs (pending the session meets Therapeutic Recreation (TR) knowledge areas required by NCTRC. 

e.) '''Internships &amp; Externships''': Supervised guidance to practice.

== Professional organizations ==

The American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA)&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.atra-online.com American Therapeutic Recreation Association (ATRA)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Canadian Therapeutic Recreation Association (CTRA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadian-tr.org Canadian Therapeutic Recreation Association (CTRA)]&lt;/ref&gt; are the largest national membership organizations representing the interests and needs of recreational therapists in the U. S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atra-online.com American Therapeutic Recreation Association] [http://www.canadian-tr.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Credentialing ==

Certification:
The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctrc.org/ National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; a charter member of the [[National Organization for Competency Assurance]] (NOCA), also provides a certification that expires after 5 years. Those who are certified must apply for re-certification at the end of the expiration period. Specialty certification is now available in 5 areas. Health and human service professionals who acquire a higher level of knowledge and more advanced skills provide the consumer with a greater depth of service compared to individuals who practice at less advanced levels. Specialization is well recognized within professional practice and has become the norm within the health and human service delivery system today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nctrc.org/SpecCert.htm CTRS Specialty Certification: The Purpose of Specialty Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; The median salary for recreational therapists in the United States was estimated $44,839 a year in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.salary.com/Recreational-Therapist-Salary.html Average salary for recreational therapists - Salary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This number may vary slightly based on specific geographic region, years of experience, and type of employing agency.

Licensure:
There are currently four states with Recreational Therapy licensure (Utah, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/recreational-therapists.htm#tab-4] &lt;/ref&gt;. To practice Recreational Therapy in these states, professionals must possess a current, valid state license. In addition to the four currently licensed states, numerous other states are currently moving toward developing licensure. Through the Joint Task Force on Recreational Therapy Licensure sponsored by the American Therapeutic Recreation Association and the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification, significant progress is being made in the licensure arena. Licensure is being pursued by the profession as a further means of protecting the public from potential harm.

In fresh eggs, only a few salmonellae are present. As albumen is an iron-restricted environment, growth only occurs with storage-related changes to vitelline membrane permeability, which allows salmonellae to invade yolk contents.|accessdate=2010-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
The United States has struggled to control salmonella infections, with the rate of infection rising from 2001 to 2011. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] have separate jurisdiction over products which may be contaminated with salmonella, but the rules defining which agency inspects what is complex and difficult to summarize; for example, the FDA inspects shelled eggs while the USDA oversees egg products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/12/who-inspects-what-a-food-safety-scramble/#.V97O-pMrKRs|title=Who Inspects What? A Food Safety Scramble {{!}} Food Safety News|date=2010-12-16|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the USDA moved to close plants if salmonella was found in excess of 20 percent, which was the industry’s average at the time, for three consecutive tests.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foodsafety.news21.com/2011/risks/salmonella/|title=Salmonella Lurks From Farm to Fork  «  News21 2011 National Project|website=foodsafety.news21.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas-based Supreme Beef Processors, Inc. sued on the argument that Salmonella is naturally occurring and ultimately prevailed when a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These issues were highlighted in a proposed [[Kevin's Law]] (formally proposed as the Meat and Poultry Pathogen Reduction and Enforcement Act of 2003), of which components were included the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act|Food Safety Modernization Act]] passed in 2011, but that law applies only to the FDA and not the USDA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The USDA proposed a regulatory initiative in 2011 to [[Office of Management and Budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/08/ground-turkey-recall-shows-we-still-need-kevins-law/#.V97IVpMrKRt|title=Ground Turkey Recall Shows We Still Need Kevin's Law {{!}} Food Safety News|date=2011-08-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the USDA proposed to increase the line speed and reduce the number of inspectors of chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/07/usda-defends-poultry-rules_n_1751269.html|title=USDA Defends Controversial Measure To Speed Up Poultry Inspection Lines|date=2012-08-07|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) rules ===
In 1996, the USDA [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] finalized rules which required slaughter and processing plants to adopt [[Hazard analysis and critical control points|Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point]] rules, which included performance standards for acceptable percentage testing positive of salmonella. These included 20% for broilers (chickens), 8.7% for swine, and 7.5% for ground beef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Oa/background/salmtest4.htm|title=Progress Report on Salmonella Testing of Raw Meat and Poultry Products|website=www.fsis.usda.gov|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, updated performance standards went into effect, reducing the salmonella prevalence to 7.5%; however, meeting these standards was not strictly required for operation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2011/03/tougher-usda-standards-poultry-pathogens-take-effect|title=Tougher USDA standards for poultry pathogens to take effect|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants not meeting the requirement were publicized online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agency originally began publishing the names of problem plants in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2008/04/usda-names-chicken-plants-salmonella-problems|title=USDA names chicken plants with Salmonella problems|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry commentary ===
In a 2013 fact sheet, the [[National Chicken Council]] observed that although salmonella on raw chicken has signfiicantly declined, salmonellosis has not significantly declined, suggesting that salmonellosis infections have another cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/fact-sheet-salmonella/|title=FACT SHEET: Salmonella - The National Chicken Council|date=2013-06-28|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
About 142,000 people in the United States are infected each year with ''[[Salmonella enterica enterica|Salmonella]]'' Enteritidis from chicken eggs, and about 30 die.&lt;ref name="Was20092"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/07/AR2009070702343.html?hpid=topnews|title=Administration Urged to Boost Food Safety Efforts|last1=Black|first1=Jane|date=2009-07-08|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=2009-07-07|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|quote=Among them is a final rule, issued by the FDA, to reduce the contamination in eggs. About 142,000 Americans are infected each year with ''Salmonella'' enteritidis from eggs, the result of an infected hen passing along the bacterium. About 30 die.|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, an analysis of death certificates in the United States identified a total of 1,316 ''Salmonella''-related deaths from 1990 to 2006. These were predominantly among older adults and those who were immunocompromised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cummings|first=PL|date=November 2010|title=Salmonellosis-related mortality in the United States, 1990–2006|journal=Foodborne Pathogens and Disease|volume=7|issue=11|pages=1393–9|doi=10.1089/fpd.2010.0588|pmid=20617938|author2=Sorvillo F|author3=Kuo T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before 2006 ===
The U.S. government reported as many as 20% of all chickens were contaminated with ''Salmonella'' in the late 1990s, and 16.3% were contaminated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/dining/08well.html?ex=1179288000&amp;en=1f7944fcd0d6fc64&amp;ei=5070|title=More Salmonella Is Reported in Chickens|last=Burros|first=Marian|date=March 8, 2006|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid- to late 20th century, ''Salmonella enterica'' serovar Enteritidis was a common contaminant of eggs. This is much less common now with the advent of hygiene measures in egg production, and the vaccination of laying hens to prevent ''Salmonella'' colonization. Various ''Salmonella'' [[serovar]]s (strains) also cause severe diseases in animals.

=== 2007 ===
In February 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to consumers not to eat certain jars of [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan]] or Great Value peanut butter, due to risk of contamination with ''Salmonella'' Tennessee.[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01563.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

In March 2007, around 150 people were diagnosed with salmonellosis after eating tainted food at a governor's reception in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. Over 1,500 people attended the ball on March 1, and fell ill as a consequence of ingesting ''Salmonella''-tainted sandwiches.

About 150 people were sickened by ''Salmonella''-tainted chocolate cake produced by a major bakery chain in Singapore, in December 2007.[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/316110/1/.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[2]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

=== 2008 ===
{{Main article|2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak}}From April 10, 2008 to July 8, 2008, the rare Saintpaul [[Serovar|serotype]] of ''S. enteritidis'' caused at least 1017 cases of salmonellosis in 41 states throughout the United States, the District of Columbia, and Canada. As of July 2008, the U.S. FDA suspected the contaminated food product was a common ingredient in fresh salsa, such as raw tomato, fresh [[Jalapeño|jalapeño pepper]], fresh [[serrano pepper]], and fresh [[Coriander|cilantro]]. It is the largest reported salmonellosis outbreak in the United States since 1985. New Mexico and Texas have been proportionally the hardest hit by far, with 49.7 and 16.1 reported cases per million, respectively. The greatest number of reported cases have occurred in Texas (384), New Mexico (98), Illinois (100), and Arizona (49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/saintpaul/map.html|title=Cases infected with the outbreak strain of ''Salmonella'' Saintpaul, United States, by state}} For some states, such as California, the CDC has recently revised the tally of identified illness downward.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 203 reported hospitalizations have been linked to the outbreak, it has caused at least one death, and it may have been a contributing factor in at least one additional death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/saintpaul/ August 8, 2008: Investigation of Outbreak of Infections Caused by ''Salmonella'' Saintpaul | Salmonella CDC&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] maintains "it is likely many more illnesses have occurred than those reported." If applying a previous CDC-estimated ratio of unreported salmonellosis cases to reported cases (38.6:1), an estimated 40,273 illnesses occurred from this outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2004-04-15|title=FoodNet Estimate of the Burden of Illness Caused by Nontyphoidal Salmonella Infections in the United States|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=38|pages=S127–S134|doi=10.1086/381578|author=Voetsch|display-authors=etal|pmid=15095181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 18 July 2008, the FDA removed raw tomatoes and cilantro as potential carriers; however, fresh jalapeño and serrano peppers still remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/07/17/fda.salmonella/index.html|title=FDA lifts warning on tomatoes|date=2008-07-18|work=CNN|author=Elizabeth Landau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008 and January 2009, several Midwestern states, including Ohio (officially confirmed by state authorities), reported an outbreak of salmonellosis from ''Salmonella typhimurium'' that had sickened at least 50 people, due to contaminated dairy products such as cheeses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

=== 2009 ===
{{Main article|Peanut Corporation of America}}On January 17, 2009, the FDA announced they had traced the source of an outbreak of ''Salmonella typhimurium'' to a plant in [[Blakely, Georgia]], owned by [[Peanut Corporation of America]] (PCA), and urged people to postpone eating commercially prepared or manufactured peanut butter-containing products and institutionally served peanut butter.&lt;ref name="fda-hottopic"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/salmonellatyph.html Recall of Products Containing Peanut Butter: ''Salmonella'' Typhimurium], [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salmonella'' was reported to be found in 46 states in the United States in at least 3,862 peanut butter-based products, such as crackers, energy bars, and peanut butter cookies from at least 343 food companies. Dog treats were affected, as well. At least 691 people in more than 46 states became sick, and the ''Salmonella'' claimed at least 9 lives as of March 25.&lt;ref name="fdaupdate"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/salmonellatyph.html Recall of Peanut-Containing Products: ''Salmonella Typhimurium'' (Current Update)], U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cdcupdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhimurium/update.html|title=Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium Infections Linked to Peanut Butter, 2008-2009 (FINAL UPDATE)    - Salmonella - CDC|work=cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE50F7GH20090119|title=More peanut products recalled, U.S. probe continues|date=2009-01-19|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28749159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/health/27peanuts.html?ref=health|title=Peanut Plant Had History of Health Lapses|date=2009-01-27|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peanut butter and peanut paste manufactured by PCA were distributed to hundreds of firms for use as an ingredient in thousands of different products, such as cookies, crackers, cereal, candy, and ice cream, all of which were recalled. Some products were also sold directly to consumers in retail outlets, such as dollar stores.&lt;ref name="fda-hottopic" /&gt;

On March 14, 2009, expressing his own personal concern for the safety of his children who enjoy peanut butter, President Obama announced the establishment of the Food Safety Working Group, "an inter-agency effort to help overhaul the oversight system." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2009|title=Salmonella outbreaks lead to food-safety changes|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-04-01-nuts-salmonella-food-safety_N.htm|author=Weise, Elizabeth|journal=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came days after the FDA, also responding, released its first "guidance" on dealing with ''Salmonella'' contamination.

=== 2012 ===
{{See also|2012 salmonella outbreak}}An outbreak of salmonellosis caused by a rarer subspecies, ''Salmonella bareilly'', was reported in multiple US states primarily on the East Coast. No deaths were reported, but many episodes of sickness and some hospitalizations were linked to the consumption of raw scraped ground tuna product.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/bareilly-04-12/index.html &lt;nowiki&gt;[3]&lt;/nowiki&gt;] "Multistate Outbreak of Salmonella Bareilly Infections Associated with a Raw Scraped Ground Tuna Product"&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''San Roque Lake''' is a [[reservoir]] (artificial lake) in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Córdoba Province (Argentina)|Córdoba]], [[Argentina]]. It was created by the [[dam]]ming of several rivers, especially the [[Primero River|Suquía]] and the [[Cosquín River|Cosquín]]. It is located next to the city of [[Villa Carlos Paz]], about 600 m [[above mean sea level]]. It has a surface area of 16&amp;nbsp;km², an average depth of 16 m, and a maximum volume of 180 million m³.

The dam was initially built to provide fresh water for the capital and its surroundings. It was designed in 1884 by the engineering firm of Cassaffousth, Bialet Massé and Dumesnil, finished in 1886, and inaugurated officially in 1890. Two years later the dam was suffering from a complete lack of maintenance, however, and a political scandal erupted.

The original dam was finally replaced by a newer one, located 150 m away, by an initiative of Governor [[Amadeo Sabattini]], and completed in 1944. The newer dam was built to contain and control larger rises in water levels. When the engineers tried to demolish the original dam, the dynamite only blew the metal railing. The new dam was therefore built several meters in front of the old one. When the level of the lake is low, the upper part of the old construction can be seen.

[[File:Dan Savage Provided.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dan Savage]] (2005)]]
'''Savage Love''' is a syndicated sex-[[advice column]] by [[Dan Savage]]. The column appears weekly in several dozen newspapers, mainly free newspapers in the US and Canada, but also newspapers in Europe and Asia. It started in 1991 with the first issue of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] weekly newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.

Since October 2006, Savage has also recorded the ''Savage Lovecast'', a weekly [[podcast]] version of the column, featuring telephone advice sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |title=Dan Savage |publisher=Podcasts.thestranger.com |accessdate=March 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206090407/http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/archives.php#a029910 |archivedate=December 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Podcasts are released every Tuesday.

Since 2002, he has written the column at [[Eppie Lederer]]'s desk, which he, a "lifelong fan" of her [[Ann Landers]] column, bought at auction after the noted advice columnist died.&lt;ref name="savage desk"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=12738 |title=Ann Advises On |date=December 5, 2002 |first=Dan |last=Savage |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1991, Savage was living in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and working as a manager at a local video store that specialized in independent film titles.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |title=GLBTQ Literature: Dan Savage |publisher=GLBTQ.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604104320/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/savage_d.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of ''[[The Onion]]'', who announced that he was moving to [[Seattle]] to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''.&lt;ref name="GLBTQ Bio" /&gt; Savage "made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: 'Make sure your paper has an advice column – everybody claims to hate 'em, but everybody seems to read 'em'."&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'' (New York: Plume, 1998), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He typed up a sample column, and to his surprise Keck offered him the job.&lt;ref name=AV-club&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/45150 Dan Savage interviewed by Tasha Robinson], ''The A.V. Club'', February 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, Introduction, ''Savage Love: Straight Answers from America's Most Popular Sex Columnist'', op. cit., pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in ''The Onion''{{'}}s ''[[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]]'' (which publishes his column) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were "clueless" when responding to letters from gay people.&lt;ref name=AV-club /&gt;

== Language ==
=== Recapture of offensive words ===
For the first six years of the column, Savage had his readers address him with "Hey, [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]", as a comment on previous efforts to [[Reclaimed word|recapture offensive words]]. He was criticized for this by some gay activists.

=== Neologisms ===
During the run of Savage Love, Savage has popularized several [[neologism]]s. He has also debunked several sexual neologisms for violent sex acts, including the "[[donkey punch]]", the "[[Pirate (sexual slang)|pirate]]" and the "[[Hot Karl (slang)|hot Karl]]", concluding "They're all fictions."&lt;ref name="savage2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=No Shit? |author=Dan Savage |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=20179&amp;mode=print |newspaper=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]] |date=December 23–29, 2004 |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Campsite rule ====
In any relationship, but particularly those with a large difference of age or experience between the partners, the older or more experienced partner has the responsibility to leave the younger or less experienced partner in at least as good a state (emotionally and physically) as before the relationship. The "campsite rule" includes things like leaving the younger or less experienced partner with no [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], no unwanted pregnancies, and not overburdening them with emotional and sexual baggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Q |first=Dan |title=Savage Love Readers Talk About the Campsite Rule |pages= |newspaper=Scatmania |location= |date=May 14, 2008 |url=http://www.scatmania.org/2008/05/14/campsite/ |accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tea and Sympathy rule ====
Shortly after a 2009 scandal in [[Portland, Oregon]], involving openly gay mayor [[Sam Adams (Oregon politician)|Sam Adams]] and Beau Breedlove, who had allegedly turned 18 almost immediately before the two began a sexual relationship, Savage created a companion rule to the "campsite rule", now known as the "Tea and Sympathy rule". The rule is a reference to a line in the [[Tea and Sympathy (play)|play of the same name]], in which a much older woman asks of a high-school-age boy, right before having sex with him: "Years from now, when you talk about this – and you will – be kind."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19kerr.html?pagewanted=print Deborah Kerr, Actress Known for Genteel Grace and a Sexy Beach Kiss, Dies at 86] – ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Savage claimed in an article in ''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' that, while Adams followed the "campsite rule" – Breedlove did not claim that Adams had given him any diseases or caused him emotional trauma, and in fact still refers to Adams as a friend – Breedlove violated the "Tea and Sympathy" rule by making public statements that he knew could ruin Adams's career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/the-tea-and-sympathy-rule/Content?oid=1089470 The Tea and Sympathy Rule] ''Portland Mercury''&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Monogamish ====
In a July 20, 2011 column, Savage coined the term "monogamish". The term describes couples who are perceived to be [[monogamy|monogamous]], who are "mostly" monogamous, but who are not 100% monogamous. Such couples have an understanding that allows for some amount of sexual contact outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=monogamish&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=9125045 |title=Savage Love: Monogamish |last=Savage |first=Dan |date= July 20, 2011 |work=The Stranger |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage believes that of all the couples people think are 100% monogamous, a lot of them are more "monogamish" than people realize. The term has since seen mainstream use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/2998792/satisfaction-monogamish-infidelity-married/ |title=Are You 'Monogamish'? A New Survey Says Lots of Couples Are |last=Luscombe |first=Belinda |date= July 17, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html |title=Married, with Infidelities |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark |date= June 3, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pegging ====
{{Main|Pegging (sexual practice)}}
In 2001, Savage challenged readers of his column to coin a name for the sex act in which a woman uses a strap-on [[dildo]] to perform [[anal sex]] on her male partner. After multiple nominations and a reader vote, the verb "[[pegging (sexual practice)|peg]]" was chosen, with a 43% [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] over runners-up "bob" and "punt".&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730 We Have a Winner!]. ''The Stranger'', June 21, 2001. Accessed April 7, 2013.&lt;!--See talk page for any thoughts.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Santorum ====
{{Main|Campaign for the neologism "santorum"|Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality}}
Savage reacted strongly to statements made about homosexuality by former [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Rick Santorum]] in an April 2003 interview with the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=USATodayApril232003&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm |title=Excerpt from Santorum interview |newspaper=USA Today |issn=0734-7456 |date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santorum included gay sex as a form of deviant sexual behavior, along with incest, [[polygamy]], and bestiality, that he said threatens society and the family; he said he believed consenting adults do not have a [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[right to privacy]] with respect to sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-04-23-santorum-excerpt_x.htm Excerpt from Santorum in an interview]: "...if the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, ... [y]ou have the right to anything. Does that undermine the fabric of our society? I would argue yes, it does.", ''[[USA Today]]'', April 23, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Savage invited his readers to create a sex-related definition for "santorum" to "memorialize the Santorum scandal [...] by attaching his name to a sex act that would make his big, white teeth fall out of his big, empty head."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14267 "Bill, Ashton, Rick"], ''The Stranger'', May 15, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The winning definition was "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex."&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Dan. [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14566 "Gas Huffer"], ''The Stranger'', June 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Savage set up a website to spread the term, inviting bloggers and others to link to it, which caused it to rise to the top of a Google search for Santorum's name.&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie. [http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage "Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem"], ''Mother Jones'', September/October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lifting luggage ====
{{anchor|Lifing Luggage|reason=Old, over-capitalized heading name, may be linked to.}}
Following the [[George Rekers#"Rent boy" allegations|"rent boy" allegations]] regarding [[George Rekers]], who has widely promoted [[aversion therapy]], Dan Savage, along with others including [[Stephen Colbert]],&lt;ref&gt;"Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party" {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/06/colbert-rips-anti-gay-act_n_565763.html| title =
Colbert Rips Anti-Gay Activist, Throws 'Rentboy' Dance Party |publisher=The Huffington Post | first=Dan| last=Abramson| date=May 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted the use of the idiom "to lift [some]one's luggage", meaning to supply sexual pleasure to, or derive it from, one's partner. This originated from Rekers who, when outed, insisted he had hired the escort only to assist him with lifting his luggage.&lt;ref name="timesonline"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article7117037.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first1=Giles | last1=Whittell |title=Baptist minister 'took ten-day holiday with male prostitute' |date=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rekers also claimed he "spent a great deal of time sharing scientific information on the desirability of abandoning homosexual intercourse" and "shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with him in great detail".&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;

Originally Savage suggested that "lifting my luggage" refer to listening to the speaker expound on the "desirability" of converting oneself from homosexual to heterosexual. Later, after several political humorists started employing "lifting your luggage" as an implicit or explicit reference to various sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;"'Lift My Luggage' Is the New 'Hiking the Appalachian Trail'" by Daniel Kurtzman {{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2010/05/06/lift-my-luggage-is-the-new-hiking-the-appalachian-trail.htm| title=About.com --Daniel Kurtzman's Political Humor Blog|accessdate=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savage suggested that "whatever lifts your luggage" supplant "whatever floats your boat" in common parlance.

==== Saddlebacking ====
In 2009, after a controversy involving the [[Saddleback Church]], the column defined "saddlebacking" as "the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex in order to preserve their virginities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=1031968|title=Savage Love|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Leotarded ====
After receiving criticism for use of the word "retarded"—considered by many to be an offensive slur against those with intellectual disabilities—Savage suggested "leotarded" as an alternative, because "leotard" rhymes with "retard".

=== Initialisations ===
==== GGG ====
Dan Savage coined the abbreviation "GGG".&lt;ref name="walczak"&gt;Ken Walczak, [http://www.good.is/posts/the-ggg-cocktail-a-non-vanilla-drink-inspired-by-dan-savage "The GGG Cocktail"], www.good.is, May 9, 2012 (accessed December 26, 2012) ("Dan is best known for two things: his advice that partners in any relationship strive to be Good, Giving, and Game (GGG) and ...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/09/12/science_proves_it_dan_savage_is_right/|title=Science proves it: Dan Savage is right|author=DebHerbenick|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands for "good, giving, and game", and it means one should strive to be ''good'' in bed, ''giving'' "equal time and equal pleasure" to one's partner, and ''game'' "for anything – within reason".&lt;ref name="Salon1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Savage, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=167448 Wrong &amp; Right], ''The Stranger'' March 1, 2007 (accessed December 26, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The term has inspired the "How GGG Are You? Test" on the popular Internet dating site [[OkCupid]], and the invention of a [[cocktail]].&lt;ref name="walczak" /&gt;

==== DTMFA ====
"Dump the mother-fucker already", used at a closing of a response to indicate that acting immediately to end the writer's abusive or worthless relationship is advised.

==== ITMFA ====
A reader of Savage Love suggested the initialisation ITMFA, a take on DTMFA, meaning "Impeach the Motherfucker Already!" The initialisation was coined in reference to the [[presidency of George W. Bush]] in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2017 in reaction to the [[presidency of Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/01/25/24822658/impeach-the-motherfucker-already|title=Impeach the Motherfucker Already!|work=The Stranger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CPOS ====
"Cheating piece of shit", said of a cheater, but usually reserved for one who is chronic or abusive/passive-aggressive about it.

==== HTH ====
"How'd that happen?", a mock-incredulous reply to those to who write in and say they had certain (often sexual) things "happen to" them, as if they had no part or say in the incident, when they clearly did.

=== Usage ===
Savage objected to use of the term "pussy" as an insult, saying that vaginas were wonderful, popping out babies, and proposed "[[scrotum]]", plural "scrota", as an insult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">The '''School Health Education Study''' (SHES) was a crucial event in transforming [[health education]] as practiced in [[Public school (government funded)|American public schools]]. It has been called, "the most significant school health education initiative of the 1960s"&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al. 1997 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely responsible for establishing the value of comprehensive health education rather than separate disease-specific units and in introducing the concept-based approach to education in general. Most health curricula developed since have followed the model set by the SHES in its School Health Curriculum Project.&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1960 millionaire distiller and philanthropist [[Samuel Bronfman]] asked Dr. Granville Larimore, then Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and a member of the Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), to suggest several projects in health or education that should receive funding but were being neglected by governmental and private funders. Dr. Larimore suggested three priorities: (I) graduate medical education, (2) effectiveness of the mass media for health education, and (3) school health education. After hearing presentations on each of these three priorities, the [[Samuel Bronfman Foundation]]’s board decided to provide $200,000 for a study of the status of health education in the nation’s schools.

== Initial study ==
The Study was envisioned as an independent, two-year-long investigation, affiliated with the [[American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance|American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation]] (AAHPER) and the National Education Association. Bronfman sought the advice of [[Delbert Oberteuffer]], professor at the [[Ohio State University]] and widely regarded as the leading figure in health education at that time, regarding who could best lead the study. Oberteuffer recommended one of his young OSU colleagues, [[Elena Sliepcevich]]. Dr. Sliepcevich accepted the appointment and moved to Washington, DC where the SHES leased office space on Dupont Circle in the building next door to the NEA.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 1962; Means, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, the Study assessed the state of health education offerings in a total of 135 school systems covering 38 states and involving some 1101 individual [[Primary education|elementary schools]] and 359 secondary schools. This survey remains the broadest of its type ever completed in the United States. In the second year test instruments were administered to students in grades 6, 9, and 12 of the participating schools. Of 17,634 usable answer sheets re¬turned to the researchers, a weighted sample of 2000 scores for each of the three [[grade level]]s representative of the makeup of the school sample was selected for analysis. Analysis of the results required a third year of Bronfman Foundation support and led to the conclusion that the state of health education in the nation’s public schools was "appalling".&lt;ref&gt;Sliepcevich, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

== School Health Curriculum Project ==
The [3M] Corporation funded SHES for a further six years (1963–1969) to develop a model curriculum—the School Health Curriculum Project or SHCP. Ann E. Nolte, of Ohio State University, joined SHES as associate director of the study and a curriculum writing team was assembled, consisting of:  William H. Creswell, Jr., professor of health education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]; Gus T. Dalis, of the Los Angeles County Schools; Edward B. Johns, professor of school health education at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; Marion B. Pollock, assistant professor of health education at [[California State University, Long Beach|California State College, Long Beach]]; Richard K. Means, professor of health education at [[Auburn University]]; and [[Robert D. Russell]], associate professor of health education at [[Southern Illinois University]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Russell proposed as the initial point of view for the SHCP that health was a unified concept of well-being. This was expressed in the curriculum as follows, "Health is a quality of life involving dynamic interaction and interdependence among the individual's physical well-being, his (or her) mental and emotional reactions, and the social complex in which he (or she) exists".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  From this starting point, the SHCP writers identified ten key concepts. Sub concepts were then developed in the physical, mental, and social dimen¬sions for each of the ten concepts. The 31 sub concepts were each linked to behavioral objectives written at four progressive levels—grades K-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12—in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.

== Concepts ==
The ten concepts developed by the SHES as the basis for the SHCP were:
# Growth and development influences and is influenced by the structure and functioning of the individual.
# Growing and developing follows a predictable sequence, yet is unique for each individual.
# Protection and promotion of health is an individual, community, and international responsibility.
# The potential for hazards and accidents exists, whatever the environment.
# There are reciprocal relationships involving man (humanity), disease, and environment.
# The family serves to perpetuate man (humanity) and to fulfill certain health needs.
# Personal health practices are affected by a complexity of forces, often conflicting.
# Utilization of health information, products, and services is guided by values and perceptions.
# Use of substances that modify mood and behavior arises from a variety of motivations.
# Food selection and eating patterns are determined by physical, social, mental, economic, and cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Social work is a broad profession that intersects with several disciplines. Social work organizations offer the following definitions: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Social work is a practice-based profession and an academic discipline that promotes social change and development, social cohesion, and the empowerment and liberation of people. Principles of social justice, human rights, collective responsibility and respect for diversities are central to social work.  Underpinned by theories of social work, social sciences, humanities and indigenous knowledge, social work'' ''engages people and structures to address life challenges and enhance wellbeing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifsw.org/policies/definition-of-social-work/|title=Global Definition of Social Work {{!}} International Federation of Social Workers|website=ifsw.org|language=en-US|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Federation of Social Workers]] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social work is a profession concerned with helping individuals, families, groups and communities to enhance their individual and collective well-being. It aims to help people develop their skills and their ability to use their own resources and those of the community to resolve problems. Social work is concerned with individual and personal problems but also with broader social issues such as poverty, unemployment, and domestic violence."  -&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.casw-acts.ca/en/what-social-work|title=What is Social Work? {{!}} Canadian Association of Social Workers|website=www.casw-acts.ca|language=en|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Association of Social Workers]]                                                                                                                                  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Social work practice consists of the professional application of social work values, principles, and techniques to one or more of the following ends: helping people obtain tangible services; counseling and psychotherapy with individuals, families, and groups; helping communities or groups provide or improve social and health services; and participating in legislative processes. The practice of social work requires knowledge of human development and behavior; of social and economic, and cultural institutions; and of the interaction of all these factors."-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naswdc.org/practice/default.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020531061348/http://www.naswdc.org/practice/default.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 31, 2002|title=Practice - NASW|website=www.naswdc.org|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Association of Social Workers]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Social workers work with individuals and families to help improve outcomes in their lives.

==History==
{{Main article|History of social work}}
[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the 19th century.]]
The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860–1900) |work =The Social Work History Station |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organization Society]] in the mid-19th century, which was founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|title=1800s|work=Family Action: About Us|accessdate=November 17, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155|archivedate=July 18, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the [[social theory]] that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief – 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action – rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby [[poverty reduction|alleviate poverty]]. This approach was developed originally by the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]].&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundation basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in [[History of England#Modern England, 18th–19th centuries|19th century England]], and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of [[charity (practice)|charity]] work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011" /&gt;

Other important historical figures that shaped the growth of the social work profession are [[Jane Addams]], who founded the [[Hull House]] in Chicago and won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1931; [[Mary Richmond|Mary Ellen Richmond]], who wrote Social Diagnosis, one of the first social work books to incorporate law, medicine, psychiatry, psychology, and history; and [[William Beveridge]], who created the social welfare state, framing the debate on social work within the context of social welfare prevision.

==Transtheoretical models==
Social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as (but not limited to) [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[politics]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[ecology]], [[education]], [[health]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Counseling psychology|counseling]], including [[psychotherapy]]. Field work is a distinctive attribution to social work [[pedagogy]]. This equips the trainee in understanding the theories and models within the field of work. Professional practitioners from multicultural aspects have their roots in this social work [[Immersion journalism|immersion]] engagements from the early 19th century in the western countries. As an example, here are some of the models and theories used within social work practice:{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Profession==
[[Abraham Flexner]] in a 1915 lecture, "Is Social Work a Profession?",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924014006617|title=Is social work a profession?|first=Abraham|last=Flexner|date=June 19, 2018|publisher=New York, The New York school of philanthropy|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivered at the National Conference on Charities and Corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession with reference to social work. It is not a 'single model', such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are [[evidence-based practice|evidence-based by practice standards]]. A social work professional's services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers: The Centre for Education &amp; Training | date=2011 | accessdate=November 8, 2016 | url=http://www.tcet.com/assets/pdf/nrc/employment/1-12-11/OCSWSSW.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its seven core functions are described by Popple and Leighninger as:
# Engagement — the social worker must first engage the client in early meetings to promote a collaborative relationship
# Assessment — data must be gathered that will guide and direct a plan of action to help the client
# Planning — negotiate and formulate an action plan
# Implementation — promote resource acquisition and enhance role performance
# Monitoring/Evaluation — on-going documentation through short-term goal attainment of extent to which client is following through
# Supportive Counseling — affirming, challenging, encouraging, informing, and exploring options
# Graduated Disengagement — seeking to replace the social worker with a naturally occurring resource&lt;ref&gt;Popple &amp; Leighninger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Six other core values identified by the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606100446/http://www.socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-06-06|title=Code of Ethics (English and Spanish) – National Association of Social Workers|work=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code of Ethics are:

# Service — help people in need and address social problems
# Social Justice — challenge social injustices
# Respect the dignity and worth of the person
# Give importance to human relationships
# Integrity — behave in a trustworthy manner
# Competence — practice within the areas of one's areas of expertise and develop and enhance professional skill

A historic and defining feature of social work is the profession's focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society.&lt;ref name="Crisp"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Crisp, B.R.|author2=Beddoe, L.|date=December 2012|title=Promoting Health and Well-being in Social Work Education|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers promote [[social justice]] and [[social change]] with and on behalf of clients.&lt;ref name="Stefaroi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefaroi, Petru|date=December 2014|title=Humane &amp; Spiritual Qualities of the Professional in Humanistic Social Work: Humanistic Social Work – The Third Way in Theory and Practice|location=Charleston|publisher=Createspace|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "client" can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community.&lt;ref&gt;NASW, Code of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadening scope of the modern social worker's role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Kosovo Family Support Project:Offering Psychosocial Support for Families with Missing Persons |author1=Keough, Mary Ellen  |author2=Samuels, Margaret F. | journal=Social Work |date=October 2004 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=587–594 | doi=10.1093/sw/49.4.587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S.|year=2004|title=Banking the poor: Policies to bring low-income Americans into the financial mainstream|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as Knight in 1921 defined "If you don't even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and If you don't even know the odds, that is uncertainty." Risk management in social work means minimising the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analysing the risks and benefits in duty of care or in decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllida Parsole. Risk assessment in social care and social work. 2001. Jessica Kingsley Publishers.pg. 17+&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, according to the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), a branch of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], professional social workers are the largest group of mental health services providers. There are more clinically trained social workers—over 200,000—than psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses combined. Federal law and the National Institutes of Health recognize social work as one of five core mental health professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Association of Social Workers |url=http://www.socialworkers.org/ |work=NASW |accessdate=September 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are [[poverty relief]], [[life skills|life skills education]], [[community development]], [[rural development]], [[forensics]] and [[corrections]], [[legislation]], [[industrial relations]], [[project management]], [[child protection]], [[elder abuse|elder protection]], [[women's rights]], [[human rights]], [[systems theory|systems optimization]], [[Financial social work|finance]], [[drug rehabilitation|addictions rehabilitation]], [[child development]], [[Cross-cultural psychology|cross-cultural mediation]], [[occupational safety and health]], [[disaster management]], [[mental health]], [[psychosocial|psychosocial therapy]], [[disabilities]], etc.

==Qualifications==
[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumbnail|252x252px|right|Social Work training begins in a structured manner at higher educational institutions (universities and colleges), coupled with or followed by practical internships and externships.]]
The education of social workers begins with a bachelor's degree (BA, BSc, BSSW, BSW, etc.) or diploma in social work or a [[Bachelor of Social Services]]. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, such as a master's degree (MSW, MSSW, MSS, MSSA, MA, MSc, MRes, MPhil.) or doctoral studies (PhD and DSW (Doctor of Social Work)). Increasingly, graduates of social work programs pursue post-masters and post-doctoral study, including training in psychotherapy.

In the United States, social work undergraduate and master's programs are accredited by the [[Council on Social Work Education]]. A CSWE-accredited degree is required for one to become a state-licensed social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/careers/how-to-become-a-licensed-clinical-social-worker.html|title=How to Become a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-dsw/|title=Online Doctorate of Social Work (DSW) Programs|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSWE even accredits online master's in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onlinemswprograms.com/online-schools.html|title=Online MSW Programs: 2018's Full List of CSWE Accredited Schools|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the New York [[Charity Organization Society]], which was the [[Columbia University School of Social Work]]'s earliest entity, began offering formal "social philanthropy" courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the United States, as well as the launching of professional social work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2vnns1wL8wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=history+of+columbia+university+school+of+social+work+first&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OKcgdIAK4S&amp;sig=ELBKCq_wU25ep2y0EYXYBo92vsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigxZC1obDYAhVDRN8KHTjhC74Q6AEIXjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20columbia%20university%20school%20of%20social%20work%20first&amp;f=false|title=The Columbia University School of Social Work: A Centennial Celebration|last=Feldman|first=Ronald A.|last2=Kamerman|first2=Sheila B.|date=2001|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231122825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of countries and jurisdictions require [[Licensure|registration]] or [[licensure]] of people working as social workers, and there are mandated [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[National Association of Social Workers]] (NASW, 2005). NASW Fact Sheet. Retrieved November 15, 2006 from http://www.socialworkers.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. The success of these professional bodies' efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cswna.org|title=Catholic Social Workers National Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional associations===
Social workers have a number of professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and for social work in general. These associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. The main international associations are the [[International Federation of Social Workers]] (IFSW) and the [[International Association of Schools of Social Work]] (IASSW).

The largest professional social work association in the United States is the [[National Association of Social Workers]]. There also exist organizations that represent clinical social workers such as The American Association of Psychoanalysis in Clinical Social Work. AAPCSW is a national organization representing social workers who practice psychoanalytic social work and psychonalysis. There are also a number of states with Clinical Social Work Societies which represent all social workers who conduct psychotherapy from a variety of theoretical frameworks with families, groups and individuals.  The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration (ACOSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Association for Community Organization and Social Administration|url = http://www.acosa.org/joomla/|website = www.acosa.org|accessdate = October 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres.

In the UK, the professional association is the [[British Association of Social Workers]] (BASW) with just over 18,000 members (as of August 2015).

The Code of Ethics of the US-based [[National Association of Social Workers]] provides a code for daily conduct and a set of principles rooted in 6 core values:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=NASW Delegate Assembly|first=|date=1996|title=Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers|url=https://www.socialworkers.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=ms_ArtLqzeI%3d&amp;portalid=0|journal=National Association of Social Workers|volume=2017 revision|pages=|via=socialworkers.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siedlecki|first=Karen L.|last2=Salthouse|first2=Timothy A.|last3=Oishi|first3=Shigehiro|last4=Jeswani|first4=Sheena|date=2014-06-01|title=The Relationship Between Social Support and Subjective Well-Being Across Age |journal=Social Indicators Research |volume=117|issue=2|pages=561–576|doi=10.1007/s11205-013-0361-4 |pmc=4102493|pmid=25045200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trade unions representing social workers===
In the United Kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Contemporary_History_of_Social_Work.html?id=MCyGoAEACAAJ|title=A contemporary history of social work: Learning from the past|last=Terry|first=Bamford|date=February 25, 2015|publisher=Policy Press: University of Bristol|year=2015|isbn=9781447322184|location=Bristol, United Kingdom|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of these are represented by [[UNISON]], the public sector employee union. Smaller numbers are members of the [[Unite the Union]] and the [[GMB (trade union)]]. The [[British Union of Social Work Employees]] (BUSWE) has been a section of the [[Community (trade union)]] since 2008.

While at that stage not a union, the [[British Association of Social Workers]] operated a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations provide the kind of representation you would expect from a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.

By 2011 several councils had realized that they did not have to permit BASW access, and those that were challenged by skilled professional representation of their staff were withdrawing permission. For this reason BASW once again took up trade union status by forming its arms length trade union section, SWU (Social Workers Union). This gives legal right to represent its members whether the employer or [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) recognizes SWU or not.  At 2015 the TUC was still resisting SWU application for admission to congress membership and while most employers are not making formal statements of recognition until such a time as the TUC may change its policy, they are all legally required to permit SWU (BASW) representation at internal discipline hearings etc.

The '''Stadtmuseum Gütersloh''' (Gütersloh Town Museum) is a museum in [[Gütersloh]], Germany, dealing with the city's history. Under the auspices of Gütersloh's association for [[local history]] it accommodates – beside exhibits to Gütersloh's local history – two exhibitions referring to the [[history of medicine]] and the [[industrial history]]. Every year about five to seven special exhibitions about local topics respectively [[travelling exhibition]]s take place in addition to these three permanent exhibitions. The medical-historic collection – the flagship of the museum – was granted a special prize of the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 1990. A desk of the Nobel Prize winner [[Robert Koch]] and an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] are some of the most important exhibits.

== Museum’s History ==
On 24 June 1982 Dr. Wilhelm Angenete (1890-1984) – a family doctor in Gütersloh – and his sister Else donated two real estates with buildings in the city of Gütersloh to the association for local history on condition of establishing a museum there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Heinrich Lakämper-Lührs|Title=Das Stadtmuseum Gütersloh. Ein modernes Museum in Vereins-Trägerschaft |PublicationPlace=Bielefeld|Year=1993|ISBN=978-3-89534-103-8|Date=  1993|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 the town museum Gütersloh was opened in a brick building under the responsibility of Gütersloh's association for local history. Till today the town Gütersloh participates in the cost sharing. In 1997 a neighbouring half-timbered house could be renovated in a second construction phase. In the year 2000 the museum's café was opened.

== Buildings ==
The museum area comprises five historical buildings. The exhibition about the local history can be visited in a half-timbered house, built about 1750. From 1819 and 1868 it accommodated Prussia's first state-supported primary school in Gütersloh, before the corn-dealer Angenete &amp; Wulfhorst opened its business there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Matthias E. Borner|Surname2=Detlef Güthenke|Title=[http://www.stadtfuehrer-guetersloh.de Stadtführer Gütersloh] |Publisher=tpk-Regionalverlag|PublicationPlace=Bielefeld|Year=2010|ISBN=978-3-936359-43-5|Date=  2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 1874 this enterprise built the brick building which was used as granary. Today the exhibitions about the history of medicine and industry are shown there. Since 1984 both buildings have been put under [[cultural heritage management]].

The museum's management and -administration as well as the museum's café are accommodated in further half-timbered houses. The museum's store-room/depot is located outside of the actual museum's estate.

== Collections and Exhibitions ==
[[File:Stadtmuseum-raf-gt.jpg|thumb|An important chapter in the local history of Gütersloh: [[RAF Gütersloh]]]]
In principle everything in connection with the town of Gütersloh is collected in the Stadtmuseum Gütersloh. The collections focus particularly on medicine, hygiene and health, economy and industry, media and media technology (due to the media trust [[Bertelsmann]] being domiciled in Gütersloh), toys and recreational activities. Its comprehensive inventory of collections, of which only a minor part can be exhibited due to the small available exhibition space, turns the museum into one of the largest regional museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Carsten Vorwig|Title=Das kulturelle Gedächtnis der Stadt. Zur Notwendigkeit eines umfangreichen Sachgutmagazins im Stadtmuseum |Issue=76/77|PublicationPlace=Gütersloh|Year=2003|Date=  2003|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local History of Gütersloh ==
The exhibition about Gütersloh's local history features artefacts from the bronze-age to modern testimonials of the digital revolution. Beside original prehistoric finds a replication of the approximately 3.500 years old, 40&amp;nbsp;cm high "Pavenstädter Riesenbecher" ("[[Beaker culture#Extent and impact|Giant Beaker]] of Pavenstädt" – Pavenstädt is an urban district of Gütersloh) is exhibited, one of the oldest testimonials of human settlements in Gütersloh's urban area. The former purpose of the half-timbered house is illustrated in a teacher's residence of about 1840 ([[Vormärz]] era). The exhibition about the local history mainly deals with the everyday life of families living in Gütersloh in 1868. The furnishing and basic commodities of one Protestant and one Catholic family are shown. Historical meteorological data commemorate Gütersloh's first weather station installed by the town's [[Citizenship#Honorary citizenship|honorary citizen]] Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Stohlmann.

The entire workshop of Gütersloh's [[coppersmith]] Thiro of the year 1900 is exhibited in the former horse stable of the half-timbered house. Three generations of the Thiro family worked with the exhibited equipment till 1977, producing – among others – pots, pans and [[Still|distillation apparatus]] for the local distilleries.

A part of the exhibition deals with the topic "Gütersloh – Town of Patrons and Donors". Personalities, who campaigned for the town's public welfare by donation activities, are introduced – not only because of the fact that the museum's existence is due to a donation. A prominent example is [[Reinhard Mohn]] who set up the oldest [[community foundation]] of Germany in 1996. Therefore, a bronze sculpture of Reinhard Mohn – created in 1986 by the sculptor [[Hubert Hartmann]] (1915–2006) coming from [[Wiedenbrück]] – is exhibited in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nw-news.de/lokale_news/guetersloh/guetersloh/3376653_Ein_Bronze-Denkmal_fuer_Guetersloh.html Ein Bronze-Denkmal für Gütersloh – Büste von Reinhard Mohn findet dauerhaft Platz im Stadtmuseum], [[Neue Westfälische]] (Gütersloher Zeitung), 9 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Medicine ==
[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|An [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] from the 1950s]]
The exhibition dealing with the [[history of medicine]] is of supraregional importance&lt;ref name="medizinische Sammlung"&gt;Martin Wedeking, Norbert Ellermann: ''Die medizinische Sammlung des Stadtmuseums Gütersloh: Geschichte – Positionen – Perspektiven.'' In: Rainer Alsheimer, Roland Weibezahn (Hrsg.): ''Körperlichkeit und Kultur 2005 – Geschichtliches, Normen, Methoden'', Universität Bremen, Bremen 2005, {{ISBN|3-88722-659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was granted a special prize of the European Museum of the Year Award in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=NRW-Stiftung|Title=Unser NRW. Reiseführer zu den kultur- und Naturdenkmälern. Ostwestfalen-Lippe |Publisher=Klartext|PublicationPlace=Essen|Year=2011|ISBN=978-3-8375-0622-8|Date=  2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this exhibition general developments of the history of medicine ("Medicine in ancient times, Middle Ages and modern times") are combined with local references (practice furnishing of Dr. Angenete, well-known doctors in Gütersloh). As Germany features only rather few medical-historic museums, this permanent exhibition is a flagship and the museum's unique selling proposition – at least in the regional museum landscape.

The collection was initiated by Dr. Wilhelm Angenete, a family doctor in Gütersloh. He bequeathed not only the buildings of the museum to the association for local history, but also the equipment of his practice, as for example medical instruments, furniture, a skeleton as well as educational material which partly dated from the 1920s and 1930s. Furthermore, the association managed to achieve substantial components of a store for cosmetics and healthcare of the year 1890 which was originally furnished as pharmacy.

These exhibits formed the basis for a collection which has meanwhile be completed among others by [[Robert Koch]]’s desk, which Koch – winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his tuberculosis findings in 1905 – used during his employment as director at the Institute for Hygiene of the University in Berlin (1885–1891). Further appreciable exhibits are the furnishing of two dental practices of the years 1925 and 1955, an [[Radiography|X-ray]] machine, a [[cystoscope]] from the 1920s and an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]]. Nowadays less than a dozen of these breathing machines are presented to the public in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gt-info.de/index.html?site=Top+Thema&amp;mgid=44&amp;tid=318 Matthias Borner: ''Per Kran auf die Insel – Das Stadtmuseum.''], In: GT-INFO, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the town museum also took over the practice equipment of Dr. Kurt Heinrich (1908-1998), an oculist in Gütersloh. In addition to the permanent exhibition special- and travelling exhibitions about medical-historic topics take place in the town museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Friedhelm Heinrich|Title=Dr. Kurt Heinrich. Biographie eines Gütersloher Augenarztes |Issue=66/67|PublicationPlace=Gütersloh|Year=2000|Date=  2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibits of the medical-historic collection are often made available by the museum for special exhibitions of other museums. Following the idea of "History Marketing" also companies, associations, practices, health insurance companies or hospitals use the collection for exhibitions on the occasion of - for example - anniversaries. The Stadtmuseum Gütersloh grants the loan of its exhibits including expert device as "historical service" to make additional income.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Dr. Rolf Westheider|Title=Das Stadtmuseum Gütersloh als Anbieter historischer Dienstleistungen |PublicationPlace=Gütersloh|Year=2005|Date=  2005|language=German|Comment=[[Memorandum]], [[Copy (written)|Copy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial History ==
[[File:Stadtmuseum-gt-schmiede.jpg|thumb|Workshop of a [[coppersmith]] (1900)]]
[[File:Stadtmuseum-gt-miele.jpg|thumb|[[Miele]]]]

The second permanent exhibition deals with the [[Second industrial revolution#Germany|industrial development in Germany]]. As companies of Gütersloh are taken as examples, it mainly focuses on the textile- and metal working industry. Apart from work benches and machines a fully functional mechanic weaving [[loom]] is exhibited. This permanent exhibition also refers to the topic "Washing and Washing Machine" with reference to [[Miele]], a local manufacturer of household appliances.

== Special Exhibitions ==
Special exhibitions either deal with local issues or feature [[travelling exhibition]]s. In case of local matters, the exhibitions concentrate on the town history including the development of industry, trade, traffic, culture, leisure time and formation. Corresponding to the focus of its collection regarding the history of medicine, exhibitions – either of the Stadtmuseum Gütersloh itself or of third parties - regularly take place in the town museum about this topic.

Following a tradition, a [[toy]] exhibition is organized in the winter months, which attracts - according to gathered experiences – a tremendous number of visitors. The most successful exhibitions were: an exhibition showing duplications of [[Gyro Gearloose]]’s inventions, “Busy Girl – [[Barbie]] works her way up“, “Everybody’s constructing by using [[Lego]]“ and a “[[Käthe Kruse]]”-exhibition.

== Museum’s Education ==
Pupils of primary schools are given the opportunity by the Stadtmuseum to become acquainted with the exhibitions in a playful and child-oriented way. Furthermore, they have the chance to get some background information of a museum. Therefore, museum rallies, guessing games, disguising actions and courses of textile manufacturing and wood working are offered. Furthermore, museum tours – particularly for children – and offers for children's birthday parties are available. A "museum’s doctor" and his "medical secretary" will explain to them the medical-historic collection. Furthermore, the Stadtmuseum Gütersloh disposes of portable wooden exhibition boxes. They contain material (for example referring to the paper manufacturing or the teaching of historical writing- and printing techniques) and are borrowed to schools for project work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Norbert Ellermann|Title=Museumspädagogik im Stadtmuseum Gütersloh.

[[Transmission (medicine)|Transmission]] of an [[infection]] requires three conditions:
*an [[infectious disease|infectious]] individual
*a [[susceptible]] individual
*an effective contact between them

An '''effective contact''' is defined as any kind of contact between two individuals such that, if one individual is infectious and the other susceptible, then the first individual infects the second. Whether or not a particular kind of contact will be effective depends on the infectious agent and its [[transmission (medicine)|route of transmission]].

The '''effective contact rate''' (denoted ''β'') in a given [[population]] for a given [[infectious disease]] is measured in effective contacts per unit time. This may be expressed as the '''total contact rate''' (the total number of contacts, effective or not, per unit time, denoted γ), multiplied by the [[risk of infection]], given contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual. This risk is called the '''transmission risk''' and is denoted ''p''. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\beta = \gamma \times p \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The total contact rate, γ, will generally be greater than the effective contact rate, β, since not all contacts result in infection. That is to say, ''p'' is almost always less than 1 and it can never be greater than 1, since it is effectively the [[probability]] of transmission occurring.

This relation formalises the fact that the effective contact rate depends not only on the social patterns of contact in a particular society (γ) but also on the specific types of contact and the pathology of the infectious organism (''p''). For example, it has been shown that a concurrent [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] can substantially increase the probability (''p'') of infecting a susceptible with [[HIV]]. Therefore, one way to reduce the value of ''p'' (and hence lower HIV transmission rates) might be to treat other sexually transmitted infections.

There are a number of difficulties in using this relation. The first is that it is very difficult to measure contact rates because they vary widely between individuals and groups, and within the same group at different times. For sexually transmitted infections, [[sexual network|large scale studies of sexual behaviour]] have been set up to estimate the contact rate. In developed countries for serious diseases such as [[AIDS]] or [[tuberculosis]], contact tracing is often carried out when a patient is diagnosed (the patient and medical authorities try to inform every possible contact the patient may have made since infection). This, however, is not so much a research tool and more to alert the contacts to the possibility that they may be infected and so can seek medical treatment and avoiding passing on the disease if they have contracted it. 

A second consideration is that it is generally thought [[medical ethics|unethical]] to carry out direct experiments to establish per-contact infection risks as this would require the deliberate exposure of individuals to infectious agents. The [[Common Cold Unit]] that researched cold transmission in the UK between 1946 and 1989 was a notable exception. It is also possible to estimate the transmission risk in certain circumstances where exposures to infection have been documented, for example the rate of infection among nurses who have accidentally pricked their fingers with a needle that had previously been used with contaminated blood.

A more direct assessment of transmission risks can be provided by a [[contact study]], which is often carried out because of an outbreak (such a study was carried out during the [[SARS]] outbreak of 2002&amp;ndash;3). The first (or primary) case within a defined group (such as a school or family) is identified and people infected by this individual (called secondary cases) are documented. If the number of susceptibles in the group is ''n'' and the number of secondary cases is ''x'', then an estimation of the transmission risk is

:&lt;math&gt; 
p = \frac {x} {n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''p'' is the same [[parameter]] as before but it has been calculated in a different way. To reflect this, it is called the '''secondary attack rate''' (it is really a risk, of course, and not a rate, but the term is still commonly used).

Even if the whole group in question is susceptible, ''x'' is generally smaller than the [[basic reproduction number]] for the disease. That is defined as the number of individuals each infected individual will go on to infect themselves, in a population with no resistance to the disease. The basic reproduction number includes all secondary cases infected by a primary case, while ''x'' is only the number of secondary cases within the group in question.

Secondary attack rates are useful for comparisons between [[vaccination|vaccinated]] and unvaccinated groups and hence assessing the efficacy of vaccinations against the disease under inspection. However, there are inevitably complications with such contact studies. It is not always obvious which members of the group are susceptible and distinguishing between secondary and subsequent cases (for example, those infected by the secondary cases are tertiary cases and so on) can be difficult. Also, the possibility of infection from an outsider must be ignored.

Despite these problems, the parameters ''p'' and β are powerful tools in the mathematical modelling of epidemics. But it should always be remembered that a model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based and the data from which its parameters are calculated.

The '''Trenton Psychiatric Hospital''' is a state run [[mental hospital]] located in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Ewing, New Jersey|Ewing]], [[New Jersey]].  It previously operated under the name '''New Jersey State Hospital at Trenton''' and originally as the '''New Jersey State Lunatic Asylum'''.

Founded by [[Dorothea Lynde Dix]] on May 15, 1848, it was the first public mental hospital in the state of New Jersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Trenton Psychiatric Hospital|journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=1 December 1999|volume=156|issue=12|pages=1982–1982|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173859}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first mental hospital designed on the principle of the [[Kirkbride Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, ''The Architecture of Madness: Insane Asylums in the United States'', Minneapolis: Minnesota University Press, 2007, 55&lt;/ref&gt;  The architect was the Scottish-American [[John Notman]].  

Under the Hospital's first superintendent, Dr. Horace A. Buttolph, the hospital admitted and treated 86 patients.  In 1907, Dr. [[Henry Cotton (doctor)|Henry Cotton]] became the medical director.  Believing that infections were the key to mental illness, he had his staff remove teeth and various other body parts that might become infected from the hospital patients.  Cotton's legacy of hundreds of fatalities and thousands of maimed and mutilated patients did not end with his leaving Trenton in 1930 or his death in 1933; in fact, removal of patients' teeth at the Trenton asylum was still the norm until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Madhouse: A Tragic Tale of Megalomania and Modern Medicine]]'', Andrew Scull, Yale University Press, 2005.  {{ISBN|0-300-10729-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-Cigarette-Electronic Cigarette-E-Cigs-E-Liquid-Vaping (16273944865).jpg|thumb|Male smoking a cigarette, CFCF, 2015.]]'''Underage [[smoking]] in [[Australia]]''' is still a major concern ([http://www.quitnow.gov.au/internet/quitnow/publishing.nsf/Content/ntc-pregeval-execsumm National Tobacco Campaign]). As a result, statistics have been recorded and compared from surveys completed throughout Australia, showing how the numbers of underage smokers have drastically decreased in the years between 1991 and 2013. However, adolescents are still being pressured to try smoking (whether intentionally or not) by various influences including family, peers, and advertising campaigns. The amount of advertising that is being publicized is still striking attention in adolescent’s minds. This is why [[tobacco smoking]] is still relatively popular among youth in Australia. The broadcasts promoting smoking are found to be highly influential to the whole of the targeted audience, regardless of age. However, it is youth who are being most affected. Almost all smokers start while they are young, and studies have found that nearly all first time smoking experiences take place during high school years. Generally, the younger a person is when they start smoking [[tobacco]], the more likely the person is to use it as an adult. This is due to the addictive effects of nicotine, which have been shown to create deeper addictions with those who have smoked for longer periods of time. Substances that are commonly smoked by adolescents in Australia include [[cigarette]]s, [[Marijuana (word)|marijuana]], [[hookah]]s and [[electronic cigarette]]s.

== History ==
Underage
smoking in Australia has taken a big turn throughout the years and has dropped
the percentage of adolescents smoking drastically. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) conducted surveys detailing daily
smokers, they conducted these surveys in the years between 1991-2013. The
survey in 2013 collected information from almost 24,000 and the results showed
that "there has been a significant decrease in daily smokers '''aged 14 years'''
or older in Australia, falling from 16.6% in 2007, 15.1% in 2010, to 12.8% in
2013."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129549848|title = National Drug Strategy Household Survey detailed report|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barola and White from the
Drug Strategy Branch in the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing reported that in 2011, the overall rate of current
smoking among Australian students aged 12 to 15 years was 6.7%. Within that
amount 4.1% were current smokers between the ages of 12 and 15, the ratio included
males taking up 4.4% and females 3.8%. Whereas 12.9% of 16- and 17-year-olds were
current smokers, and that worked out to be males 13.4% and females 12.3%. These
figures are calculated from 25,000 Australian students who took part in this
survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nationaldrugstrategy.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/Publishing.nsf/content/BCBF6B2C638E1202CA257ACD0020E35C/$File/National%20Report_FINAL_ASSAD_7.12.pdf|title = Australian secondary school students’ use of tobacco, alcohol, and over-the- counter and illicit substances|date = 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing|author1=White, V  |author2=Bariola, E. |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The
AIHW reported that high levels of tobacco control activities in the community
have contributed to the drop in smoking rates among students. These control
activities that the community helped instigate included anti-smoking media campaigns,
the increase of tobacco tax, restrictions of advertising and the sales of
tobacco products, smoking bans in public places, and graphic health warnings on cigarette
packs, alongside multiple more. It was noted that education and tobacco control
measures are also important, so that adolescents are aware and understand the
harms of smoking and secondhand smoke, and are therefore less likely to start
smoking underage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influences ==

=== Family ===
Winstanley et al. stated, "Australian
research has shown that young people living in households where English is
spoken are more likely to smoke, than those living in households where a
language other than English is the first language."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Smoking in Australia - Quit Victoria|url = http://www.quit.org.au/criticschoice/critics-choice-smoking-in-australia|website = www.quit.org.au|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This puts forward the
matter of concern in regards to what influence this has on the children being
impacted. While a child is young, they are at risk of being influenced by bad
habits of the people who surround them. In particular family, because
adolescents look up to their elders as role models, and if the parents,
siblings, and extended family are smoking around the child, the child is twice
as likely to become a smoker. This is not in the best interest of the child, because it promotes that it is suitable for the child to start smoking,
as family influence has the greatest impact on a child’s behaviour and choices.

A bad issue as a result of this is second hand
smoke, British Columbia (2012), stated that people who do not smoke, and who are exposed regularly to the toxic
chemicals being inhaled from the [[Passive smoking|second-hand smoke]] can suffer serious, and
life-threatening health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Harmful Effects of Second-hand Smoke - HealthLinkBC File #30a|url = http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthfiles/hfile30a.stm|website = www.healthlinkbc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-01|first = Province of British|last = Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that these risks can already bring upon
many health issues while not physically smoking will only enhance, and become
more dangerous to the adolescent if found to take up smoking for themselves.

[[File:A smoker with huge head exhales cigar smoke which forms the Wellcome V0019250.jpg|thumb|left|A man exhaling smoke from a cigar forming the words, "TRY ONE."]]

=== Advertising ===
Advertising plays a substantial role in the original
establishment of underage smoking. The media influences general curiosity about
the effects of smoking, which can sway the decisions of underage smokers. This
is because adolescents are easy targets for the tobacco industry, as they
are influenced effortlessly to ‘try new things’. Television shows, movies, the
Internet, and general advertising of tobacco products, all play
huge roles in getting young adolescents minds to wonder what smoking is like as they all
promote that smoking is fun, healthy, and attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Analyzing Assorted Tobacco Advertisements|url = http://healthliteracy.worlded.org/docs/tobacco/Unit2/3analyzing_ads.html|website = healthliteracy.worlded.org|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco
advertisements aim to display one main concept, which is the
enjoyment that you could get out of the effects of cigarettes, but however
ignore the health risks that come from smoking cigarettes.

=== School ===
Friends
and social groups have a huge impact on [[youth smoking]]. What someone’s friends
do and say, play a huge reflection in others minds, so the desire of knowing
what smoking is like for one person, can impact countless others. It is a mixture between [[peer pressure]] that encourages
or discourages smoking, as well as a bonding mechanism among peers. [[Adolescence|Adolescents]]
may smoke because they want to belong to a particular group and have a sense of
fitting in, whereas other adolescents may lack the skills to refuse a cigarette
offered by a friend (peer pressure), or someone they want to get to know. Peer smoking is by far a major influential factor in adolescent
smoking, as there are strong desires to look cool in others eyes, and to appear
older and more mature to those watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.taadas.org/publications/LIBRARY%20STUF/Tobacco%20Info/peerpressureandsmoking.pdf|title = Peer pressure and smoking|last = Morris|first = Philip|date = 2005|journal = The RAISING KIDS WHO DON’T SMOKE Series |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is known to be a fun hobby where a
group of friends can get together and bond, a great example of this is hookah smoking. The enjoyment of
smoking, the sensations, and feelings which one gets from smoking is being
taken out of this ‘social hobby’. However, there is one major problem with this, and
that is, adolescents who start smoking in early teenage years don’t think much,
or at all, about the [[Health risks of smoking|health risks]] they can obtain in the near future, due to
long-term extended smoking.

== Substances commonly smoked by minors ==
[[File:Cigarette-s x.jpeg|thumb|A Cigarette.]]

=== Cigarettes ===
There are two types of cigarettes, one being shredded or
ground tobacco that is wrapped in paper, or another substance that does not
include tobacco&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a Cigarette?|url = http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/glossaryofterms/g/cigarette.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other is manufactured
cigarettes, which differ by having filters on one end, which are intended to ‘trap’ some of
the toxic chemicals contained in cigarette smoke.
The main ingredient in cigarettes is tobacco;
tobacco is a green, leafy plant named [[nicotiana tabacum]]. Artificial
flavorings and other chemicals are also added into the compound mixed in cigarettes (as seen below in ''Figure 1'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TalkSooner.org {{!}} Drugs {{!}} Tobacco|url = http://www.talksooner.org/drugs/tobacco/|website = www.talksooner.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 4,000 chemicals in cigarette
smoke, and 43 of them are known to be [[carcinogen]]ic, which is a cancer-causing
compound. Ingredients found in cigarettes that are carcinogenics include nicotine,
[[tar]], carbon monoxide, [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]], and
[[DDT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What's in a Cigarette|url = http://healthliteracy.worlded.org/docs/tobacco/Unit4/1whats_in.html|website = healthliteracy.worlded.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicotine is a highly addictive drug, and smoke that
contains nicotine is inhaled into the lungs and can travel to the brain
in just six seconds. Nicotine in small doses acts as a [[stimulant]] to the brain (when it
reaches the bloodstream, it makes the smoker feel calm), as opposed to large
doses, whereas it acts as a [[depressant]] (inhibiting the flow of signals between
nerve cells). In even larger doses, nicotine is a lethal poison, affecting the
heart, blood vessels, and hormones.&lt;ref name="betterhealth.vic.gov.au"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Smoking - effects on your body - Better Health Channel|url = http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Smoking_effects_on_your_body|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbon monoxide and Tar are also chemicals found in cigarettes that effect health severely. Carbon monoxide makes it harder for red blood cells to
carry oxygen throughout the body, and tar is a mixture of substances that together
form a sticky mass in the lungs. Therefore, when a cigarette is smoked, the amount of tar inhaled
into the lungs increases. Most of the chemicals inhaled in cigarette
smoke stay in the lungs, so although the more smoke being inhaled is creating a better feeling, its also creating greater damage to the lungs.&lt;ref name="betterhealth.vic.gov.au"/&gt;

[[File:Marijuana-Cannabis-Weed-Bud-Gram.jpg|left|thumb|Marijuana mixture.]]

=== Cannabis (Marijuana) ===
[[Cannabis]],
in particular marijuana, is a common street and recreational illegal drug.
Marijuana is made from dried leaves, flowers,
stems, and seeds from the hemp plant, [[cannabis sativa]]. The hemp plant contains
the active ingredient tetra-hydro-cannabinol ([[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]]), which is a mind-altering
chemical that creates a high when smoked.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = DrugFacts: Marijuana {{!}} National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)|url = http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana|website = www.drugabuse.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-01|first = National Institute on Drug|last = Abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana is
commonly smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes, pipes, or water pipes ([[bong]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s),
however it can be used in vaporisers, turned
into a tea, or used as an ingredient in foods as an edible. The THC in marijuana is responsible for
changing how the brain works, by distorting how the mind perceives the world
and making the heart beat faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marijuana|url = https://teens.drugabuse.gov/drug-facts/marijuana|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In particular marijuana is used to heighten perception, affect mood, and feel
relaxed: it alters senses, sense of time, changes in mood, impaired body
movement (coordination), difficultly in thinking (judgment), and impaired
memory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When marijuana is being used
as an adolescent, the chances of getting addicted
increase almost instantly. This is because adolescents who smoke marijuana are
twice as likely as adults to become addicted. Young
people believe that marijuana is a safe drug and it cannot be harmful because
it is "natural," however this is untrue.
Marijuana can cause changes in the brain that impair learning, this especially
effects adolescents as their brains have not finished developing. The drug impacts their brains heavily because it reduces
thinking, memory, and learning functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Hence, why adolescents are addicted easily. Marijuana is dangerous while being
a teenager as the effects to the brain impact their overall achievements and
outcomes during high school, which determine their future, and health.

"Young Australians (aged 14–24)
first try cannabis at 16.7 years on average. 14.8% of 12–17 year olds have
tried cannabis – it is the most commonly used illicit drug among this age group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Statistics - Drug Prevention &amp; Alcohol Facts - DrugInfo|url = http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/topics/quick-statistics#cannabis|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110425032922/http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/topics/quick-statistics#cannabis|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2011-04-25|website = www.druginfo.adf.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01|last = Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term health effects of marijuana include damages to the brain, heart, lungs, and reproductive
system, it also increases the development of [[anxiety]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[schizophrenia]],
and it can trigger acute [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Does Marijuana Kill Brain Cells?

=== Hookah ===
A [[hookah]] is s a single, or
multi-stemmed water pipe used for [[Vaporizing|vaporising]], and smoking flavored tobacco,
which is called shisha. The tobacco in shisha can be mixed with all sorts of flavours including mint, apple, peach, and or
fruit heads. The shisha is heated using charcoal that releases the flavours
when burnt in the water pipe, while inhaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Hookah And Is it A Safe Way To Smoke?|url = http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/smokingalternatives/p/Hookah-Information.htm|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smoke as result of the inhalation is passed through a
water basin first (often glass-based) before being inhaled and exhaled.

Hookah smoking is often a social event, which
allows the smokers to spend time together and talk as they pass the pipe
around. This form of smoking creates the higher risk of contracting a health
related smoking issue, as many hours can pass by while socialising and smoking,
it is the lengthy hours on end of smoking shisha which puts adolescents health
in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dangers Of Just One Evening Of Hookah Smoking|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2014/05/27/hookah-health_n_5374558.html?ir=Australia|website = Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-09-01|first = Amanda L.|last = Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hookah smoking is known to be the socially
acceptable way to smoke tobacco, however this claim is false. Hookah smoke can
contain concentrations of toxins, such as carbon monoxide, nicotine, tar, and
heavy metals. All of these toxins are as high, or higher than those that are
associated with cigarette smoke. This is due to the result when physically inhaling the shisha, as water in the basin does not get rid of the toxins in the shisha, it only enhances them. Several types of cancer and infectious
diseases are linked with smoking shisha. Health risks including: [[lung cancer]],
[[tuberculosis]], [[aspergillus]], [[helicobacter]] and [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr virus]], can be
contracted from the way the shisha is prepared, the smoking of the shisha, and
the sharing around of the mouthpiece connected to the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Other forms of tobacco favored by young people|url = http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/childandteentobaccouse/child-and-teen-tobacco-use-other-types|website = www.cancer.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronic Cigarettes ===
[[Electronic cigarette]]s, also known as e-cigarettes,
are small refillable devices that deliver nicotine and/or other chemicals through
a battery-powered system. The devices are
designed to stimulate the act of smoking tobacco cigarettes, but do not involve
the physical burning of tobacco. E-cigarettes use the
battery power to help inhale the vapor, which can be flavoured resembling things
such as fruit and candy.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) - Quit Victoria|url = http://www.quit.org.au/resource-centre/policy-advocacy/policy/e-cigarettes1|website = www.quit.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is through these flavours, which makes e-cigarettes
appealing to adolescents, although it is not warned how e-cigarettes can hook adolescents
on nicotine; which creates a lifelong nicotine addiction that could lead to the
use of more harmful tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = E-cigarettes - the good the bad and the ugly {{!}} Asthma Australia|url = http://www.asthmaaustralia.org.au/onAIR/E-cigarettes_-_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly.aspx#.VeV_hrQxHfY|website = www.asthmaaustralia.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic cigarettes are being marketed as cheap and healthier alternatives to cigarettes, as
well as an option for smokers when smoking is not permitted, since they do not
produce tobacco smoke. They are also seen as less harmful than cigarettes, but the short and long-term health
impacts of using electronic cigarettes remain unknown. However, there is a lot of debate regarding their safety as the Therapeutic Goods
Administration stated that, "The Australian Government is concerned about the
use of electronic cigarettes in Australia. The impact of wide scale use of
these devices on tobacco use is not known, and the outcome in the community
could be harmful." One major concern is the impact that e-cigarettes may have on the wider community,
including how they can be a gateway to smoking, or to nicotine addiction to new smokers,
particularly amongst adolescents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Health effects of smoking underage ==
Smoking harms nearly every organ in
the body, and adolescents who smoke have higher risks of developing health
issues sooner in life, rather than later. Smoking regardless of age causes health
issues including [[lung cancer]], [[Throat Cancer|throat cancer]], [[mouth cancer]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]],
[[stroke]]s, [[Respiratory disease|lung diseases]], diseases affecting the eyes, gums, [[blood vessel]]s, bones
and gut, and countless others.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Critics Choice - Oxygen|url = http://www.oxygen.org.au/criticschoice/page.asp?ID=smoking-in-australia|website = www.oxygen.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Risks form smoking-smoking can damage every part of the body.png|thumb|Smoking can damage every part of the body.]]
The younger someone starts to smoke,
the more likely they are to be heavy users of tobacco, and therefore, the
greater risk they have of obtaining poor health. Smoking during adolescence
causes serious [[Health effects of tobacco|health problems]], in regards to the [[Respiratory failure|respiratory]] and [[asthma]]-related
symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing spells, phlegm, increased frequent
headaches, and wheezing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Smoking
as an adolescent also impairs [[Lung|lung growth]], and causes the early onset of lung
function deterioration during late adolescence and early adulthood; this only
brings upon early addition to nicotine, and worse overall health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Deaths &amp; disease from smoking - Quit Victoria|url = http://www.quit.org.au/resource-centre/facts-evidence/fact-sheets/deaths-and-disease-from-smoking|website = www.quit.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate effects of smoking include
a rise in [[heart rate]] and [[blood pressure]], shaky hands, and a drop in skin
temperature as blood vessels compact in the fingertips and toes. An example of
this is the [[carbon monoxide]] in cigarettes, it reduces the ability of blood to
carry [[oxygen]], and the ability of muscle cells to take up oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Smoking in Australia - Quit Victoria|url = http://www.quit.org.au/criticschoice/critics-choice-smoking-in-australia|website = www.quit.org.au|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents
who smoke have higher increased stress levels than non-smokers, this is due to
re-occurring [[nicotine withdrawal]] symptoms, as nicotine makes the heart work
harder.

There are many
long-term health issues that come from the initiation of underage smoking.
Adolescents who continue to smoke can develop complications such as: [[Periodontitis|Gum]]
disease, [[tooth loss]], [[infertility]], [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]], chronic lung diseases, hearing
loss, [[Visual impairment|vision impairment]] (which can lead to blindness) and blood vessel diseases
(which can lead to heart attacks or strokes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Child and Teen Tobacco Use|url = http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/tobaccocancer/childandteentobaccouse/child-and-teen-tobacco-use-child-and-teen-tobacco-use|website = www.cancer.org|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are only some major health
issues that can be caught, hence why it is important for young people to not
fall into the trap of smoking at a young age, as it could ruin the rest of
their adult life.

== Education ==
Students who smoke are more likely to
feel more negatively towards school, to miss school more often, to perform less
well academically, to engage in early school misbehaviour, and to drop out of
school at an earlier age than non-smokers. Mark Wheeler (2011), found a relationship with smoking and the brain,
the greater an underage child’s addiction to nicotine is, the less active the
[[prefrontal cortex]] was, which suggests that smoking affects [[brain function]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tobacco smoking impacts teens' brains, UCLA study shows|url = http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/teen-brains-impacted-by-smoking-192660|website = UCLA Newsroom|accessdate = 2015-09-01|first = Mark|last = Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"As the prefrontal cortex continues to develop during the critical period of adolescence, smoking may influence the trajectory of [[Neural development|brain development]] and affect the function of the prefrontal cortex," (London, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DailyTech - Teen Smoking Linked to Reduced Brain Activity|url = http://www.dailytech.com/Teen+Smoking+Linked+to+Reduced+Brain+Activity/article21072.htm|website = www.dailytech.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that there is a definite link between teen substance
abuse and how well you do in school. Ultimately this affects the way your
brain processes and retains information—and how you think, learn, remember,
focus, and concentrate. Teens who abuse
drugs have lower grades, a higher rate of absence from school and other
activities, and an increased potential for dropping out of school. Youth smoking can biologically reduce
learning productivity, while also reducing adolescent’s motivation to go to
school, where smoking is forbidden.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Does Drug Use Affect Your High School Grades? {{!}} Just Think Twice|url = http://www.justthinktwice.com/how-does-drug-use-affect-your-high-school-grades|website = www.justthinktwice.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana, for example, affects your attention,
memory, and ability to learn. Its effects can last for days or weeks after the
drug wears off. So, if a student were smoking marijuana daily, they would not
be functioning at their best capable ability. Therefore, students who smoke marijuana tend to
get lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school. With saying that, students in their last years
of high school who drop out before graduation are more likely than their peers
to be smokers.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This
makes students’ chances of graduating high school with good grades and
furthermore attend college, or obtain a college degree less likely than
non-smokers in high school.

Providing an adequate '''[[water supply]] for Hong Kong''' has always been difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate [[groundwater]] sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard [[granite]] [[bedrock]] found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand is met by importing water from the [[Dong River (China)|Dongjiang River]] in neighbouring [[Guangdong]] province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed by the use of seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = N. K. | title = The Changing Nature of Border, Scale and the Production of Hong Kong's Water Supply System since 1959 | doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.12060 | journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research | pages = | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Water supply in Hong Kong initially came only from local sources, including numerous small dams built in the valleys of the territory.

===Water rationing===
[[File:HK queue for water 1963.jpg|thumb|Residents waiting for fresh water during drought period]]
Until 1964 water rationing was a constant reality for Hong Kong residents, occurring more than 300 days per year. The worst crisis occurred in 1963–64 when water was delivered only every 4 days for 4 hours each time. The territory, which was under British colonial administration, then embarked on a three-pronged approach to supply water to an increasing population. (Hong Kong's population increased from 1.7 million in 1945 to about 6 million in 1992.) The strategy involved seawater flushing, the construction of larger freshwater reservoirs in bays that used to be covered by the sea, and water imports from mainland China.&lt;ref name=Chau/&gt;

===Seawater flushing===
In 1955 seawater was first used to flush toilets in a pilot scheme. This was followed by installation of [[seawater flushing]] systems in all new houses and in selected districts beginning in 1957.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Water Supply in Hong Kong (1946–2007)|url=http://www.wsd.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/TWM.pdf|work=Total Water Management|publisher=Water Supply Department|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 legislation was introduced to promote seawater flushing on a larger scale, followed by substantial investments in a separate network. However, the system was unpopular due to the need to build a separate plumbing network in each house. Seawater initially was sold, but from 1972 on it was provided for free and the costs of the system were recovered through the drinking water tariff.  In 1991, about 65 percent of Hong Kong's households used seawater for flushing. By 1999, the number of conforming households had increased to 79 percent.&lt;ref name=Century/&gt;

===Freshwater reservoirs in the sea===
[[Image:Shek Pik Reservoir 3.jpg|thumb|The Shek Pik Reservoir was the first reservoir in Hong Kong built in a sea bay.]]
In 1957 construction began on the first dam that would close off a natural sea bay and create the [[Shek Pik Reservoir]]. The reservoir was built to store freshwater that previously had been "lost to the sea" during the rainy season. The reservoir was completed in 1963. The completion of Shek Pik reservoir was followed by the construction of two larger reservoirs of the same type. After the [[Plover Cove Reservoir]] was completed in 1968, water rationing was discontinued until 1977. With the completion of the [[High Island Reservoir]] in 1978, continuous water supply was re-established. Water rationing was renewed for the last time in 1980–81. Between 1965 and 1982 water had to be rationed seven times, often for many months with interruptions of up to 16 hours per day. To maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness, rationing was imposed only on residential users. Industry, the city's main water user, was exempted from rationing. The need for rationing was finally overcome in 1982 thanks to water imports.&lt;ref name=Chau/&gt;

===Water imports===
[[Image:WatersupplyinHKfromPRC.png|thumb|left|200px|Dong Jiang-Shenzhen water supply system]]
In 1960 Hong Kong began importing water from outside its borders through the Dongjiang – Shenzhen (Dongshen) Water Supply Scheme. After many extensions and upgrades the current system consists of a pipeline from Qiaotou Town of Dongguan to a reservoir in Shenzhen next to Hong Kong. Water imports from the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] have increased gradually from 23 million cubic meters per year (under a 1960 agreement) to 1100 million cubic meters per year (under a fifth agreement signed in 1989). Water imports thus played a crucial role in alleviating Hong Kong's water crisis, accounting for 70 percent of the territory's water supply in 1991. The People's Republic of China has never exercised the "water weapon" in its relationship with Hong Kong. China needed foreign exchange and between 1979 and 1991 alone Hong Kong paid China almost 4 billion Hong Kong Dollars (about US$500 million applying the 1991 exchange rate) for water imports.&lt;ref name=Chau/&gt;

===Desalination intermezzo===
[[Desalination]] was a source of water in Hong Kong between 1975 and 1981.  A large desalination plant was commissioned in [[Lok on Pai]] in 1975, but was decommissioned again in 1981 because its operation was more expensive than importing water from [[Dongjiang]].&lt;ref name=Century&gt;{{cite web|last=Government of Hong Kong|title=Waterworks of a Century|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/water150/mbook/TEXT/TEXT_ENG/Construction/construction_p3.html|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protecting raw water quality===
The pollution of raw water supplied to Hong Kong became an increasing concern that triggered a variety of activities designed to protect the quality of raw water. In 1998 the intake of the water pipeline was moved further upstream on the Dongjiang River where water quality was better. In 2003 an 83&amp;nbsp;km dedicated aqueduct was completed, thus reducing the vulnerability of the supply to pollution. Additionally, wastewater treatment plants were constructed in settlements in the Dongjiang basin and polluting industries were removed, thus protecting the water at the source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Water Supplies Department|title=Dongjiang Raw Water|url=http://www.wsd.gov.hk/en/water_resources/raw_water_sources/dongjiang_raw_water/index.html|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a Water Supply Agreement was signed with [[Guangdong Province]] for a "flexible" supply of Dongjiang water.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The agreement allows for less water to be withdrawn when reservoirs in Hong Kong are full, and more water to be withdrawn in times of drought, while the annual payment remains the same. Under the new agreement, Hong Kong paid fixed lump sums of HK$2,959 million, HK$3,146 million and HK$3,344 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Government of Hong Kong Press Release|title=Agreement ensures stable supply of Dongjiang Water to Hong Kong|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200812/11/P200812110098.htm|accessdate=26 November 2011|date=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total water management===
In 2003 the government of Hong Kong announced what it called a "total water management programme". In 2005 a study was commissioned and the results were broadly discussed. Based on the study the government reaffirmed its approach to water management, but also started new initiatives concerning leakage reduction, water conservation, [[greywater]] reuse, [[rainwater harvesting]], as well as pilots for the reuse of [[reclaimed water]] and [[desalination]]. For example, the government plans to provide reclaimed water from [[Shek Wu Hui Sewage Treatment Works]] for consumers in [[Sheung Shui]] and [[Fanling]] for toilet flushing and other non-potable uses, as well as pilot desalination plants in [[Tuen Mun]] and [[Ap Lei Chau]].&lt;ref name=TWM&gt;{{cite web|title=Total Water Management|url=http://www.wsd.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/pdf/TWM.pdf|publisher=Water Supply Department|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desalination comeback===
Because the price of imported water increased from $1 to $3 per cubic meter, the Hong Kong authorities announced in 2011 that the government would build a 50,000 cubic meter per day seawater desalination plant. The plant will allow greater resiliency against droughts that may become more severe due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=HK Magazine|title=A New Desalination Plant in Hong Kong|url=http://hk.asia-city.com/health/article/new-desalination-plant-hong-kong|accessdate=12 August 2012|date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of water==
Hong Kong's three main sources of water are supplied from [[Guangdong Province]]; internal freshwater sources stored in reservoirs; and seawater used for flushing toilets. [[Dongjiang]] is Hong Kong's major source of water. The designed maximum capacity of the supply system is 1.1 billion cubic metres per annum. The supply contract, costing HK$2 billion a year, has helped the city's economy grow without the interruption caused by water shortages, although the payment constitutes only 0.15 percent of Hong Kong's HK$1.3 trillion gross domestic product. About one-third of Hong Kong's 1,098 square kilometres has been developed as water catchments including reservoirs behind dams on land and three 'reservoirs in the sea', the [[Shek Pik Reservoir]], the [[Plover Cove Reservoir]] and the [[High Island Reservoir]].

An interesting facet of the waterworks is the seawater supply system with its separate networks of distribution mains, treatment facilities for screening and disinfection, pumping stations and service reservoirs. Eighty (80) percent of the population, including nearly all housing estates in [[Hong Kong Island]] and other densely populated districts, receive sea water for flushing. Some remote districts in the New Territories and some outlying islands do not use the system.&lt;ref name=Chau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chau|first=K.W.|title=Management of limited water resources in Hong Kong|journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development|year=1993|volume=9|issue=1|pages=68–72|doi=10.1080/07900629308722574|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07900629308722574?journalCode=cijw20|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an average of about 740,000 cubic metres of seawater was supplied each day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Water Supply Department|title=Seawater for flushing|url=http://www.wsd.gov.hk/en/water_resources/water_treatment_and_distribution_process/seawater_for_flushing/index.html|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; up from 330,000 cubic meters each day in 1990/91. Seawater is used to flush toilets and accounts for about 22 percent of total water use in 2008–09.

==Consumption==
More than 70 percent of Hong Kong's water is used by industry and services, particularly the textile, metal-working and electronics sectors in manufacturing, hotels and restaurants in services.&lt;ref name=Chau/&gt;

Hong Kong's water infrastructure consists of the following water treatment plants, pumping stations and reservoirs.

===Water treatment===
The supply is fully treated by chemical coagulation, [[sedimentation]] (at most treatment works), [[filtration]], [[pH]] value correction, [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[fluoridation]]. The water is soft in character and conforms in all respects – both [[chemistry|chemically]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriologically]] – to standards for [[drinking water]] set by the [[World Health Organization]]. Residents often prefer to boil the water before drinking, but this is generally not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Water Supplies Department, Water Quality FAQ | url = http://www.wsd.gov.hk/en/faqs/water_quality/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main water treatment plants are:

===Sanitation===
There are a total of 67 sewage treatment facilities in Hong Kong, including 40 in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and Outlying Islands and 27 in the New Territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drainage Services Department|title=List of Sewage Treatment Facilities|url=http://www.dsd.gov.hk/EN/Sewerage/Sewage_Treatment_Facilities/List_of_Sewage_Treatment_Facilities/index.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the largest facilities is the [[Sha Tin Sewage Treatment Works]] covering an area of 28 hectares. It was commissioned in three stages in 1982, 1986 and 2004. In 2012 a study was announced to relocate the facility to mountain caverns using compact advanced treatment systems to free up the land for housing and other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=China Daily|title=Hong Kong Considers Sewage Plant Relocation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutional framework ==
The [[Water Supplies Department]] collects, stores, purifies and distributes potable water to consumers, and provides adequate new resources and installations to maintain a satisfactory standard of water supply. The department also supplies [[seawater]] for flushing toilets. The [[Drainage Services Department]] is responsible for sanitation.
