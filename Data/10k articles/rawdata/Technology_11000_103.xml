'''Arlene Joy Harris''' (born June 6, 1948), also known as the "First Lady of Wireless,"&lt;ref name="mvno"&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/jitterbug-anti-mvno/2007-06-15 "Jitterbug: the anti-MVNO"], FierceWireless.com, June 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xconomy"&gt;[http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2009/03/13/the-first-lady-of-wireless-built-mobile-startup-to-send-message-of-simplicity "The First Lady of Wireless Built Mobile startup to Send Message of Simplicity"], Xconomy, San Diego, March 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;[http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0917/060.html "One Trick Pony"], Forbes.com, January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rcr"&gt;[http://www.rcrwireless.com/article/20070526/sub/wireless-hall-of-fame-arlene-harris Wireless Hall of Fame – Arlene Harris], RCR Wireless, May 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; is an entrepreneur and inventor, who holds numerous  wireless communications [[patents]].&lt;ref name="rcr"/&gt; In May, 2007 she was the first woman inducted into the Wireless Hall of Fame.

==Career==

In 1983 Harris co-founded Cellular Business Systems Inc. (CBSI),&lt;ref name="fiercewireless"&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/special-reports/arlene-harris ''Arlene Harris - Top US Wireless Inventors of All Time''] FierceWireless.com, October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; (sold to [[Cincinnati Bell]], now [[Convergys]]) where she guided the development of the leading billing/[[Customer relationship management|CRM]] service bureau in the early cellular industry.&lt;ref name="mvno"/&gt; She personally specified and directed the development of the first automated cellular service activation systems now used globally in retail locations to remotely and instantly activate cellular phones.{{fact|date=November 2016}} While at CBSI Harris served as one of three FCC committee members challenged to develop intersystem [[roaming]] protocols. The committee was established to create  methods for   cellular companies to bill customers who visited their networks. The committee's work resulted in the Cellular Inter-carrier Billing Exchange Record (CIBER) used throughout the cellular industry.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

In 1986 Harris launched Dyna LLC in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and later relocated to Del Mar, California, as a home base to incubate and spin out new ideas and help young companies.&lt;ref name="fiercewireless"/&gt;  

Harris founded the software company Subscriber Computing, Inc.&lt;ref name="mvno"/&gt; (merged with Corsair, now [[CyberSource]]) in 1986; her team built and delivered systems to the largest paging companies in the world and provided the first converged billing systems for cellular and the Internet to global leaders, including [[British Telecom]] and [[Hutchison 3G|Hutchinson]].{{fact|date=November 2016}} In 1988, she led the Company's implementation of the first communications methods used to support access to cellular services by low and no credit consumers. The concept became known as "prepaid" cellular service and has grown to become one of the primary forms of subscriber relationship and payments in the cellular industry.{{fact|date=November 2016}}  

In 1986, Harris founded Cellular Pay Phone, Inc. (CPPI) where she developed her first patented invention, the first program-controlled end-to-end management system (created with OKI Electronics and Motorola). This offering made CPPI the first [[Niche market|niche]] cellular reseller in history to create a special cellular phone and a tightly integrated system to support cellular with automated payments by credit card.&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59879475.html/''Enterprising Women of Wireless,''] Wireless Week, February 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by Harris in 1994 and under her guidance,{{fact|date=November 2016}} SOS Wireless Communications developed the first consumer oriented reseller of cellular service designed especially for safety. Like the payphone business SOS developed a custom phone and service for making outgoing calls for urgent communications. SOS customers were primarily older Americans who adopted cellular service to keep them safe while on the road.&lt;ref name="wirelessweek"/&gt;

Harris acquired cellular carrier Accessible Wireless in 2001 to provide a home carrier service for offerings targeting typically low usage applications. Accessible and SOS both supported the founding of Harris' next company [[GreatCall]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobihealthnews.com/368/jitterbug-mobile-entertainment-tech-for-mhealth/ ''Jitterbug: Mobile Entertainment Tech for mHealth,''] Mobihealthnews, February 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

GreatCall is the first complete end-to-end value-added service provider in the cellular industry to focus on simplicity with primary emphasis on [[baby boomers]] and senior citizens. At GreatCall  Harris  led the development of the Jitterbug phone&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/08/peek-blackberry-gadgets-tech-personal-cx_ew_1008peek.html/ ''Gadgets we Crave.

Additionally, GreatCall won the wireless industry's coveted Andrew Seybold Choice Award for "Best New Company" at CTIA in 2007 and the American Society on Aging's Award for "Best Small Business in 2008."&lt;ref name="xconomy"/&gt;

A '''boxcar averager''' (alternative names are '''gated integrator''' and '''boxcar integrator''') is an [[electronic test instrument]] that [[integral|integrates]] the signal input voltage after a defined waiting time (trigger delay) over a specified period of time (gate width) and then averages over multiple integration results (samples) – for a mathematical description see [[boxcar function]].

[[File:Boxcar averager UHFLI Zurich Instruments picture instrument front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zurich Instruments]] boxcar averager.]]
The main purpose of this measurement technique is to improve signal to noise ratio in pulsed experiments with often low [[duty cycle]] by the following three mechanisms: 1) signal integration acts as a first averaging step that strongly suppresses noise components with a frequency of the reciprocal gate width and higher, 2) time-domain based selection of signal parts that actually carry information of interest and neglect of all signal parts where only noise is present, and 3) averaging over a defined number of periods provides [[low-pass filter]]ing and convenient adjustment of time resolution.

[[File:Boxcarsim timedomain.svg|thumb|Timing diagram of a boxcar averager.]]
Similar to [[lock-in amplifier]]s, boxcar averagers are mostly used for the analysis of periodic signals. Whereas the lock-in can be understood as sophisticated band pass filters with adjustable center frequency and bandwidth, the boxcar averager allows to define the signal of interest and resulting time resolution mostly in the time domain.

== Principle of operation ==
The boxcar operation is defined by a trigger delay, a gate width and the number of trigger events (i.e., samples) that are averaged over in the buffer.

The principle of operation can be understood as a two-step process: signal integration over the desired gate width and  averaging the integrated signal over a defined amount of periods/trigger events

Considering a simple implementation of the core circuitry looks like regular RC [[low-pass filter]] that can be gated by a switch S.

[[File:Gated integrator circuit diagram.svg|thumb|Equivalent circuit diagram describing the core functionality of a gated integrator.]]
Provided the filter time constant τ = RC  is set to sufficiently large values with respect to the gate width, the output voltage is to a good approximation the integral of the input signal with a signal bandwidth of B = 1/(4RC). The output of this filter can then be subjected to another analog circuit for subsequent averaging. After each trigger event this sampling circuit has to be set back before receiving the next pulse. The time it takes for this reset is one of the major speed limitations for analog implementations, where maximum trigger rates of a few 10&amp;nbsp;kHz are typical even though the gate width itself can be as low as a few ten picoseconds and delay is set to zero.

== History ==
The origin of the boxcar averager dates back to as early as 1950 where the technique helped to improve signal quality in experiments investigating nuclear magnetic resonances with pulsed schemes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Ware and P. Mansfield mention in a publication of 1966 “Much of the early work on “boxcar” circuits, including a theoretical analysis is contained in J. L. Lawson and G. E. Uhlenbeck, Threshold Signals, MIT Radiation Laboratory Series (McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York, 1950; J. L. Lawson and G. E. Uhlenbeck, Threshold Signals, MIT Radiation Laboratory Series (McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc., New York, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;). The first reported application of "boxcar circuits to NMR was Holcomb and Norberg".&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Holcomb and R. E. Norberg, Phys. Rev. 98, 1074 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of Scientific Instruments, 37, 9, 1167, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; In their 1955 paper Holcomb and Norberg credit the invention of the “boxcar integrator” to a large extent to L. S. Kypta and H. W. Knoebel.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The '''CBU-72''' was a 550-pound American [[Thermobaric weapon|fuel-air]] [[cluster bomb]] used by the [[United States Military]] until 1996.  It was very effective against armored vehicles, aircraft parked in the open, bunkers, and minefields.

==Design==
The CBU-72 consisted of three [[Thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosive]] (FAE) submunitions. Each submunition weighed about 100 pounds and dispensed a cloud approximately 60 feet in diameter and 8 feet thick composed of its 75 pounds of [[ethylene oxide]] aerosol fuel across the target area, with air-burst fusing set for 30 feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/cbu-72.htm CBU-72 / BLU-73/B Fuel/Air Explosive (FAE) - Dumb Bombs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An embedded detonator ignited the cloud as it descended to the ground to produce a massive explosion.
The high-pressure of the rapidly expanding wave front flattened all objects within close proximity of the epicenter of the fuel cloud, as well as causing debilitating damage well beyond it. Like other FAE using ethylene oxide, in the event of non-ignition, it functions as a [[chemical weapon]], due to the highly toxic nature of this gas.

==History of use==
First-generation [[CBU-55]] and CBU-72 fuel-air weapons were used in the [[Vietnam War]]. A second generation of FAE weapons were based on those, and were used by the United States in [[Iraq]] during [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cbu-72.htm CBU-72 / BLU-73/B Fuel/Air Explosive (FAE) - Dumb Bombs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 254 CBU-72s were dropped by the [[United States Marine Corps]], mostly from [[A-6E]]s. They were targeted against mine fields and personnel in trenches, but were more useful as a [[psychological weapon]].

After Desert Storm, the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marines Corps|Marines]] removed their remaining FAE weapons from service, and by 1996, they had been transferred for demilitarization. By the middle of 2001, only a few hundred remained in existence, awaiting demilitarization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''cXML (commerce eXtensible Markup Language)''' is a [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]], created by [[Ariba]] in 1999, intended for communication of business documents between [[procurement]] applications, [[e-commerce]] hubs and suppliers. cXML is based on [[XML]] and provides formal [[XML schema]]s for standard business transactions, allowing programs to modify and validate documents without prior knowledge of their form.

The protocol does not include the full breadth of interactions some parties may wish to communicate.  However, it can be expanded through the use of extrinsic elements and newly defined domains for various identifiers. This expansion is the limit of point-to-point configurations necessary for communication.

The current protocol includes documents for setup (company details and transaction profiles), catalogue content, application integration (including the widely used PunchOut feature), original, change and delete purchase orders and responses to all of these requests, order confirmation and ship notice documents (cXML analogues of [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] 855 and 856 transactions) and new invoice documents.

PunchOut is a protocol for interactive sessions managed across the Internet, a communication from one application to another, achieved through a dialog of real-time, synchronous cXML messages, which support user interaction at a remote site.  This protocol is most commonly used today in the form of Procurement PunchOut, which specifically supports interactions between a procurement application and a supplier’s eCommerce web site and possibly includes an intermediary for authentication and version matching. The buyer leaves or "punches out" of their company's system and goes to the supplier's web-based catalog to locate and add items to their shopping cart, while their application transparently maintains connection with the web site and gathers pertinent information. A vendor catalog, enhanced for this process, is known as a punchout catalog. PunchOut enables communication between the software and the web site so that relevant information about the transaction is delivered to the appropriate channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chieu |first1=Trieu C. |last2=Fu |first2=Shiwa S. |last3=Pinel |first3=Florian |last4=Yih |first4=Jih-Shyr |chapter=Unified solution for procurement integration and B2B stores |title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Electronic Commerce - ICEC 2003 |editor-last1=Sadeh |editor-first1=Norman M. |editor-last2=Dively |editor-first2=Mary Jo |editor-last3=Kauffman |editor-first3=Robert J. |editor-last4=Labrou |editor-first4=Yannis |editor-last5=Shehory |editor-first5=Onn |editor-last6=Telang |editor-first6=Rahul |editor-last7=Cranor |editor-first7=Lorrie Faith |volume=September 30-October 3, 2003 |pages=61–67 |isbn=1-58113-788-5 |doi=10.1145/948005.948014 |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA |publisher=ACM Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

* Easy to implement automated order receipt, fulfilment updates and catalogue transport
* Many sell-side solutions come with the protocol out of the box
* cXML supports remote shopping session ([https://www.punchout2go.com/frequently-asked-questions/what-punchout-catalog/ PunchOut]) transactions
* Extensible: If your buyer relationships require more information than cXML supports intrinsically, that data may still be sent end-to-end
* Leverages XML, which is a robust open language for describing information
* cXML leaves much of the syntax from [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]] behind

== Proprietary issues ==

cXML is published based on the input of many companies, and is controlled by Ariba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=cXML.org|title=cXML FAQ, item #10|url=http://cxml.org/prnews/faq.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; cXML is a protocol that is published for free on the Internet along with its [[XML#DTD|DTD]]. It is open to all for their use without restrictions apart from publications of modifications and naming that new protocol. Essentially, everyone is free to use cXML with any and all modifications as long as they don't publish their own standard and call it "cXML".   Beginning in February 1999, the cXML standard has been available for all to use. The details of its license agreement are found at http://cxml.org/license.html.

A '''curtain rod''', '''curtain rail''', or '''traverse rod''' is a device used to suspend [[curtain]]s, usually above [[window]]s or along the edges of [[shower]]s or [[bathtub]]s, though also wherever curtains might be used. When found in bathrooms, curtain rods tend to be [[Telescoping (mechanics)|telescopic]] and self-fixing, while curtain rods in other areas of the home are often affixed with decorative [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] or [[finial]].

==Bathtubs==
[[File:BernheimerHouseTub.jpg|thumb|Circled bathtub rod and curtain ]]
Bathtubs can use L shaped or circle rod, mainly when only one wall and be used.

== Making ==

Curtain rods can be made of many materials including- wood, metal and plastic. Curtain rods come in almost endless styles and designs. Not all curtain rods are simple straight poles; curved and hinged poles are available from numerous companies, allowing installation in bay windows and around curved walls and corners. Curtain rods can also be shaped like a crane or exhibit a swing arm design. Prices and quality of curtain rods are as varied as designs from inexpensive big box store products to high end specialty products made by companies catering to interior designers and architects.

==History==


18 years following the invention of the curtain rod by Samuel R. Scrottron in 1892, the flat, telescoping curtain rod was invented by Charles W. Kirsch, of [[Sturgis, Michigan|Sturgis]], [[Michigan]], in 1907. However, they were not in use until the 1920s. Kirsch also invented the traverse curtain rod in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bungalow details: interior|publisher=Gibbs Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Gwd99wUthMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Charles+W.+Kirsch+and+curtain+rod&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eFdyToiSOsKbtwei-Yn-CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1829">The '''Customer Service System''' ('''CSS''') of the [[BT Group]] (previously British Telecommunications) is the core operational support system for BT, bringing in 70% of income for the company (figures from 1997). BT rolled out CSS nationally in 1989 and provided an integrated system for telephony—order handling, repair handling and billing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/bttj/1997/00000015/00000001/00176305 IngentaConnect Customer Service System - past, present and future&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001090829/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/bttj/1997/00000015/00000001/00176305 |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT Customer Service System (BT/CSS) was developed by [[Logica]] in 1984, costing £1bn to implement, representing the largest computer project undertaken in Europe and the largest integrated database in the world, at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Customer Service and Support - History and Milestones | url=http://allsupportjobs.com|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Note: logicacmg now redirects to CGI; I assume the latter bought the former at some point.--&gt;

In 2005, the CSS databases deployed by BT handled 23 million customers, with 13 terabytes of data spread out over 28 mainframe images.  The databases supported 230 million transactions per day generated by over 40,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/2005/05/25-schema/BT.html | title=XML Schema and Web Services | publisher=British Telecom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSS is still used by BT but it is now controlled by Openreach. BT retail migrated all accounts from CSS to a new billing system known as Geneva/Oneview/Avalon. This was to support the migration to WLR3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">A '''data service unit''', sometimes called a digital service unit, is a piece of [[telecommunication]]s circuit terminating equipment that transforms digital data between telephone company lines and local equipment. The device converts [[bipolar signal|bipolar digital signals]] coming ultimately from a digital circuit and directly from a [[Channel service unit]] (CSU), into a format (e.g. RS- 530) compatible with the piece of [[data terminal equipment]] (DTE) (e.g. a router) to which the data is sent. The DSU also performs a similar process in reverse for data heading from the DTE toward the circuit. The telecommunications service a DSU supports can be a point-to-point or multipoint operation in a [[digital data]] network.

A DSU is a two or more port device; one port is called the WAN ([[Wide Area Network]]) port and the other is called a DTE port. The purpose of the DSU is to transfer serial data synchronously between the WAN port and the DTE ports. If more than one DTE port is used, the DSU assigns the DTE data according to time slots (channels) on the WAN side.

On the WAN side, the DSU, via a CSU, interfaces with a digital carrier such as [[Digital Signal 1|DS1]] or [[Digital Signal 3|DS3]] or a low speed Digital Data Service. On the DTE side, the DSU provides control lines, timing lines and appropriate physical and electrical interface. To maintain the synchronous relationship between the ports, the DSU manages timing by slaving ports to the bit rate of another or to its internal clock. Typically, the DTE port provides timing to the data terminal equipment while the WAN port dictates the rate.

DSUs usually include some maintenance capabilities. At minimum, they can loop data back at either the WAN or DTE ports, or at both. When only one port is looped back, the data received at that port is simultaneously sent back toward the port and passed in normal fashion to the other port. Most DSUs also allow various data patterns to be generated and monitored to measure error rate of the communication link.  A DSU may be a separate piece of equipment, or may be combined in a [[CSU/DSU]].

A '''directional well''' is an oil industry term for an [[oil well]] with a [[borehole]] that deviates from a vertically straight line. This is normally done with the intention of hitting several target sands, for instance.

'''Drumeo''', an acronym for ''drum education online'', is an online [[drum]] learning platform known for offering drum lessons to students.&lt;ref name="ABBY"&gt;{{cite news | last =Butler  | first =Alex | title =Drums lessons from Abbotsford teachers make their way around the world | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''abbynews.com''| date =27 October 2013 | url =https://www.abbynews.com/news/drums-lessons-from-abbotsford-teachers-make-their-way-around-the-world/ | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lee  | first =Jenny | title =Drumming up business online, one lesson at a time | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''vancouversun.com''| date =30 October 2013 | url =http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Drumming+business+online+lesson+time/9104255/story.html | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Drumeo was  launched  in 2012 by  Jared Falk  and Rick Kettner  with its physical location in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="BCB"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Why star drummers are drawn to Abbotsford | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''bcbusiness.ca''| date =6 July 2018 | url =https://www.bcbusiness.ca/Why-star-drummers-are-drawn-to-Abbotsford | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =The Fastest Way to Get Faster: A 10-Day Plan To Bump Up Your BPMs | newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''drummagazine.com''| date =4 April 2017 | url =http://drummagazine.com/faster/ | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the launching of the  platform, Jared had been teaching private drum lessons touring as musician for years.&lt;ref name="ABBY"/&gt; Rick, on the other hand, used to film simple video lessons for online drum message boards. Both later teamed up and created the online drum learning platform.&lt;ref name="ABBY"/&gt;

In 2016, Drumeo released the ''Drumeo P4 Practice Pad'' which offers four different playing surfaces, compared to the traditional one-surface practice pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Yannick | first = | title =Best Drum Practice Pad 2018 – 6 Top Reviews, 1 Winner| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''kickstartyourdrumming.com''| date =7 June 2017 | url =http://www.kickstartyourdrumming.com/best-drum-practice-pad/ | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by [[New York City|New York]] drummer Pat Petrillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Best Drum Practice Pad| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =''drumradar.com''| date = | url =https://www.drumradar.com/best-drum-practice-pad/ | accessdate =10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electronic bill payment''' is a feature of [[online banking|online]], [[Mobile banking|mobile]] and [[telephone banking]], similar in its effect to a [[giro]], allowing a customer of a [[financial institution]] to transfer money from their [[transaction account|transaction]] or [[credit card]] account to a [[creditor]] or [[vendor]] such as a [[public utility]], [[department store]] or an individual to be credited against a specific [[account (accountancy)|account]]. These payments are typically executed electronically as a [[direct deposit]] through a national [[payment system]], operated by the banks or in conjunction with the government.  Payment is typically initiated by the payer but can also be set up as a [[direct debit]].

In addition to the bill payment facility, most banks will also offer various features with their electronic bill payment systems. These include the ability to schedule payments in advance to be made on a specified date (convenient for installments such as mortgage and support payments), to save the biller information for reuse at a future time and various options for searching the recent payment history. In many cases the payment data can also be downloaded and posted directly into the customer's [[Accounting software|accounting]] or personal finance software.

==History==
Although this technology was available from the mid 1990s, uptake was initially slow until internet access by households increased. By 2000, adoption of electronic bill payment systems started to dramatically increase.

==Impact==
From the consumer's point of view, electronic payment of bills is cheaper, faster, and more convenient than writing, posting and reconciling cheques. In addition, though limitations exist, a wider range of bank accounts or credit cards can be used for the electronic payment of bills.

Using electronic bill presentment and payment enables businesses to fast-track customer payments and get access to funds faster, which in turn results in cash flow improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ippayments.com/site/?id=58&amp;p=Improvingcustomersatisfactionandcashflow |title=eBPP workshop at CeBIT Future of Payments 2012 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211203838/http://www.ippayments.com/site/?id=58&amp;p=Improvingcustomersatisfactionandcashflow |archive-date=December 11, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For banks the advantages of electronic bill payments are a reduction in processing costs minimizing paperwork and an increase in customer loyalty. In a 2003 study, the banks said that "customers who pay online show more loyalty and are more receptive to other offers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/21/business/banks-offer-sweeteners-to-paying-bills-online.html|title=Banks Offer Sweeteners To Paying Bills Online|last=Bayot|first=Jennifer|date=April 21, 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embryo space colonization''' is a [[theoretical]] [[interstellar travel|interstellar]] [[space colonization]] concept that involves sending a robotic mission to a habitable [[terrestrial planet]], [[dwarf planet]], [[minor planet]] or [[natural satellite]] transporting frozen early-stage human [[embryo]]s or the technological or biological means to create human embryos.&lt;ref name="Crowl, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowl|first=Adam|title=Embryo Space Colonisation to Overcome the Interstellar Time Distance Bottleneck|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2012.65.283|work=Journal of the British Interplnanetary Society, 65, 283-285, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas, 2006"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040621/travel.shtml| title=Cruising the Infinite: Strategies for Human Interstellar Travel| first=Paul| last= Lucas| date=2004-06-21| accessdate=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal circumvents the most severe technological problems of other mainstream interstellar colonization concepts. In contrast to the [[sleeper ship]] proposal, it does not require the more technically challenging 'freezing' of fully developed humans (see ''[[cryonics]])''.

==Various concepts==
{{Space colonization}}
Embryo space colonization concepts involve various concepts of delivering the embryos from [[Earth]] to an [[extrasolar planet]] around another star system. 
* The most straightforward concept is to make use of [[embryo cryopreservation]]. Modern medicine has made it possible to store frozen embryos in various low-development stages (up to several weeks into the development of the embryo).
* The technologically more challenging but more flexible scenario calls for just carrying the biological means to create embryos, that is various samples of donated [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] and [[Ovum|egg cells]].
* [[Self-replicating spacecraft|Self replicating machines]] could spread out to interstellar space, bring [[Mind uploading|uploaded human minds]] with them and/or receive them via radio or laser transmission and build artificial electronic brains/bodies as needed. The uploaded humans can raise the children.

==Mission at target planet==

Regardless of the "cargo" used in any embryo space colonization scenario, the basic concept is that upon arrival of the embryo-carrying spacecraft (EIS) at the target planet, fully [[Wiktionary:Autonomy|autonomous]] [[robot]]s would build the first settlement on the planet and start growing food. More ambitiously, the planet may be [[terraforming|terraformed]] first.&lt;ref name="Crowl, 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas, 2006"/&gt; Thereafter the first embryos could be unfrozen (or created using biosequenced or natural [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] and [[Ovum|egg cells]] as outlined above).

In any event, one of the technologies needed for the proposal are [[artificial uterus|artificial uteri]].&lt;ref name="Crowl, 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas, 2006"/&gt; The embryos would need to develop in such artificial uteri until a large enough population existed to procreate by natural biological means.

==Comparison to other interstellar colonization concepts==
* Proposals of [[sleeper ship]]s and [[generation ship]]s require very large spacecraft to transport humans, life support systems and other equipment or food as well as an even larger propulsion system for a long period in time. Even optimistic proposals would require such a major effort for such ships that the resources required on Earth would involve a large part of mankind devoted to the mission or would even exceed available resources. In contrast, an EIS would have feasible small dimensions in the range of today's [[spacecraft]], as the most important "cargo" would not need much space or weigh very much.
* [[Sleeper ship]] proposals call for freezing adult humans. While there is research into [[hibernation]], the complexity of a living fully developed human body may make the sleeper ship proposals much more difficult.&lt;ref name="Lucas, 2006"/&gt;
* While sleeper ships and generation ships would deliver to a prospective colony world a population that has undergone some degree of education, training, and socialization in areas reconcilable with those of the sponsor culture (e.g. historical, scientific, and technical education, language acquisition, an understanding of the original mission and broader cultural norms), individuals who are born into colony worlds through embryo space colonization would initially lack this education.&lt;ref name="Crowl, 2012"/&gt;

==Difficulties in implementing the concept==
[[Image:Artwork showing a blurred globe and other celestial bodies, inspired by the asteroid belt of HD 69830.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Artist's impression from 2005 of the planet [[HD 69830 d]]. Embryo space colonization depends on the existence of a habitable terrestrial [[exoplanet]].]]

Like every proposal for interstellar colonization, embryo space colonization depends on solutions to still-unsolved technological problems. Some of these are:
* '''Robotics''': Whether it will be possible to develop fully autonomous robots that can build the first settlement on the target planet and raise the first humans, is unclear. Because the initial probe must be maximally compact, the industrial robots that build the habitat would themselves have to be built autonomously from local materials. Though such technology does not yet exist, there are strong economic incentives to develop it, which are unrelated to space colonization.
* '''Artificial Intelligence''': It would be challenging to create an [[artificial intelligence]] that could serve as an adequate artificial parent and successfully raise human children who have no contact with other human beings. Its design would have to include strategies for the transmission of terrestrial culture and language, as well as the prerequisites for healthy psychological functioning, to persons who cannot interact with Earth.
* '''Artificial Uterus''': [[Artificial uterus|Artificial wombs]] exist today but they are not available for full-term development of fetuses. Human embryos have been successfully grown in artificial uteri for 13 days.&lt;ref&gt;Shahbazi, M. N., Jedrusik, A., Vuoristo, S., Recher, G., Hupalowska, A., Bolton, V., … Zernicka-Goetz, M. (2016). Self-organization of the human embryo in the absence of maternal tissues. Nature Cell Biology, 18, 700. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb3347&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shahbazi, M. N., Jedrusik, A., Vuoristo, S., Recher, G., Hupalowska, A., Bolton, V., … Zernicka-Goetz, M. (2016). Self-organization of the human embryo in the absence of maternal tissues. Nature Cell Biology, 18, 700. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb3347&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 14 day rule, codified into law in twelve countries, preventing human embryos from being kept in artificial uteri past 14 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/14-day-rule/|title=Should We Study Human Embryos Beyond 14 Days?|last=Morber|first=Jenny|date=26 Apr 2017|website=PBS Socal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Long-duration computers''': [[Computer]] hardware would need to function reliably over long periods of time, in the range of several thousands of years. 
* '''Propulsion''': Furthermore, a [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system would be required that could accelerate the EIS to a high speed and slow it down again upon nearing the destination.  Even assuming a speed one hundred times faster than any of today's space probes and a target planet within a couple of hundred light years would lead to a journey lasting several thousand years.
* '''Exoplanet found''': Finally this depends on the existence of an [[exoplanet]] qualifying for colonization within a reachable distance. Current science missions like [[COROT]], [[Kepler mission|Kepler]] or [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]] may very well yield results for this requirement within the next 3 to 4 years.{{when|date=May 2012}}

Further unknowns that affect the feasibility of embryo space colonization are:

* '''Biological''': Will genetic material survive intact on a space mission that could potentially last centuries? Exposure to [[cosmic rays]] is known to irreparably damage DNA. What other symbiotic lifeforms does a human need to live a healthy life? For example, [[gut flora]] and many other species of microorganisms may be necessary for proper biological and immunological functioning. Babies normally acquire these from their mothers and the wider environment, but this would not be the case for embryos in colonization ships.
* '''Ethical''': In addition to the question of whether it is technically feasible to raise children without human contact, there is the further question of whether this is morally permissible. It is found to be unethical to deliberately create children that will grow up without parents, yet embryo space colonization requires this. Controversial value judgments would also need to be made about whose DNA should be the basis of the space colony. Should they be selected by some metric of merit, or randomly from the general population? Either choice presents ethical problems. Should the parenting AI firmly steer the children to maximize the chances of the colony's success, or should it accept the risk of allowing them significant autonomy? Which languages and cultural values should be transmitted to the colonists? Should they be raised according to some value system that exists on Earth, or create one that is somehow optimized? Are there truths that should be kept from them? The possibility of a new civilization that starts without a cultural legacy might appeal to cults that want their values to become a norm for an entire society. Is it permissible to allow them have their own embryo colonies, where the AI indoctrinates the colonists only in the cult's value system? The difficulty of answering these and other ethical questions may become a non-technological obstacle to embryo space colonization.

[[Image:Diesel-smoke.jpg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|This diesel-powered truck emits an exhaust gas rich in black particulate matter when starting its engine.]]

'''Exhaust gas''' or [[flue gas]] is emitted as a result of the [[combustion]] of fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[gasoline]], petrol, biodiesel blends,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Omidvarborna|title=Characterization of particulate matter emitted from transit buses fueled with B20 in idle modes|journal=Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=2335–2342|doi=10.1016/j.jece.2014.09.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343714002140|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diesel fuel]], [[fuel oil]], or [[coal]]. According to the type of engine, it is discharged into the atmosphere through an [[exhaust pipe]], [[flue gas stack]], or [[propelling nozzle]]. It often disperses downwind in a pattern called an ''exhaust plume''.

It is a major component of [[motor vehicle]] emissions (and from stationary [[internal combustion engine]]s), which can also include:
* [[Crankcase]] blow-by
* Evaporation of unused gasoline

Motor vehicle emissions contribute to [[air pollution]] and are a major ingredient in the creation of [[smog]] in some large cities.  A 2013 study by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] indicates that 53,000 early deaths occur per year in the United States alone because of vehicle emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231013004548 | title = Air pollution and early deaths in the United States.

==Composition==
The largest part of most combustion gas is [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) (except with pure-carbon fuels), and [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (except for fuels without carbon); these are not toxic or noxious (although carbon dioxide is a [[greenhouse gas]] that contributes to [[global warming]]). A relatively small part of combustion gas is undesirable, noxious, or toxic substances, such as [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) from incomplete combustion, [[hydrocarbon]]s (properly indicated as C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, but typically shown simply as "HC" on emissions-test slips) from unburnt fuel, [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) from excessive combustion temperatures, and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] (mostly [[soot]]).

==Exhaust gas temperature==
Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is important to the functioning of the [[catalytic converter]] of an [[internal combustion engine]]. It may be measured by an [[exhaust gas temperature gauge]]. EGT is also a measure of engine health in gas-turbine engines (see below).

==Cold engines==
[[File:Exhaust.jpg|thumb|right|Steam from tailpipe of cold car]]
During the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours, the amount of emissions can be very high. This occurs for two main reasons:
* '''Rich air-fuel ratio requirement in cold engines''': When a cold engine is started, the fuel does not vaporize completely, creating higher emissions of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[nitrogen oxide]]s and [[carbon monoxide]], which diminishes only as the engine reaches operating temperature. The duration of this start-up phase has been reduced by advances in materials and technology, including [[Fuel injection#Electronic injection|computer-controlled fuel injection]], shorter intake lengths, and pre-heating of fuel and/or inducted air.
* '''Inefficient catalytic converter under cold conditions''': Catalytic converters are very inefficient until up to their [[operating temperature]]. This time has been much reduced by moving the converter closer to the exhaust manifold and even more so placing a small yet quick-to-heat-up converter directly at the exhaust manifold. The small converter handles the start-up emissions, which allows enough time for the larger main converter to heat up. Further improvements can be realised in many ways,&lt;ref&gt;Pulkrabek W.W. (2004) Engineering Fundamentals of the Internal Combustion Engine. Pearson Prentice Hall, new Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;  including electric heating, thermal battery, chemical reaction preheating, flame heating and superinsulation.

==Types==

===Internal-combustion engines===

====Spark-ignition engines====
{{see also|Automobile emissions control}}

In [[spark-ignition engine]]s the gases resulting from combustion of the fuel and air mix are called exhaust gases. The composition varies from petrol to diesel engines, but is around these levels:

The 10% oxygen for "diesel" is likely if the engine was idling, e.g. in a test rig. It is much less if the engine is running under load.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=====Nitromethane additive=====
Exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes [[nitromethane]] will contain [[nitric acid]] vapour, which is corrosive, and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe. People exposed to it should wear a [[gas mask]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turbofast.com.au/racefuel6.html|title=Race Fuel - Nitromethane|website=www.turbofast.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diesel engines====
:{{See also|Diesel exhaust|Soot}}

====Gas-turbine engines====
*In aircraft gas turbine engines, "exhaust gas temperature" (EGT) is a primary measure of engine health. Typically the EGT is compared with a primary engine power indication called "engine pressure ratio" (EPR). For example: at full power EPR there will be a maximum permitted EGT limit. Once an engine reaches a stage in its life where it reaches this EGT limit, the engine will require specific maintenance in order to rectify the problem. The amount the EGT is below the EGT limit is called EGT margin. The EGT margin of an engine will be greatest when the engine is new, or has been overhauled. For most airlines, this information is also monitored remotely by the airline maintenance department by means of [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]].

====Jet engines and rocket engines====
[[Image:Jet exhaust by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|What looks like exhaust from jet engines, is actually [[contrail]]. (Jet flying over the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]).]]
In [[jet engine]]s and [[rocket engine]]s, exhaust from [[propelling nozzle]]s which in some applications shows [[shock diamond]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Other types===

====From burning coal====
* [[Flue gas]]
* [[Flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion]]

====Steam engines====
In [[steam engine]] terminology the exhaust is steam that is now so low in pressure that it can no longer do useful work.

==Main motor vehicle emissions==

When oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) react in the presence of sunlight, ground level [[ozone]] is formed, a primary ingredient in [[smog]].

===Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)===
[[Carbon dioxide]] is a [[greenhouse gas]].

===Water vapour===
Vehicle exhaust contains much [[water vapour]].

====Water recovery====
There has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles' exhaust gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=recovering+water+from+diesel+exhaust&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=qI7hVsOSHYr3UKvnruAE#q=recovering+water+from+exhaust|title=recovering water from diesel exhaust - Google Search|website=www.google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pollution reduction==
{{see also | Air suction valve}}[[Emission standard]]s focus on reducing [[pollutant]]s contained in the exhaust gases from vehicles as well as from industrial flue gas stacks and other [[air pollution]] exhaust sources in various large-scale industrial facilities such as [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], natural gas processing plants, [[petrochemical]] plants and [[chemical]] production plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/peg_caa/pegcaain.html|title=EPA Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ap42/index.html US EPA Publication] AP 42, Fifth Edition, Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors&lt;/ref&gt; However, these are often referred to as [[flue gas]]es. [[Catalytic converter]]s in cars intend to break down the pollution of exhaust gases using a catalyst. [[Scrubber]]s in ships intend to remove the sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of marine exhaust gases. The regulations on marine sulfur dioxide emissions are tightening, however only a small number of special areas worldwide have been designated for low sulfur diesel fuel use only.

One of the advantages claimed for [[advanced steam technology]] engines is that they produce smaller quantities of toxic pollutants (e.g. oxides of nitrogen) than petrol and diesel engines of the same power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  They produce larger quantities of carbon dioxide but less carbon monoxide due to more efficient combustion.

==Health studies==
Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles School of Public Health say preliminary results of their statistical study of children listed in the California Cancer Registry born between 1998 and 2007 found that traffic pollution may be associated with a 5% to 15% increase in the likelihood of some cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/04/09/smog-exposure-during-pregnancy-might-raise-childs-cancer-risk-study | title = Smog Exposure During Pregnancy Might Raise Child's Cancer Risk: Study | date = 9 April 2013 | first = Steven | last = Reinberg | newspaper = USNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[World Health Organization]] study found that diesel fumes cause an increase in lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2012/pdfs/pr213_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localised effects==
The [[California Air Resources Board]] (C.A.R.B.) found in studies that 50% or more of the [[air pollution]] ([[smog]]) in [[Southern California]] is due to car emissions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}&lt;!--NOTE: this Wikipedia page also needs the same reference: Los Angeles smog#The Cause of Smog in Los Angeles.--&gt; Concentrations of pollutants emitted from combustion engines may be particularly high around signalized intersections because of idling and accelerations.

Communication between devices in a [[fibre channel]] network uses different elements of Fibre Channel standards.

==Transmission words and ordered sets==
All Fibre Channel communication is done in units of four 10-bit codes. This group of 4 codes is called a '''transmission word'''.

An '''ordered set''' is a transmission word that includes some combination of control (K) codes and data (D) [[Fibre Channel 8B/10B encoding|codes]]

==AL_PAs==
Each device has an [[Arbitrated_loop|Arbitrated Loop]] Physical Address (AL_PA).  These addresses are defined by an 8-bit field but must have neutral disparity as defined in the [[Fibre Channel 8B/10B encoding|8B/10B coding scheme]].  That reduces the number of possible values from 256 to 134.  The 134 possible values have been divided between the fabric, FC_AL [[Computer_port_(hardware)|ports]], and other special purposes as follows:

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
|-
|'''AL_PA'''||'''Quantity'''||'''Purpose'''
|-
||00||1||FL (fabric) port
|-
||01-7E||126||NL (normal) ports
|-
||F0||1||Used during LIP and ARB
|-
||F7||1||Used during LIP
|-
||F8||1||Used during LIP
|-
||F9-FE||3||Reserved
|-
||FF||1||Used for broadcasts
|-
|}

==Meta-data==
In addition to the transfer of data, it is necessary for Fibre Channel communication to include some [[metadata]].  This allows for the setting up of links, sequence management, and other control functions.  The meta-data falls into two types, '''primitives''' which consist of a 4 character transmission word and '''non-data frames''' which are more complex structures.

==Primitives==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lip (disambiguation)]] --&gt;
All primitives are four characters in length.  They begin with the control character K28.5, followed by three data characters.  In some primitives the three data characters are fixed, in others they can be varied to change the meaning or to act as parameters for the primitive.  In some cases the last two parameter characters are identical.

Parameters are shown in the table below in the form of their hexadecimal 8-bit values.  This is clearer than their full 10-bit (Dxx.x) form as shown in the [[Fibre Channel]] standards:

|}
Note 1: The first parameter byte of the EOF primitive can have one of four different values (8A, 95, AA, or B5).  This is done so that the EOF primitive can rebalance the disparity of the whole frame.  The remaining two parameter bytes define whether the frame is ending normally, terminating the transfer, or is to be aborted due to an error.

Note 2: The '''Open selective replicate''' variant can be repeated a number of times in order to communicate with more than one destination port simultaneously.  The '''Open broadcast replicate''' variant will allow communication with all ports simultaneously.

Note 3: The SOF primitive contains a pair of control [[byte]]s (shown as cccc in the table) to designate the type of frame.

==Frames==
The Fibre Channel protocol transmits data in frames each of which can contain up to 2112 bytes of [[payload data]].  The structure of a frame is shown in this table:

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
|-
|'''Field'''||'''Length'''
|-
||SOF - Start Of Frame||4
|-
||Extended header(s)||0 or more
|-
||Routing Control||1
|-
||Destination ID||3
|-
||Class-Specific Control / Priority||1
|-

|-
||Parameter||4
|-
||Data field||0 to 2112
|-
||CRC - [[Cyclic redundancy Check]]||4
|-
||EOF - End of Frame||4
|-
|}

In addition to data frames, there are non-data frames that are used for setup and messaging purposes.  These fall into three categories: [[High-Level Data Link Control|link control]] frames, link service frames, and extended link service frames.  The following table lists the most common ones:

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"

[[Image:Early NBS crystal oscillator frequency standards.jpg|thumb|These precision 100 kHz [[crystal oven|oven controlled crystal oscillators]] at the US Bureau of Standards (now [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]) served as the frequency standard for the United States in 1929.]]

A '''frequency standard''' is a stable [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]] used for [[frequency]] [[calibration]] or reference. A frequency standard generates a [[fundamental frequency]] with a high degree of [[accuracy and precision]]. Harmonics of this fundamental frequency are used to provide reference points.

Since time is the reciprocal of frequency, it is relatively easy to derive a [[time standard]] from a frequency standard. A standard clock comprises a frequency standard, a device to count off the cycles of the oscillation emitted by the frequency standard, and a means of displaying or outputting the result.

Frequency standards in a [[telecommunications network|network]] or [[Telecommunications facility|facility]] are sometimes administratively designated as ''primary'' or ''secondary''. The terms ''primary'' and ''secondary'', as used in this context, should not be confused with the respective technical meanings of these words in the discipline of [[precise time]] and frequency.

==Frequency reference==
A '''frequency reference''' is an instrument used for providing a stable frequency of some kind. There are different sorts of frequency references, [[acoustics|acoustic]] ones such as [[tuning fork]]s but also electrical ones that emit a signal of a certain frequency (a frequency standard).

Among the most stable frequency references in the world are [[cesium standard]]s, including [[Atomic fountain|cesium fountain]]s, and [[hydrogen maser]]s. Cesium standards are widely recognized as having better long-term stability, whereas hydrogen masers can attain superior short-term performance; therefore, several national [[Measurement standards laboratory|standards laboratories]] use ensembles of cesium standards and hydrogen masers in order to combine the best attributes of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/cesium.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906004352/http://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclides/cesium.html |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier of [[time signal]] transmitters, [[LORAN|LORAN-C]] transmitters and of several [[longwave|long wave]] and [[mediumwave|medium wave]] broadcasting stations is derived from an atomic clock and can be therefore used as frequency standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">== Definition ==
There are a variety of definitions and understandings of a global information system (GIS, GLIS), such as 

* A '''global information system (GIS)''' is an information system which is developed and / or used in a global context.&lt;ref&gt;Pawlowski, J.M.: Globale Informationssysteme (Global Information Systems). In: Kurbel, K., Becker, J., Gronau, N., Sinz, E., Suhl, L. (Eds.): Online Lexikon Wirtschaftsinformatik [http://www.enzyklopaedie-der-wirtschaftsinformatik.de/wi-enzyklopaedie/lexikon/uebergreifendes/Globalisierung/Globales-Informationssystem ''Online Encyclopedia Business Information Systems''], Oldenbourg, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''global information system''' (GIS) is any [[information system]] which attempts to deliver the totality of measurable data worldwide within a defined context. 

Common to this class of [[information systems]] is that the context is a global setting, either for its use or development process. This means that it highly relates to [[distributed systems]] / [[distributed computing]] where the distribution is global. The term also incorporates aspects of global software development and there [[outsourcing]] (when the outsourcing locations are globally distributed) and [[offshoring]] aspects. A specific aspect of global information systems is the case (domain) of [[global software development]].&lt;ref&gt;Sangwan, R., Bass, M., Mullick, N., Paulish, D.J., Kazmeier, J. (2006): Global Software Development Handbook, Auerback Publications, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8493-9384-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A main research aspect in this field concerns the coordination of and collaboration between virtual teams.&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, E. (1999): Global Software Teams: Collaborating Across Borders and Time Zones (High Performance Cluster Computing) - {{ISBN|0-13-924218-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garton, C., Wegryn, K. (2006): Managing Without Walls: Maximize Success with Virtual, Global, and Cross - Cultural Teams, MC Press, US, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Further important aspects are the [[internationalization]] and [[language localization]] of system components.

== Tasks in designing global information systems ==
Critical tasks in designing global information systems are 
* Process and system design: How are the processes between distributed actors organized, how are the systems distributed / integrated.
* Technical architecture: What is the technical infrastructure enabling actors to collaborate?
* Support mechanisms: How are actors in the process of communication, collaboration, and cooperation supported?

A variety of examples can be given. Basically every multi-lingual website can be seen as a global information system. However, mostly the term GLIS is used to refer to a specific system developed or used in a global context.

== Examples ==
Specific examples are 
* Systems developed for multinational users, e.g., [http://www.sap.com SAP as a global ERP system]
* Global Information Systems for Education: [http://www.globe-info.org/ The Global Learning Objects Brokered Exchange]
* For the specific case of data integration : http://data.un.org, http://www.internettrafficreport.com, http://www.unhcr.org/statistics.html

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">'''Illuminated mannequins''' are a home decor piece that were popular in the 1970s and 1980s in the [[United States]]. Although niche items of decor, their less known style was a symbol in 70s fashion and home furnishing.

An illuminated mannequin is a full or part body [[mannequin]] which illuminates from inside as an alternative to floor lamps.

The illuminated mannequin was originally manufactured and released by [[Adel Rootstein]] as a decorative counterpart to her widely successful [[Twiggy]] Mannequin.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Arpino. (2016). Adel Rootstein changed the Face of the Mannequin. Available: https://agnautacouture.com/2014/05/18/adel-rootstein-changed-the-face-of-the-mannequin/. Last accessed 25/10/16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;mannequin madness - Twiggy The Mannequin. (2010). The Madness of Mannequins. Available: https://mannequinmadness.wordpress.com/the-history-of-mannequin/. Last accessed 20/10/16..&lt;/ref&gt; Rootstein became well-known thanks to the success of the Twiggy mannequin, and the illuminated mannequin followed as a lesser known counterpart in its wake.

Adel Rootstein has gifted her home décor mannequins to musicians and actors which she is inspired by, as mentioned briefly in an interview with [[Stevie Nicks]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Stevie Nicks - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4Hdvua7O0I)&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been various celebrity photographs taken in which the illuminated mannequins can be seen in the celebrities homes, most notably Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac and [[Michael Jackson]].

The illuminated mannequin is quoted as an early inspiration to [[Ralph Pucci]] of the Pucci Mannequins.  Pucci’s mannequin display ‘THE ART OF THE MANNEQUIN’ at the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] (MAD) had an illuminated mannequin form amongst the many models in his display. From March 31 to August 30, 2015, thirty of Pucci’s most memorable mannequins were on display for museum goers. Finding the exhibition, “extremely gratifying,” Pucci was thrilled that the visual industry is getting a shining moment in a museum whose mission is to “document contemporary and historic innovation in craft, art, and design.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6085">The '''International Federation for Learning, Education, and Training Systems Interoperability''' (LETSI) is an international [[nonprofit organization]] focused on enabling technical interoperability for computer-based [[learning]], [[education]], and [[training system]]s.  Comprising [[e-learning]] vendors, adopters, standards bodies, associations, and policy makers, LETSI's primary activity is to support the adoption of open software standards in learning systems. The LETSI community formed around an international planning effort for the next generation of the [[SCORM|Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)]], which was originally created by the U.S. [[Advanced Distributed Learning|Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative]]. LETSI was founded in March, 2008 to serve the international SCORM community.

== History ==

In 1997 the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] founded the [[Advanced Distributed Learning| Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative]], with the mission of improving "access to education, training, and performance aids, tailored to individual needs, delivered cost effectively, anytime and anywhere." &lt;ref&gt;[[Advanced Distributed Learning]], [http://www.jointadlcolab.org/downloads/introducing_the_adli.ppt “Introducing the ADL Initiative.”] (PowerPoint).  Retrieved 2009-02-03&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, the ADL released the first edition of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), a technical framework designed to facilitate interoperability of computer-based education and training materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Advanced Distributed Learning]], [http://www.adlnet.gov/scorm/history/index.aspx “SCORM Timeline”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217192533/http://adlnet.gov/scorm/history/index.aspx |date=2009-02-17 }} Retrieved 2009-02-03&lt;/ref&gt; Though developed for use within the DoD, SCORM became widely adopted in commercial, educational, government, and international projects.&lt;ref&gt;Gafford, Wayne (2008).  [http://www.x-pubs.com/site/program_detail/why_and_how_adl_is_passing_on_the_stewardship_of_scorm_to_letsi/ “Why the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative is Passing the Stewardship of SCORM to LETSI,”] London, X-Pubs 2008.  Retrieved on 2009-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing that SCORM had acquired an international constituency across a broad spectrum of markets, the ADL in 2005 determined that an "international collaborative approach" was required in order to meet the needs of the SCORM user base, and resolved that "an international stewardship organisation shall be established and become fully functional within a three-year period."&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Forum (October 2005), [http://adlaustralia.org/aatgc/melbourne-declaration.html The Melbourne Declaration] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20051103011556/http://adlaustralia.org/aatgc/melbourne-declaration.html |date=2005-11-03 }}, Retrieved 2009-02-03&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, representatives from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States assembled at the London Institute for Education to discuss the formation of LETSI.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36, [http://www.tk461.stankin.ru/rus/news/36N1445.pdf Programme: March 19 2007 London ‘Open Forum’ Conference on Global Leadership &amp; Governance ICT standards for learning, education &amp; training] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812150433/http://www.tk461.stankin.ru/rus/news/36N1445.pdf |date=2007-08-12 }}.  Retrieved on 2009-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2008, the LETSI founding sponsors signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Seoul, Korea about their common goals and principles and approved LETSI’s Operating Procedures Pro Tem.

In August, 2008, LETSI held the first SCORM 2.0 conference, in Pensacola, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;LETSI, [http://wiki.letsi.org/download/attachments/6324770/10232008.pdf?version=1 Inaugural SCORM 2.0 Workshop Jump-Starts LETSI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902095307/http://wiki.letsi.org/download/attachments/6324770/10232008.pdf?version=1 |date=2011-09-02 }} (PDF), Retrieved on 2009-02-03&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==

LETSI adheres to an open development process.  The public may view meeting minutes, committee decisions, and materials related to work in progress at no cost through the LETSI wiki.  Nonmembers may contribute comments, case studies, and other inputs to LETSI through the wiki.  Voting, however, requires membership, which involves an annual fee.

Outputs of LETSI, such as a new SCORM reference model, are planned to be public and non-proprietary. 

LETSI currently operates under IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization ([[IEEE-ISTO|ISTO]])  interim procedures.  The Sponsors' Executive Committee (SEC), which is composed of sponsors, serves as LETSI’s governing body.

== Working Groups ==

LETSI activities are organized into the following working groups, each responsible for a different area of the next SCORM:

* Architecture Working Group
* Business Requirements Working Group
* Orchestration (Sequencing) Working Group
* Teaching and Learning Strategies Working Group

== Software Outputs ==

To increase consistency of adoption and to decrease time-to-market for innovation, LETSI plans to develop enabling software components (for example, code for [[RESTful]] and [[SOAP]]-based web services) and other tools for developers.  These tools will be available to developers free of charge.

[[File:Intel Pentium II die-to-BGA-interposter.png|thumb|Pentium II: example of an interposer, [[Die (integrated circuit)|integrated circuit die]] to [[ball grid array]] [[chip carrier]]]]

An '''interposer''' is an electrical interface routing between one socket or connection to another.  The purpose of an interposer is to spread a connection to a wider pitch or to reroute a connection to a different connection.&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;[http://www.siliconfareast.com/substrates.htm Package Substrates/Interposers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interposer comes from the Latin word "interpōnere", meaning "to put up between".&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/interposes interposes - definition of interposes by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of an interposer is an [[Die (integrated circuit)|integrated circuit die]] to [[Ball grid array|BGA]], such as in the [[Pentium II]].  This is done through various substrates, both rigid and flexible, most commonly [[FR-4|FR4]] for rigid, and [[polyimide]] for flexible.&lt;ref name="sub" /&gt; Silicon and glass are also evaluated as an integration method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroiq.com/blog/2011/06/silicon-interposers-building-blocks-for-3d-ics/ Silicon interposers: building blocks for 3D-ICs] / ElectroIQ, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prc.gatech.edu/Articles/25D%20Interposers-Organics%20vs%20Silicon%20vs%20Glass%20-%20R%20Tummala%20-%20GA-Tech.pdf 2.5D Interposers; Organics vs. Silicon vs. Glass] /  Rao R. Tummala, ChipScaleReview Volume 13, Number 4, July–August 2013, pages 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Interposer stacks are also a widely accepted, cost-effective alternative to [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D ICs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=John H.|date=2011-01-01|title=The Most Cost-Effective Integrator (TSV Interposer) for 3D IC Integration System-in-Package (SiP)|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1115/IPACK2011-52189|pages=53–63|doi=10.1115/ipack2011-52189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.3dincites.com/2013/05/semicon-singapore-3d-ic-wrap-up-bring-down-the-cost-and-bring-out-the-tsv-alternatives/|title=SEMICON Singapore 3D IC Wrap-Up: Bring down the cost and bring out the TSV alternatives - 3D InCites|date=2013-05-22|work=3D InCites|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are already several products with interposer technology in the market, notably the [[AMD Radeon RX 300 series|AMD Fiji/Fury GPU]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anandtech.com/print/9390/the-amd-radeon-%20r9-fury-x-review|title=The AMD Radeon R9 Fury X Review: Aiming For the Top|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Virtex 7|Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp380_Stacked_Silicon_Interconnect_Technology.pdf|title=White Paper: Virtex-7 FPGAs|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[CEA-Leti: Laboratoire d'électronique des technologies de l'information|CEA Leti]] demonstrated their second generation 3D-[[NoC]] technology which combines small dies (“chiplets”), fabricated at the [[Silicon on insulator|FDSOI]] 28&amp;nbsp;nm node, on a 65&amp;nbsp;nm [[CMOS]] interposer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1330129|title=Leti Unveils New 3D Network-on-Chip {{!}} EE Times|website=EETimes|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of an interposer would be the adapter used to plug a [[Serial ATA|SATA]] drive into a [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]] backplane with redundant ports.  While SATA drives can be connected to nearly all SAS backplanes without adapters, an interposer would allow providing path [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''JPay ''' is a privately held corrections-related service provider based in the [[United States]] with its headquarters in [[Miramar, Florida]]. The company contracts with state [[Department of Corrections|Departments of Correction]] (DOC), county [[jails]], and private [[federal prisons]] to provide technologies and services including [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]], [[email]], [[Inmate video visitation|video visitation]] and parole and probation payments to approximately 1.5 million inmates throughout 35 states.&lt;ref name="sfgate1"&gt;Nick Leiber, [http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/JPay-working-to-be-Apple-of-prison-system-3802432.php JPay working to be Apple of prison system], SFGate, August 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
JPay was started in 2002 by the company’s [[CEO]] and founder, Ryan Shapiro. Mr. Shapiro stepped down in 2016 and Errol Feldman was named the new CEO. In 2005, the company moved its headquarters from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]. In 2009, JPay’s services expanded to offer an inmate [[MP3 player]], the JP3, and a library of music tracks for purchase. In 2011, JPay moved its headquarters from Miami to Miramar, Florida, to accommodate a larger call center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Narayan Bhat |title=JPay Relocates its Call Center to Miramar &amp; adds 75 New Jobs |url=http://outbound-call-center.tmcnet.com/topics/outbound-call-center/articles/165648-JPay-relocates-its-call-center-miramar-adds-75.htm |date=April 18, 2011 |publisher=Technology Marketing Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, JPay launched a [[tablet computer|tablet]], the JP4, designed for the corrections industry, which enables inmates to read and draft emails, play games, and listen to music.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Leiber |title=JPay, the Apple of the U.S. Prison System |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-14/the-apple-of-the-u-dot-s-dot-prison-system |date=September 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Bloomberg Business Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also allows inmates to view and attach photos and videograms.&lt;ref name="correctionsforum.net"&gt;{{cite web |author=Donna Rogers, {{resize|Editor-in-Chief}} |title=From Flintstones to Jetsons |url=http://www.correctionsforum.net/article/from-flinstones-to-jetsons-38435 |date=April 3, 2014 |publisher=Corrections Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to permit use of the JP4, and the full extent of its functions, is made by the state [[corrections]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Glass |title=I Played With A Tablet Made For Prison Inmates |url=http://www.supercompressor.com/tech/i-played-with-a-jp4-the-tablet-made-for-prison-inmates |date=November 5, 2014 |publisher=[[Thrillist Media Group]] |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; JPay’s tablet has been distributed in seven [[Department of Corrections|DOC]] agencies, including [[North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation|North Dakota]], [[Georgia Department of Corrections|Georgia]], [[Florida Department of Corrections|Florida]], [[Louisiana Department of Corrections|Louisiana]], [[Virginia Department of Corrections|Virginia]], [[Michigan Department of Corrections|Michigan]] and [[Washington Department of Corrections|Washington]].&lt;ref name="usatoday1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kimberly Railey |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/08/17/tabletsforinmates/2651727/ |title=Some prisons let inmates connect with tablets |publisher=[[USA TODAY]] |date=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="breakthruradio1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Zach Schepis |url=http://www.breakthruradio.com/#/post/?blog=72&amp;post=27677 |title=Freedom Behind Bars? - Orange Is The New Black Week |publisher=BreakThru Radio |date=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, JPay was acquired by [[Securus Technologies]] though terms of the agreement were kept secret.&lt;ref name=sfbj-jpayacquired&gt;{{cite web|title=Miramar tech company JPay bought by Dallas firm|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2015/04/14/miramar-tech-company-jpay-bought-by-dallas-firm.html|website=South Florida Business Journal|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business Model and Growth Strategy ==
In a 2012 Bloomberg Business Week article entitled "JPay, the Apple of the Prison System," Ryan Shapiro, the company’s founder and CEO, stated, "We're looking for products that an inmate would want to buy and a corrections facility would accept."  He went on to state, "We take outside applications, redevelop them for [[prisons]] specifically, and then deploy them…the prison doesn't pay for any of (our services); it's the end user who pays." And, as the JP4 was being launched, Shapiro was quoted saying, “Think about education, think about games; it's endless where we could go. We think it's as big, if not bigger, than the money-transfer business."&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;

In a 2014 CNBC article, Ryan Shapiro stated "Our goal is to become the nation's digital consumer app company for prisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Dina |last=Gusovsky |title=The big business of selling apps to prison inmates |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/102042489 |date=October 1, 2014 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and Services ==

=== Money Transfer ===
An inmate’s friend or family member can use JPay’s money transfer service to deposit money to the inmate’s commissary or trust account. JPay offers [[electronic payment]] and deposit options which include credit and debit card payments via online, phone, and [[mobile app]] channels. The company has a relationship with [[MoneyGram]] to accept cash at MoneyGram’s U.S. agent locations, like [[Walmart]] and [[CVS/pharmacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=JPay |title=Sending Money {{resize|It just got easier}} |url=http://www.mdoc.state.ms.us/Sending%20Money_JPay.htm |publisher=Mississippi Department of Corrections |website=Mdoc.state.ms.us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604170346/http://www.mdoc.state.ms.us/Sending%20Money_Jpay.htm |archivedate=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=February 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moneygram.com/MGICorp/campaigns/JPay |title=Transfer money, online money transfer and bill pay &amp;#124; MoneyGram Global Money Transfer |publisher=Moneygram.com |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the company processes [[money orders]] on behalf of its contracted agencies.

=== Communications and Inmate Devices ===
JPay provides services that an inmate and an inmate's family and friends can use to communicate, such as video visitation, email, videogram,&lt;ref name="correctionsforum.net"/&gt; instant messaging,&lt;ref name="correctionsforum.net"/&gt; and a tablet computer ("J8P5").&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite web |author=Leslie Kraft Burke |title=JPay offers innovative services to corrections; grows revenue |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/print-edition/2012/09/28/jpay-offers-innovative-services-to.html?page=all |date=September 28, 2012 |publisher=South Florida Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parole and Probation Payments ===
JPay provides [[Payment service provider|payment services]] for offenders to make community corrections and [[Court order|court-ordered]] payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://JPay.com/ParoleProb.aspx |title=JPay Inmate Services - Send Money, Send Email, Send Packages |publisher=JPay.com |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JPay"&gt;{{cite web |title=JPay |url=http://correctionsmarketplace.com/Listing/Company/113970 |publisher=[[American Correctional Association]] |work=Corrections Marketplace |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its [[parole]] and [[probation]]ary services, JPay also offers a release card&lt;ref name="JPay"/&gt; (JPay Progress Card), which is a prepaid, reloadable [[MasterCard]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://JPay.com/ReleaseCards.aspx |title=JPay – Parole &amp; Probation – Release Cards |publisher=JPay.com |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all agencies contract to use JPay for money transfer services, they do not all utilize JPay’s full ranges of services.&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;

=== Charitable donations ===
JPay has been one of the corporate supporters of the Creative Corrections Education Foundation, a nonprofit founded by a former Texas warden, which collects contributions from prison inmates and from corporate sponsors to fund scholarships for children of prison inmates.  In 2014 the charity reported having provided $63,000 in scholarships over the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Joe Blundo commentary: Prisoners give to fund for children of inmates |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/life_and_entertainment/2014/10/16/prisoners-give-to-fund-for-children-of-inmates.html |date=October 16, 2014 |publisher=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

=== State licensing violations ===
In 2012, the [[Pennsylvania Department of Banking]] fined JPay $80,000 for violating the state’s [[Money transmitter|Money Transmitter]] Act by failing to have the necessary state license since it began operating in the state in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ford Turner |title=Florida Firm Fined $80,000 |url=http://businessweekly.readingeagle.com/florida-firm-fined-80000/ |date=February 7, 2012 |publisher=[[Reading Eagle]] – Business Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, JPay has been fined $408,500 across seven states for operating unlicensed businesses.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web |author=Daniel Wagner |title=Meet the Prison Bankers Who Profit From the Inmates – {{resize|With the ultimate captive markets, prison bankers and state jailers make money off high fees for financial services.}} |url=https://time.com/3446372/criminal-justice-prisoners-profit/ |date=September 30, 2014 |publisher=[[Center for Public Integrity]] |via=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intellectual property claims ===
In February 2015, Valerie Buford sued the [[Indiana Department of Corrections]] after she learned that her brother, Leon Benson, had been placed in [[solitary confinement]], had [[good conduct time]] deducted, and had JPay access revoked after she had reposted a videogram sent via JPay on a Facebook page campaigning for his release.&lt;ref name=eff-jpay /&gt; Although access was later restored, Buford continued to argue that the actions had a chilling effect on her ability to communicate with Benson.  Officials of the prison claimed the actions were to "protect" JPay's [[intellectual property]]; at the time, its [[terms of use]] stated that JPay held the [[copyright]] to any content that was sent through its systems, regardless of its original author.  Following a May 2015 posting by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] that criticized the company for attempting to abuse copyright law, JPay amended its terms of use to no longer contain this clause.&lt;ref name=eff-jpay&gt;{{cite web |author=Dave Maass |title=The Hidden Cost of JPay's Prison Email Service|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/hidden-cost-jpays-prison-email-system |date=May 5, 2015 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eff-jpay2&gt;{{cite web |author=Dave Maass |title=JPay Will No Longer Claim Ownership Over Inmate-Family Correspondence |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/05/jpay-will-no-longer-claim-ownership-over-inmate-family-correspondence |date=May 8, 2015 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=indystar-jpay&gt;{{cite web |author=Kristine Guerra |title=DOC punishing woman for posting video of imprisoned brother on Facebook, suit says |url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/02/05/doc-punishing-woman-posting-video-imprisoned-brother-facebook-suit-says/22946347/ |date=February 5, 2015 |publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predatory practices ===
Senator Cory Booker (Democrat, New Jersey) vowed to ask the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] to intercede on behalf of inmates against JPay's allegedly predatory practices with its prepaid debit release cards which are often the only form in which released prisoners are permitted to collect their prison earnings and remaining commissary balances. Allegedly, the company deducts non-optional fees which can exceed 40% of the funds owed to released inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=German Lopez |title=How private bankers cash in on released prisoners |url=https://www.vox.com/explainers/2015/11/3/9661554/prison-bank-prepaid-card |date=November 3, 2015 |publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kickbacks ===
In approximately half of the states it operates in,&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt; contracts between the various state prison systems or individual prisons and JPay include an agreement to apportion part of the fees, collected from those sending money to the prisoners, back to the prison operators in exchange for giving JPay a monopoly over financial transfers to inmates.  According to state mandated disclosures in Illinois, correctional institution operators there received approximately $48,000 for 2013 in what company founder Shapiro prefers to call ''"commissions"''.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; One prisoner, released in 2010 following a 28-year incarceration for murder, identified the potential hardship on the poorest families, leaving a mother of three with a husband in jail to decide: "Do I send money to him so he can afford to stay in touch with the kids, or do I feed the kids?"&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;  Meanwhile, JPay funds lavish parties for corrections institute bureaucrats during the American Correctional Association's annual convention, providing "tequila, hand-rolled cigars" and "live mariachi band" as well as sponsoring an award, including a trip, presented by the Association of State Correctional Administrators to former state corrections directors.&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Louie Wainwright Award |url=http://www.asca.net//projects/5/pages/46 |publisher=Association of State Correctional Administrators |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the political level, despite many of JPay's contracts explicitly banning lobbying,&lt;ref name="NASPO§35"&gt;{{cite web |title=Statewide Master Service Agreement for Services of Independent Contractor — '''§35.&amp;nbsp;Lobbying''' |url=http://vadoc.virginia.gov/mcpa/contracts/documents/JPay%20executed%207-19-11.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 |publisher=[[Government of Virginia]] |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro says the company's lawyers approved JPay's hiring registered state lobbyists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JPAY INC. |url=http://classic.followthemoney.org/database/lobbyistclient.phtml?lc=572450 |publisher=''my''FollowTheMoney {{resize|The Nation's Most Complete Resource for Information on Money in State Politics}} |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spending $20,000 lobbying Washington in attempts to take the federal prisons' financial transactions contract from [[Bank of America]].&lt;ref name=Time /&gt;  A ''Master Contract'' between JPay and the [[National Association of State Procurement Officials]] and the Multi-State Corrections Procurement Alliance, valid until July 2015, set out kickback rates, to any state signing on, of 50¢ per inbound money transfer to prisoners, 5¢ per outbound email, $5 per [[MP3 player|MP3]] device, $10 per JP5 Tablet device, and 5% of JPay's music download fees (which are 30%&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;50% higher than [[iTunes]]).&lt;ref name="NASPO§10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Statewide Master Service Agreement for Services of Independent Contractor — '''§10.&amp;nbsp;Consideration''' |url=http://vadoc.virginia.gov/mcpa/contracts/documents/JPay%20executed%207-19-11.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 |publisher=[[Government of Virginia]] |accessdate=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6680">'''Magnesium/Teflon/Viton''' ('''MTV''') is a [[pyrolant]]. Teflon and Viton are [[trademark]]s of DuPont for [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[FKM|fluoroelastomer]], (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(CF(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2016}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
[[Thermite]]s based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton, aka MTV-compositions, have been in use since the 1950s as payloads in infrared [[decoy flare]] applications. See also [[Countermeasures]]. Derived from the [[acronym]] MTV is the expression "MTV-Flare" for pyrotechnic infrared decoy flares.

==Chemistry==
Whereas in conventional visual pyrotechnic illuminants [[sodium nitrate]], NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is used as an [[oxidizer]], in MTV compositions the polytetrafluoroethylene, (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, acts as fluorine source. The very high [[reaction enthalpy]],  &lt;math&gt; \Delta_\mathrm{R}H &lt;/math&gt;, upon combustion of magnesium with PTFE is based on the formation of magnesium fluoride, having a very high negative [[enthalpy of formation]] ( &lt;math&gt; \Delta_\mathrm{f}H^o&lt;/math&gt; = −1124 kJ&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;):

:&lt;big&gt;2''n'' Mg + (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2''n'' MgF&lt;sub&gt;2''(s)''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' C, &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\mathrm{R}H&lt;/math&gt; = −1438 kJ&amp;nbsp;mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &amp;nbsp; (1)

As lots of carbon and much heat is released upon combustion of MTV the combustion flame can be described as a [[grey body]] of high [[emissivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-4087(200001)25:1&lt;37::AID-PREP37&gt;3.0.CO;2-#|title=IR Emission Behaviour of Magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV) Compositions|year=2000|last1=Koch|first1=Ernst-Christian|last2=Dochnahl|first2=Axel|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|volume=25|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on [[stoichiometry]], MTV displays varying [[Burn rate (chemistry)|burn rates]] and yields different reaction products. With constant Viton-content the burn rate increases exponentially with increasing magnesium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/1521-4087(200211)27:5&lt;262::AID-PREP262&gt;3.0.CO;2-8|title=Metal-Fluorocarbon-Pyrolants: III. Development and Application of Magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV)|year=2002|last1=Koch|first1=Ernst-Christian|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|volume=27|issue=5|pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the burn rate of MTV, as is the case with many metallized pyrotechnic compositions is strongly dependent on the specific surface area of the metal fuel, that are particle morphology and dimensions. Generally magnesium powder having a high specific surface area will exhibit a higher burn rate than those having a smaller specific area. The main reactions products for MTV at [[Magnesium|Mg]] contents between 30 and 65 wt% [[magnesium fluoride]], [[soot]] and vaporized magnesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/prep.200290004|title=Metal-Fluorocarbon-Pyrolants IV: Thermochemical and Combustion Behaviour of Magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV)|year=2002|last1=Koch|first1=Ernst-Christian|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|volume=27|issue=6|pages=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For aerial decoy flares magnesium rich compositions are used with Mg contents between 55 and 65 wt%. At these stoichiometries only a part of the applied Mg reacts with the PTFE. The surplus Mg is vaporised and reacts with the atmospheric oxygen; likewise the thermally excited soot reacts with the atmospheric oxygen:

:&lt;big&gt;''m'' Mg + (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2''n'' MgF&lt;sub&gt;2''(s)''&lt;/sub&gt; + (''m'' − 2''n'') Mg&lt;sub&gt;''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' C, ''m'' &amp;ge; 2''n'' &lt;/big&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (2)

:&lt;big&gt;(''m'' − 2''n'') Mg&lt;sub&gt;''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' C + ((1/2)''m'' + ''n'') O&lt;sub&gt;2''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; (''m'' − 2''n'') MgO&lt;sub&gt;''(s)''&lt;/sub&gt; + 2''n'' CO&lt;sub&gt;2''(g)''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (3)

==Safety==
Pyrotechnic compositions based on magnesium/polytetrafluoroethylene with stoichiometries from 25 wt% to 90 wt% magnesium are, according to German explosive legislation, the [[Koenen test]] ([[steel sleeve test]]), and [[BAM impact test]], explosive substances. Due to their sensitivity and their reaction behaviour these substances are categorized as group 1.1.2.&lt;ref&gt;''BGV B5 (VBG 55a) Explosivstoffe – Allgemeine Vorschrift'', Jedermann-Verlag, 69021 Heidelberg, '''2001'''.&lt;/ref&gt; MTV compositions explode at minimum confinement (also self confinement) at relative low amounts. MTV compositions are sensitive toward thermal ignition.
In addition MTV compositions in loose and pressed state are extraordinarily sensitive to [[friction]] and [[electrostatic discharge]]s (ESD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safety of Magnesium Teflon Viton|url=http://www.rothgreaves.com/ptfe-coatings/safety-of-magnesium-teflon-viton/|publisher=RothGreaves|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, suitable measures have to be taken to avoid ESD while processing and handling of MTV.

==Aerial decoy flare applications==
Since aircraft and helicopters could (and still can) counter surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles with the substance, MTV was a classified issue until the mid-1980s. It was not until 1997 that the U.S. government released a formerly classified invention, {{US patent|5679921}} (filing year 1957), that originally described the properties and applications of MTV.&lt;ref&gt;G.T. Hahn, P.G. Rivette, R. G. Weldon, ''Tracking Flare'', {{US patent|5679921}} '''1997''', The United States of America as represented by the Secretary of the Navy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although missile development has brought up seeker countermeasures against MTV flares there are still numerous missile systems fielded worldwide based on 1st Generation technology. Hence MTV flares are still not obsolete in fighting unknown threats. Together with advanced spectral flares (see [[countermeasures]]) they are part of the so-called "cocktail solution".&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''[[Magnetic flux]] leakage''' ('''TFI''' or Transverse Field Inspection technology) is a [[Magnetism|magnetic]] method of [[nondestructive testing]] that is used to detect [[corrosion]] and [[pitting corrosion|pitting]] in steel structures, most commonly pipelines and storage tanks. The basic principle is that a powerful [[magnet]] is used to magnetize the steel. At areas where there is corrosion or missing metal, the [[magnetic field]] "leaks" from the steel. In an MFL (or Magnetic Flux Leakage) tool, a magnetic detector is placed between the poles of the magnet to detect the leakage field. Analysts interpret the chart recording of the leakage field to identify damaged areas and to estimate the depth of metal loss.

==Introduction to pipeline examination==
There are many methods of assessing the [[integrity]] of a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]. [[Pipeline inspection gauge|In-line-Inspection (ILI) tools]] are built to travel inside a pipeline and collect data as they go. The type of ILI we are interested in here, and the one that has been in use the longest for pipeline inspection, is the magnetic flux leakage inline inspection tool (MFL-ILI). MFL-ILIs detect and assess areas where the pipe wall may be damaged by corrosion. The more advanced versions are referred to as "high-resolution" because they have a large number of sensors. The high-resolution MFL-ILIs allow more reliable and accurate identification of anomalies in a pipeline, thus, minimizing the need for expensive [[Verification and validation|verification]] [[excavations]] (i.e. digging up the pipe to verify what the problem is). Accurate assessment of pipeline anomalies can improve the decision making process within an Integrity Management Program and excavation programs can then focus on required repairs instead of calibration or exploratory digs. Utilizing the information from an MFL ILI inspection is not only cost effective but, as well, can also prove to be an extremely valuable building block of a Pipeline Integrity Management Program.

The [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] supply and transportation of product in a safe and cost-effective manner is a primary goal of most pipeline operating companies and managing the integrity of the pipeline is paramount in maintaining this objective.  In-line-inspection programs are one of the most effective means of obtaining data that can be used as a fundamental base for an Integrity Management Program.  There are many types of ILI tools that detect various pipeline defects, but high-resolution MFL tools are becoming more prevalent as its applications are surpassing those to which it was originally designed.  Originally designed for detecting areas of metal loss, the modern High Resolution MFL tool is proving to be able to accurately assess the severity of corrosion features, define [[Abrasion (mechanical)|dents]], [[wrinkle]]s, [[buckle]]s, and, in some cases, cracks.  Having a device that can perform simultaneous tasks reliably is more efficient and ultimately provides cost saving benefits.

==MFL pipeline inspection tools==
Background and origin of the term "pig":
In the field, a device that travels inside a pipeline to clean or inspect it is typically known as a pig.  PIG is an acronym for "Pipeline Inspection Gauge".  The acronym PIG came later as the  nickname for "pig" originated from cleaning pigs (first designed pigs) that actually sounded like squealing or screeching pigs when they passed through the lines scraping, scrubbing and "squeegeeing" the internal surface.  The name serves as common industry jargon for all pigs, both intelligent tools and cleaning tools.  Pigs, in order to fit inside the pipeline, are cylindrical and are necessarily short in order to be able to negotiate bends in the pipeline. Many other short, cylindrical objects, such as propane storage tanks, are also known as pigs and it is likely that the name came from the shape of the devices.  In some countries a pig is known as a "Diablo", literally translated to mean "the [[Devil]]" relating to the shuddering sound the tool would make as it passed beneath people's feet.  The pigs are built to match the diameter of a pipeline and use the very product being carried to end users to transport them.  Pigs have been used in pipelines for many years and have many uses.  Some separate one product from another, some clean and some inspect.  An MFL tool is known as an "intelligent" or "smart" inspection pig because it contains electronics and collects data real-time while travelling through the pipeline.  Sophisticated electronics on board allow this tool to accurately detect features as small as 1 [[Milliimetre|mm]] by 1&amp;nbsp;mm, dimensions of the wall of a pipeline as well as depth or thickness of wall (helps indicate potential wall loss).

Typically, an MFL tool consists of two or more bodies.  One body is the magnetizer with the [[magnets]] and [[sensors]] and the other bodies contain the [[electronics]] and [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].  The magnetizer body houses the sensors that are located between powerful "rare-earth" magnets.  The magnets are mounted between the [[brush]]es and tool body to create a magnetic circuit along with the pipe wall.   As the tool travels along the pipe, the sensors detect interruptions in the magnetic circuit.  Interruptions are typically caused by metal loss and which in most cases is corrosion and the dimensions of the potential metal loss is denoted previously as "feature."  Other features may be manufacturing defects and not actual corrosion. The feature indication or "reading" includes its length by width by depth as well as the o'clock position of the anomaly/feature.  Mechanical damage such as shovel gouges can also be detected.  The metal loss in a magnetic circuit is analogous to a rock in a stream.  Magnetism needs metal to flow and in the absence of it, the flow of magnetism will go around, over or under to maintain its relative path from one magnet to another, similar to the flow of water around a rock in a stream.  The sensors detect the changes in the magnetic field in the three directions (axial, radial, or circumferential) to characterize the anomaly. The sensors are typically oriented axially which limits data to axial conditions along the length of the pipeline.  Other designs of smart pigs can address other directional data readings or have completely different functions than that of a standard MFL tool. Oftentimes an operator will run a series of inspection tools to help verify or confirm MFL readings and vice versa.  An MFL tool can take sensor readings based on either the distance the tool travels or on increments of time.  The choice depends on many factors such as the length of the run, the speed that the tool intends to travel, and the number of stops or outages that the tool may experience.

The second body is called an Electronics Can. This section can be split into a number of bodies depending on the size of the tool. This can, as the name suggests, contains the electronics or "brains" of the smart pig.  The Electronics Can also contains the batteries and is some cases an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to tie location information to GPS coordinates.  On the very rear of the tool are odometer wheels that travel along the inside of the pipeline to measure the distance and speed of the    tool.

==MFL  principle==
As a MFL  tool navigates the pipeline a magnetic circuit is created between the pipewall and the tool.  Brushes typically act as a transmitter of magnetic flux from the tool into the pipewall, and as the magnets are oriented in opposing directions, a flow of flux is created in an elliptical pattern.  High Field MFL tools saturate the pipewall with magnetic flux until the pipewall can no longer hold any more flux. The remaining flux leaks out of the pipewall and strategically placed tri-axial [[Hall effect]] sensor heads can accurately measure the three-dimensional vector of the leakage field.

Given the fact that magnetic flux leakage is a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity and that a hall sensor can only measure in one direction, three sensors must be oriented within a sensor head to accurately measure the [[Axis of rotation|axial]], [[wikt:radial|radial]] and [[circumference|circumferential]] components of an MFL signal.  The axial component of the vector signal is measured by a sensor mounted [[orthogonal]] to the axis of the pipe, and the radial sensor is mounted to measure the strength of the flux that leaks out of the pipe.  The circumferential component of the vector signal can be measured by mounting a sensor [[perpendicular]] to this field.  Earlier MFL tools recorded only the axial component but high-resolution tools typically measure all three components.  To determine if metal loss is occurring on the internal or external surface of a pipe, a separate [[eddy current]] sensor is utilized to indicate wall surface location of the anomaly.  The unit of measure when sensing an MFL signal is the [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] or the [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] and generally speaking, the larger the change in the detected magnetic field, the larger the anomaly.

==Signal analysis==
The primary purpose of a MFL tool is to detect corrosion in a pipeline. To more accurately predict the dimensions (length, width and depth) of a corrosion feature, extensive testing is performed before the tool enters an operational pipeline. Using a known collection of measured defects, tools can be trained and tested to accurately interpret MFL signals.  Defects can be simulated using a variety of methods.

Creating and therefore knowing the actual dimensions of a feature makes it relatively easy to make simple correlations of signals to actual anomalies found in a pipeline.  When signals in an actual pipeline inspection have similar characteristics to the signals found during testing it is logical to assume that the features would be similar. The [[algorithms]] and [[neural nets]] designed for calculating the dimensions of a corrosion feature are complicated and often they are closely guarded [[trade secrets]]. An anomaly is often reported in a simplified fashion as a cubic feature with an estimated length, width and depth.  In this way, the effective area of metal loss can be calculated and used in acknowledged formulas to predict the estimated burst pressure of the pipe due to the detected anomaly.

Another important factor in the ongoing improvement of sizing algorithms is customer feedback to the ILI vendors.  Every anomaly in a pipeline is unique and it is impossible to replicate in the shop what exists in all cases in the field.  Open lines of communication usually exist between the inspection companies and the pipeline operators as to what was reported and what was actually visually observed in an excavation.

After an inspection, the collected data is downloaded and [[compiled]] so that an analyst is able to accurately interpret the collected signals.  Most pipeline inspection companies have proprietary software designed to view their own tool's collected data.   The three components of the MFL vector field are viewed independently and collectively to identify and classify corrosion features.  Metal loss features have unique signals that analysts are trained to identify.

===Estimation of corrosion growth rate===
High-resolution MFL tools collect data approximately every 2&amp;nbsp;mm along the axis of a pipe and this superior resolution allows for a comprehensive analysis of collected signals.  Pipeline Integrity Management programs have specific intervals for inspecting pipeline segments and by employing high-resolution MFL tools an exceptional corrosion growth analysis can be conducted.  This type of analysis proves extremely useful in forecasting the inspection intervals.

===Other features that an MFL tool can identify===
Although primarily used to detect corrosion, MFL tools can also be used to detect features that they were not originally designed to identify.  When an MFL tool encounters a geometric deformity such as a dent, wrinkle or buckle, a very distinct signal is created due to the plastic deformation of the pipe wall.

===Crack detection===
There are cases{{where|date=March 2015}} where large non-axial oriented cracks have been found in a pipeline that was inspected by a magnetic flux leakage tool. To an experienced MFL data analyst, a dent is easily recognizable by trademark "horseshoe" signal in the radial component of the vector field.  What is not easily identifiable to an MFL tool is the signature that a crack leaves.

A '''micromanipulator''' is a device which is used to physically interact with a sample under a microscope, where a level of precision of movement is necessary that cannot be achieved by the unaided human hand.&lt;ref name="El-Badry2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hamed M.

The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]]. This is achieved by the use of [[kinematic]] constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], which achieves a high precision and repeatability of movement, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.

Movement reduction can be performed by mechanical levers, hydraulically using pistons of different diameters connected by tubing containing non-compressible fluid,  electronically using stepper motors or linear actuators, or combinations of techniques in one instrument. Mechanisms with different ranges of movement or variable reduction ratio may be incorporated in one instrument to allow coarse and fine positioning.

Depending on the application, users may require different scales of movement resolution, movement speed, range and accuracy. These are the critical variables integrated into manipulator design by manufacturers, which are typically presented to suit particular applications. 

==Microscope integration==
Micromanipulators are usually used in conjunction with microscopes.  Depending on the application, one or more micromanipulators may be fitted to a microscope stage or rigidly mounted to a bench next to a microscope.  A typical application of micromanipulation is human [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]]. Here, a spermatozoon measuring some 3 to 5 micrometres across is injected into an oocyte of approximately 100 micrometres in diameter, under the direct manual control of an embryologist. A disposable glass micropipette is fitted to a toolholder mounted on the output of the manipulator. The toolholder can be adjusted for different sized tools as well as the angle at which the tool is held.

==Microelectronics==
Micromanipulators are also used in applications such as microelectronics to position test probes onto small to medium scale [[integrated circuits]] and hybrid devices, and [[patch clamp]] experiments in biological research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6081">'''Mosaic''' (also called '''Composer's Mosaic'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxgXhfMmJ5sC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22Mosaic%22+%22mark+of+the+unicorn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TBlSMoDpgx&amp;sig=zb7oFsgwQYe11IvpQh6uQDkMfh8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo15ytkrDVAhVCxFQKHXJCBUk4ChDoAQhDMAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Anatomy of a Home Studio: How Everything Really Works, from Microphones to MIDI|last=Wilkinson|first=Scott R.|date=1997|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=|isbn=9780918371218|location=|pages=112|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[scorewriter]] application for producing music notation, developed by [[Mark of the Unicorn]]. 

First released as '''Professional Composer''' among early Macintosh software in 1984, the application introduced a user interface similar to the [[word processor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= McGeever|first=Christine|date=June 4, 1984|title=New Programs, Macintosh carries a tune|magazine=InfoWorld|publisher= CW Communications|issn=0199-6649|volume=6|number=23|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main features included entering [[musical notation]], printing [[sheet music]], and support for [[lyrics]] under the score with the font of choice. Notes could be selected from the user interface or entered from the keyboard. The user could also change or extend the [[tempo]], [[key signature]], [[Metre (music)|meter]], and other parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clapp |first1=Doug |last2=Ryall |first2=Pat |date=1985 |title=The Complete Macintosh Sourcebook|location=Santa Monica, CA |publisher=InfoBooks |pages=135-136 |isbn=0-931137-03-9|chapter=12 Sound &amp; Animation Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major release, Professional Composer 2.0, supported writing on up to 40 [[Staff (music)|staves]] and allowed the user to enter notes as short as 128th notes, with all operations mainly controlled by menus and dialog boxes. Version 2.0 also introduced several improvements for printing (such as automatically condensing parts with several [[Rest (music)|rest]] measures), allowing production of professional quality scores. Although the application demanded knowledge of music theory to use its rich features, it offered only rudimentary playback capabilities. A ''[[Macworld]]'' review also criticized the high price (495 USD in February 1986) and the lack of automatic scrolling when staves were filled (only via scroll bars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Swigart|first=Bob|date=February 1986|title=They´re Playing Our Song |magazine=Macworld|publisher=PC World Communications|volume=3|number=2|issn=0741-8647|pages=109-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Version 2.2 (1988) corrected several bugs and improved compatibility with [[Mac Plus]], [[Macintosh SE|SE]] and [[Macintosh II|II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=August 1988|title=Updates, Professional Composer |magazine=Macworld|publisher=PC World Communications|volume=5|number=8|issn=0741-8647|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 2.3M was the last release of Professional Composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=MOTU's MOSIAC|date=February 1992 |newsgroup=rec.music.synth |url=https://groups.google.com/d/topic/rec.music.synth/rfloPZjaB44/discussion |access-date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mosaic entered the market in 1992 as the successor to Professional Composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Gruberman|first=Ken|date=October 1992|title=Composer’s Mosaic|magazine=MacUser|publisher= Ziff-Davis|issn=0884-0997|volume=8|number=10|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early user review of version 1.01 criticized stability issues and problems with file importing from other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | author = Ron Hemmel | title = MOSAIC | date = March 8, 1992 | newsgroup = rec.music.synth | message-id = Mar.8.15.31.22.1992.12994@finesse.rutgers.edu| url = https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=rec.music.synth/22kluj6ofZY/HOvoAZRMYrIJ| access-date = July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In version 1.58 released in 1998, the notation software removed all limits on page size, score length, number of staves, and number of voices per staff. Configuration options in different windows created a flexible but sometimes confusing user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whitney |first=Ross|date=December 1998 |title=Composer's Mosaic |url= |journal=Notes |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=436-438 |issn=0027-4380}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drag and drop]] features and ability to convert [[MIDI]] files into usable notation were counted among the strongest points of Mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Shirak |first=Rob |date=November 2000 |title=There's More to Creating Good Scores and Parts Than Just Putting Notes on Paper, Get It In Print, Mark of the Unicorn Mosaic (Mac) |magazine=Electronic Musician |publisher=Intertec Publishing|issn=0884-4720|url=http://www.digitalprosound.com/Features/2000/Oct/Notation5.htm| accessdate=July 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1998, no new versions of Mosaic were released by [[Mark of the Unicorn|MOTU]], and because it was not compatible with [[macOS|MacOS 10]], it became [[Orphaned technology|orphaned technology]] and [[Abandonware|abandonware]].  Competing notation packages are [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], [[Finale (software)|Finale]], and [[Dorico]], however no direct conversion of file formats, such as via [[MusicXML]], is possible.&lt;ref&gt;(19 August 2008).

[[Sibelius (software)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosaic users now have to rely on creating [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files of Mosaic output under [[MacOS 9]] and then having these read by [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] programs such as PDFtoMusic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myriad-online.com/en/products/pdftomusicpro.htm  PDFtoMusic].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2592">'''Numerical Wind Tunnel''' ('''数値風洞''') was an early implementation of the vector parallel architecture developed in a joint project between [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]] and [[Fujitsu]]. It was the first supercomputer with a sustained performance of close to 100 Gflop/s for a wide range of fluid dynamics application programs. It stood out at the top of the [[TOP500]] during 1993-1996. With 140 cores, the Numerical Wind Tunnel reached a Rmax&lt;ref&gt;''Rmax'' – The highest score measured using the [[LINPACK]] benchmark suite. This is the number that is used to rank the computers. Measured in [[1000000000000000 (number)|quadrillion]]s of [[floating point]] operations per [[second]], i.e. [[FLOPS|petaflops]].&lt;/ref&gt; of 124.0 GFlop/s and a Rpeak&lt;ref&gt;''Rpeak'' – This is the theoretical peak performance of the system. Measured in Pflops.&lt;/ref&gt; of 235.8 [[GFlop/s]] in November 1993.&lt;ref name=top500-nov1993&gt;{{cite web|title=Sublist Generator|url=http://www.top500.org/statistics/sublist/|publisher=top500.org|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consisted of parallel connected 166 [[vector processor]]s with a gate delay as low as 60 ps in the Ga-As chips. The resulting cycle time was 9.5 ns. The processor had four independent pipelines each capable of executing two Multiply-Add instructions in parallel resulting in a peak speed of 1.7 Gflop/s per processor. Each processor board was equipped with 256 Megabytes of central memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netlib.org/benchmark/top500/reports/report94/main.html TOP500 Annual Report 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

A '''photonic laser thruster''' ('''PLT''') is an amplified photonic propulsion thruster for [[space propulsion]] that works on the principle of a photon-pushed sail, generating thrust directly from the [[momentum]] of a [[photon]] from a [[laser]] reflected from a mirror. The thruster, invented by Young K. Bae differs from other [[solar sail]] and [[laser propulsion]] thrusters in that an amplification process is used, in which the incident beam is re-used by being reflected by a stationary mirror, with an amplification stage at each reflection.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6084 | title = Photon Tether Formation Flight (PTFF) for Distributed and Fractionated Space Architectures | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year = 2007 |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6084 }} Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6131 | title = Photonic Laser Propulsion (PLP): Photon Propulsion Using an Active Resonant Optical Cavity | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  |year = 2007  |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6131 }}Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6156 | title = Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT): Experimental Prototype Development and Demonstration | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6156 |date = 2007 |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | page = paper 2007-6156-318}}; Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Photonic Laser Propulsion: Proof-of-Concept Demonstration|last = Bae|first = Y.K.|date = 2008|journal = AIAA Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|accessdate = |doi = 10.2514/1.32284|pmid = |volume = 45|issue = 1|pages = 153–155|bibcode = 2008JSpRo..45..153B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the recycling of energy, the photonic laser thruster has been demonstrated to be more energy efficient than other laser-pushed sail concepts.

The near-term usage of the photonic laser thruster the earth-orbit applications include propellant-free and thrust-plume-contamination-free spacecraft maneuvering for precision [[Satellite formation flying|formation flying]], large optical and RF [[Synthetic-aperture radar|synthetic aperture]] construction, and [[stationkeeping]].  The usage of the photonic laser thruster for main space propulsion would require scaling-up of the laser power and controlling laser diffraction over interplanetary and interstellar distances. Photonic laser thrusters have a very high [[specific impulse]], and can permit spacecraft to reach much higher speeds that approach a fraction of the light speed, unlike conventional rockets, which are limited by the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fiso.spiritastro.net/telecon/Bae_11-9-16/|title=Breaking the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation|last=Bae|first=Young|date=2016|website=Future In-Space Operations Telecon Presentation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
The use of light for propulsion has been researched since the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From a Scientific Heritage|last = Tsander|first = Friedrich|date = 1967|journal = NASA Ttf-541|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  with the analysis of a sail pushed by the pressure of sunlight by [[Friedrich Zander|Friedrich Tsander]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, Friedrich (1925). "Problems of flight by jet propulsion: interplanetary flights"; in English translation as  ''NASA Technical Translation F-147'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Photon propulsion has been discussed for decades as a propulsion that could enable interstellar flight.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GLWHQgAACAAJ}}|date=1 September 1995|isbn=978-0-07-031320-0|title = Space Propulsion Analysis and Design|last = Humble|first = R.W.|publisher = McGraw-Hill Co.|location= New York|pages = 631–683|last2 = Henry|first2 = G.N.|last3 = Larson|first6 = W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Landis, “The Ultimate Exploration: Approaches to Interstellar Flight,” ''Interstellar Exploration'', Y. Kondo, ed., Apogee Books (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional photonic propulsion, such as laser- or microwave-pushed [[Beam-powered propulsion#Direct impulse|lightsails]], photons transfer their momentum to the sail by reflection. Since, for a sail moving slowly with respect to the speed of light, very little of the energy of the photon is lost on reflection, a theoretical way to increase the efficiency is by recycling photons, bouncing the reflected photons back to the sail by a mirror,&lt;ref name= "metzger" /&gt; resulting in repetitively cycling the photons between two reflective mirrors in an [[optical cavity]].

The photonic thruster utilized this approach of recycling the reflected light, but with the addition of an active material amplifying the beam.

===Development===
The Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) was invented and developed by Young Bae and his team at Y.K.

Initial proposed uses include high-precision and high-speed maneuver of small spacecraft, such as formation flying, orbit adjustments, and drag compensation.

In August 2015, under another NASA program (NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts) he demonstrated additional 100-fold improvement, achieving a photon thrust of 3.5 millinewtons. In addition, a small 1U [[CubeSat]] satellite was propelled and stopped in simulated zero-gravity.  The laser power of the trapped photon beam exceeded 500&amp;nbsp;kW, which was powered by a 500 W laser.

===Beamed laser propulsion===
{{see also|Laser propulsion|Beam-powered propulsion}}

The limitations posed by the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|rocket equation]] can be overcome, as long as the reaction mass is not carried by the spacecraft. In the Beamed Laser Propulsion (BLP) concept, the photons are beamed from the photon source to the spacecraft as coherent light. [[Robert L. Forward]] pioneered interstellar propulsion concepts including photon propulsion and [[antimatter rocket]] propulsion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Forward | first = R.L. | date = 1987 | title = Advanced Space Propulsion Study | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a189218.pdf | journal = AFRL Final Report | page = F04611–86–C–0039 | doi = | pmid = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Forward introduced beamed laser propulsion, aiming at the goal of achieving roundtrip manned [[interstellar travel]].

However, at higher speeds (v&gt;0.1c), owing to the favorable [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] energy transfer, onboard photon propulsion becomes much more energy efficient.

Photons transfer their energy to the spacecraft by redshifting due to Doppler shift upon reflection, thus the higher the spacecraft speed, the higher the efficiency. The figure shows the energy transfer efficiency from photons to the spacecraft's [[kinetic energy]] as a function of β=v/c (the spacecraft velocity divided by the light velocity) in photon propulsion. As the spacecraft velocity approaches the light velocity (v≈c), the efficiency of photon propulsion approaches 100%, as if the spacecraft acts like a [[black hole]] in the moving direction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The lower solid curve in the figure represents the efficiency of conventional photon rocket or sail with photon recycling.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The upper solid line represents schematically an example the efficiency of a recycling photon rocket, such as a PLT. At low β, the recycling rocket can have a high thrust amplification factor (in this example, ~3,000), however as β approaches 1, the amplification factor converges to 1 and the overhead of recycling is unneeded. Therefore, these rockets are projected to bridge the efficiency gap.[[File:Photon-Thrust-Amplification.jpg|thumb|Figure 4: Amplification of photon thrust by bouncing photon beams.

==== Photonic laser thruster ====
After 2000 Bae began to investigate photon recycling for use in a nanometer accuracy formation flight, for a [[NASA]]-[[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]] project called Photon Tether Formation Flight (PTFF).&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bae | first = Young K. | date = 2006-01-20 | title = A Contamination‐Free Ultrahigh Precision Formation Flying Method for Micro‐, Nano‐, and Pico‐Satellites with Nanometer Accuracy | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 813 | pages = 1213–1223 | doi = 10.1063/1.2169304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to sustain fixed-formation flight with a baseline distance between craft of over 10&amp;nbsp;km, for next generation NASA space missions. In 2006 Bae investigated active resonant optical cavities, in which the optical gain medium is located within the cavity, and coined the term "photonic laser thruster" (PLT) for such thrusters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt; [[File:PLT-Mechanism-Diagram.jpg|thumb|Figure 5: Photonic Laser Thruster mechanism diagram shows its laser-like active resonance cavity with a laser gain medium in the cavity.|302x302px]]Initially PLT was proposed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; It was assumed that the cavity would be sensitive to the stability of the mirrors and other optical parameters as in passive cavities. Bae discovered that he could sustain the resonance with the mirror in his hand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This would be impossible if the cavity were highly sensitive to cavity perturbations such as moving and tilting. He concluded the gain medium in the cavity actively stabilizes the recycling photon beam, through negative feedback. This encouraged the idea that these thrusters could enable a range of applications well beyond PTFF.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:PLT-Demo-Setup.jpg|thumb|Figure 6: Schematic diagram of the first Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) demonstration setup in December 2006.|298x298px]] In December 2006, a proof-of-concept of PTFF was demonstrated in a laboratory environment.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Figure 6 illustrates the first demonstration setup, consisting of a concave High Reflectance (HR) mirror, a [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] Diode Pumped Solid State laser gain medium and a flat Output Coupler (OC) mirror. The photon thrust was determined by measuring the difference between the weight of the HR mirror with laser on and that with laser off with the use of a digital scale. Below is an infrared picture of the thruster in action. [[File:PLT-1st-Lab-Demo.jpg|thumb|An infrared picture of the first proof-of-principle demonstration of Photonic Laser Thruster, in which photon thrust was measure on a digital scale by measuring the mirror weight difference with power on and off.|250x250px]]

Figure 7 shows the experimental results of the photon thrust measured as a function of the laser power output through the OC mirror, P, with [[reflectance]] greater than 0.997 according to the manufacturer’s specification. Curve fitting the data resulted in the specific thrust of 20±1&amp;nbsp;µN/W, resulting in the apparent photon momentum multiplication factor of 2,990±150 and the true OC mirror reflectance used in this demonstration of 0.99967±0.00002. The maximum photon thrust demonstrated was 35 μN. When the demonstration setup was operating at thruster levels near or beyond 35&amp;nbsp;µN, the setup became unstable and the gain medium overheated. Therefore, it was realized that thermal management is critical to scaling such thrusters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:PLT-Thrust-Data.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: The first PLT demonstration data obtained with an output coupler mirror with 0.99967 reflectance.|265x265px]]

The Doppler shift limits the maximum obtainable velocity of the accelerating mirror and its accommodating spacecraft. Doppler shift effect on the active resonant cavity behavior is an extremely complicated issue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Optical gain in the laser cavity can only occur for a finite range of optical frequencies. The gain bandwidth is approximately the width of this frequency range. For example, the gain bandwidth of the YAG laser system with the laser wavelength in the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;nm is in the order of 0.6&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name="Yariv1989"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum electronics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UTWg1VIkNuMC}}|date=17 January 1989|isbn=978-0-471-60997-1|last = Yariv|first = A.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; ~ 0.06% of the wavelength. For an order of magnitude estimation, it can be assumed that a thruster utilizing the YAG laser system will be limited by the gain bandwidth to the first order, i.e., its theoretical maximum spacecraft velocity is ~{{val|1.8|e=5|u=m/s}} (180&amp;nbsp;km/s), 0.06% of the light velocity, c=3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. To overcome this redshift limitation, at high operation velocities, wide bandwidth lasers should be used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Greater thrust requires higher power lasers.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hagop |last1=Injeyan|first2=Gregory |last2=Goodno|title=High Power Laser Handbook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0u0Foaw8wNYC}}|date=5 January 2011|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-160902-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasers are often designed to maximize power outside the laser cavity, while PLT calls for maximizing laser power inside the cavity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The necessary laser operation parameters to maximize intracavity power (circulating power) in laser cavities are still poorly understood.

Bae and colleagues chose a thin [[disk laser]] and began to develop a PLT in 2013.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Typically, a thin disk laser with a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm disk thickness can be operated with a 99% output coupler, and provide an intracavity power 100 times larger than extracavity power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latham | first = William P. | last2 = Lobad | first2 = Ahmed | last3 = Newell | first3 = Tim C. | last4 = Stalnaker | first4 = Don | date = 2010-10-08 | title = 6.5 kW, Yb:YAG Ceramic Thin Disk Laser | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 1278 | pages = 758–764 | doi = 10.1063/1.3507169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A schematic diagram of this design is shown in Figure 8. A thin disk gain medium is coated with HR with a reflectivity of up to 99.999% and attached to a heat sink. The recycling photons between the gain medium and the HR mirror located in the mission platform deliver amplified thrust beaming from the resource platform.

In 2014, Bae's group, working under a NASA program (NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts), demonstrated intracavity power of 154&amp;nbsp;kW with a 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm diameter thin disk laser, which can be translated into a photon thrust of 1.03&amp;nbsp;mN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech/niac/2013phaseII_bae.html#.VGqrRvnF_SM|title = Propellantless Spacecraft Formation-Flying and Maneuvering with Photonic Laser Thruster|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC)|publisher = |last =Bae |first =Y.K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the group successfully [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QICCrlmBjvY&amp;ab_channel=NASAVideo measured] photon thrust up to 1.1&amp;nbsp;mN with a digital scale.

In August 2015, under the NASA program the group successfully [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLEK8Zq7Pk&amp;ab_channel=Y.K.BaeCorporation propelled] a Cube satellite, and demonstrated and measured photon thrust up to 3.5&amp;nbsp;mN with the use of the newly developed NIST/Scientech/Navy radiation pressure sensor. An intracavity power of the photonic laser thruster over 500&amp;nbsp;kW was demonstrated with 500 W laser pumping.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Open problems ====
To date the experimental tests of the photonic thruster are limited to laboratory-scale distances.  The maximum range of operation for a photonic laser thruster, PLT, is yet to be established. Bohn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bohn | first = Willy L. | date = 2008-01-01 | volume = 7005 | pages = 70051C–70051C–9 | doi = 10.1117/12.785634 | title = High-Power Laser Ablation VII | chapter = Novel aspects in laser propulsion }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a 1&amp;nbsp;km-long laser resonator similar to the PLT cavity, which is an active cavity, in 1995 and proposed that such resonators could scale to 100&amp;nbsp;km.  Recently, 4-km &amp;nbsp;[[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|Fabry–Pérot cavities]], which are passive cavities, but share the same intracavity power multiplication principle with the PLT cavity, have been demonstrated in [[LIGO]] for gravitational wave detection with an intracavity multiplication factor of 280 and an intracavity laser power on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;kW. Based on these results and the state-of-the-art technologies in precision optics, the PLT cavity length over 1,000&amp;nbsp;km is promising. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether the PLT cavity could be scaled for astronomical distances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Likewise, use of the amplifying cavity has not yet been demonstrated for the case when the sail is moving at velocities approaching fractions of the light velocity. The Doppler shift of the moving sail will, as noted earlier, mean that the amplification medium will need to operate at a different wavelength for each pass of the photons through the system. The mode of the Fabry-Perot cavity will likewise be changing with time.

Another issue is intracavity laser beam aiming, aligning and tracking over long distances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Progress in [[directed energy weapon]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; has improved these capabilities. The speed of light limits how quickly tracking information can travel between the two cavity ends over long distances.

At speeds higher than rocket speeds lack of brakes is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livestream.com/viewnow/niac2015seattle/videos/105034354 Philip Lubin, Univ. of California Santa Barbara, DEEP IN Directed Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration, since 4:17]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a problem can be solved by installing another photonic laser thruster at the destination as in photonic railway.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The braking of spacecraft with PLT in lab has been recently demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLEK8Zq7Pk&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=February 2018}}

If the photonic laser thruster is scalable for the use in such main space propulsion, multiple photonic laser thrusters can be used to construct a photonic railway that has been proposed as a potential permanent transport infrastructure for interplanetary or interstellar commutes, allowing the transport craft themselves to carry very little or no fuel.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187538921202514X|title = Prospective of photon propulsion for interstellar flight|last = Bae|first = Y.K.|date = 2012|journal = Physics Procedia|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.026|pmid = |volume = 38|pages = 253–279|bibcode = 2012PhPro..38..253B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The photonic railway&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was investigated for a space applications involving planets, moons and asteroids both in the solar system and other star systems, such as mining and setting up permanent habitation, with regular interplanetary and interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For example, platforms could be built in Earth orbit and then used for constructing further platforms at one of the [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]] of a planet of interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Mars, solar power is still strong, thus solar pumped platforms could be operated near Mars. Planets farther from the sun might not support solar pumping, and the railway would involve two PLT-BLP systems near Earth.

Bae compared the energy need to speed spacecraft for conventional rockets and that for photonic railway or PLT-BLP, in terms of specific energy (J/kg) that is the energy required for propelling a unit mass to a given velocity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Fig. 11 shows examples of the specific energy (J/kg) as a function of the spacecraft velocity (km/s) related with the Mars photonic railway. Two curves represent the specific energies for conventional rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 500 s and 3,000 s, respectively.  The upper straight solid line represents the specific energy for BLP and the lower straight solid line for photonic railway or PLT-BLP with M=1,000.  Here M is the photon thrust amplification factor.  It is interesting that BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 1 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s, if the travel time is shorter than a week. However, photonic railway or PLT-BPL with M=1,000 becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 2 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than two weeks. Eventually, when the flight time needs to be 3 days, for example, both BLP and photonic railway or PLT-BLP are more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s.  This estimate demonstrates photonic railway is potentially the most energy efficient way to commute to planets in the solar system.

One interesting aspect of the Spacetrain on the photonic railway was realized that the continuous low level acceleration of up to 1 g will create an artificial gravity that may eliminate or minimize the health effects of [[weightlessness]] long term space travel in zero-gravity environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This artificial gravity will play a crucial role in reducing or eliminating the health problems arising from the typical zero-g space travel environment.

A simple PLT system could provide continuous and constant thrust in a straight line. However, travel around the solar system involves interacting with planets and the sun, so trajectories and travel time calculations are more complex. Fu-Yuen Hsiao has investigated the trajectories of spacecraft relying entirely on a PLT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Trajectory of spacecraft with photonic laser propulsion in the two-body problem|last = Hsiao|first = F.Y.|display-authors = etal|date = 2012|journal = Acta Astronautica|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.11.006|pmid = |volume = 84|pages = 215–226|bibcode = 2013AcAau..84..215H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bae's investigation concluded that the development of interplanetary and interstellar photonic railway will require development of the ways to utilize Photon [[Bose Einstein Condensation]] or diffraction-minimized laser beam propagation with non-diffracting beams, such as [[Bessel beam]], or [[x-ray lasers]] and future advanced material science and technologies.  Bae further concluded that the realization of the interstellar photonic railway would require that the PLT technology developments ride on the [[Moore’s law]] as the 20th century silicon devices did.

A '''prefabricated building''', informally a '''prefab''', is a building that is manufactured and constructed using [[prefabrication]]. It consists of factory-made components or units that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.

==History==
[[File:Villa Undine.JPG|thumb|''Villa Undine'' in [[Binz]] on German [[Rügen|Rugia Island]], built in 1885 by ''Wolgaster Holzbau''.]]
[[File:Prefabfront.jpg|thumb|right|Prefabricated post-war home at [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]] - Universal House, Mark 3, steel frame clad with corrugated [[asbestos cement]]]]
[[File:prefab 20060625.jpg|thumb|right|A 1950s metal UK prefab at the [[Rural Life Centre, Tilford]], Surrey.]]

Buildings have been built in one place and reassembled in another throughout history. This was especially true for mobile activities, or for new settlements; [[Great House (Cape Ann)|one of the first buildings]] at [[Cape Ann]] in 1624 was probably partially prefabricated, and was rapidly disassembled and moved at least once. [[John Rollo]] described in 1801 earlier use of portable hospital buildings in the [[West Indies]]&lt;ref name="Rollo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rollo|first1=John|title=A short account of the Royal Artillery Hospital at Woolwich: with some observations on the management of artillery soldiers, respecting the preservation of health.|date=1801|publisher=Mawman|location=London|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly the first advertised prefab house was the "Manning cottage". A London carpenter, Henry Manning, constructed a house that was built in components, then shipped and assembled by British emigrants. This was published at the time (advertisement, South Australian Record, 1837) and a few still stand in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94119708 Prefab: From Utilitarian Home To Design Icon], by Jim Zarroli, Morning Edition, September 15, 2008, NPR&lt;/ref&gt; One such is the [[Friends Meeting House, Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html Channel 9 South Australia Pty Ltd &gt; Postcards &gt; Friend's Meeting House] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317183329/http://www.postcards-sa.com.au/features2009/quakers_meeting_house.html |date=2012-03-17 }} Retrieved 8 September 2011

The peak year for the importation of portable buildings to Australia was 1853, when several hundred arrived. These have been identified as coming from [[Liverpool]], [[Boston]] and [[Singapore]] (with Chinese instructions for re-assembly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Barbados]] the [[Chattel house]] was a form of prefabricated building which was developed by emancipated slaves who had limited rights to build upon land they did not own. As the buildings were moveable they were legally regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1855 during the [[Crimean War]], after [[Florence Nightingale]] wrote a letter to ''[[The Times]]'', [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was commissioned to design a prefabricated modular hospital. In five months he designed the [[Renkioi Hospital]]: a 1,000 patient hospital, with innovations in sanitation, ventilation and a flushing toilet.&lt;ref&gt;Renkioi: Brunel's Forgotten Crimean War Hospital by Christopher Silver&lt;/ref&gt; Fabricator [[William Eassie]] constructed the required 16 units in [[Gloucester Docks]], shipped directly to the [[Dardanelles]]. Only used from March 1856 to September 1857, it reduced the death rate from 42% to 3.5%.

The world's first prefabricated, pre-cast panelled apartment blocks were pioneered in [[Liverpool]]. A process was invented by city engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]], whose inventive genius also had him inventing the football goal net. The tram stables at Walton in [[Liverpool]] followed in 1906.  The idea was not extensively adopted in Britain, however was widely adopted elsewhere, particularly in Eastern Europe.

Prefabricated homes were produced during the [[Gold Rush]] in the United States, when kits were produced to enable Californian prospectors to quickly construct accommodation. Homes were available in kit form by mail order in the United States in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902005129/http://www.chetboddy.com/Pages/factorybuilt.html |archivedate=2006-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefabricated housing was popular during the [[World War II|Second World War]] due to the need for mass accommodation for military personnel. The United States used [[Quonset hut]]s as military buildings, and in the United Kingdom prefabricated buildings used included [[Nissen hut]]s and [[Bellman Hangar]]s. 'Prefabs' were built after the war as a means of quickly and cheaply providing quality housing as a replacement for the housing destroyed during [[the Blitz]]. The proliferation of prefabricated housing across the country was a result of the [[Burt Committee]] and the [[Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944]]. Under the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] [[Emergency Factory Made]] housing programme, a specification was drawn up and bid on by various private construction and manufacturing companies. After approval by the MoW, companies could bid on Council led development schemes, resulting in whole estates of prefabs constructed to provide accommodation for those made homeless by the War and ongoing [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008181601/http://www.localhistory.scit.wlv.ac.uk/interesting/prefabs/prefabs.htm |archivedate=2006-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 160,000 had been built in the UK by 1948 at a cost of close to £216 million. The largest single prefab estate in Britain&lt;ref&gt;[[Belle Vale, Liverpool]]&lt;/ref&gt; was at [[Belle Vale]] (South Liverpool), where more than 1,100 were built after World War 2. The estate was demolished in the 1960s amid much controversy as the prefabs were very popular with residents at the time.
[[File:Prefabfrontroom.jpg|thumb|Amersham Prefab (COAM)-front room showing solid-fuel fire]]
Prefabs were aimed at families, and typically had an entrance hall, two bedrooms (parents and children), a bathroom (a room with a bath) &amp;nbsp;— which was a novel innovation for many Britons at that time, a separate toilet, a living room and an equipped (not ''fitted'' in the modern sense) kitchen. Construction materials included steel, aluminium, timber or [[asbestos]], depending on the type of dwelling. The aluminium ''Type B2'' prefab was produced as four pre-assembled sections which could be transported by lorry anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518065604/http://www.walespast.com/article-print.shtml?id=73 |archive-date=2006-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal House (pictured left &amp; lounge diner right) was given to the [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]] after 40 years temporary use. The Mark 3 was manufactured by the Universal Housing Company Ltd, Rickmansworth.

The United States used prefabricated housing for troops during the war and for GIs returning home. ''Prefab'' classrooms were popular with UK schools increasing their rolls during the [[baby boom]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

Many buildings were designed with a five-ten year life span, but have far exceeded this, with a number surviving today. In 2002, for example, the city of [[Bristol]] still had residents living in 700 examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/main.jhtml?xml=/property/2002/03/23/prefab23.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=The prefab four | first=Lesley | last=Gillilan | date=March 23, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UK councils have been in the process of demolishing the last surviving examples of Second World War prefabs in order to comply with the British government's [[Decent Homes Standard]], which came into effect in 2010. There has, however, been a recent revival in prefabricated methods of construction in order to compensate for the United Kingdom's current housing shortage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/mortgages/article.html?in_article_id=407133&amp;in_page_id=8|title=New age of the prefab house|work=This is Money}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prefabs and the modernist movement==
Architects are incorporating modern designs into the prefabricated houses of today. Prefab housing should no longer be compared to a mobile home in terms of appearance, but to that of a complex modernist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportablehomefinance.com.au/transportableHomeExplained.html|title=Transportable Homes, Explained|publisher=Transportable home finance|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been an increase in the use of "green" materials in the construction of these prefab houses. Consumers can easily select between different environmentally friendly finishes and wall systems. Since these homes are built in parts, it is easy for a home owner to add additional rooms or even solar panels to the roofs. Many prefab houses can be customized to the client's specific location and climate, making prefab homes much more flexible and modern than before.

There is a [[zeitgeist]] in architectural circles and the spirit of the age favors the small carbon footprint of "prefab." Eminent amongst the new breed of off the shelf luxury modernist products is the perrinepod,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inhabitat.com/2007/08/10/prefab-friday-perrinepod/|title=PREFAB FRIDAY: Perrinepod|work=inhabitat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has found favor worldwide for its green credentials and three-day build time.

Many eastern European countries had suffered physical damage during [[World War Two]] and their economies were in a very poor state. There was a need to reconstruct cities which had been severely damaged due to the war. For example, [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] had been practically razed to the ground under the planned destruction of Warsaw by German forces after the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The centre of [[Dresden]], Germany had been totally destroyed by the 1945 Allied bombardment. Stalingrad had been largely destroyed and only a small number of structures were left standing.

Prefabricated buildings served as an inexpensive and quick way to alleviate the massive housing shortages associated with the wartime destruction and large-scale [[urbanization]] and [[rural flight]].

[[File:Automobile radiator.jpg|thumb|right|Water-air convective cooling radiator]]
'''Radiators''' are [[heat exchanger]]s used to transfer [[thermal energy]] from one medium to another for the purpose of cooling and heating. The majority of radiators are constructed to function in [[automobiles]], [[buildings]], and [[electronics]]. The radiator is always a source of heat to its environment, although this may be for either the purpose of [[#Heating|heating]] this environment, or for cooling the fluid or [[coolant]] supplied to it, as for [[#Engine cooling|engine cooling]]. Despite the name, most radiators transfer the bulk of their heat via [[convection]] instead of [[thermal radiation]].  

The Roman [[hypocaust]] is an early example of a type of radiator for building space heating. [[Franz San Galli]], a Prussian-born [[Russia]]n businessman living in [[St. Petersburg]], is credited with inventing the heating radiator around 1855,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Radiation and convection==
[[Heat transfer]] from a radiator occurs by all the usual mechanisms: [[thermal radiation]],  [[convection]] into flowing air or liquid, and conduction into the air or liquid. A radiator may even transfer heat by [[Phase transition|phase change]], for example, drying a pair of socks.  In practice, the term "radiator" refers to any of a number of devices in which a liquid circulates through exposed pipes (often with fins or other means of increasing surface area).  The term "convector" refers to a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed.

To increase the surface area available for heat exchange with the surroundings, a radiator will have multiple fins, in contact with the tube carrying liquid pumped through the radiator. Air (or other exterior fluid) in contact with the fins carries off heat.  If air flow is obstructed by dirt or damage to the fins, that portion of the radiator is ineffective at heat transfer.

==Heating==
[[File:Radiator.svg|thumb|A Type 22 Convector Radiator, typical of a standard central heating system|alt=Type 21 Convector Radiator]]
{{Main|Radiator (heating)}}
Radiators are commonly used to heat buildings. In a [[central heating system]], hot water or sometimes steam is generated in a central boiler and circulated by pumps through radiators within the building, where this heat is transferred to the surroundings.

==Engine cooling==
[[File:Radiateur de voiture - 2.jpg|thumb|right|Car engine bay, with radiator in front]]
{{Main|Radiator (engine cooling)}}
[[File:Radiatore.jpg|thumb|Auto radiators with a double grid of tubes: staggered grids on the left, parallel grids on the right]]
Radiators are used for cooling [[internal combustion engine]]s, mainly in automobiles but also in piston-engined aircraft, [[railway locomotive]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[Fossil-fuel power plant|stationary generating plant]]s and other places where such engines are used.

To cool down the engine, a [[coolant]] is passed through the [[engine block]], where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the radiator (located either on the top of the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the [[Fin (extended surface)|fins]] that are lodged between each row of tubes. The fins then release the heat to the ambient air. Fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled coolant is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats.  Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.

This coolant is usually water-based, with the addition of [[glycol]]s to prevent freezing and other additives to limit [[corrosion]], [[erosion]] and [[cavitation]]. However, the coolant may also be an oil. The first engines used [[thermosiphon]]s to circulate the coolant; today, however, all but the smallest engines use [[pump]]s.

Up to the 1980s, radiator cores were often made of [[copper]] (for fins) and [[brass]] (for tubes, headers, and side-plates, while tanks could also be made of [[brass]] or of [[plastic]], often a [[polyamide]]). Starting in the 1970s, use of [[aluminium]] increased, eventually taking over the vast majority of vehicular radiator applications. The main inducements for aluminium are reduced weight and cost. 

Since air has a lower [[heat capacity]] and [[density]] than liquid coolants, a fairly large [[volume flow rate]] (relative to the coolant's) must be blown through the radiator core to capture the heat from the coolant. Radiators often have one or more [[Mechanical fan|fan]]s that blow air through the radiator. To save fan power consumption in vehicles, radiators are often behind the grille at the front end of a vehicle. [[Short ram air intake|Ram air]] can give a portion or all of the necessary cooling air flow when the coolant temperature remains below the system's designed maximum temperature, and the fan remains disengaged.

==Electronics==
{{main|Heat sink}}
[[File:Harumphy.dg965.heatsink.jpg|thumb|A passive heatsink on a motherboard]]
As electronic devices become smaller, the problem of dispersing [[waste heat]] becomes more difficult. Tiny radiators known as [[heat sink]]s are used to convey heat from the electronic components into a cooling air stream. Heatsink do not use water, rather they conduct the heat from the source (high-performance heat sinks have copper to conduct better).  Heat is transferred to the air by conduction and convection; a relatively small proportion of heat is transferred by radiation owing to the low temperature of semiconductor devices compared to their surroundings.

==Spacecraft==
{{see also|Spacecraft thermal control}}
Radiators are found as components of some spacecraft. These radiators work by radiating heat energy away as light (generally infrared given the temperatures at which spacecraft try to operate) because in the vacuum of space neither convection nor conduction can work to transfer heat away. On the International Space Station, these can be seen clearly as large white panels attached to the main truss. They can be found on both manned and unmanned craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Reliability''' in [[statistics]] and [[psychometrics]] is the overall consistency of a measure.&lt;ref&gt;William M.K. Trochim, [http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reliable.php Reliability]&lt;/ref&gt; A measure is said to have a high reliability if it produces similar results under consistent conditions. "It is the characteristic of a set of test scores that relates to the amount of random error from the measurement process that might be embedded in the scores. Scores that are highly reliable are accurate, reproducible, and consistent from one testing occasion to another. That is, if the testing process were repeated with a group of test takers, essentially the same results would be obtained. Various kinds of reliability coefficients, with values ranging between 0.00 (much error) and 1.00 (no error), are usually used to indicate the amount of error in the scores." &lt;ref&gt; National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorR &lt;/ref&gt; For example, measurements of people's height and weight are often extremely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Neil R. Carlson ... [et|title=Psychology : the science of behaviour|year=2009|publisher=Pearson|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|edition=4th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="themasb.org"&gt;The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board]] (MASB) endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212100753/http://www.themasb.org/common-language-project/ |date=12 February 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are several general classes of reliability estimates:
*'''[[Inter-rater reliability]]''' assesses the degree of agreement between two or more raters in their appraisals.
*'''[[Test-retest reliability]]''' assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next. Measurements are gathered from a single rater who uses the same methods or instruments and the same testing conditions.&lt;ref name="themasb.org"/&gt; This includes [[intra-rater reliability]].
*'''Inter-method reliability''' assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent when there is a variation in the methods or instruments used. This allows inter-rater reliability to be ruled out. When dealing with [[Form (document)|forms]], it may be termed '''parallel-forms reliability'''.&lt;ref name=socialresearchmethods&gt;[http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/reltypes.php Types of Reliability] The Research Methods Knowledge Base. Last Revised: 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Internal consistency]] reliability''', assesses the consistency of results across items within a test.&lt;ref name=socialresearchmethods/&gt;

==Difference from validity{{anchor|Validity}}==
{{see also|Validity (statistics)#Reliability}}

Reliability does not imply [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. That is, a reliable measure that is measuring something consistently is not necessarily measuring what you want to be measured. For example, while there are many reliable tests of specific abilities, not all of them would be valid for predicting, say, job performance.

While reliability does not imply [[validity (statistics)|validity]], reliability does place a limit on the overall validity of a test. A test that is not perfectly reliable cannot be perfectly valid, either as a means of measuring attributes of a person or as a means of predicting scores on a criterion. While a reliable test may provide useful valid information, a test that is not reliable cannot possibly be valid.&lt;ref name=David&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidshofer|first=Kevin R. Murphy, Charles O.|title=Psychological testing : principles and applications|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-189172-3|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a set of [[weighing scales]] consistently measured the weight of an object as 500 grams over the true weight, then the scale would be very reliable, but it would not be valid (as the returned weight is not the true weight). For the scale to be valid, it should return the true weight of an object. This example demonstrates that a perfectly reliable measure is not necessarily valid, but that a valid measure necessarily must be reliable.

==General model==

In practice, testing measures are never perfectly consistent. Theories of test reliability have been developed to estimate the effects of inconsistency on the accuracy of measurement. The basic starting point for almost all theories of test reliability is the idea that test scores reflect the influence of two sorts of factors:&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

1. '''Factors that contribute to consistency:''' stable characteristics of the individual or the attribute that one is trying to measure

2. '''Factors that contribute to inconsistency:''' features of the individual or the situation that can affect test scores but have nothing to do with the attribute being measured.

These factors include:&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

* Temporary but general characteristics of the individual: health, fatigue, motivation, emotional strain
* Temporary and specific characteristics of individual: comprehension of the specific test task, specific tricks or techniques of dealing with the particular test materials, fluctuations of memory, attention or accuracy
* Aspects of the testing situation: freedom from distractions, clarity of instructions, interaction of personality, sex, or race of examiner 
* Chance factors: luck in selection of answers by sheer guessing, momentary distractions

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to '''errors in measurement''' and how much is due to variability in '''true scores'''.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

A '''true score''' is the replicable feature of the concept being measured. It is the part of the observed score that would recur across different measurement occasions in the absence of error.

'''Errors of measurement''' are composed of both [[random error]]  and [[systematic error]]. It represents the discrepancies between scores obtained on tests and the corresponding true scores.

This conceptual breakdown is typically represented by the simple equation:

: &lt;big&gt;'''''Observed test score = true score + errors of measurement'''''&lt;/big&gt;

==Classical test theory==
{{main|Classical test theory}}

The goal of reliability theory is to estimate errors in measurement and to suggest ways of improving tests so that errors are minimized.

The central assumption of reliability theory is that measurement errors are essentially random. This does not mean that errors arise from random processes. For any individual, an error in measurement is not a completely random event. However, across a large number of individuals, the causes of measurement error are assumed to be so varied that measure errors act as random variables.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

If errors have the essential characteristics of random variables, then it is reasonable to assume that errors are equally likely to be positive or negative, and that they are not correlated with true scores or with errors on other tests.

It is assumed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gulliksen|first=Harold|title=Theory of mental tests|year=1987|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8058-0024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Mean error of measurement = 0

2. True scores and errors are uncorrelated

3. Errors on different measures are uncorrelated

Reliability theory shows that the variance of obtained scores is simply the sum of the variance of '''true scores''' plus the variance of '''errors of measurement'''.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_X = \sigma^2_T + \sigma^2_E &lt;/math&gt;

This equation suggests that test scores vary as the result of two factors:

1. Variability in true scores

2. Variability due to errors of measurement.

The reliability coefficient &lt;math&gt;\rho_{xx'} &lt;/math&gt; provides an index of the relative influence of true and error scores on attained test scores. In its general form, the reliability coefficient is defined as the ratio of ''true score'' variance to the total variance of test scores. Or, equivalently, one minus the ratio of the variation of the ''error score'' and the variation of the ''observed score'':

: &lt;math&gt; \rho_{xx'} = \frac{\sigma^2_T}{\sigma^2_X} = 1 - \frac{ \sigma^2_E }{ \sigma^2_X } &lt;/math&gt;

Unfortunately, there is no way to directly observe or calculate the '''true score''', so a variety of methods are used to estimate the reliability of a test.

Some examples of the methods to estimate reliability include [[test-retest reliability]], [[internal consistency]] reliability, and ''parallel-test reliability''. Each method comes at the problem of figuring out the source of error in the test somewhat differently.

==Item response theory==
It was well-known to classical test theorists that measurement precision is not uniform across the scale of measurement.  Tests tend to distinguish better for test-takers with moderate trait levels and worse among high- and low-scoring test-takers.  [[Item response theory]] extends the concept of reliability from a single index to a function called the ''information function''.  The IRT information function is the inverse of the conditional observed score standard error at any given test score.

==Estimation==

The goal of estimating reliability is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to errors in measurement and how much is due to variability in true scores.

Four practical strategies have been developed that provide workable methods of estimating test reliability.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

1. '''[[Test-retest reliability]] method''': directly assesses the degree to which test scores are consistent from one test administration to the next.

It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Re-administering the same test to the same group at some later time
* Correlating the first set of scores with the second

The correlation between scores on the first test and the scores on the retest is used to estimate the reliability of the test using the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]]: see also [[item-total correlation]].

2. '''Parallel-forms method''':

The key to this method is the development of alternate test forms that are equivalent in terms of content, response processes and statistical characteristics. For example, alternate forms exist for several tests of general intelligence, and these tests are generally seen equivalent.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

With the parallel test model it is possible to develop two forms of a test that are equivalent in the sense that a person’s true score on form A would be identical to their true score on form B. If both forms of the test were administered to a number of people, differences between scores on form A and form B may be due to errors in measurement only.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

It involves:

* Administering one form of the test to a group of individuals
* At some later time, administering an alternate form of the same test to the same group of people
* Correlating scores on form A with scores on form B

The correlation between scores on the two alternate forms is used to estimate the reliability of the test.

This method provides a partial solution to many of the problems inherent in the '''[[test-retest reliability]] method'''. For example, since the two forms of the test are different, [[carryover effect]] is less of a problem. Reactivity effects are also partially controlled; although taking the first test may change responses to the second test. However, it is reasonable to assume that the effect will not be as strong with alternate forms of the test as with two administrations of the same test.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

However, this technique has its disadvantages:

* It may be very difficult to create several alternate forms of a test
* It may also be difficult if not impossible to guarantee that two alternate forms of a test are parallel measures

3. '''Split-half method''':

This method treats the two halves of a measure as alternate forms. It provides a simple solution to the problem that the '''parallel-forms method''' faces: the difficulty in developing alternate forms.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

It involves:

* Administering a test to a group of individuals
* Splitting the test in half
* Correlating scores on one half of the test with scores on the other half of the test

The correlation between these two split halves is used in estimating the reliability of the test. This halves reliability estimate is then stepped up to the full test length using the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]].

There are several ways of splitting a test to estimate reliability. For example, a 40-item vocabulary test could be split into two subtests, the first one made up of items 1 through 20 and the second made up of items 21 through 40. However, the responses from the first half may be systematically different from responses in the second half due to an increase in item difficulty and fatigue.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

In splitting a test, the two halves would need to be as similar as possible, both in terms of their content and in terms of the probable state of the respondent. The simplest method is to adopt an odd-even split, in which the odd-numbered items form one half of the test and the even-numbered items form the other. This arrangement guarantees that each half will contain an equal number of items from the beginning, middle, and end of the original test.&lt;ref name =David /&gt;

4. '''[[Internal consistency]]''': assesses the consistency of results across items within a test. The most common internal consistency measure is [[Cronbach's alpha]], which is usually interpreted as the mean of all possible split-half coefficients.&lt;ref name="Cortina"&gt;Cortina, J.M., (1993). What Is Coefficient Alpha? An Examination of Theory and Applications. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78''(1), 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cronbach's alpha is a generalization of an earlier form of estimating internal consistency, [[Kuder–Richardson Formula 20]].&lt;ref name="Cortina" /&gt; Although the most commonly used, there are some misconceptions regarding Cronbach's alpha.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, N. (2010). Understanding a widely misunderstood statistic: Cronbach's alpha. Paper presented at Southwestern Educational Research Association (SERA) Conference 2010, New Orleans, LA (ED526237).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Eisinga|first2=M.|last2=Te Grotenhuis|first3=B.|last3=Pelzer|title=The reliability of a two-item scale: Pearson, Cronbach or Spearman-Brown? |journal= International Journal of Public Health|year=2012|volume=58|issue=4|pages=637–642|doi= 10.1007/s00038-012-0416-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These measures of reliability differ in their sensitivity to different sources of error and so need not be equal.  Also, reliability is a property of the ''scores of a measure'' rather than the measure itself and are thus said to be ''sample dependent''.  Reliability estimates from one sample might differ from those of a second sample (beyond what might be expected due to sampling variations) if the second sample is drawn from a different population because the true variability is different in this second population.  (This is true of measures of all types—yardsticks might measure houses well yet have poor reliability when used to measure the lengths of insects.)

Reliability may be improved by clarity of expression (for written assessments), lengthening the measure,&lt;ref name="Cortina" /&gt; and other informal means. However, formal psychometric analysis, called item analysis, is considered the most effective way to increase reliability. This analysis consists of computation of '''item difficulties''' and '''item discrimination''' indices, the latter index involving computation of correlations between the items and sum of the item scores of the entire test. If items that are too difficult, too easy, and/or have near-zero or negative discrimination are replaced with better items, the reliability of the measure will increase.

* &lt;math&gt;R(t) = 1 - F(t).&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R(t) = \exp(-\lambda t).&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the failure rate)

'''Roger Tiley''' is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[documentary photographer]]. His work on documenting the [[coal mine]]s of [[Wales]] and [[United States|America]] has been used extensively in publications. Specifically during the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)]].

==Life and work==
Tiley first worked in photography as an industrial photographer for [[Lucas Industries plc|Lucas Industries]], a large car component company. He spent four years there and subsequently decided to specialise in [[documentary photography]].

He studied at the School of [[Documentary Photography]] under Magnum photographer [[David Hurn]].

On completion of the course in 1984, Tiley worked for a number of national newspapers and magazines, including ''[[The Times]],''&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;http://www.channel4.com/news/miners-strike-south-wales-exhibition-alan-sandel-roger-tiley&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sunday Times]],'' ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref name="channel4" /&gt; and ''[[The Observer]].'' Much of his journalistic work was based on the miners strike in 1984/85.

Because of his work on the miners strike, he was commissioned, along with [[David Bailey]], [[John Davies (photographer)]] and [[Paul Reas]] to produce "The Valleys Project", a collection of photographs reflecting life in the [[South Wales Valleys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ffotogallery.org/whats-on/the-valleys-archive | accessdate = 24 April 2014 | publisher = [[Ffotogallery]] | title = The Valleys Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;A resource on the Valleys Project is available at [http://www.ffotogallery.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ffotogallery-TheValleysArchive.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; They are meticulously annotated with context information and encompass every part of the miners' lives.

Since the 1980s, Tiley has concentrated on working on commissions for exhibitions, archive collections, television and book publication. Over the past three decades, Tiley has had work exhibited and published regularly in Europe and the US and is the author of three books.

His commissions include photographing the Welsh descendants living in [[Pennsylvania]] and covering extensively the [[Coal in the United States|mining communities]] of [[West Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Virginia]], and [[Tennessee]].

He is now  a former lecturer in photography, media studies and graphic design at [[Gower College Swansea]], Wales. He has delivered lectures on his photographic practice in the UK and the US. He is also involved in delivering photography workshops on landscape and documentary photography.

Tiley was awarded a commission to photograph the manufactured coast-scape in Wales. For the year-long project He travelled around the coastline of Wales to make photographs of the way the coast line has been adapted to cater for twenty-first-century needs. This included photographing industrial manufacturing plants, the tourism industry and the need for power generation. The work was exhibited in Europe and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aberystwythartscentre.co.uk/exhibitions/roger-tiley-manufactured-coast&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiley was the only photographer allowed to photograph underground on the coal face of the last deep coal mine in the UK, Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire. This work was commissioned by Keo Films, London, who made a BBC documentary titled 'The Last Miners'. It was also published as a book by 2Ten Books.

Tiley has also produced and directed moving image.&lt;ref name="channel4" /&gt;

His work has been featured on a number of television and radio features in the UK, Europe and the US.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Tiley worked on a project called ''Thirty Years Ago'', re-visiting the mining communities he photographed thirty years ago and making portraits of former miners, along with people involved in mining today. His work is closely linked to his upbringing in the south Wales valleys. He is very proud of his birthplace. To this day, he supports the miners and feels sad to see the demise of the industrial valleys.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24906205&lt;/ref&gt;

'''S-200''' is a [[bioremediation]] product used to clean up [[oil spill]]s.  It is an oleophilic nitrogen-phosphorus nutrient  that promotes the growth of micro-organisms that degrade [[hydrocarbon]]s (such as oil and fuel).  S-200 bonds to the hydrocarbon to eliminate the need to reapply in tidal or rain events. S-200 is identified as a bioremediation accelerator and as such, does not contain bacterial cultures, but rather  contributes to the establishment of a robust microbial population.  In the laboratory, considerable biodegradation to alkanes was seen over the course of treatment. Field trials have yielded inconsistent results.

The product was developed by International Environmental Products, a US company based around S-200 as its product.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/133401958.html|title=IEP Develops cost-effective oil pollution treatment|date=2005-07-01|work=Industrial Environment|accessdate=2009-05-03|publisher=International Environmental Products }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field tests==

After laboratory and field trials, S-200 was the only bioremediation process selected by the Spanish Department of National Parks for the final cleanup of the [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n coastline following the [[Prestige oil tanker spill]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The effects of the product were studied on a beach affected by the  spill]  off the coast of Spain in 2002. A  study concluded that it enhanced the biodegradation rate of specific compounds, but  did not establish whether it had improved the visible aspect of the beach, detached stuck oil, or reduced weathered oil.{{which|date=January 2015}} Other compounds, such as [[uric acid]] and [[lecithin]], may be more effective than S-200, but wash off in tidal areas or rain events and must be applied continuously.  In 2006, other researchers summarized the findings of experiments on Prestige-affected coastal areas, concluding that oloephilic substances such as S-200 were of "limited effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Gallego, E. Gonzalez-Rojas, A. I. Pelaez, J. Sanchez, M. J. Garcia-Martinez, and J. F. Llamas. "Effectiveness of bioremediation for the Prestige fuel spill: A summary of case studies". Advanced Technology in the Environmental Field: Second IASTED International Conference Proceedings. February 6–8, 2006; Lanzarote, Spain.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a field bioremediation assay was conducted by the Department of Microbiology, [[University of Barcelona]] on the use of S-200 ten months after the Prestige heavy fuel-oil spill on a beach of the Cantabrian coast in northern Spain. The field survey indicated that the product enhanced the biodegradation rate, particularly of high molecular weight n-alkanes, alkylcyclohexanes, and benzenes, and alkylated PAHs. The most significant molecular bioremediation indicators were the depletion of diasteranes and C-27 [[sterane]] components.&lt;ref name="prestige"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es052370z|title=The Prestige Oil Spill. 2.

However, the study was confined to analysis of specific compounds, and did not report whether the application of S-200 caused a decrease in the amount of weathered oil, the detachment of any oil that had been stuck, or any improvement to the visible appearance of the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evaluation of biodiesel as bioremediation agent for the treatment of the shore affected by the heavy oil spill of the Prestige|author1=P.

'''Search Engine Watch''' (SEW) provides news and information about [[search engines]] and [[search engine marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/28/technology/the-crumbs-you-leave-behind.html|title=The Crumbs You Leave Behind|last=Mitchell|first=Dan|date=2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Search Engine Watch was started by [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]] in 1996. In 1997, Sullivan sold it for an undisclosed amount to [[WebMediaBrands|MecklerMedia]] (now WebMediaBrands). In 2005 the website and related [[Search Engine Strategies]] conference series were sold to [[Incisive Media]] for $43 million. On November 30, 2006, Danny Sullivan left Search Engine Watch, after his resignation announcement on August 29, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-063058 Stepping Down From Search Engine Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901115553/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-063058 |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Lieb was named editor-in-chief the following month.

In 2015, Incisive Media sold [[Search Engine Strategies|SES]], Search Engine Watch, and [[ClickZ]] to Blenheim Chalcot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Incisive Media's ClickZ, SES &amp; Search Engine Watch Acquired By Blenheim Chalcot| work = Marketing Land| accessdate = 2015-05-06| url = http://marketingland.com/incisive-medias-clickz-ses-and-sew-acquired-by-london-based-blenheim-chalcot-125871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[railroad]]ing, '''slack action'''  is the amount of free movement of one car before it transmits its motion to an adjoining coupled car. This free movement results from the fact that in railroad practice cars are loosely coupled, and the [[Railway coupling|coupling]] is often combined with a shock-absorbing device, a "[[draft gear]]," which, under stress, substantially increases the free movement as the train is started or stopped. Loose coupling is necessary to enable the train to bend around curves and is an aid in starting heavy trains, since the application of the locomotive power to the train operates on each car in the train successively, and the power is thus utilized to start only one car at a time.

==United Kingdom==
The UK formerly used three link couplings which allowed a large amount of slack; these have since been replaced by [[buffers and chain coupler]]s.  While the couplings are held tight by buffers and shortened by a turnbuckle, other railways decided to replace them with automatic couplings, such as the [[Scharfenberg coupler]] and the [[Janney_coupler|Janney Coupler]].

[[Image:Swedish buffet-Smörgåsbord-01 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|225px|''Smörgåsbord'', Swedish buffet]]
'''Smörgåsbord''' ({{IPA-sv|²smœrɡɔsˌbuːɖ|lang|Sv-Smörgåsbord.oga}}) is a type of [[Scandinavia]]n meal, originating in [[Sweden]], served [[buffet]]-style with multiple hot and cold dishes of various foods on a table. 

Smörgåsbord became internationally known at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when it was offered at the Swedish Pavilion's "Three Crowns Restaurant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadling.com/2008/02/23/straight-up-scandinavia-understanding-the-smorgasbord/ |title=Straight-up Scandinavia: Understanding the smörgåsbord |work=Gadling |accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically a celebratory meal and guests can help themselves from a range of dishes laid out for their choice. In a [[restaurant]] the term refers to a [[buffet|buffet-style table]] laid out with many small dishes from which, for a fixed amount of money, one is allowed to choose as many as one wishes. In [[Pennsylvania]], smorgasbords are popular [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country|Pennsylvania Dutch]]-style buffets that are often associated with [[Amish]]-made meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bird-in-hand.com/dining/bird-in-hand-family-restaurant-smorgasbord/|title=Bird-in-Hand Smorgasbord in Lancaster County, PA|last=|first=|date=|work=Bird-in-Hand|access-date=2018-03-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ny nordisk mat (12).jpg|thumb|right|A Nordic smorgasbord]]
In Northern Europe, the term varies between 'cold table' and 'buffet': In [[Norway]] it is called '''koldtbord''' or '''kaldtbord''' and in [[Denmark]] '''det kolde bord''' (literally ''the cold table''); in [[Germany]] '''kaltes Buffet''' (literally ''cold buffet''); in [[The Netherlands]] '''koud buffet''' (''cold buffet''); in [[Iceland]] it is called '''hlaðborð''' (''farmyard/courtyard table''), in [[Estonia]] it is called '''külmlaud''' (''cold table'') or '''rootsi laud''' (''Swedish table''), in [[Finland]] '''voileipäpöytä''' (''butter-bread/sandwich table'') or '''ruotsalainen seisova pöytä''' (''Swedish standing table/buffet''). In Eastern Europe, each language has a term that literally means ''Swedish table''. Similarly, in [[Japan]] '''バイキング''' / '''ヴァイキング''' (''baikingu'' / ''vaikingu'', i.e. "Viking") is a popular name used.

The Swedish word ''smörgåsbord'' consists of the words ''smörgås'' (sandwich, usually [[open sandwich|open-faced]]) and ''bord'' (table). ''Smörgås'' in turn consists of the words ''smör'' (butter, cognate with English ''smear'') and ''gås''. ''Gås'' literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of [[butter]] that formed and floated to the surface of cream while it was churned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Grünbaum |last=Catharina |title=Smörgåsar men datormöss |url= http://dn.se/kultur-noje/spraket/smorgasar-men-datormoss-1.431186 |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2009-03-05 |language=Swedish |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5f3EOmfx8 |archivedate=2009-03-05 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants of fat geese swimming to the surface.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so ''smörgås'' came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term ''att breda smörgåsar'' (to spread butter on open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.

In [[English language|English]] and also in Scandinavian languages, the word ''smörgåsbord'' refers loosely to any [[buffet]] with a variety of dishes — not necessarily with any connection to the Swedish Christmas traditions discussed in this article. In an extended sense, the word is used to refer to any situation which invites patrons to select whatever they wish among lots of pleasant things, such as the smorgasbord of university courses, books in a bookstore, etc. In the Scandinavian languages, ö/ø and å are separate letters and are correctly transliterated as oe and aa, respectively, not as o and a. If the ö and å letters aren't available, the word can be correctly rendered as smoergaasbord.

== Smörgåsbord and julbord ==
[[File:Smörgåsbord foods.jpg|thumb|Smörgåsbord foods]]
A traditional [[Sweden|Swedish]] ''smörgåsbord'' consists of both hot and cold dishes. Bread, butter, and cheese are always part of the ''smörgåsbord''. It is customary to begin with the cold fish dishes which are generally various forms of [[herring]], [[salmon]], and [[eel]]. After eating the first portion, people usually continue with the second course (other cold dishes), and round off with hot dishes. [[Dessert]] may or may not be included in a smörgåsbord.

=== Julbord ===
{{see also|julebord}}
A special Swedish type of ''smörgåsbord'' is the ''julbord'' (literally "Yule/Christmas table"). The classic Swedish julbord is central to traditional [[Swedish cuisine]], often including bread dipped in ham [[broth]] and continuing with a variety of fish (salmon, herring, whitefish and eel), baked ham, meatballs, pork ribs, [[head cheese]], sausages, potato, [[Janssons frestelse]], boiled potatoes, cheeses, beetroot salad, various forms of boiled cabbage, [[kale]] and rice pudding.

It is customary to eat particular foods together; herring is typically eaten with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs and is frequently accompanied by strong spirits like [[snaps]], [[brännvin]] or [[akvavit]] with or without spices. Other traditional foods are smoked eel, [[rollmops]], herring salad, baked herring and smoked salmon.
[[File:Julbord 1990b.jpg|thumb|[[Christmas|Julbord]] for "[[Gustavsberg VII]]" in 1990]]

Other dishes are pork sausages (''[[fläskkorv]]''), smoked pork and potato sausages (''[[isterband]]''), [[cabbage rolls]] (''[[kåldolmar]]''), [[baked beans]], [[omelette]] with shrimps or mushrooms covered with béchamel sauce. Side dishes include [[beetroot]] salad in mayonnaise and warm stewed red, green or brown [[cabbage]].

[[Lutfisk]], lyed fish made of stockfish (dried [[Common ling|ling]] or [[cod]] served with boiled potato and thick [[white sauce]]) and green peas that can be served with the warm dishes or as a separate fourth course. Lutfisk is often served as dinner the second day after the traditional Christmas Yule-table dinner. Julbord desserts include [[rice pudding]] (''risgrynsgröt''), sprinkled with [[cinnamon]] powder.&lt;sup&gt;[http://media.hd.se/2006/12/14/185624/large/grot1.jpg photo]&lt;/sup&gt; Traditionally, an [[almond]] is hidden in the bowl of rice porridge, and whoever finds it receives a small prize or is recognized for having good luck.
Julbord is served from early December until just before Christmas at restaurants and until [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in some homes. It is tradition for most Swedish and Norwegian workplaces to hold an annual Julbord between November and January.

In Denmark a typical tradition resembling the Swedish ''julbord'' is ''Julefrokost'' ("Christmas-lunch"), which involves a wellstocked Danish [[Danish cuisine#Det kolde bord|smörgåsbord]] with cold as well as hot dishes, and plenty of beer and [[snaps]]. It is distinct from the Danish Christmas dinner, which is served on December 24, and is served as a lunchtime meal, usually for family and friends on December 25 or 26. It is also a tradition for most Danish workplaces to hold an annual Julefrokost some time during the months of November to January.

==History ==

The members of the Swedish merchant and upper class in sixteenth-century Sweden and Finland served [[schnapps]] table (''brännvinsbord''), a small buffet presented on a side table offering a variety of [[hors d'oeuvres]] served prior to a meal before sitting at the dinner table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bewilderingstories.com/issue318/smorgasbord.html|title=The Smorgasbord|author=Bertil Falk|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most simple '' brännvinsbord '' was bread, butter, cheese, herring and several types of liqueurs; but smoked salmon, sausages and cold cuts were also served. The '' brännvinsbord '' was served as an appetizer for a gathering of people and eaten while standing before a dinner or supper, often two to five hours before dinner, sometimes with the men and women in separate rooms.&lt;ref name="Nordiska Museet"&gt;[http://www.nordiskamuseet.se/Publication.asp?publicationid=10676 Nordiska Museet], in Swedish&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''smörgåsbord'' became popular in the mid-seventeenth century, when the food moved from the side table to the main table&lt;ref name="Nordiska Museet"/&gt; and service began containing both warm and cold dishes. ''Smörgåsbord'' was also served as an appetizer in hotels and later at [[railway station]]s, before the [[dining car]]s time for the guests.  Restaurants in Stockholm at the [[1912 Olympic Games]] stopped serving ''smörgåsbord '' as an appetizer and started serving them instead as a main course.

'''Structured ASIC''' is an intermediate technology between [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] and [[FPGA]], offering high performance, a characteristic of ASIC, and low [[Non-recurring engineering|NRE]] cost, a characteristic of FPGA.
Using Structured ASIC allows products to be introduced quickly to market, to have lower cost and to be designed with ease.

In a FPGA, interconnects and logic blocks are programmable after fabrication, offering high flexibility of design and ease of debugging in prototyping.
However, the capability of FPGAs to implement large circuits is limited, in both size and speed, due to complexity in programmable routing, and significant space occupied by programming elements, e.g. SRAMs, MUXes.
On the other hand, ASIC design flow is expensive.
Every different design needs a complete different set of masks.
The Structured ASIC is a solution between these two.
It has basically the same structure as a FPGA, but being mask-programmable instead of field-programmable, by configuring one or several via layers between metal layers.
Every SRAM configuration bit can be replaced by a choice of putting a via or not between metal contacts. 

A number of commercial vendors have introduced structured ASIC products. They have a wide range of configurability, from a single via layer to 6 metal and 6 via layers. Altera's Hardcopy-II, eASIC's Nextreme are examples of commercial structured ASICs.

'''Swords to ploughshares''' (or '''Swords to plowshares''') is a concept in which military [[weapon]]s or technologies are converted for peaceful civilian applications.

The phrase originates from the [[Book of Isaiah]]:

{{quote|And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the {{Sc|L|ORD}}, to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the {{Sc|L|ORD}} from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.—{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|2:3–4|KJV}}}}

The ''[[plowshare|ploughshare]]'' is often used to symbolize creative tools that benefit humankind, as opposed to destructive tools of war, symbolized by the ''[[sword]]'', a similar sharp metal tool with an arguably opposite use.

In addition to the original Biblical Messianic intent, the expression "beat swords into ploughshares" has been used by disparate social and political groups.

An ongoing example as of 2013 is the dismantling of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the use of their contents as fuel in civilian electric [[power station]]s, the [[Megatons to Megawatts Program]]. [[Nuclear fission]] development, originally accelerated for [[World War II]] weapons needs, has been applied to many civilian purposes since its use at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including electricity and [[radiopharmaceutical]] production.

==Biblical references==
This [[analogy]] is used several times in the [[Old Testament]] or [[Tanakh]], in both directions, such as in the following verses:

{{quote|And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|KJV}}}}

{{quote|Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.|Christian [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|versification]]: {{bibleref|Joel|3:10|KJV}} Jewish versification: {{bibleref|Joel|4:10|JPR}}}}

{{quote|And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.|{{bibleref|Micah|4:3|KJV}}}}

An expression of this concept can be seen in a [[bronze]] statue in the [[United Nations]] garden called ''Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares'', a gift from the [[Soviet Union]] sculpted by [[Evgeniy Vuchetich]], representing the figure of a man hammering a sword into the shape of a plowshare.

==Practical applications==
*After World War II, [[military surplus]] [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFVs]] were sometimes converted into [[bulldozer]]s, agricultural, and logging tractors, as seen in the American television series [[Axe Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/military-vehicle-news/civilianshermans-after-the-war-they-went-to-work.html|title=Civilian Shermans: after the war - they went to work...|first=Simon|last=Templar|date=11 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two are currently preserved at the [[Swords and Ploughshares Museum]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/spoelstra/g104/ploughshare.htm|title=Shermans into ploughshares|first=Hanno|last=Spoelstra|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calnan.com/swords/|title=The Swords And Ploughshares Museum|website=www.calnan.com|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; French farmers sometimes used modified versions of the obsolete [[FT-17 tank]], and similar vehicles, based on the [[T-34 tank]], remain in widespread use in the former USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2341811.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Monitoring - Media reports - Ukraine turns tank into tractor|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Crawford, a British agricultural engineer and collector of classic tractors, owns a [[Sherman tank]] that was adapted to plow Lincolnshire's fields in response to the shortage of [[crawler tractor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inter.nl.net/users/spoelstra/g104/ploughshare.htm|title=Shermans into ploughshares|first=Hanno|last=Spoelstra|website=web.inter.nl.net|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* From the 1970s onwards, several [[anti-war]] musicians play guitars made from [[military surplus]] weapons. Jamaican [[reggae]] star [[Pete Tosh]] famously owned a [[Stratocaster]] built around an [[M-16 rifle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diply.com/reggae/article/tosh-m16-guitar|title=More Than Music: Peter Tosh And His M16 Rifle Guitar|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present day the [[Escopetarra]], a guitar converted from the [[AK-47]], is the signature instrument of [[César López]], [[Souriya Sunshine]] and [[Sami Lopakka]] of the Finnish [[death metal]] band [[Sentenced]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/newsletter/en/perspectives/no03/page008.html|title=UNODC Perspectives No. 3 - Escopetarra: Instrument of peace|first=|last=UNODC|website=www.unodc.org|accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political and popular culture==
* Twelve term US Congressman and three time presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]] wrote a book entitled ''Swords into Plowshares: A Life in Wartime and a Future of Peace and Prosperity'', in which he discusses growing up during World War II and living his life through war after war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Swords-into-Plowshares-Ron-Paul/dp/0996426507|title=Swords into Plowshares|first=Ron|last=Paul|date=17 July 2015|publisher=Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity|accessdate=11 June 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his [[Eisenhower's farewell address|farewell address]], U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]], when speaking about the [[military-industrial complex]] stated:
{{quote|Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations.}}
* For his [[First inauguration of Richard Nixon|first]] and [[Second inauguration of Richard Nixon|second]] inaugurations, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] took the oath of office with his hand on two family Bibles, opened to Isaiah 2:2-4.&lt;ref name="UPI 1969"&gt;{{cite news |author=United Press International (UPI) |title=Protestors' shouts mar inaugural ceremonies | date=20 January 1973 | url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1973/01/20/Protestors-shouts-mar-inaugural-ceremonies/9270282371459/ | access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://time.com/4639596/inauguration-day-presidents-bible-passages/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ross | first=Scott | title=Obama's Inaugural Bibles: Lincoln, MLK | website=NBC 6 South Florida | date=21 January 2013 | url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/national-international/Inuaration-Day-Bibles-and-Passages-186343462.html | access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cannot swords be turned to plowshares? Can we and all nations not live in peace? In our obsession with antagonisms of the moment, we often forget how much unites all the members of humanity. Perhaps we need some outside, universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences world-wide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world. And yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already among us? What could be more alien than war and the threat of war?}}
*The popular [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] song "The Vine and Fig Tree" repeats the verse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fredsakademiet.dk/abase/sange/greenham/song9.htm |title=Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp Songbook |publisher=Fredsakademiet.dk |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And everyone neath their vine and fig tree
shall live in peace and unafraid,
Everyone neath their vine and fig tree
shall live in peace and unafraid.
And into ploughshares beat their swords
Nations shall learn war no more.
And into ploughshares beat their swords
Nations shall learn war no more.&lt;/poem&gt;}}
*The song "[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]" by [[Don Henley]] (1989) uses the Joel inverted version of the phrase:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords
For this tired old man that we elected king&lt;/poem&gt;}}
* "[[Heal the World]]" by [[Michael Jackson]] (1991):
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn
Their swords into plowshares&lt;/poem&gt;}}
* Finale of the musical ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'':
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord.
They will walk behind the ploughshare,
They will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

* A poem by Israeli poet [[Yehuda Amichai]]:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Don’t stop after beating the swords
into plowshares, don’t stop! Go on beating
and make musical instruments out of them.
Whoever wants to make war again
will have to turn them into plowshares first.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''''The Magic Box''''' is a 1951 British, [[Technicolor]], biographical drama film, directed by [[John Boulting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6bf4e62e|title=The Magic Box (1951)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film stars [[Robert Donat]] as [[William Friese-Greene]], with a host of cameo appearances by actors including [[Peter Ustinov]] and [[Laurence Olivier]]. It was produced by [[Ronald Neame]] and distributed by [[British Lion Film Corporation]]. The film was a project of the [[Festival of Britain]] and adapted by [[Eric Ambler]] from the controversial biography by Ray Allister.

This biographical drama gives an account of the life of William Friese-Greene, who first designed and patented one of the earliest working cinematic cameras. Told in flashback, the film details Friese-Greene's tireless experiments with the "moving image", leading inexorably to a series of failures and disappointments, as others hog the credit for the protagonist's discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-magic-box-100913|title=The Magic Box (1951) - John Boulting - Synopsis, Characteristics, Moods, Themes and Related - AllMovie|website=AllMovie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot ==
In 1921, William Friese-Greene, in dire financial straits and separated from his wife, but still working, attends a film conference in London. He is saddened that all those attending are businessmen interested only in moneymaking. He attempts to speak, but no-one is interested and he sits down. He thinks back to his early pioneering days.

Young "Willie" works as an assistant to photographer Maurice Guttenberg, who will not let him take portraits his way. He leaves and, with his new wife, a client of his former employer, he opens a studio. After a slow start, he does well and opens other studios, but he is more interested in developing moving pictures and colour films. He single-mindedly works on his ideas, spending more and more money, and is eventually declared bankrupt. With the coming of World War I, their sons (one under age) enlist in the army to relieve their parents of the burden of providing for them.

In partnership with a businessman, he develops his ideas, but the partnership sours and he's on his own, bankrupt, again. Nevertheless, he perseveres and, late one night, he projects the short film he has taken in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] that afternoon. Excited, he rushes out and drags in a passing policeman, portrayed by Laurence Olivier (credited as Larry Oliver), to witness the success of the film. The policeman is dumbfounded, not quite comprehending what he has just seen.

Back at the conference, Friese-Greene again stands up to speak, but becomes incoherent and is forced to sit down. He collapses. A doctor is called, but it is too late. Examining the contents of his pockets in an attempt to identify him, the doctor comments that all the money he could find was just enough for a ticket to the cinema.

The '''Volksflugzeug''' (People’s Aircraft) was a grand [[Third Reich]] scheme for the mass-production of a small and simple airplane in the 1930s. It was one of the attempts of the Nazi regime to use consumer technologies as a propaganda tool.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fritzsche, ''Machine Dreams: Airmindedness and the Reinvention of Germany,'' American
Historical Review 98 (1993): 685-709&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]] car, the showpiece of the [[Nazi]]'s attempt to appear to work for the good of the average German,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/vw.htm The Volkswagen car]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the less-known ''[[Volksempfänger]]'' radio, the ''Volkskühlschrank'' [[refrigerator]] and the ''Volksgasmaske'' [[gas mask]], the Volksflugzeug project was contemplated but never fully realized.&lt;ref name="WK"/&gt;

The Volksflugzeug grand plan surfaced at different times and in different locations in Germany during Nazi rule. However, since it only had lukewarm official backing, it remained ill-defined and vague. Finally [[World War II]] dictated priorities ended abruptly most of the projects connected with the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftarchiv.de/index.htm?/flugzeuge/fieseler/fi253.htm Fieseler Fi 253]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
[[File:1929 Etrich Sport Taube (2).jpg|thumb|The Etrich Sport-Taube at the [[National Technical Museum (Prague)]].]]

===Early attempts===
The idea of a ‘People's Aircraft’ predated the Nazi regime. Its main source of inspiration was [[Henry Ford]]’s [[Ford T]]. After the industrial production of a cheap car that the ordinary citizen could afford was made possible, there was only one step in the minds of some towards building an aircraft on the same pattern. The idea of a ‘People's Plane’ was put forward to Henry Ford  by [[William Bushnell Stout]] and Ford immediately became enthusiastic about it. The [[Ford Flivver]] was the resulting plane, a project that ended up not becoming as successful as expected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fliegerweb.com/de/lexicon/Geschichte/Ford+Flivver-632 Flieger - Ford Flivver]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In Germany itself, some projects in the second half of the 1920 decade were intended as early Volksflugzeug planes. Already in 1928 the [[Raab-Katzenstein RK-9]] ''Grasmücke'' ([[Typical warbler|Warbler]]) was a 2-seat biplane trainer fitted with a 3-cylinder [[Anzani]] motor that was planned as a 'Volksflugzeug'. The [[Etrich Sport-Taube]], built in 1929 by the [[Etrich]] company, was also intended as a Volksflugzeug, but it soon faced difficulties regarding production in series and the project was given up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_E/Etrich_Igo_1879_1967.xml Sport-Taube]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other early People’s Aircraft projects were the [[Deicke ADM 11]] ''Volksflugzeug'' built in 1933,&lt;ref&gt;[http://histaviation.com/Deicke.html Arthur Deicke , München ADM 11]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gerner G.I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airwar.ru/enc/law1/gernerg1.html Gerner G.I]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gerner G II R|G.II]] biplanes, and the [[Messerschmitt M 17]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://histaviation.com/Gerner_G_II.html Flugzeugbau Max Gerner]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers such as [[Hanns Klemm]] saw that there was a future in [[light aircraft]]. This led Klemm to design the [[Daimler L15]] while he worked at the [[Daimler Benz|Daimler Motor Company]] in [[Sindelfingen]].
Klemm had a clear goal: to build in series a Volksflugzeug, a plane that would be low in production costs, fitted with a low-priced motor and low in maintenance. Later, after leaving Daimler, Klemm established his own company [[Leichtflugzeugbau Klemm]] in [[Böblingen]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meilenwerk.com/meilenwerk/stuttgart/historie-meilenwerk-region-stuttgart Stuttgart Region, History: Ein Flugzeug für jedermann (A Plane for Everybody)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a competition for the construction of a single-seat low-cost Volksflugzeug in the early 1930s before the [[Nazi Party]] came to power.  In addition to industrial and private companies, also academic groups took part in the contest. Thus the ''Akademische Fliegergruppe Berlin'' of the Berlin Technical High School produced the B 4, also known as „FF“, ''fast fertig'' (almost ready) and won the first prize. Following the Nazi takeover such Academic Flying Groups were disbanded through a decree issued on 11 April 1933 by the [[Reichskommissar]] responsible for aviation.&lt;ref&gt;''Hundert Jahre Akademische Fliegergruppe Berlin / Technische Hochschule zu Berlin'' , Der Lilienthaler, Heft 4/2010 13. Jahrgang - A46951&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propaganda tool ===
The prefix ‘Volks-’ became for National Socialism a kind of honor badge that was awarded to selected industrial products. The capacity to mass-produce such items flattered a totalitarian state which sought to present itself as a leader in technical progress as well as the forerunner of a more egalitarian world led by the [[Adolf Hitler|Führer]]. 
In the post war years such people's projects were often mentioned as “the good side” of the Nazi times.&lt;ref name="WK"&gt;Wolfgang König. ''Volkswagen, Volksempfänger, Volksgemeinschaft - 'Volksprodukte' im Dritten Reich: Vom Scheitern einer nationalsozialistischen Komsumgesellschaft,'' Schöningh, 2004 {{ISBN|9783506717337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/623951/How_We_Learned_to_Live_with_the_Bombs_Materialities_and_Mentalities_of_Urban_Terrormindedness How We Learned to Live with the Bombs Materialities and Mentalities of Urban Terrormindedness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Initiative and eventual instructions regarding the “People’s Products” proposals came from the [[German Labour Front]], led by [[Robert Ley]], as well as from the [[Nazi Propaganda Ministry]] led by Joseph Goebbels. Political, ideological, as well as economical factors dictated their viability within the Nazi context. The “People’s Products” had a double function, on one hand they were key elements of the [[Nazi Propaganda|official propaganda]], which promised an affluent and comfortable future society to citizens,  mainly in order to make the actual economic hardships dictated by the [[German re-armament]] acceptable to the population. On the other hand, they constituted real plans and visions of a specifically Nazi consumer’s society.&lt;ref name="WK"/&gt;

The failure of the grand scheme became evident, however, when the economic goal of massive people’s consumption revealed itself incompatible with the simultaneous political goals of [[autarky]], re-armament and [[Drang nach Osten|territorial expansion]].&lt;ref name="WK"/&gt;
By mid 1937 with the German re-armament in full gear, such small planes were labelled as 'weak-engined planes' (''schwachmotorige Flugzeuge'') and Nazi engineer Hermann Schäfer would write in Berlin that:
The name „Volksflugzeug“ is only acceptable for a plane that wide layers of a ''Volk'' can afford to buy and upkeep. However, in the foreseeable time one can neither count on a plane of that type nor on the creation of the necessary conditions for it, such as take-off, landing and maintenance infrastructures.&lt;ref name="LW-5/6"&gt;''Luftwelt'' Bd. 4 Nr. 5/6, May/June 1937. ''Schwachmotorige Flugzeuge'' p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and twilight of the concept==
The vision behind the Volksflugzeug project was to manufacture a small plane in large quantities that would be affordable for the average Third Reich citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fritzsche, ''A Nation of Fliers: German Aviation and the Popular Imagination.'' Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the designs of the Volksflugzeug airplane were developed into viable small aircraft, but not as part of the wider Nazi scheme, such as the [[Messerschmitt M 33]], a very little plane that would have been produced in a ‘build-it-yourself’ kit. [[Willy Messerschmitt]]'s idea was to  produce a plane so cheap that it would be affordable for anyone with an average salary. Designed during the pre-[[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of Germany]] years, the Messerschmitt M-33 never went past the project stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kartonbau.de/forum/messerschmitt-m-33-new-releases/board3-aviation/t9355-f75/ Messerschmitt M-33]&lt;/ref&gt;
Other craft, such as the [[Lehmann Falter]], another very little airplane roughly based on the [[Mignet Pou du Ciel]] ({{lang-de|Himmelslaus}}), were seeking to improve or develop existing designs of very small planes, but remained projects as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histaviation.com/Lehmann__Falter.html Lehmann Falter]&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineer [[Wolf Hirth]] had pursued the idea of building a Volksflugzeug when he finally built and patented the [[Hirth Hi-20 MoSe]] (Motorsegler) in 1937. It was the first [[motorglider]] with a non-rigid motor that could change angle.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;

The Technical Department of the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|Nazi Ministry of Aviation]], the ''Technisches Amt'' (LC, but more often referred to as the C-amt) in charge of all research and development, led by [[Ernst Udet]] after June 1936, withdrew its favor from smaller aircraft building companies. Industries such as [[Weser Flugzeugbau]] (former Rohrbach), [[Bücker]], [[AGO Flugzeugwerke|Ago]], [[Klemm]] and [[Fieseler]] were told that there were no further projects for them to develop because future projects could be handled by the remaining aircraft industrial groups.&lt;ref&gt;From a Luftwaffe Development Program briefing led by Major [[Werner Junck]] on 10 January 1937&lt;/ref&gt; Instead these small companies were advised to become involved in the production of a so-called Volksflugzeug powered by motors of {{convert|50|to|60|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The recommendation was taken not only by Klemm, with its [[Klemm Kl 105|Kl 105]], [[Siebel]] with the [[Siebel Si 202|Si 202 Hummel]] and Fieseler with the [[Fieseler Fi 253|Fi 253 Spatz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftarchiv.de/index.htm?/flugzeuge/fieseler/fi253.htm Luftarchiv - Fieseler]&lt;/ref&gt; but apparently as well by Bücker with its [[Bücker Bü 134|Bü 134 Student]], of which only one was built, even though the Bü 134 was powered by a [[Hirth HM 504|Hirth HM 504 A]] motor which with {{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} fell a bit beyond the scheme.&lt;ref name="Bücker"&gt;[http://www.buecker-museum.de/geschichte/home/home.htm Förderverein Bücker-Museum Rangsdorf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the further designs made by Bücker's Swedish engineer Anders J. Anderson, the [[Bücker Bü 180|Bü 180]] and the [[Bücker Bü 182|Bü 182 Kornett]], could have been the result of the Volksflugzeug proposal made by the LC II, the department of the ''Technisches Amt'' responsible for the development of new aircraft. The Bü 182 Kornett, the last plane designed by Anderson, of which only three were built, also found no support in the Air Ministry of the Reich, even though it combined technical progress and low-cost. The Bü 182 Kornett was a highly innovative model, fitted with a low-priced high-performance engine, that would have made a good trainer for the [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref name="Bücker"/&gt;

===Motors===
[[File:Zündapp Z 9-092 iim Technikmuseum Hugo Junkers Dessau 2010-08-06 Detail 01.jpg|thumb|The Zündapp 9-092, one of the light engines used in 'Volksflugzeug' planes]]
The 1930s saw the development of certain light-weight and low-power aviation engines that were intended for small craft and that made Volksflugzeug-type planes feasible both from the low cost as well as from a technical perspective.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;Kyrill von Gersdorff, Helmut Schubert, Stefan Ebert: ''Flugmotoren und Strahltriebwerke'', Bernard &amp; Graefe Verlag München, {{ISBN|978-3-7637-6128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Zündapp 9-090]], also known as Zündapp Z 90, was a small aeronautical piston engine built by the [[Zündapp]] company. Its successor, the [[Zündapp 9-092]], was a more powerful four-cylinder version developed in 1938. Both engines were designed by Ernst Schmidt.  Zündapp 9–092 production was terminated in 1940 when about 200 units had been built. Although planes fitted with these engines had broken several records in their class, precedence was given to the production of military plane engines in an industrial scale.&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;
*The [[DKW]] company, founded and led by Danish entrepreneur Jørgen Skafte Rasmussen also developed a small {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} aviation engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl-Dieter Seifert|title=DKW und die Erla-Me-Flugzeuge: 1926 bis 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVPf8Y9Fyc4C|year=2011|publisher=Sutton Verlag GmbH|isbn=978-3-86680-852-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for the DKW [[Erla Me 5]], a low-cost one-seat [[low wing]] Volksflugzeug. Conceived by engineer [[Franz Xaver Mehr]], a small number of Me 5 were built in series in 1933 before the production faced difficulties. In 1934, DKW chief Rasmussen was able to convince the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Saxony]], the [[Reichsstatthalter]] (representative of the Third Reich) in the region, to become interested in the project. As a result, the [[Erla Maschinenwerk G.m.b.H.]] company was founded in [[Leipzig]] and took over production and projects. Rasmussen, nevertheless, left after a few years, when industrial production was shifted to military aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saechsisches-industriemuseum.de/_html/infothek/presse/pressemitteilungen_archiv_2012_3.htm Industrial Museum of Saxonia]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Hirth HM 515]] was another low-cost piston engine for small aircraft built by the German aviation company Hirth. It was a little four-cylinder [[OHV]] piston engine first presented in 1938. After several tests, only a small number of units were built from 1940 onwards, owing to the lack of demand for small, less-powerful engines during the war years. It would have been used in  Volksflugzeug-type planes such as the Bücker Bü 180, Fieseler Fi 253 Spatz, [[Haller Ha 22]] and [[Haller Ha 23|Ha 23]], as well as the Klemm Kl 105, [[Pause Mücke]], Siebel Si 202 and [[Gotha Go 150]].&lt;ref name="GSE"/&gt;
*[[Köller]] was another company building small engines giving {{convert|18|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|18.5|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl/zbiory_sz.php?ido=135&amp;w=a Polish Aviation Museum - Aircraft engine: Köller ”Kröber M4”]&lt;/ref&gt; The little [[Gruse BO 15/1]] was a Volksflugzeug project equipped with a Köller M3 {{convert|18|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine driving a pusher propeller. It was a light single seater built by the [[August Gruse Maschinenfabrik]] in 1933. Following the scant interest displayed by Nazi authorities, only one prototype was built.&lt;ref&gt;''Luftwelt'' Bd. 4 Nr. 5/6, May/June 1937. ''Schwachmotorige Flugzeuge'' p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
