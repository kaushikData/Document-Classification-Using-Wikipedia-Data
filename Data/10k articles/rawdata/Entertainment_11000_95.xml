'''''ALF: The Animated Series''''' (also known as '''''ALF on Melmac''''') is a 30-minute [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning animated series]] and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] based on the live-action [[sitcom]] ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' that aired for 102 episodes {{Ambiguous|date=November 2018}} on [[NBC]] from September 22, 1986, to March 24, 1990. ''[[ALF Tales]]'' was a spin-off from the series that also ran on [[NBC]] on Saturdays from September, 1988 to December, 1989.

==Synopsis==
This show is a [[prequel]] to the live action sitcom ''ALF'', depicting ALF's life back on his home planet of Melmac, much resembling a 1950s/1960s small town. Since the name "ALF" was an acronym short for Alien Life Form and only given to Gordon Shumway later on Earth, "ALF" is never used in the animated series except for its title. ALF would always be referred to as "Gordon", his true name, or "Gordo" by his friends Rick and Skip. In nearly every episode a live action ALF would appear at the introduction and conclusion of the episode; reading fan mail and saying that this show is a response to a huge demand of people wanting to know what his life was like on Melmac.

Much of the humor arises from the characters taking part in surrealistic activities while treating them as ordinary and unremarkable. For example, in order to prove their manhood and win their distinguished [[antlers]], the sons of members of the Mayonnaise Lodge (formed of men who work in the [[mayonnaise]] mines) must wrestle a [[clam]] and make it sing. Other episodes had issues somewhat similar to Earth issues, such as when Gordon's parents take part in a free vacation, while failing to realize it is a [[time share]] scam: the scam artist literally steals the Shumway residence and transplants it to the time share plots, then uses [[brainwashing]] machines to convince Flo and Bob to buy a house they already own.

Another one which was a play on the original TV series was a TV show which ALF and his family loved about "the Earthling who crash landed on Melmac" where a human was shown saying "On my homeworld we keep cats as housepets" and a Melmacian telling him "Well, here we eat them!" Gordon/ALF from this series is one of the cartoon characters featured in ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''.

{{Nihongo|'''''Ace Combat: Joint Assault'''''}}, or '''''Ace Combat X²: Joint Assault''''' in Japan, is a 2010 [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Arcade game|arcade]], combat flight [[video game]] developed by [[Access Games]] and published by [[Namco Bandai Games]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. It is the second in the series released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] and the fourth for a portable platform. It is also the first game in the Ace Combat franchise to be set in the real world.&lt;ref name="Announcement"/&gt; The game was released on August 26, 2010 in Japan, on August 31, in North America, and in Europe on September 24.

==Gameplay==
The game features both a single-player mode as well as a multiplayer mode supporting ''ad hoc'' and Infrastructure mode. The game features a co-operative campaign which can be played with up to four players as well as a competitive multiplayer mode supporting up to eight players. Some missions in the campaign will make use of the Joint Assault Mission System, which breaks the players into teams and has them coordinate attacks where each effort can affect the other team's situation. A new feature of the game is the Enhanced Combat View mechanic, which removes the distanced fighting seen in almost every flight simulation game.

===Aircraft===
''Joint Assault'' features more than 40 licensed aircraft types,&lt;ref name="Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/106/1060003p1.html |title=Ace Combat: Joint Assault Announced |author=Chris Roper |date=January 11, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100115070123/http://psp.ign.com/articles/106/1060003p1.html| archivedate= 15 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; plus fictional aircraft from previous installments in the series, particularly ''[[Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception]]''. Propeller planes will also be available for the first time in the series, with players being able to unlock the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F-5 Hellcat]] and the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]]. Frequent use of each aircraft allows the player to unlock more weapons, tune-up parts, paint schemes, and new emblems. The game's official superfighter is the GAF-1 ''Varcolac''.

==Plot==

===Characters===
Players assume the role of a pilot freshly hired by a [[private military company]] called Martinez Security. The unnamed pilot is assigned to Antares Squadron under the command of Major Frederick Burford. Another squadron within the company, Rigel, has Milosz Sulejmani, Daniel Oruma, Faryd Gaviria, and Kiriakov. The game's antagonists are Col Nicolae Dumitrescu and international insurance businessman Andre Olivieri.

===Story===
The game is set sometime after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global financial crisis]]. Off [[Midway Island]], the player begins his first day on the job flying with Martinez Security in an exercise involving the [[United States Seventh Fleet|US 7th Fleet]] and the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]]. After a successful practice run, several unidentified bandits suddenly appear from the east and head due west. Burford breaks the news that the bandits, now known as the "Valahia," are attacking Tokyo and the 7th Fleet is seeking Martinez Security's help. The defense of Tokyo is a success, with the destruction of the Valahia's Orgoi flying fortress and heavy damage being dealt to a larger airborne fortress called the Spiridus. Antares Squadron also helps the SDF fend off Valahia attacks at the [[Boso Peninsula]] and over the [[Izu Islands]]. In the midst of the action, the Rigel Squadron defects to the Valahia and leave Tokyo upon considering a lucrative offer by leader Col Nicolae Dumitrescu.

Embarrassed by the defection, Martinez Security joins the International Union Peacekeeping Force (IUPF) in stopping all Valahia activity around the world, starting with operations in the [[Middle East]] and the [[Balkans]]. During missions over [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]], the player fends off an attack from Rigel Squadron, now calling themselves the Varcolac Squadron. The crackdown is given an added boost when the IUPF destroys the Spiridus over London. Dimitrescu later announces that the Valahia have captured several former Soviet ballistic missile [[Missile launch facility|silos]] in Central Asia. As the IUPF prepares to attack the silos, Antares Squadron is hired to pilot Andre Olivieri's personal [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-200B]] over Valahia-controlled territory.

As Antares Squadron destroys the silos and eliminates the Valahia threat, the player discovers that Olivieri used his insurance earnings to finance the Valahia and the IUPF's operations, preparing for an operation named Golden Axe, scheduled to take place over San Francisco. It is revealed that the attacks themselves are part of a plan for Olivieri to establish a monopoly over the global insurance market. He also orders the Valahia eliminated because they went rogue on him with plans to establish a new nation. Antares Squadron, which reorganizes at Midway after the silo attack, is also attacked by the Golden Axe forces in an attempt to prevent them from stopping the operation.

In a final series of missions over [[Nevada]] and the Bay Area, Antares engages the rest of the Golden Axe forces and the Varcolac Squadron. After eliminating the Varcolac team, the player is sent to destroy Olivieri's underground data center at his company's headquarters in downtown [[San Francisco]]. The data center is destroyed, and Olivieri is killed in the blast, ending any further schemes of the Golden Axe Plan to foment more conflict. 

In the aftermath of the Battle of San Francisco, Olivieri's plans are exposed to the public, and the Antares Squadron continues to defend the skies.

==Development==
The game was officially announced by [[Namco Bandai]] on January 12, 2010, however screenshots had been leaked a day before on [[IGN]].&lt;ref name="NB nnouncement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/106/1060301p1.html |title=Namco Bandai Games America Announces Ace Combat Joint Assault for the PSP |author=Namco Bandai |date=January 12, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=January 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100121165023/http://psp.ign.com/articles/106/1060301p1.html| archivedate= 21 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game officially went gold on August 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="JAGoneGold"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ace Combat Joint Assault Gone Gold for the PSP | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 13 August 2010 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/08/13/ace-combat-joint-assault-gone-gold-for-the-psp | accessdate = 10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception to the game has been mixed.

Gamesradar cited the PSP's control options as a letdown compared to console versions, but lauded the Joint Assault system as an idea worth seeing in future games, especially with ''Assault Horizon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/psp/ace-combat-joint-assault/review/ace-combat-joint-assault-review/a-2010083114543610065/g-20100112103642747082|title=Ace Combat: Joint Assault review|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-06-11|language=EN-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameFan reviewer Christopher Bowen said the campaign was tedious and the online cooperative system is better off on the console versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diehardgamefan.com/2010/09/08/review-ace-combat-joint-assault-sony-psp/|title=Review: Ace Combat: Joint Assault (Sony PSP) {{!}} Diehard GameFAN|website=diehardgamefan.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; G4tv.com gave the game a 4/5 score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/games/psp/63302/ace-combat-joint-assault/index/|title=G4TV|website=g4tv.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anno 2070''''' is a [[city-building game|city-building]] and [[Business simulation game|economic simulation game]], with [[real-time strategy]] elements. It is the 5th game of the [[Anno (series)|''Anno'' series]]. It was released on 17 November 2011, and was co-developed by the [[Germany|German]] studios [[Related Designs]] and [[Blue Byte]], and published by [[Ubisoft]]. ''Anno 2070'' requires [[Uplay]] to operate.

==Plot==
The scenario is set in the year 2070. [[Global warming]] has melted the [[Arctic ice cap]], which has raised the global [[sea level]] so that the coasts were flooded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/preview-anno-2070-209519.phtml|title=Preview: Anno 2070|publisher=ModernMethod|date=21 August 2011|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many old cities have vanished under the ocean, and much of what was once highland has been turned into chains of new islands. Responsibility for settling and exploiting these new frontiers is given to a select group of people, who captain mobile ocean-going bases known as Arks.

The game has three factions: The Eden Initiative (referred to as the "Ecos"), Global Trust (referred to as the "Tycoons"), and the S.A.A.T. (referred to as the "Techs"). Ecos are [[environmentalism|environmental]] and build [[sustainability|sustainable]] cities, but are inefficient and slow to expand. Tycoons are [[industry|industrious]] and expand quickly, but have problems with [[pollution]] and dwindling [[natural resources|resources]]. The Tech is a support faction available to the other two, and they are useful in researching the latest and most powerful technologies. The Techs are only available later in the game when 10,000 credits are donated to their cause.

==Gameplay==
In ''Anno 2070'', politics are no longer defined by countries, boundaries, religions, races, etc., but how humans choose to produce energy. All humankind rally under one global government where the three main factions of the game control the world's decisions. Players can also vote for a World President and vote in Senate Council. Participation will give different effects to all players, depending on who is president or what bill was passed, until the next cycle of voting begins. For example, voting for the Tycoons' CEO Skylar Banes will increase productivity of manufacturing buildings.

Players can also gain achievement and rewards from just playing the game. Players can customize their Ark to fit personal preference, which is only for aesthetics, as well as gaining special rewards that affect gameplay.

Resources and technology upgrades can be carried on Arks, and be used in another game in "Continuous Mode".

===Events===
The gameplay includes "World Events"; special missions offered only for a limited time, allowing all players to band together and complete the missions. Completing missions will reward players depending on how many people participate.

*'''First event: Neo Skullz Pirates''' - players answer the World Council's call to war against pirates who threaten humanity with nuclear missiles.
*'''Second event: Project Eden''' - players help the Eden Initiative activate "Former" technologies, which are high-performance air and water filtration systems, to fight pollution on islands.
*'''Third event: Global Distrust''' - players help the Global Trust to prevent a global recession by expanding trade and decrease taxes to attract more inhabitants.
*'''Fourth event: The Nordamark Conflict''' - players need to mediate a confrontation between Global Trust and Eden Initiative in a region called Nordamark with diplomats and a nuclear submarine, Orca.
*'''Fifth event: The Secret of the Ebashi Trench''' - players help the Tech faction to develop a geothermal power plant. This event is the prelude of the Deep Ocean expansion.

There are also "Current Events", where a player can complete a particular quest for one of the three factions to gain rewards. Current Events change daily, unlike World Events, which can be around for several months.

===Factions===
*'''Tycoon''' - Leader: Skylar Banes, CEO. This faction is representative of the Global Trust, Earth's number one leading energy supplier in 2070. Tycoons like to exploit resources quickly for immediate use, which leads to workers that are richer and can pay more taxes. The economy of a Tycoon player accelerates early in the game and declines gradually near the end, as their non-renewable resources run out (Tech's technologies can mitigate this setback however). In turn, Tycoons decrease the eco balance and affect the environment negatively. Tycoons rely on coal and nuclear plants for power, and their citizens enjoy hamburgers, wine and spending time at the Casino. Tycoon citizens do not worry about negative eco balance as much as their Eco counterparts, but they can't gain benefits from positive eco balance. To increase eco balance, Tycoons can build, for example, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reservoirs and waste compactors.
*'''Eco''' - Leader: Seamus Green, founder and spiritual leader. This faction is representative of the Eden Initiative, Earth's most influential environmental organization. Ecos rely on green technology to create their cities, which preserve nature and help the eco balance. Their cities are inefficient and slow to prosper, but Ecos' economy will be steady and reliable until the game's end. Ecos rely on wind and solar power, and their citizens enjoy drinking tea, eating health food and listening to orchestral music. Ecos are affected by negative eco balance more than Tycoons, but they can also benefit from a positive eco balance. To increase the eco balance, Ecos use ozone generators and weather changing stations, etc.
*'''Tech''' - Leader: F.A.T.H.E.R., super-intelligent AI. This faction is representative of the S.A.A.T. (Scientific Academy for Advanced Technologies), and are the supreme inventors of technology and masters of the underwater world. They designed the Ark and E.V.E. (the player's in-game advisor), as well as building plans for aircraft, submarines, and missiles. Tech is the only faction that can live and work underwater on submerged plateaus. Farming algae and mining diamonds are a few things they can do underwater. Tech can research hydroelectric dams for energy and utilize marine current power plants underwater. Their people are scientists and like to study in research buildings. To advance to a higher level, their citizens need algae processed food from underwater cities, and they like to drink energy drinks (made from coffee and sugar).

===Digital rights management===
The game contains Solidshield [[Tagès|Tages]] SAS 3 machine activation limit.

The 3 machine activation limit has caused some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guru3d.com/news/why-guru3d-probably-never-will-review-ubisoft-titles-anymore/ |title=DRM Criticism|publisher=Guru3D|date=14 January 2012|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing hardware can use up one activation. After the last activation is used, 1 is regained every 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2677124/|title=Steam Community :: Discussions|website=forums.steampowered.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
In October 2012, Ubisoft published an expansion to the game called ''Deep Ocean'', which adds a new civilization level for the tech faction and new resources and products to satisfy that faction's new needs. It also offers a new energy source, the geothermal power plant, which may cause a new natural disaster: a tsunami. Five new campaign missions introduce these new features. It also adds many new factors to the game, which completely changes the way the game is played, most notably when playing with the Tech Faction.

Players who don't have the Deep Ocean Expansion cannot play a multiplayer game with other players who do have the expansion unless the expansion is deactivated.

}}
Critical reception for ''Anno 2070'' has been positive since the game's release, with a majority of critics considering it a big step forward in the ''Anno'' series.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Criticism of the game is heavily influenced by the requirement to be always online to access all game options. Without being online the player can still access an offline mode, but one can't edit their own profile information, and the player is unable to update their Ark base, place cargo into it, or upgrade it with equipment. Early reception at time of release was also negatively influenced by constant crashes, server issues, and critics pointed out that the game worked better on pirated versions instead of the official one with Ubisoft server access.

An '''anthology series''' is a [[radio programming|radio]], [[television program|television]] or book series that presents a different story and a different set of characters in each [[episode]] or [[Season (television)#Seasons.2Fseries|season]]. These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some [[anthology]] series, such as ''[[Westinghouse Studio One|Studio One]]'', began on radio and then expanded to television.

==Etymology==
Medieval Greek anthologiā, collection of epigrams, from Greek, flower gathering, from anthologein, to gather flowers : antho-, antho- + logos, a gathering (from legein, to gather; see leg- in Indo-European roots).

==Radio==
Many popular [[old-time radio]] programs were anthology series. On some series, such as ''[[Inner Sanctum Mysteries]]'', the only constant was the host, who introduced and concluded each dramatic presentation. One of the earliest such programs was ''[[The Collier Hour]]'', broadcast on the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]] from 1927 to 1932. As radio's first major dramatic anthology, it adapted stories and serials from ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' in a calculated move to increase subscriptions and compete with ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Airing on the Wednesday prior to each week's distribution of the magazine, the program soon moved to Sundays in order to avoid spoilers with dramatizations of stories simultaneously appearing in the magazine.

Radio drama anthology series include:
* ''[[Academy Award Theater]]''
* ''[[Arch Oboler's Plays]]''
* ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''
* ''[[Cavalcade of America]]''
* ''[[CBS Radio Workshop]]''

==Television==
In the history of television, live anthology dramas were especially popular during the [[Golden Age of Television]] of the 1950s with series such as ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' and ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]]''.

[[Dick Powell]] came up with an idea for an anthology series, ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', with a rotation of established stars every week, four stars in all. The stars would own the studio and the program, as [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] had done successfully with [[Desilu]] studio. Powell had intended for the program to feature himself, [[Charles Boyer]], [[Joel McCrea]], and [[Rosalind Russell]]. When Russell and McCrea backed out, [[David Niven]] came on board as the third star. The fourth star was initially a guest star. [[CBS]] liked the idea, and ''Four Star Playhouse'' made its debut in fall of 1952. It ran on alternate weeks only during the first season, alternating with ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''. It was successful enough to be renewed and became a weekly program from the second season until the end of its run in 1956. [[Ida Lupino]] was brought on board as the de facto fourth star, though unlike Powell, Boyer, and Niven, she owned no stock in the company.

American [[television network]]s would sometimes run summer anthology series which consisted of unsold [[television pilot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/film.htm#starlight Ray Bradbury on Film and TV: ''Starlight Summer Theater'' (1954)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006074209/http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/film.htm#starlight |date=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1971, the long-run ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theatre]]'' drama anthology series brought British productions to American television.

In 2011, ''[[American Horror Story]]'' debuted a new type of anthology format in the U.S.  Each season, rather than each episode, is a standalone story.  Several actors have appeared in the various seasons, but playing different roles -- in an echo of the ''Four Star Playhouse'' format.

The success of ''American Horror Story'' has spawned other season-long anthologies such as ''[[American Crime Story]]'' and ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud]]''.

'''''Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park''''' is a 1984 action/platform game based on the [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] franchise. It is the first and only game in the ''Cabbage Patch Kids Adventures'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colecovisionzone.com/page/game/coleco/cabbage_patch_kids_adventures_in_the_park.html|title=Colecovision Zone Cabbage Patch Kids Adventure in the Park|work=colecovisionzone.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
MobyGames described the gameplay thus: "Your player is a Cabbage Patch kid with pigtails who is having a day at the park. A day that includes jumping onto vines and leaping over holes and bouncing onto correct platforms. A misplaced jump will lose a life and additionally there are a few creatures such as bees who end the player's turn when touched. There are several screens of challenge with different combinations of obstacles."&lt;ref name="mobygames.com"/&gt;

AtariProtos wrote "According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle ''Adventures in the Park'').  The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome.  Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires.  Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out.  Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win".&lt;ref name="atariprotos.com"/&gt;

==History==
In the wake of the video game crash of 1983, this game served as "Coleco's attempt to use one of their properties on the way up (Cabbage Patch Kids) to give a boost-through-association to one of their properties on the way down (the ColecoVision)".&lt;ref name="mobygames.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/cabbage-patch-kids-adventures-in-the-park|title=Cabbage Patch Kids Adventures in the Park for ColecoVision (1984) - MobyGames|work=MobyGames}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unreleased Atari 2600 was developed by Individeo. It "has now seen the light of day, thanks to a discovery by Alex Handy at a flea market in California" in 2008.&lt;ref name="atariage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=2767|title=AtariAge|work=atariage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer, Ed English, many years prior.&lt;ref name="atariprotos.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/cpk/cpk.htm|title=AtariProtos.com - All Your Protos Are Belong To Us!|work=atariprotos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
AtariAge wrote of the Atari 2600 version: "As luck would have it, ''Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park'' is an impressive game, comparable in quality to many modern homebrew games".&lt;ref name="atariage.com"/&gt; AtariProtos said "While it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of ''CPK'' is an amazing feat of programming.  Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.  It appears that ''CPK'' was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations."&lt;ref name="atariprotos.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">The '''Chronicle of Rivius''' is a German-language manuscript, often cited by [[Teodor Narbutt]] in his nine-volume work on the [[history of Lithuania]] and journal articles. Supposedly written between 1697 and 1730s by Jan Fryderyk Rivius, the chronicle remains unpublished. Lithuanian researcher Artūras Dubonis pointed out many inconsistencies in its authorship, unclear provenance, factual and chronological fallacies, and concluded that it is most likely a forgery, though more extensive study is required for a conclusive determination.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt;

==Provenance==
According to Narbutt, he accidentally purchased the manuscript in [[Tallinn|Reval]] in 1808. He first made references to the chronicle in articles published in 1817. Narbutt did not cite page numbers of the chronicle in his work, though the pages are numbered and he cited the page numbers of the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]]. Narbutt prepared a Polish translation of the most important parts of the chronicle and intended to publish it in a collection of primary sources on the history of Lithuania. However, the chronicle remains unpublished and is kept, along with the Narbutt's translation, at the Library of the [[Lithuanian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt; 

==Content==
The chronicle is written in German with some phrases in Latin and words in Latvian. Narbutt analyzed the chronicle and claimed that it used an earlier Russian chronicle, compiled by Mitrofan, a monk in [[Pinsk]]. This work by Mitrofan was used both by Rivius and by [[Augustinus Rotundus]] for his long-lost history. Thus, according to Narbutt, the Chronicle of Rivius preserved some unique fragments of Rotundus' work. Narbutt lamented that fragments of Rotundus work, including two genealogical tables, were lost when the last pages of the manuscript burned during a fire at his library in 1838. However, the surviving manuscript shows no fire damage.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt;

The chronicle contains many obviously wrong and incorrect facts. For example, it claims that in 1276 a woman gave birth to 346 babies or that Turks made an assault on [[Belgrade]] in 1717.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt; The chronicle also contains many unique, otherwise unknown, facts from the history of Lithuania. For example, Lithuanian and Samogitian golden coins from the 13th century, a Lithuanian pagan flag with a cock on the tip of the pole, an inscription on the king [[Mindaugas]] tombstone, a description of the [[Perkūnas]] shrine in the [[Šventaragis' Valley]] in [[Vilnius]].&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt; Some events are described differently in the chronicle than in Narbutt's works. For example, the chronicle records that Duke [[Mindaugas]], his wife, and {{illm|Andreas von Stirland|ru|Вельвен, Андреас фон}}, Master of the Livonian Order, traveled to Rome in 1254 to discuss Mindaugas' coronation with the pope, while Narbutt described the trip in 1262 when Mindaugas traveled to clear his conscience of the [[apostasy]] and desire to serve pagan gods. In his comments to the translation, Narbutt even debated which version is more correct (though both are proved wrong by the 13th-century [[Livonian Rhymed Chronicle]]).&lt;ref name=dubon2/&gt; 

==Author==
Narbutt referred to the chronicle as ''Kronika niemiecka J. F. R.'' (German Chronicle of J. F. R.) and revealed its author to be Jan Fryderyk Rivius (1673–1730/1735), grandson of Johann Rivius (1528–1596).&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt; However, in his work Rivius provided his grandfather's biography that supplied no new information in addition to what was known from the encyclopedias of [[Johann Friedrich von Recke]] and [[Karl Eduard von Napiersky]], published in 1831, and of {{illm|Friedrich Konrad Gadebusch|ru|Гадебуш, Фридрих Конрад}}, published in 1777. The biography also repeated some mistakes found int these encyclopedias.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt; Also, the 77-year gap between grandfather's death and grandson's birth is virtually impossible. The chronicle makes no mention of Rivius' father or his own life, other than he was born in [[Königsberg]] and in 1689 moved to [[Courland]], where he worked as a pastor after pastor Grott moved to [[Liepāja|Libau]]. The exact information about Grott was presented to Narbutt by Napiersky in a letter written in April 1833.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt;  Other researchers pointed out a Johannes Fridericus Ruvius from [[Cēsis|Wenden]] who became a student at the [[University of Dorpat]] in 1690, but Rivius was from Königsberg and it is unlikely that he "forgot" to mention his university education. Therefore, researcher Artūras Dubonis concluded that Rivius' biography was invented between 1833 and 1842.&lt;ref name=dubon/&gt;

'''Dogme 95''' was a filmmaking movement started in 1995 by the [[Denmark|Danish]] directors [[Lars von Trier]] and [[Thomas Vinterberg]], who created the "Dogme 95 Manifesto" and the "Vows of Chastity" ({{lang-da|kyskhedsløfter}}). These were rules to create filmmaking based on the traditional values of story, acting, and theme, and excluding the use of elaborate special effects or technology. It was an attempt to take back power for the director as artist, as opposed to the studio.&lt;ref name="TC"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and Culture, the Film Reader |last=Utterson |first=Andrew |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2005|publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=978-0-415-31985-0 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=EsVYBL8ytLMC&amp;pg=PA87 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later joined by fellow Danish directors [[Kristian Levring]] and [[Søren Kragh-Jacobsen]], forming the '''Dogme 95 Collective''' or the '''Dogme Brethren'''. ''Dogme'' ({{IPA-da|ˈdɒwmə|pron}}) is the Danish word for [[dogma]].&lt;!-- See Talk --&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dogme28.jpg|frameless|244px|right|Dogme certifikate for Susanne Bier's "Elsker dig for evigt" (Open Hearts, 2001), Dogme No. 28.]]
Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg wrote and co-signed the manifesto and its companion "vows". Vinterberg said that they wrote the pieces in 45 minutes.&lt;ref name="VCJDG"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Implementing of the 'Vow of Chastity' in Jan Dunn's "Gypo" |last=Krause |first=Stefanie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Verlag |location= |isbn=978-3-638-76811-5 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=phzgbBQcBmAC&amp;pg=PA5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto initially mimics the wording of [[François Truffaut]]'s 1954 essay "Une certaine tendance du cinéma français" in ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]''.

They announced the Dogme movement on March 13, 1995 in [[Paris]], at ''Le cinéma vers son deuxième siècle'' conference. The cinema world had gathered to celebrate the first century of motion pictures and contemplate the uncertain future of commercial cinema. Called upon to speak about the future of film, Lars von Trier showered a bemused audience with red pamphlets announcing "Dogme 95".

In response to criticism, von Trier and Vinterberg have both stated that they just wanted to establish a new extreme: "In a business of extremely high budgets, we figured we should balance the dynamic as much as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Movies|last=Sfectu|first=Nicolae|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the Dogme films (Dogme #1) was Vinterberg's 1998 film ''[[Festen]]'' (''The Celebration''). It was critically acclaimed and won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that year. Lars von Trier's Dogme film, ''[[Idioterne]]'' (''The Idiots''), also premiered at Cannes that year but was less successful. Since the two films were released, other directors have made films based on ''Dogme'' principles. French-American actor and director [[Jean-Marc Barr]] was the first non-Dane to direct a Dogme film: ''Lovers'' (1999) (Dogme #5). American director [[Harmony Korine]]'s film ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'' (Dogme #6) is also considered a Dogme film.  In total, thirty-five films made between 1998 and 2005 are considered to be part of the movement.

The end credits of ''Het Zuiden'' (''South'') (2004), directed by [[Martin Koolhoven]], included thanks to "Dogme 95". Koolhoven originally planned to shoot it as a Dogme film, and it was co-produced by von Trier's [[Zentropa]]. Finally, the director decided he did not want to be so severely constrained as by Dogme principles.

Since the late 2000s, the emergence of video technology in DSLR photography cameras, such as the [[Canon EOS 550D]], has resulted in a tremendous surge of both feature and short films shot with most, if not all, of the rules pertaining to the Dogme 95 manifesto. However, because of advancements in technology and quality, the aesthetic of these productions typically appears drastically different from that of the Dogme films shot on Tape or DVD-R Camcorders. Largely erasing the primitive and problematic features of past technologies, newer technologies have helped Dogme 95 filmmakers achieve an aesthetic of higher resolution, as well as of lower contrast, film grain, and saturation.

==Goals and rules==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:King is alive.jpg|right|thumb|250px|An example of natural lighting found in a Dogme film.]] --&gt;
The goal of the Dogme collective is to purify filmmaking by refusing expensive and spectacular special effects, post-production modifications and other technical [[gimmicks]]. The filmmakers concentrate on the story and the actors' performances. They believe this approach may better engage the audience, as they are not alienated or distracted by overproduction. To this end, Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg produced ten rules to which any Dogme film must conform. These rules, referred to as the "Vow of Chastity," are as follows:&lt;ref name="TC"/&gt;

# Shooting must be done on location. [[Theatrical property|Props]] and sets must not be brought in (if a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found).
# The sound must never be produced apart from the images or ''vice versa''. (Music must not be used unless [[diegesis#Film sound and music|it occurs where the scene is being shot]].)
# The camera must be hand-held. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted.
# The film must be in colour. Special lighting is not acceptable. (If there is too little light for exposure the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).
# Optical work and filters are forbidden.
# The film must not contain superficial action. (Murders, weapons, etc. must not occur.)
# Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. (That is to say that the film takes place here and now.)
# [[Genre movie]]s are not acceptable.
# The film format must be [[35 mm film#Academy format|Academy 35 mm]].
# The [[Film director|director]] must not be credited.

==Uses and abuses==
The above rules have been both circumvented and broken from the first Dogme film to be produced. For instance, Vinterberg "confessed" to having covered a window during the shooting of one scene in ''[[The Celebration]]'' (''Festen''). With this, he both brought a prop onto the set and used "special lighting." Von Trier used background music ([[Le Cygne (Saint-Saëns)|''Le Cygne'']] by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]) in the film ''[[The Idiots]]'' (''Idioterne''). Korine's ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'' features two scenes with [[non-diegetic]] music, several shot with non-handheld, hidden cameras and a non-diegetic prop. Von Trier, however, praised the film's transgressions on an interview released on the ''[[Epidemic (film)|Epidemic]]'' DVD.

Like the [[No Wave Cinema]] creative movement, Dogme 95 has been described as a defining period in [[low budget film]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|title=Low-budget movements that defined cinema|last=Coulter|first=Tomas|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002 and the 31st film, a filmmaker no longer needs to have his or her work verified by the original board to identify it as a Dogme 95 work. The founding "brothers" have begun working on new experimental projects and have been skeptical about the later common interpretation of the Manifesto as a brand or a genre. The movement broke up in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.dogme95.dk/news/interview/pressemeddelelse.htm Kristian Levring interview] (via [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 experimental film ''[[Hotel (2001 film)|Hotel]]'', directed by [[Mike Figgis]], makes several mentions of the Dogme 95 style of filmmaking, and has been described as a "Dogme film-within-a-film".&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{Citation |last=Brook |first=Tom |date=6 April 2002 |title=Figgis unlocks Hotel's secrets |publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1913197.stm |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203175656/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1913197.stm |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{Citation |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=26 Sep 2003 |title=Hotel |publisher=[[Roger Ebert]] |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hotel-2001 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220141640/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hotel-2001 |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of 'Dogme 95' style filming is in a list of a hostage taker's demands in the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' episode, "[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]".

Keyboard player and music producer [[Money Mark]] used principles inspired by Dogme 95 to record his [[Mark's Keyboard Repair]] album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/money-mark-constructing-creativity/|title=Interview with Money Mark - Ableton|author=|date=|website=www.ableton.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502210130/https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/money-mark-constructing-creativity/|archivedate=2 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edge sorting''' is a technique used in [[advantage gambling]] where a player determines whether a face-down [[playing card]] is likely to be low or high at [[List of table games|casino table games]] by observing, learning, and exploiting subtle unintentional differences on the backs of the cards being dealt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-edge-sorting-phil-ivey-sued-borgata-casino-allegedly-cheated-win-96-million-baccarat-1571442 |title=What Is Edge Sorting? Phil Ivey Sued By Borgata Casino, Allegedly Cheated To Win $9.6 Million In Baccarat |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |author=Thomas Barrabi |date=14 April 2014 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied by world-famous poker pro [[Phil Ivey]] and subsequently challenged in court by the casino in which he did so, the UK [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruled that the technique, which requires the player to trick the dealer into rotating specific, high-value cards, is cheating in civil law, and that a casino was justified in refusing payment of winnings. This ruling would not be applicable if the player simply took advantage of an observed error or anomaly in the deck for which he was not responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/10/26/what-is-edge-sorting-and-why-did-it-cost-a-poker-star-10-million-in-winnings/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.e559fdda2276 |title=What is ‘edge-sorting’ and why did it cost a poker star $10 million in winnings? |publisher=[[The Washington Post]] |author=Derek Hawkins |date=26 October 2017 |accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==

Many packs of cards produced by manufacturers have unintentional, almost indistinguishable edge irregularities. Typically the backs of every card in such a pack are identical, but the two long edges of each card are distinguishable from one another: the back pattern of one card is not symmetrical to another that has been rotated 180° (half a full turn).

During the course of a game, the player asks the dealer to rotate high-value face-up cards, saying for example that they feel it will bring them luck. The dealer, indulging superstition, does not realize he or she is unwittingly orienting the cards such that valuable high cards are oriented one way in the deck and low cards the other way round. The unintentional card edge irregularity thus makes the high or low value of face-down cards apparent to an observer aware of how the dealer has been tricked into orienting them. This orientation will remain so long as the cards are not "washed," shuffled in a way that rotates them. Thus, the player must also request that the dealer shuffle the cards with an [[Shuffling machine|automatic shuffler]], which does not change the orientation as a manual shuffle might. The dealer is not obliged to comply with any of these requests, but will usually do so if thought to be the result of gambler superstition or mistrust.

Over the course of a game being played this way, low cards will tend to be oriented one way, high cards the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2420796/I-read-cards-Im-cheat-U-S-poker-ace-suing-Britains-oldest-casino-denied-8million-win-admits-using-controversial-edge-sorting-technique.html |title='I read the cards but I'm no cheat': U.S. poker ace suing Britain's oldest casino after being denied £8million win admits using controversial 'edge sorting' technique |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |author=Ian Gallagher |date=14 September 2013 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a significant proportion of cards have been rotated, any player who knows this can gain a statistical edge more than outweighing [[house edge]] by using the knowledge whether the card to be turned is likely to be low or high.&lt;ref name=PAMAG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/04/14/borgata-poker-star-phil-ivey-cheated-edge-sorting/ |title=Borgata: Poker Star Phil Ivey Cheated Us Out of $10 Million Using Edge Sorting |publisher=Philly Mag |author=Victor Fiorillo  |date=14 April 2014 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
Casinos usually regard this technique as cheating; many players consider that they are legitimately playing to gain an advantage.

In 2012 poker player [[Phil Ivey]] and partner Cheung Yin Sun won [[US$]]9.6 million playing [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] at the [[Borgata]] casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/magazine/how-advantage-players-game-the-casinos.html|title=How 'Advantage Players' Game the Casinos|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Michael|last=Kaplan|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/13/us/casino-sues-poker-champ-phillip-ivey/ |title=Atlantic City casino claims poker champ Phillip Ivey cheated to win $9.6 million |publisher=[[CNN]] |author=Haley Draznin and Sho Wills |date=13 April 2014 |accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 the Borgata filed a lawsuit against Ivey and Cheung for their winnings.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; In 2016 a Federal Judge ruled that Ivey and Cheung Yin Sun must repay US$10 million to the Borgata. U.S. District Judge Noel Hillman ruled that they did not commit fraud, but did breach their contract with the casino. He found that they did not abide by a New Jersey Casino Controls Act provision that prohibited marking cards. Although they did not mark the cards, they used tiny imperfections in the cards to gain an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/atlantic/index.ssf/2016/12/poker_pro_phil_ivey_ordered_to_repay_10m_to_atlantic_city_casino.html|title=Poker pro Phil Ivey ordered to repay $10M to Atlantic City casino|newspaper=NJ.com|access-date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2012 he was reported to have won £7.7 million (approx. $11 million) playing [[Baccarat (card game)#Punto banco|punto banco]], a version of baccarat, at [[Crockfords (casino)|Crockfords casino]] in London. Crockfords refunded his £1 million stake and agreed to send him his winnings, but ultimately refused payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/09/phil-ivey-poker-champion-_n_1951012.html|title=Phil Ivey, Poker Champion, Denied $11.7 Million Payout From Punto Banco Card Game|date=9 October 2012|author=Ron Dicker|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivey sued them for payment, but lost in the UK [[High Court of Justice|High Court]]; it was judged that the edge sorting was "cheating for the purpose of civil law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-29543448|title=Top poker player Phil Ivey loses £7.7m court battle|date=8 October 2014|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; It was accepted that Ivey and others genuinely considered that edge sorting was not cheating, and deemed immaterial that the casino could easily have protected itself. Critically, the judgment pointed out that Ivey had gained an advantage by actively using a croupier as his innocent agent, rather than taking advantage of an error or anomaly on the casino's part. Ivey appealed against the judgement but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/03/poker-player-loses-appeal-against-london-casino-over-77m-edge-sorting-win|title=Poker player loses appeal against London casino over £7.7m winnings|first=Nadia|last=Khomami|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He further appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poker Pro Ivey Goes All In at U.K.'s Top Court Cheating Case|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/poker-pro-ivey-goes-all-in-at-supreme-court-over-cheating-case|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also decided in favour of the casino. All five justices upheld the decision of the court of appeal, "which dismissed his case on the basis that dishonesty was not a necessary element of 'cheating'."&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/25/poker-player-phil-ivey-loses-court-battle-over-77m-winnings-from-london-casino|title=Poker player loses court battle over £7.7m winnings from London casino|last=Grierson|first=Jamie|date=25 October 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=25 October 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Epistory - Typing Chronicles''''' is a 2016 [[action-adventure]], typing [[video game]] by Fishing Cactus. The game was released on [[Steam Early Access]] in September 2015 and was officially released on March 30, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/cure-writers-block-in-the-origami-world-of-epistory/|title=Cure writer’s block in the origami world of Epistory|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/epistory-puts-your-combat-typing-skills-to-the-t-e-s-t-1767957423|title=Epistory Puts Your Combat Typing Skills To The T-E-S-T|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/28/epistory-release-date/|title=Happy Ending! Epistory Riding Fox Out Of Early Access|work=Rock Paper Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, a young girl rides a fox with three tails. The game's story follows a writer's writing process, which unfolds like paper on-screen and is narrated from the perspective of the writer's internal thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-keyboard-is-your-mightiest-weapon-in-epistory-1734457740|title=The Keyboard Is Your Mightiest Weapon In Epistory|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Fishing Cactus Studio.jpg|thumb|The full ''Fishing Cactus'' staff]]
Part of the challenge in making Epistory was to "feel like a game and not just a typing application".  To that end, the developers emphasised player choice in gameplay design decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/04/03/epistory-it-all-starts-with-good-intentions/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Epistory: It all starts with (good) intentions|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was developed in [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-while-switching-to-unity/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Epistory: Lessons learned while switching to Unity|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the Tiled map editor.&lt;ref name=handmadevsrandomized&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/05/26/handmade-vs-randomized-level-design-in-epistory/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Epistory: Handmade vs randomized level design in Epistory|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Tiled made the ground tiles look artificial, so this was fixed using Shader Forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/10/12/breaking-the-cycle/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Breaking the cycle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFJI keys were used to move the character through the world to encourage good use of the home keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Epistory Retrospective - Looking back over the development of Epistory news|url=http://www.indiedb.com/games/epistory/news/once-upon-a-time|website=Indie DB|accessdate=14 October 2017|language=en|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The art design was influenced by another game project that Fishing Cactus was working on, with a World War I theme.  Because the frame story of Epistory is about a writer, it seemed like a natural choice to have a paper-themed world.  Later, the decision was made to take it into 3D and incorporate [[papercraft]] and [[origami]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/05/11/epistory-paper-on-art-direction/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Epistory: Paper on art direction|publisher=|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epistory used random methods to populate levels with trees, which were then manually checked and edited by the designers before being saved as the level.&lt;ref name=handmadevsrandomized/&gt;

Epistory was released on Steam Early Access on 30 September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/09/22/epistory-save-the-date/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Epistory: SAVE THE DATE!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mac and Linux editions of Epistory were released on Steam Early Access in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/10/31/trick-or-treat-epistory-halloween-update/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Trick or Treat!

These were used in later levels to give the impression of the world becoming deeper as the player explores it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2016/03/07/how-extra-budget-can-increase-your-visual-quality-and-put-you-into-troubles/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » How extra budget can increase your visual quality… and put you into troubles!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Epistory was available in English, French and German from the early access period, and Spanish was added later on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiedb.com/games/epistory/news/finding-the-right-words&lt;/ref&gt;  Mod support was added in June 2016,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiedb.com/games/epistory/news/major-update18&lt;/ref&gt; which allows players to change the words they typed in-game, add translations, and add support for different keyboard layouts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiedb.com/games/epistory/news/on-your-mods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File: Epistory03.jpg|thumb|Gameplay screenshot]]
The game was nominated for the Indie of the Year Awards at IndieDB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fishingcactus.com/index.php/2015/12/01/indie-of-the-year-2015/|title=Fishing Cactus development blog  » Blog Archive   » Indie of the Year 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Had an honorable mention in the 17th [[Independent Games Festival]]'s Excellence in Visual Art category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igf.com/2016winners.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The game received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/epistory---typing-chronicles|title=Epistory - Typing Chronicles|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple reviewers wrote in praise of its typing mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/31/epistory-typing-chronicles-review/|title=Epistory - Typing Chronicles Review - Rock, Paper, Shotgun|work=Rock Paper Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Vanderwall, writing for the Escapist, described Epistory as a meditative experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/binging-indie/16975-Epistory-Origami-Art-Typing-Indie#&amp;gid=gallery_6120&amp;pid=1|title=Epistory Origami Art Typing Indie - Binging Indie - The Escapist|date=March 31, 2016|work=The Escapist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game is a finalist for Best 3D Visuals at the Unity Awards 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiedb.com/games/epistory/news/unity-awards-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localization==
The game has been localized to 8 languages besides English: French, German, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese-Brazil, Russian, Czech (trans. Jan Balek) and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/398850/|title=Epistory: Typing Chronicles Steam Page|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The localized versions have been in some cases marked as significantly more difficult, because all forementioned languages use alphabets with more characters than English, e.g. Spanish (29 without accents),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_orthography|title=Spanish Orthography on Wikipedia|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} Russian (33 letters),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet|title=Russian Orthography on Wikipedia|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} Czech (41/42 letters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_orthography|title=Czech Orthography on Wikipedia|work=Kill Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} Despite the higher difficulty the localized game is still accessible to younger audience.

'''''Eulis Atjih''''' is a 1927 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia); it was the second feature film produced in the country, after ''[[Loetoeng Kasaroeng]]'' in 1926. The [[silent film]] follows the lives of a [[native Indonesian]] family sent into poverty by the husband's splurging. ''Eulis Atjih'' was a commercial success in the Indies, but failed in international markets.

==Premise==
A [[native Indonesian]] man leaves his beautiful young wife Eulis Atjih and their child to lead a life of partying. She falls into poverty and, when he returns several years later, he is also poor.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Eulis Atjih}}

==Production==
''Eulis Atjih'' was produced by Java Film Co., which had made the first film in the Dutch East Indies, ''[[Loetoeng Kasaroeng]]'', in 1926. The earlier film had left Java Film Coy in a poor financial after it underperformed; as such, for ''Eulis Atjih'' the company had to find financial backers.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=72}} The film was directed by [[G. Krugers]]{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=97}} and based on the novel by [[Joehana]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=76}} The film featured [[native Indonesian]] actors, including Arsad and Soekria. It was a black and white, silent film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Eulis Atjih}}

''Eulis Atjih'' was the second film to include native Indonesians in its cast, and the second feature film produced in the country.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=379}} The native role was emphasised in the film's promotion; a poster for a screening at the Orient Theatre in [[Surabaya]], for example, wrote that the film's native cast was equal to any American or European one.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=74}} Of note is the film's use of the word "Indonesia", which was not to be formalised as a preferred term for the archipelago until the [[Youth Pledge]] in 1928.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=72}}

==Themes==
The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that the film educated Dutchmen through its depiction of native Indonesian rites, including funerals and marriage, as well as sent a message to native audiences that splurging would only result in poverty.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=73}}

==Release and reception==
''Eulis Atjih'' was released in 1927, being screened in [[Bandung]] in August and in Surabaya in September.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=72}} It was a critical and commercial success in the country, especially among the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] community; the newspaper ''Pewarta Soerabaja'' wrote that the actress who played Eulis was "beautiful when her life was carefree, but looked like a villager when she fell poor."{{efn|Original: "''Pembawa peranan 'Eulis Atjih' terlihat tjanti' saat masih hidoep senang dan air moekanja beroebah seperti orang desa sesoedah djatoeh miskin.''"}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=73}} In Surabaya, the film was accompanied by music from the ''[[keroncong]]'' group under Tuan Kayoon.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=73}}

For international release, the Java Film Co. and Krugers emphasised the [[ethnographic]] aspects of the film. It was shown in Singapore, but was a commercial failure.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=76}}

A '''floating timeline''' (also known as a '''sliding timescale''') is a device used in [[fiction]], particularly in [[comics]] and [[animation]], to explain why characters [[Ageless|age little or not at all over a period of time]] — despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of [[retroactive continuity]]. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently.

==Overview==
For an example taken from television animation, in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', episode "[[I Married Marge]]", which was broadcast in 1991, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] are shown in flashback to have conceived their son [[Bart Simpsons|Bart]] in 1980, after watching ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in the cinema. In an episode that was broadcast in 2008, "[[That '90s Show]]", however, another flashback shows Homer and Marge in an earlier stage of their relationship, but sets those scenes in the mid- to late- 1990s. In both sets of present-day scenes, the characters are shown to be the same age—for example, Bart is still 10 years old in 1991 and 2008.

For comic book examples, any dates given within the comic are not relative to the publishing date of the comic (i.e. "10 years ago" means ten years before the reader read the story). This device enables publishing companies to continue to use their characters for as long as they wish without changing them significantly.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events, but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' and [[The Punisher (2001 series)|its subsequent continuation]], the title character is shown to be a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as [[Spider-Man]], who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962.{{fact|date=September 2015}} 

An example taken from novels is the case of mystery writer [[Rex Stout]], who created a floating timeline for master detective [[Nero Wolfe]] and other principal characters in the corpus, while the stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society. Nero Wolfe's age is 56. "Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years," Stout told his authorized biographer John McAleer. "Any reader who can't or won't do the same should skip them. I didn't age the characters because I didn't want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories."&lt;ref&gt;McAleer, John, ''Rex Stout: A Biography'' (1977, Little, Brown and Company; {{ISBN|0-316-55340-9}}), p. 383; and McAleer, John, ''Royal Decree'' (1983, Pontes Press, Ashton, Maryland), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the early novels, Wolfe dated himself somewhat by discussing his life before [[World War I]] and his combat service in that war, but in later stories he was less explicit about his past.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

{{Cleanup|reason=Many lists with bullet points. Section headings with references. Feels like article could use more sources for certain sections.|date=February 2018}}[[File:Commgames 2006 Mens Marathon.jpg|thumb|250px|Humans using a running gait. The runner in the back and on the far right are in the ''suspended phase,'' in which neither foot touches the ground.]]

'''Human gait''' refers to [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] achieved through the movement of human [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;“Gait.” ''Dictionary.com'', Dictionary.com, www.dictionary.com/browse/gait.&lt;/ref&gt; Human gait is defined as [[Bipedalism|bipedal]], [[Bipedal gait cycle|biphasic forward propulsion]] of center of gravity of the human body, in which there are alternate [[Sinuosity|sinuous]] movements of different segments of the body with least expenditure of energy. Different gait patterns are characterized by differences in limb-movement patterns, overall velocity, forces, kinetic and potential energy cycles, and changes in the contact with the surface ([[Soil|ground]], [[floor]], etc.). '''Human gaits''' are the various ways in which a human can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Minetti, A.E. "The biomechanics of skipping gaits: a third locomotion paradigm?". NIH.gov. Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. PMC 1689187 .&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Human gaits are classified in various ways. Every gait can be generally categorized as either natural (one that humans use instinctively) or trained (a non-instinctive gait learned via training). Examples of the latter include [[hand walking]] and specialized gaits used in martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tattersall|first=Timothy L|last2=Stratton|first2=Peter G|last3=Coyne|first3=Terry J|last4=Cook|first4=Raymond|last5=Silberstein|first5=Paul|last6=Silburn|first6=Peter A|last7=Windels|first7=François|last8=Sah|first8=Pankaj|date=March 2014|title=Imagined gait modulates neuronal network dynamics in the human pedunculopontine nucleus|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn.3642|journal=Nature Neuroscience|language=En|volume=17|issue=3|pages=449–454|doi=10.1038/nn.3642|issn=1546-1726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaits can also be categorized according to whether the person remains in continuous contact with the ground.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Foot strike ==
One variable in gait is ''foot strike'' – how the foot contacts the ground, specifically which part of the foot first contacts the ground.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chi|first=Kai-Jung|last2=Schmitt|first2=Daniel|title=Mechanical energy and effective foot mass during impact loading of walking and running|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021929004003392|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=38|issue=7|pages=1387–1395|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''forefoot strike'' – toe-heel: ball of foot lands first
* ''midfoot strike'' – heel and ball land simultaneously
* ''heel strike'' – heel-toe: heel of foot lands, then plantar flexes to ball

In sprinting, gait typically features a forefoot strike, but the heel does not contact the ground.

Some researchers classify foot strike by the initial center of pressure; this is mostly applicable to shod running (running while wearing shoes).&lt;sup&gt;[[Gait (human)#cite note-before-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In this classification:

* a rearfoot strike (heel strike) has the initial center of pressure in the rear third of the shoe (rear 1/3 of shoe length);
* a midfoot strike is in the middle third (middle 1/3 of shoe length);
* a forefoot strike is in the front third (front 1/3 of shoe length).

Foot strike varies to some degree between strides, and between individuals. It varies significantly and notably between walking and running, and between wearing shoes (shod) and not wearing shoes (barefoot).

Typically, barefoot walking features heel or midfoot strike, while [[barefoot running]] features midfoot or forefoot strike. Barefoot running rarely features heel strike because the impact can be painful, the human heel pad not absorbing much of the force of impact. By contrast, 75% of runners wearing modern [[running shoe]]s heel strike,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''Modern Running Shoes &amp; Heel Striking'', Daniel Lieberman, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; running shoes being characterized by a padded sole, stiff soles and arch support, and sloping down from a more padded heel to a less padded forefoot.

The cause of this change in gait in shoe running is unknown, but Liebermann noted that there is correlation between the foot-landing style and exposure to shoes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In some individuals, the gait pattern is largely unchanged – the leg position and foot position are identical in barefoot and shoe running – but the wedge shape of the padding moving the point of impact back from the forefoot to the midfoot.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other cases, it is conjectured that the padding of the heel softens the impact and resulting in runner modifying their gait to contact further back in the foot.

A 2012 study involving Harvard University runners found that those who "habitually rearfoot strike had approximately twice the rate of repetitive stress injuries than individuals who habitually forefoot strike".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This was the first study that investigated the link between foot strike and injury rates. However, earlier studies have shown that smaller collision forces were generated when running forefoot strike compared to rear-foot strike. This may protect the ankle joints and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries experienced by rear-foot strikers.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Kathryn. "Human's heel first gait is efficient for walking". ''Journal of Experimental Biology''. Retrieved 4 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 article called "Foot Strike Pattern in Children During Shod-Unshod Running," there was a study done where over 700 children were observed from the ages of 6-16 to see their foot strike patterns and neutral support.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bisi|first=M.C.|last2=Stagni|first2=R.|title=Evaluation of toddler different strategies during the first six-months of independent walking: A longitudinal study|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0966636214008017|journal=Gait &amp; Posture|volume=41|issue=2|pages=574–579|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2014.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also wanted to see what outside factors to shod and unshod conditions and sex. This study used multiple video recording devices to get their results. The results showed that most foot patterns such as foot rotation and the rearfoot strike were similar in boys and girls at the same ages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Control of gait by the nervous system ==
The CNS regulates gait in a highly-ordered fashion. The signals fire in a rhythmic fashion that matches the movement seen in behavior.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takakusaki|first=Kaoru|date=2017-01-18|title=Functional Neuroanatomy for Posture and Gait Control|url=http://e-jmd.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.14802/jmd.16062|journal=Journal of Movement Disorders|language=English|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.14802/jmd.16062|issn=2005-940X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rhythmic firing is the result of [[Central pattern generator|Central Pattern Generators]] (CPG) that are present throughout the tracts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Regardless of if a motion is voluntary or not, these processes occur. Therefore, CPG’s are mostly autonomous to cognition.

Gait in humans is difficult to study due to ethical concerns. Therefore, the majority of what is known about gait in humans comes from fMRI data in different walking conditions. These studies have provided the field with several important discoveries.

There are numerous centers, both in the brain and in the spinal cord, that have been proposed to regulate gait. There are three centers that are specifically described to regulate locomotion:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

* MLR - Mesopontine Tegmentum Locomotor Region
* SLR - [[Spinal cord]] Locomotor Region
* CLR - [[Cerebellum|Cerebellar]] Locomotor Region

These centers are coordinated with the posture control systems in place in the cerebral hemisphere and the cerebellum.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunningham|first=C. B.|last2=Schilling|first2=N.|last3=Anders|first3=C.|last4=Carrier|first4=D. R.|date=2010-03-01|title=The influence of foot posture on the cost of transport in humans|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/5/790|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=213|issue=5|pages=790–797|doi=10.1242/jeb.038984|issn=0022-0949|pmid=20154195}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each behavioral movement, the sensory systems responsible for posture control respond.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These signals act on the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. Many of these pathways are currently under investigation, but some aspects of this control are fairly well understood.

=== Subsection: Regulation by the Cerebral Cortex&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C., Wai, Y., Kuo, B. et al. J Neural Transm (2008) 115: 1149. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-008-0058-z&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ===
From fMRI studies, two regions have been identified to hold particular importance in gait regulation. These are the supplementary motor area ([[Supplementary motor area|SMA]]) and the prefrontal cortex ([[Prefrontal cortex|PFC]].) When these regions are inhibited in bi-pedal monkeys, a close relative to humans, they experience irregular gait.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition, the firing rate of these regions has been shown to regulate speed of gait. This suggestion is the result of a study showing that elderly have less activity in these regions, and this firing rate correlates with a slower gait.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Harada, T., Miyai, I., Suzuki, M. et al. Exp Brain Res (2009) 193: 445. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-008-1643-y&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; How these regions are regulated has yet to be fully elucidated, however they serve as current areas of research for disorders associated with irregular gait, such as [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[Parkinson's disease|.]]

=== Subsection: Regulation by the Cerebellum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thach|first=W. Thomas|last2=Bastian|first2=Amy J.|date=2004|title=Role of the cerebellum in the control and adaptation of gait in health and disease|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=143|pages=353–366|issn=0079-6123|pmid=14653179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
The cerebellum plays a major role in [[motor coordination]]. Regulation of gait by the cerebellum is referred to as “[[Error correction model|error/correction]],” because the cerebellum responds to abnormalities in posture in order to coordinate proper movement. The cerebellum sends signals to the cerebral cortex and the brain stem in response to sensory signals received from the spinal cord. [[Efferent nerve fiber|Efferent]] signals from these regions go to the spinal cord where motor neurons are activated to regulate gait.

=== Subsection: Regulation by the Spinal Cord&lt;ref&gt;Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, et al., editors. Neuroscience. 2nd edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2001. Flexion Reflex Pathways. Available from: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11091/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ===
There are multiple pathways within the spinal cord which play a role in regulating gait:

* Stretch and [[Flexion reflex]]es - as one footstrike occurs, the spinal cord sends inhibitory signals to the other side so that one side is actively moving forward as the other side is preparing for movement.
* [[Reciprocal inhibition]] - one side of the leg is active as the other is relaxed. There is cross-talk between the two limbs.
* [[Auto-inhibition]] - when the muscle itself inhibits activity.

== Natural gaits ==
The so-called '''natural''' gaits, in increasing order of speed, are the [[Walking|walk]], [[Jogging|jog]], skip, [[Running|run]], and [[Sprint (running)|sprint]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ackermann|first=Marko|last2=van den Bogert|first2=Antonie J.|date=2012-04-30|title=Predictive simulation of gait at low gravity reveals skipping as the preferred locomotion strategy|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=45|issue=7|pages=1293–1298|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2012.01.029|issn=0021-9290|pmc=3327825|pmid=22365845}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some people, these five basic gaits occur naturally across almost all cultures. All '''natural''' gaits are designed to propel a person forward, but can also be adapted for lateral movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As natural gaits all have the same purpose, they are mostly distinguished by when the leg muscles are used during the gait cycle.

===Walk===
The walk is a gait which keeps at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The walk is performed with the following steps:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

1. Lift one leg off of the ground;

2. Using the leg in contact with the ground, push your body forward;

3. Swing your lifted leg forward until it is in front of your body;

4. Fall forward to allow your lifted leg to contact the ground;

5. Repeat steps 1–4 for the other leg;

6. Repeat steps 1–5 to continue walking.

===Skip===
Skipping is a gait children display when they are about four to five years old.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While a jog is similar to a horse's trot, the skip is closer to the bipedal equivalent of a horse's [[canter]].

In order to investigate the gait strategies likely to be favored at low gravity a series of predictive, computational simulations of gait are performed using a physiological model of the musculoskeletal system, without assuming any particular type of gait; a computationally efficient optimization strategy is utilized allowing for multiple simulations. The results reveal skipping as more efficient and less fatiguing than walking or running and suggest the existence of a walk-skip rather than a walk-run transition at low gravity.

== Children gait pattern ==
Time and distance parameters of gait patterns are dependent on a child's age.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Different age leads to different step speed and timing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Arm swinging slows when the speed of walking is increased. Height of a child plays a significant role in stride distance and speed. The taller the child is the longer the stride will be and the further the step will be. Gait patterns are velocity and age dependent. For example, as age increased so did velocity. Meanwhile, as age increases, cadence (rate at which someone walks that is measured in steps per minute) of the gait pattern decreased. Physical attributes such as height, weight, and even head circumference can also play a role in gait patterns in children. Environmental and emotional status also play a role in with speed, velocity, and gait patterns that a child uses. Besides, children of different genders will have different rates of gait development. Significant developmental changes in gait parameters such as stride time, swing time, and cadence occur in a child’s gait two months after the onset of independent walking, possibly due to an increase in postural control at this point of development.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

By the age of three, most children have mastered the basic principles of walking, consistent with that of adults. Age is not the only deciding factor in gait development. Gender differences have been seen in young children as early as three years old. Girls tend to have a more stable gait than boys between the ages of 3–6 years old.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another difference includes the plantar contact area. Girls showed a smaller contact area in plantar loading patterns than boys in children with healthy feet.

== Gender differences ==
There are [[Sex differences in humans|gender differences]] in human gait patterns: females tend to walk with smaller step width and more pelvic movement.&lt;sup&gt;[[Gait (human)#cite note-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; [[Gait analysis]] generally takes gender into consideration.&lt;sup&gt;[[Gait (human)#cite note-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Gender differences in human gait can be explored using a demonstration created by the Biomotion Laboratory at Queen's University, Kingston, Canada.&lt;sup&gt;[[Gait (human)#cite note-15|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Efficiency and evolutionary implications ==
Even though [[plantigrade locomotion]] usually distributes more weight toward the end of the limb than [[digitigrade locomotion]], which increases energy expenditure in most systems, studies have shown that the human heel-first gait conserves more energy over long distances than other gaits, which is consistent with the belief that humans are evolutionarily specialized for long-distance movement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

For the same distance, walking with a natural heel-first gait burns roughly 70% less energy than running.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Differences of this magnitude are unusual in mammals. Kathyrn Knight of the ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' summarizes the findings of one study: "Landing heel first also allows us to transfer more energy from one step to the next to improve our efficiency, while placing the foot flat on the ground reduces the forces around the ankle (generated by the ground pushing against us), which our muscles have to counteract."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to David Carrier of the University of Utah, who helped perform the study, "Given the great distances hunter-gatherers travel, it is not surprising that humans are economical walkers."&lt;sup&gt;[[Gait (human)#cite note-JEB-16|[16]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Abnormal gaits ==
Abnormal gait is a result of one or more of these tracts being disturbed. This can happen [[Neurodevelopment|developmentally]] or as the result of [[neurodegeneration]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The most prominent example of gait irregularities due to developmental problems comes from studies of children on the [[autism spectrum]]. They have decreased muscle coordination, thus resulting in abnormalities in gait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaber|first=M.|date=April 2017|title=[The cerebellum as a major player in motor disturbances related to Autistic Syndrome Disorders]|journal=L'Encephale|volume=43|issue=2|pages=170–175|doi=10.1016/j.encep.2016.03.018|issn=0013-7006|pmid=27616580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this is associated with decreased muscle tone, also known as [[hypotonia]], which is also common in ASD. The most prominent example of abnormal gait as a result of neurodegeneration is Parkinson’s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Although these are the best understood examples of abnormal gait, there are other phenomenons that are described in the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomann|first=K. H.|last2=Dul|first2=M. W.|date=1996|title=Abnormal gait in neurologic disease|journal=Optometry Clinics|volume=5|issue=3-4|pages=181–192|issn=1050-6918|pmid=8972513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Antalgic gait]]: [[limp]]ing caused by pain that appears or worsens when bearing weight on one limb, due to injury, disease, or other painful conditions
* Charlie Chaplin gait: occurs in [[tibia]]l torsion.
* Circumduction gait: occurs in [[hemiplegia]]
* Waddling gait: occurs in bilateral [[congenital hip dislocation]]
* High stepping gait: occurs in [[foot drop]]
* [[Scissor gait]]: occurs in [[cerebral palsy]]
* Stiff hip gait: occurs in [[ankylosis]] of the hip
* Trendelenburg gait: occurs in unstable hip due to congenital dislocation of hip, [[gluteus medius]] muscle weakness

Abnormal gait can also be a result of a stroke. However, by using treadmill therapy to activate the cerebellum, abnormalities in gait can be improved.

'''''GamesMaster''''' is a British television show, screened on [[Channel 4]] from 1992 to 1998, and was the first ever UK television show dedicated to [[Video game|computer and video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Langshaw, Mark| url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a175628/feature-gamesmaster-retrospective.html |title=Feature: 'GamesMaster' Retrospective - Gaming News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''GamesMaster'' began when Jane Hewland, formerly of [[LWT]], who had set up her own production company Hewland International, took an interest in her son's love of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/factual/computers.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514173117/http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/factual/computers.htm |archivedate=2008-05-14 |title=OFF THE TELLY: Factual/Stand by for a Data-Blast |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; She put together a pitch for a show that would translate the excitement of games playing into watchable television. It was [[Channel 4]] that became interested in the concept and green lit the production. However, because it had been pitched as a competitive event programme, the show was always under the jurisdiction of the "sports" department amongst shows such as ''[[Football Italia]]'', horse racing and [[Kabaddi]].

==Format and hosts==
Although it featured game reviews, most of the show was about challenges where game players would compete against one another for the title of "''GamesMaster'' Champion". Contestants who were successful at their challenges were rewarded with the coveted "''GamesMaster'' Golden Joystick" trophy. [[Dominik Diamond]] usually presented the show with [[Patrick Moore|Sir Patrick Moore]] appearing in pre-recorded inserts as the 'Games Master'. During these challenges, Dominik was joined by a host of commentators. These included Derrick Lynch, Kirk Ewing, [[Julian Rignall]], Rik Henderson, Dave Perry, Tim Boone and Neil West amongst others.

For the third series, [[Dexter Fletcher]] became the main presenter; this change was criticised by fans, who saw the new host as over-the-top, and too 'in-your-face'. To balance this, the production company dropped all other co-presenters and gave UK games champion [[Dave Perry]] a regular co-presenter slot on every show. Fletcher was better known at the time for having played an American character called "Spike" in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] drama series ''[[Press Gang]]''.

==Review segments==
From the very first episode, ''GamesMaster'' included reviews of forthcoming titles. In an attempt to give the show some authority and get the gaming press on their side, as well as eliminate the need for extra staff to review games, the reviews featured a host of magazines journalists from the publishing house [[EMAP]]. This meant the show could pool the collective opinions of magazines like ''[[Mean Machines]]'', ''[[C&amp;VG]]'' and ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''.

However, by series 5, it was decided that the reviews would be better presented by two of the show's co-commentators, namely Rik Henderson and [[Dave Perry]]. It brought a much-needed stability to the format{{Citation needed|reason=who says it was much-needed? i was happy with the original format.|date=December 2011}} and some interesting banter between the reviewers. Series 6 also featured Rik, who was now joined by Ed Lomas, while series 7, due to time constraints and Dave Perry having resigned from the show's cast (after complaining on-air about being "set up" during a ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' challenge), employed two of its own research staff to present the slot, including Richard Pitt.

==Relationship with the games industry==
Prior to ''GamesMaster'' appearing, games companies had very few TV shows on which to have their titles featured. UK broadcasters had shown sporadic interest in the scene, normally confining coverage to segments within Saturday morning children's programming. From time to time, news programmes would report on one of the very successful British games studios, but in contrast to programming involving films and music videos, there was no regular showcase for videogames.

''GamesMaster'' was first broadcast in 1992, during the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth (16-bit) console generation]] - after the launch of the [[Mega Drive]], but before the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]]. [[Sega]]'s success in the early 90s (with both the [[Master System]] and Mega Drive, as well as the huge hit game [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]) helped cause a video game console boom in 1991, bringing gaming into mainstream UK culture, which would only increase following the arrival of consoles with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] such as those found on the [[PlayStation]]. That ''GamesMaster'' regularly drew in audiences in the millions proved that there was a huge and so far untapped audience.

Despite competition with specialist gaming magazines, the show managed to secure several exclusives over the series, showing games that were months or even years away from being finished. Because ''GamesMaster'' was largely a challenge-based show, games studios could, for example, present a single level to be used for these competitive segments.  ''[[Blast Corps]]'' is one example of a game that was demonstrated long before it, or even the [[Nintendo 64]] that it played on, were released.

Occasionally, games studios made levels specifically for use on one of the challenges. [[Shiny Entertainment]] were one such studio when they put together a special level of ''[[Earthworm Jim (video game)|Earthworm Jim]]''. Though this worked out well for both game studio and the show, the experience was somewhat soured when this code ended up being leaked on the Internet. It is believed that the only way for this to have happened is that one of the staff on the show must have had links with online [[ROM image|ROM]] crackers. It led to a great deal of embarrassment and likely upset the trust that existed between the producer, [[Shiny Entertainment]] and their publisher, [[Virgin Interactive]].

==Gamesmaster Sponsorship== 
*''[[McDonald's]]'' (9 September 1993 – 10 January 1995)

==Series 2's cold opening==
For Series 2, the show began originally as in Series 1, except for it was "plagued" by numerous apparent "technical faults" (a ruse on the producer's part, the "Please do not adjust your set" warning that appeared is a hint to this), with the first challenge being an as yet un-shown ''[[Marble Madness]]'' challenge (the contestant's name and town are partly obscured over a technical fault, meaning this was also part of the joke). As the challenger was coming to the podium, the program "crashed", "rebooted" with the new series opener, and a ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' challenge, the cast acting like the short segment preceding the new challenge had not happened.

Every series following Series 2 had the original series' closing moments portrayed in the series itself as the previous "set" being deconstructed in some manner. In the final series, the set was literally dismantled and the studio closed down over Dominik's final words.

Each location the series was set in, a plot device occurred after Auntie Marisha blew up the newly pine-fitted kitchen at the end of series 2, causing the oilrig to be evacuated. Dominik Diamond was later revealed to be burnt to death while trying to escape, giving way to Dexter Fletcher to present series 3, when in reality Diamond left the show. Diamond would later return in series 4 onwards in Hell and then in Heaven for series 5, continuing on from his whereabouts after his death in series 2 (although the opening title sequence of the fifth series offers an alternative "death", with Diamond being run over by a bus and flat-lining while in hospital). He then fell from Heaven in the opening credits to series 6 continuing a bit of continuity there, but that was dropped for the series 7 titles where Diamond traveled to the island setting of series 7 during a dream sequence.

==Demise==
Prior to ''GamesMaster'' leaving UK television, there had been a crisis of confidence in games television over at rival channel ITV. Their children's department had commissioned another videogames show ''T.I.G.S.'' to accompany ''[[Bad Influence!]]''. Then, one series later, they pulled the plug on both shows, deciding that there was no demand for games coverage on their channel.

''GamesMaster'' was not affected and continued with success. In 1998, towards the end of production for the 7th series, the show was looking set to be re-commissioned; viewing figures were still strong, and the show was finding a new audience, benefiting from the emerging PlayStation culture with the success of [[Sony]]'s console bringing gaming into the mainstream. The production was also more oriented towards actual games players than the first few series, which had been decidedly light in feature content, and no longer poked fun at 'nerds' and 'geeks', as it was young adults and not children and teenagers who appeared on the show; indeed, they and the publicity-seeking celebrities were now the subject of jokes.

It is believed that Dominik Diamond, along with the show's producers, wanted to make a more adult programme that would air in a late night, more mainstream time slot. (Series 8 was going to be set on a pirate ship with buxom wenches as the Golden Joystick assistants.) There was also talk of a spin-off show being made that would seek to emulate the US talk shows of the time. Whether this would have meant a programme that focused far less on games is unknown. No confirmation exists that any pilots of this concept were ever made; Channel 4 did not see the potential of a gaming show for an older, adult audience.

However, changes in senior staff at Channel 4 were responsible for taking the show off the air. The new head of Channel 4 was [[Michael Jackson (TV executive)|Michael Jackson]] who had worked at LWT at the same time as Jane Hewland; the two never saw eye-to-eye. Alternatively, having been the head of [[BBC Two]], Jackson may have wanted less entertainment programming on Channel 4.

The first series of the show was repeated on [[Challenge (TV channel)|Challenge]] in 2003, but no further episodes have been shown. Challenge thought the show was "too dated" and "the games being played wouldn't stand up today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challenge.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?s=06b0491a864d4d346a5bc548cb0500f4&amp;threadid=9175|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928120153/http://www.challenge.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?s=06b0491a864d4d346a5bc548cb0500f4&amp;threadid=9175|archivedate=2007-09-28 |title=Challenge Forums - GamesMaster |publisher=Challenge.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting spin-offs==
Several gaming shows were commissioned by [[Sky 1|Sky One]] in 1993 from Hewland International (one of which was ''[[Games World]]''). Due to this close relationship with [[BSkyB]], Hewland International were even successful in convincing them to launch a whole new channel dedicated to gaming, computers, the internet and technology.  [[The Computer Channel]] launched in 1996 for only BSkyB subscribers, appearing for just two hours every night. Originally, the only gaming show was ''[[Game Over]]'', made by some of the same production team as ''Gamesmaster'' and ''[[Games World]]''. When The Computer Channel was relaunched as [[.tv (TV channel)|.tv]] in 1998, other shows began to start covering the gaming scene. These included ''Gear'', ''Roadtest'', ''ExMachina'' and also ''[[Games Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Games_Republic |title=Games Republic |publisher=UKGameshows |date= |accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter show was closest in style and tone to ''Gamesmaster'', featured a themed studio set, studio challenges and the irreverent presenters [[Trevor and Simon]]. Though the show did not include any features or VT content, as it was a question based game show based on video games, it was produced by ''Gamesmaster'' and ''[[When Games Attack]]'' Producer Johnny Ffinch. The series unfortunately came under fire from fans after several questions asked in the show had incorrect answers, infuriating several contestants over the series. (For example, poorly researched questions about the [[Dreamcast]]'s online capabilities, and characters from ''[[Tekken]]'').

Dominik Diamond returned to games television first as an interviewee in the 1999 documentary ''Games Wars'', in which he commented that boys getting turned on by [[Lara Croft]] was tragic and "desperately sad". He then returned to presenting in 2004 with a show on [[Bravo (British TV channel)|Bravo]], called ''[[When Games Attack]]''. This programme was largely feature-based and contained plenty of Dominik's trademark humour. Prior to its broadcast, Dominik featured in a sizable ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' interview, with his longtime producer Johnny Ffinch. Both of them were quite vocal in stating their contempt for other shows about video games that were doing a bad job.

Though it did also feature minor celebrity challenges (mainly football players and glamour models), there were never any head-to-head competitions. To date, [[Bravo (British TV channel)|Bravo]] has yet to show a second series. However, in November 2007, a repeat of the only series to date was aired.

In 1999, the BBC filmed two pilot episodes of a new TV show franchise dedicated to video games titled ''Bleeding Thumbs'' - with Gamesmaster's Rik Henderson as assistant producer and initial commentator. The series would have run between 1999 and 2000 alternating with the hugely successful "[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]", hoping to emulate the success ''GamesMaster'' achieved in the process. Two pilots were filmed and were hosted by [[Dermot O'Leary]] and [[Kate Thornton]], and then [[Terry Alderton]] accompanying Thornton, the [[commissioning editor]] decommissioned the show claiming that "People want to play games, not watch them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/35232/the-state-uk-videogames-tv |title=The state of UK videogames TV |publisher=Pocket-lint |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GamesMaster'' was also the first UK show to feature the sport of robot fighting in a news item, which at the time was on Local [[Public-access television]] in the US. Hewland International worked for several years to translate the sport into something for UK viewers. Though they never succeeded, another production company, [[Mentorn]], were able to get their show concept ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' picked up by [[BBC Two]].

==Magazine==
{{main|GamesMaster (magazine)}}
In 1993, [[Future Publishing]] began a tie-in magazine, also called '''''GamesMaster''''', which as of today is still published, (unlike the official website for the show which shut down a few weeks after the show ended) headed up by its [[editor-in-chief]] Robin Alway. In the May issue of 2010, Alway announced that Future Publishing were 'looking into' reintroducing the programme to British television, and promised that he would keep the readers of the magazine informed of any future details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= GamesMaster TV return being 'explored'  |work= [[Computer and Video Games]]|date=|url= http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=yunus-emre-institute-a-test-of-endurance-2010-08-10|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geewa''' is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] online and mobile games company based in Prague.&lt;ref name="Geewa Crunchbase profile"&gt;"[http://www.crunchbase.com/company/geewa Geewa Crunchbase profile]." Retrieved on May 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It powers a portal for mobile multiplayer online games, [http://geewa.com Geewa.com].&lt;ref name="Geewa Crunchbase profile"/&gt; The company develops and publishes casual competitive multiplayer games for mobile devices (phones, tablets) and browsers (such as [[Facebook Games|Facebook games]]). Geewa was awarded the Red Herring 100 Europe award in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mci.eu/czech-company-geewa-on-its-way-to-becoming-a-youtube-for-online-casual-games/ MCI Ventures]." Retrieved on May 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Geewa was founded in 2005 and shortly afterwards launched the games portal Geewa.com with six initial games. Historically, the business model was based on free-to-play principles and financed through advertisement. In 2006, Geewa closed a partnership with the biggest web portal in the Czech Republic ([[Seznam.cz]]) to jointly operate a gaming portal called Hry.cz. Geewa raised $2.2{{citation needed|date = February 2014}} million in Series A funding from Poland’s MCI Ventures in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.socialgamesobserver.com/geewa-europe-pool-live-tour-15310 Who is Who in Europe: Geewa]" Retrieved on May 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In the two following years, Geewa closed license partnerships with [[Bigpoint]], [[Alawar]] and [[Ganymede Entertainment|Ganymede]] for distribution of their games on Geewa portals in the Czech Republic. A full micro-transactions economy to enable virtual goods sales was implemented as well. In 2009 Geewa started to publish its games on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;"[https://techcrunch.com/2009/04/03/challenge-your-facebook-friends-to-a-geewa-game-via-chat/ TechCrunch 2009 article about Geewa]." Retrieved on May 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 published Pool Live Tour on Facebook. The title is still one of the most popular pool games on Facebook with millions of [[monthly active users]].

In 2012, Geewa published Pirates Poker on Facebook and acquired Cuketa, a Brno-based company behind the Age of Defenders game. At the end of 2012, major creditor of Geewa was MCI Management S.A. with €400 thousand loan bearing interest 8% p.a.&lt;ref name="g12"&gt;Financial statements of Geewa a.s. for calendar year 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Geewa released Pool Live Tour on mobile devices and the competitive word-forming game, On Words, on web.

In 2014, Geewa closed a funding round totaling 4.2M US$. Lead Investor of this financing round was Czech Republic-based KKCG Ventures with participation of existing investor, MCI Ventures. 2014 also sees a lot of progress in game development with the introduction of On Words and Munchie Mania on mobile devices and the release of Tile On, a competitive tile-based puzzle game. Work also begins on the successor to Pool Live Tour, with a focus on mobile first.

This year, Geewa expanded its game portfolio with the launch of Pool Live Tour 2 and Prima Kvizy, a joint venture between Geewa and Czech Television company, [[TV Prima|Prima]]. Pool Live Tour 2, built in Unity, is currently in soft launch in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Turkey, and Argentina, with more countries to follow.

==Business Model==

Geewa’s business model is currently based on 2 main revenue streams. The first one is user generated micro-transactions and virtual goods. The second one is advertising, primarily premium ad positions (i.e. pre-roll and post-roll).&lt;ref name="Geewa Crunchbase profile"/&gt;

The '''Ghost Hunt Weekends''' (GHW) is one of the largest paranormal [[Promoter (entertainment)|promotion]] event companies in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/news/read?GUID=23085627 |title=Ghost Hunt Weekends explores Rhodes Hall |publisher=CBS News |date=December 27, 2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily focused on hosting paranormal fan events ranging from celebrity ghost hunts, bigfoot hunts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2012/09/08/2328998/bigfoot-hunters-gather-in-morehead.html#storylink=misearch |first=Greg |last=Kocher |title=Bigfoot Hunters Return to Kentucky |publisher=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=September 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to overnight paranormal and [[ghost hunting]] events and producing events worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://ghosthuntweekends.com/ghw/contact.html&lt;/ref&gt; Based in the United States, the company's principal business operations consist of specialty paranormal events with television paranormal reality show cast members at locations featured on those shows.

==Popularity and growth==

In May 2011, Ghost Hunt Weekends was issued a trademark certificate from the State of Tennessee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tn.gov/sos/bus_svc/iets2/ietm/PgTrademarkDetail.jsp?hiddenSequence=31130&lt;/ref&gt; and the attempt to brand the Ghost Hunt Weekends name with paranormal events began.

The first Ghost Hunt Weekends event was held in 2011 in [[Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee]] at the Thomas House Hotel and featured Syfy Channel's [[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]] stars Amy Bruni and Steve Gonsalves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prlog.org/11526248-syfy-channels-ghost-hunters-to-join-fans-at-haunted-tennessee-hotel.html&lt;/ref&gt; The event was greeted with larger than expected success. An  announcement of more events followed, and the Ghost Hunt Weekends name and fan base grew with popularity with every event.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

With an [[internet radio]] deal in 2012 with the [[KGRA-db|Global Radio Alliance/KGRA]] and expansion into Europe, Ghost Hunt Weekends was gaining in popularity, along with greater coverage. {{As of|2012}} all Ghost Hunt Weekends events are covered by the Global Radio Alliance/KGRA by way of Live streaming video including [[night vision]] and [[thermal camera]]s, Live Radio Commentary and Interactive Chat Rooms, with Ghost Hunt Weekends being the only event company in the field to do so.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In September 2012, the Ghost Hunt Weekends announced another major exclusive sponsorship deal with GhostHuntIR,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ghosthuntir.com&lt;/ref&gt; providing Ghost Hunt Weekends with Thermal and Night Vision Cameras including [[FLIR]] available for rentals to fans at events.

'''Greece''' was represented by [[Takis Biniaris]] with the song "[[Miazoume]]", at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Eurovision Song Contest]], which took place on 4 May in [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].  The song was chosen internally by broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]]. [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] withdrew, having been drawn eighteenth in order of presentation. The reason behind the withdrawal, was that the Eurovision contest coincided with Holy Saturday. Their entry would have been "Wagon-lit" (βάγκον λι) performed by [[Polina Misailidou|Polina]].

== At Eurovision ==
Takis Biniaris was the nineteenth and last performer on the night of the contest, following [[Luxembourg]]. At the close of voting, "Miazoume" had received 15 points, placing Greece 16th of the 19. The Greek jury awarded its 12 points to [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esc-history.com/details.asp?key=545 ESC History - Greece 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HD share''' is a now defunct [[video sharing]] website where users could upload, view and share video clips.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.20min.ch/ro/news/romandie/story/29033059&lt;/ref&gt;

HD share was launched on 1 July 2008.&lt;ref name="HD"&gt;http://www.lenouvelliste.ch/fr/news/valais/un-youtube-puissance-huit_9-93526&lt;/ref&gt;
The site uses [[Flash Video]] to display content.

HD share was one of the first websites to exclusively host [[High-definition video|high definition videos]].

Sometime in 2011 HD share was shut down after it sales to United Social Networks LLC based in New York. The company used their technology to develop niche social networks.

== Technical Informations ==
HD share's video playback technology was based on [[Macromedia]]'s [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash Player]].  This technology allows the site to display videos with quality comparable to more established video playback technologies (such as [[Windows Media Player]], [[QuickTime]] and [[RealPlayer]]) that generally require the user to download and install a [[web browser]] [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] in order to view video.  Flash also requires a plug-in, but Adobe considers the Flash 7 plug-in to be present on about 90% of online computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html Adobe Flash Player Version Penetration] [[Adobe Systems]]&lt;/ref&gt; Users can view videos in windowed mode or full screen mode and it is possible to switch modes during playback without reloading it due to the full-screen function of [[Adobe Flash Player]] 9. The video can also be played back with third-party media players such as [[GOM Player]], [[gnash (software)|gnash]], [[VLC media player|VLC]] as well as some [[FFmpeg|ffmpeg]]-based video players.

Videos uploaded to HD share weren't limited in length and had a maximum size of 4 [[Gigabytes]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hdshare.tv/upload&lt;/ref&gt; The best format that HD share could display was 1280*720.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lokigroup.com/products&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Template:Compression Formats|Video formats]]''': [[Cinepak]], [[DV]], [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]], [[HuffYUV]], [[Indeo]], [[MJPEG]], [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4 Part 2]], [[RealVideo]], [[Sorenson codec|Sorenson]], [[Theora]], [[WMV]]

== History ==
HD share was created in the begin of 2008 as a project between 3 young students in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="HD" /&gt; The website was launched in test version the 1st July 2008, the website was then upgraded few times before a closure in 2010 due to an uncertain future. In 2011 the company was acquired by United Social Networks who is devoted for the development of the website worldwide and to open video sharing markets to small communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://hdshare.tv/view_page.php?pid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restart of operations ==
On September 29, 2010, HD share and USN announced the restart of the development operations and the soon reopening of the website. The aim of the company is to become the best video portal where users can share only quality videos (HD).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hdshare.tv/&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 2011 the new version is online but still in beta version waiting for the tests.

==Plot==
Austrian Klaus Schneider, who later comes to be known as [[Erik Jan Hanussen]] is wounded during World War I. While recovering in the care of Dr. Emil Bettelheim ([[Erland Josephson]]), the Doctor discovers that Schneider possesses empathic powers. After the war, with one friend as his manager and another as his lover, Schneider changes his name and goes to Berlin to perform in halls and theaters as a hypnotist and mind reader.

The '''history of dance''' is difficult to access because [[dance]] does not often leave behind clearly identifiable physical artifacts that last over millennia, such as [[stone tool]]s, hunting implements or [[cave paintings]]. It is not possible to identify with exact precision when dance became part of [[human culture]].

==Early dance==
Dance has been an important part of [[ceremony]], [[ritual]]s, [[celebration (party)|celebration]]s and [[entertainment]] since before the birth of the earliest human [[civilization]]s. [[Archaeology]] delivers traces of dance from [[prehistory|prehistoric times]] such as the 30,000-year-old [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]] paintings in [[India]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures from c. 3300 BC. Many [[contemporary dance]] forms can be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dances of the ancient period.

===Means of social communication and bonding===
Dance may have been used as a tool of social interaction that promoted cooperation essential for survival among early humans.  Studies found that today's best dancers share two specific genes associated with a predisposition for being good social communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/619-survival-dance-humans-waltzed-ice-age.html |title=Survival Dance: How Humans Waltzed Through the Ice Age|author= Heather Whipps |date= March 10, 2006 |work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As folk celebrations===
Many dances of the early periods were performed to celebrate festivals, on important or seasonal occasions such as crop harvest, or births and weddings. Such dances are found all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nuWBch2jTqAC&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Musical Heritage of India |date= 2007 |author= Manorma Sharma |isbn=978-8131300466|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In ceremonies and rituals===
{{main article|Ceremonial dance}}
Dance may be performed in religious or shamanic rituals, for example in [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rain dance]] performed in times of drought. Shamans dancing for rain is mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. Dance is an important aspect of some religious rites in ancient Egypt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://panhistoria.com/www/AncientEgyptianVirtualTemple/music.html |title=Music &amp; Dance |work=Pan Historia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  similarly dance is also integral to many ceremonies and rites among African people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0hoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q=festival&amp;f=false |page=132 |title= Discovering Dance |last= Kassing |first= Gayle|publisher= Human Kinetics Publishers |date=15 August 2014|isbn= 978-1450468862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals, for example the [[Rasa lila|Rasa ritual dances]] of India (a number of [[Indian classical dance]]s may have their origin in ritual dances), and the [[Cham dance]]s of Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=History of Indian Theatre, Volume 2 |author= Manohar Laxman Varadpande |pages=36–40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a method of healing===
Another early use of dance may have been as a precursor to ecstatic [[altered state of consciousness|trance states]] in healing rituals. Dance is used for this purpose by many cultures from the Brazilian [[rainforest]] to the [[Kalahari Desert]].&lt;ref name='guenther'&gt;Guenther, Mathias Georg. 'The San Trance Dance: Ritual and Revitalization Among the Farm Bushmen of the Ghanzi District, Republic of Botswana.' Journal, South West Africa Scientific Society, v30, 1975-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval European ''[[danse macabre|danses macabres]]'' were thought to have protected participants from disease; however; the hysteria and duration of these dances sometimes led to death due to exhaustion.&lt;ref name=Laurson/&gt;

According to a Sinhalese legend, [[Kandyan dance]]s originated 2500&amp;nbsp;years ago, from a magic dance ritual that broke the spell on a bewitched king to cure the king of a mysterious illness.

===As a method of expression===
One of the earliest structured uses of dances may have been in the performance and in the telling of myths. It was also sometimes used to show feelings for one of the opposite gender. It is also linked to the origin of "love making." Before the production of written languages, dance was one of the methods of passing these stories down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="lecomte"&gt;Nathalie Comte. "Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World". Ed. Jonathan Dewald. Vol. 2. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2004. p94-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In European culture, one of the earliest records of dancing is by [[Homer]], whose ''[[Iliad]]'' describes [[chorea (dance)|chorea]] (χορεία ''khoreia''). The early [[Greece|Greek]]s made the art of dancing into a system, expressive of all the different passions.  For example, the dance of the [[Furies]], so represented, would create complete terror among those who witnessed them.  The Greek philosopher, [[Aristotle]], ranked dancing with [[poetry]], and said that certain dancers, with rhythm applied to gesture, could express manners, passions, and actions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The most eminent Greek sculptors studied the [[attitude (art)|attitude]] of the dancers for their art of imitating the passion.

===Indian classical dance===
{{Main|Dance in India|Dances of Sri Lanka}}
An early manuscript describing dance is the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' on which is based the modern interpretation of [[classical Indian dance]] (e.g. [[Bharathanatyam]]).

During the reign of the last [[Mughals]] and [[Nawab]]s of [[Oudh]] dance fell down to the status of '[[nautch]]', an unethical sensuous thing of courtesans.

Later, linking dance with immoral trafficking and prostitution, British rule prohibited public performance of dance. Many disapproved it. In 1947, India won her freedom and for dance an ambience where it could regain its past glory. Classical forms and regional distinctions were re-discovered, ethnic specialties were honored and by synthesizing them with the individual talents of the masters in the line and fresh innovations emerged dance with a new face but with classicism of the past.

In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] chronicle ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' states that when [[King Vijaya]] landed in Sri Lanka in 543 BCE he heard sounds of music and dancing from a wedding ceremony. The origins of the [[dances of Sri Lanka]] are dated back to the aboriginal tribes, and to the mythological times of [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] yingyang twins and "[[yakkas]]" (devils).  The classical dances of Sri Lanka (Kandyan dances) feature a highly developed system of tala (rhythm), provided by cymbals called thalampataa.

===China===

[[File:Gu Hongzhong 16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Details from a copy of a 10th-century painting ''Night Revels of Han Xizai'' by [[Gu Hongzhong]], depicting a dancer performing a dance known in the Tang dynasty.]]

There is a long recorded history of Chinese dances.  Some of the dances mentioned in ancient texts, such as dancing with sleeve movements are still performed today. Some of the early dances were associated with shamanic rituals. [[Folk dance]]s of the early period were also developed into court dances. The important dances of the ancient period were the ceremonial ''[[yayue]]'' dated to the [[Zhou dynasty]] of the first millennium BC. The art of dance in China reached its peak during the [[Tang dynasty]], a period when dances from many parts of the world also performed at the imperial court. However, [[Chinese opera]] became popular during the Song and Yuan dynasty, and many dances were merged into Chinese opera.&lt;ref name="wang"/&gt; The art of dance also declined from the [[Song dynasty]] onward as a result of the increasing popularity of [[footbinding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

===15th–19th centuries: from court dancing to Romanticism{{anchor|18th_and_19th_centuries:_from_court_dancing_to_Romanticism}}===
The origins of ballet dancing can be traced to the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century. Dance masters would teach the steps to nobility and the court would participate in performances as a form of social entertainment. This practice continued for several centuries. In the 17th century, courtly ballet reached its peak under the rule of King [[Louis XIV]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbt.org/learn-and-engage/resources-audience-members/ballet-101/brief-history-ballet/|title=A Brief History of Ballet - Illustrated by Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre|work=Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 18th century, [[ballet]] had migrated from the French and Italian royal courts to the [[Paris Opéra]] under the careful direction of composer/dancer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. Lully sought to develop ballet into a more serious art. Under his influence, ballet was turned into a recognized art that was performed by professional dancers rather than courtiers. 

During the 18th century, ballet transitioned from a courtly dance of moving images as spectacle to a performance art in its own right. Ballet performances developed around a central narrative and contained expressive movement that revealed the relationships between characters. This dramatic style of ballet became known as the ballet d' action. The ballet d' action strove to express, for the first time, human emotions drawn directly from the dancers themselves. Masks previously worn by performers were removed so that emotional content could be derived from facial expressions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Costumes during this time were very restricting for dancers. Although a more expressive use of the body was encouraged, dancers' movements were still restricted due to heavy materials and corseted dresses. Costumes often covered a dancer's physique and made it difficult to see complex or intricate choreography. It was not until choreographer [[Jean Georges Noverre]] called for dance reforms in 1760 with his ''Letters on Dancing and Ballets'' that costumes became more conducive. Noverre urged that costumes be crafted using lightweight fabrics that move fluidly with the body, complimenting a dancer's figure. In addition, dancers wore soft slippers that fit snuggly along the foot. This shoe design instilled confidence within the ballerina, daring her to dance on her toes. Naturalistic costuming allowed dancers to push the boundaries of movement, eventually rising [[Pointe technique|en pointe]].

The era of [[Romanticism]] produced ballets inspired by fantasy, mystique, and the unfamiliar cultures of exotic places. Ballets that focused more on the emotions, the fantasy and the spiritual worlds, heralded the beginning of true pointe-work. Now, on her toes, the deified ballerina (embodied in this period by the legendary ballerina [[Marie Taglioni]]) seemed to magically skim the surface of the stage, an ethereal being never quite touching the ground. It was during this period that the ascending star of the ballerina quite eclipsed the presence of the poor male dancer, who was in many cases reduced to the status of a moving statue, present only in order to lift the ballerina. This sad state was really only redressed by the rise of the male ballet star [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], with the [[Ballets Russes]], in the early 20th century. Ballet as we know it had well and truly evolved by this time, with all the familiar conventions of costume, choreographic form, plot, pomp, and circumstance firmly fixed in place.

===Early 20th century: from ballet to contemporary dance===
Since the Ballets Russes began revolutionizing ballet in the early 20th century, there have been continued attempts to break the mold of classical ballet. Currently the artistic scope of ballet technique (and its accompanying music, jumper, and [[multimedia]]) is more all-encompassing than ever. The boundaries that classify a work of classical ballet are constantly being stretched, muddied and blurred until perhaps all that remains today are traces of technique idioms such as [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]].

It was during the explosion of new thinking and exploration in the early 20th century that dance artists began to appreciate the qualities of the individual, the necessities of ritual and religion, the primitive, the expressive and the emotional. In this atmosphere [[modern dance]] began an explosion of growth. There was suddenly a new freedom in what was considered acceptable, what was considered art, and what people wanted to create. All kinds of other things were suddenly valued as much as, or beyond, the costumes and tricks of the ballet.

Most of the early 20th century modern [[choreographer]]s and dancers saw ballet in the most negative light. [[Isadora Duncan]] thought it most ugly, nothing more than meaningless gymnastics. [[Martha Graham]] saw it as European and Imperialistic, having nothing to do with the modern American people. [[Merce Cunningham]], while using some of the foundations of the ballet technique in his teaching, approached choreography and performance from a totally radical standpoint compared to the traditional balletic format.

The 20th century was indeed a period of breaking away from everything that ballet stood for. It was a time of unprecedented creative growth, for dancers and choreographers. It was also a time of shock, surprise and broadening of minds for the public, in terms of their definitions of what dance was. It was a revolution in the truest sense.

===The late 20th and early 21st centuries===

[[File:Dance history 1.jpg|thumb|Diagram of 20th century American dance history]]
After the explosion of modern dance in the early 20th century, the 1960s saw the growth of [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernism veered towards simplicity, the beauty of small things, the beauty of untrained body, and unsophisticated movement. The famous "No" manifesto rejecting all costumes, stories and outer trappings in favour of raw and unpolished movement was perhaps the extreme of this wave of thinking. Unfortunately lack of costumes, stories and outer trappings do not make a good dance show, and it was not long before sets, décor and shock value re-entered the vocabulary of modern choreographers.

By  the 1980s dance had come full circle and modern dance (or, by this time, "[[contemporary dance]]") was clearly still a highly technical and political vehicle for many practitioners. Existing alongside classical ballet, the two art-forms were by now living peacefully next door to one another with little of the rivalry and antipathy of previous eras. In a cleverly designed comment on this ongoing rivalry the brilliant collaboration of Twyla Tharp (one of the 20th Century's cutting edge Dance avant-gardist/contemporary) and Ballet dance was ultimately achieved.  The present time sees us still in the very competitive artistic atmosphere where choreographers compete to produce the most shocking work, however, there are still glimpses of beauty to be had, and much incredible dancing in an age where dance technique has progressed further in expertise, strength and flexibility than ever before in history.

At the same time, [[mass culture]] experienced expansion of [[street dance]]. In 1973, famous group [[Jackson 5]] performed on television a dance called ''Robot'' (choreographed by [[postmodern]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/NAM/general/essays/jackson.htm Ntongela Masilela's essay.]&lt;/ref&gt; artist [[Michael Jackson]]) a dance form cultivated in Richmond, CA. This event and later [[Soul Train]] performances by black dancers (such as Don Cambell) ignited a street culture revolution, in a sense. Bboying in New York, Locking in L.A., Poping in Fresno, CA, Boogaloo in Oakland, CA, Robot in Richmond, CA, all had their own creative explosions happen around the late 60's - 70's. Each with their own histories, practices, innovators and foundations. 

For the emergence of 20th century modern dance see also: [[Mary Wigman]], [[Gret Palucca]], [[Harald Kreutzberg]], [[Yvonne Georgi]], and [[Isadora Duncan]].

[[Hip-hop dance]] started when Clive Campbell, aka [[Kool DJ Herc]] and the father of hip-hop, came to New York from Jamaica in 1967. Toting the seeds of reggae from his homeland, he is credited with being the first DJ to use two turntables and identical copies of the same record to create his jams. But it was his extension of the breaks in these songs—the musical section where the percussive beats were most aggressive—that allowed him to create and name a culture of break boys and break girls who laid it down when the breaks came up. Briefly termed [[b-boy]]s and b-girls, these dancers founded [[breakdancing]], which is now a cornerstone of hip-hop dance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">'''John H. Lee''' (1847 - September 7, 1890) was an American banjoist, composer and author of the late 19th century.

==Biography==
Lee worked as a treasurer at Madison Square Theatre in [[New York City]]. He also performed in a [[minstrel show]] known as "Adams and Lee" for a couple of years. In 1879, he joined the "[[J. H. Haverly]]'s Minstrels when they were about to go on a tour in [[England]]. While in [[England]], he met the banjoist William A. Huntley and soon in 1885, they began performing together as a duo. Their partnership lasted until June 24, 1887, when Lee returned to the states.

His health began to deteriorate and he became a patient at St. Vincent's Asylum in [[New York City|New York]] in September 1888. However he was transferred to [[National City, California]], in hope that the more congenial climate would help him to recover. He moved to [[San Diego, California]] where he started the "San Diego Banjo and Guitar Club." He died in 1890 in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].

'''''Keys to Ascension 2''''' is the fifth live and sixteenth studio album by the English [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. It was released as a [[double album]] in November 1997 by [[Castle Communications|Essential Records]] as the successor to the previous live/studio album ''[[Keys to Ascension]]''. After guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] returned to the band in 1995, the group relocated to [[San Luis Obispo, California]] and started to write new material. The reunion of this particular line-up was promoted with three concerts at the city's [[Fremont Theater]] in March 1996, the five's first live performance together since 1979. ''Keys to Ascension 2'' features the remaining half of the live set from the 1996 shows and two studio new tracks which marked a return to the group writing long-form songs.

''Keys to Ascension'' received mixed reviews from music critics. It reached No. 62 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 169 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States. A promotional North American tour was scheduled to start in June 1997, but it was cancelled after Wakeman had already been booked for other projects which led to his departure from the band. The studio material from the ''Keys to Ascension'' albums was compiled on ''[[Keystudio]]'' (2001), and both albums were reissued in their entirety in 1998 and 2010, the latter with the [[Keys to Ascension (video)|concert video]] as a bonus disc.

==Background==
In mid-1995, guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] and keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] returned to the group which had also comprised lead vocalist [[Jon Anderson]], bassist [[Chris Squire]], and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. The five assembled in [[San Luis Obispo]], California to rehearse and record new studio material which included concerts at the city's [[Fremont Theater]] from 4–6 March 1996, the first live performance of this particular line-up since 1979. The first half of their live set from the 1996 shows, plus two new studio tracks, were released as ''[[Keys to Ascension]]'' in October 1996 by [[Castle Communications|Essential Records]].

By the time ''Keys to Ascension'' was released, the label had expressed a wish for the group to put out roughly 45 minutes of new studio material with the remaining unreleased live tracks from the 1996 concerts as a second instalment of the ''Keys to Ascension'' series. The band agreed, and had a deadline to hand over the finished album by the end of November 1996 in exchange for a sum of money from the label that Christmas.&lt;ref name=squire1996&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfte.org/interviews/0165_Squire.html|title=NFTE: Interview with Chris Squire|publisher=Notes from the Edge|first=Mike|last=Tiano|date=1 October 1996|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SH1998/&gt; Wakeman was "heavily against" the album's title due to his excitement over the quality of the new songs that Yes had recorded which he thought deserved to be released as a separate album.&lt;ref name=RW1997&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfte.org/interviews/RW171.html|title=Conversation With Rick Wakeman (NFTE #171)|first=Mike|last=Tiano|date=March 1997|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Live tracks===
[[File:Fremont-theater.jpeg|thumb|right|The live tracks were recorded at the Fremont Theater in San Luis Obispo, California]]
Disc one contains the remaining unreleased live tracks from the three shows at the Fremont Theatre in March 1996. This includes material from ''[[Time and a Word]]'' (1970), ''[[The Yes Album]]'' (1971), ''[[Close to the Edge]]'' (1972), and ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name=1997linernotes/&gt;

===Studio tracks===
Disc two contains five studio tracks that were recorded in the course of a year from the fall of 1995.&lt;ref name=1997linernotes/&gt; After promoting ''Keys to Ascension'' the group finalised the arrangements mainly from ideas that Anderson, Squire, and White had already put down and recorded the songs in November 1996.&lt;ref name=squire1996/&gt; The band leased a building in San Luis Obispo that was once a bank and set up a recording studio inside that was later dubbed Yesworld Studio on the album's sleeve notes.&lt;ref name=brewer2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2015-09-28/former-manager-and-friend-jon-brewer-remembers-chris-squire|title=Former Manager And Friend Jon Brewer Remembers Chris Squire|first=Rob|last=Hughes|date=28 September 2015|publisher=Team Rock|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nftesquire1996&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfte.org/interviews/0165_Squire.html|title=NFTE: Interview with Chris Squire|publisher=Notes from the Edge|first=Mike|last=Tiano|date=1 October 1996|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with the band was Tom Fletcher, who was only available to oversee production of the live tracks as he commitments with [[Steve Lukather]]. This prompted Squire to suggest [[Billy Sherwood]], who had played additional guitars during Yes's 1994 tour, to complete production on the studio material and additional recording, engineering, and mixing.&lt;ref name=1997linernotes/&gt; This was the first time Wakeman had worked with Sherwood, and the keyboardist praised Sherwood's attitude and contributions to the album.&lt;ref name=RW1997/&gt; Wakeman was particularly pleased with the studio tracks on ''Keys to Ascension 2'', rating them "light years" ahead of the studio material on its predecessor. He reasoned this down to the sense of maturity in the songs and the greater amount of input from the band in terms of what they and other members played, something that had not been done for a long time.&lt;ref name=RW1997/&gt;

"Mind Drive" was originally a song that was rehearsed by the proposed supergroup [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] featuring Squire, White, and guitarist [[Jimmy Page]]. "Children of the Light" was originally written by [[Jon and Vangelis]] in 1986 as "Distant Thunder". A demo version was recorded by [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]] which was included as a hidden track on the 2011 reissue of ''[[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (album)|Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe]]'' (1989). The lyrics to the song was printed on the band's 1991 tour book. The original version of "Children of the Light" included a keyboard introduction written by Wakeman entitled "Lightning", but it was removed prior to the album's release. In 1998, Howe said that the introduction was taken off following the group's overall dissatisfaction with it, an opinion that the record company also shared.&lt;ref name=SH1998&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfte.org/interviews/SH196.html|title=Conversation With Steve Howe [NFTE #196]|first=Mike|last=Tiano|date=February 1998|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section was restored on the 2001 compilation album ''[[Keystudio]]'', which combined the studio tracks from both ''Keys to Ascension'' albums. The version of "Children of the Light" on the compilation, however, has a verse removed.

===Artwork===
As with its predecessor, ''Keys to Ascension 2'' features cover art by [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] on an outer sleeve that fits around the package.&lt;ref name=1997linernotes/&gt; On the sleeve, the image's predominant colour is magenta, but the booklet features the painting in its original blue colouration.

A '''line''' is a concept in western comic books which denotes a specific couple of publications by a publisher. Sometimes taking place in a separate continuity or more loose continuity (such as [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] by [[DC Comics]]) or exploring a kind of subject matter and or genre which the publisher does not want to involve in their main franchise or so called "universe".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbr.com/dc-comics-dark-matter-line-details/&lt;/ref&gt; Often lines which explore more "realistic" or "dark" subject matters are published under a companies sub [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s (such as [[Ultimate Marvel]] or [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] by [[Marvel Comics]]) to distinguish it from their main superhero lines. Sometimes a line can be published under an imprint but not always be part of a larger continuity within their imprint (such as [[The Punisher (MAX line)|''The Punisher'' MAX line]] which is not in continuity with most other Marvel Max titles). A line can consist of several different titles, ongoing series, limited series, one-shots, annuals, specials or trades and be by many different artists but are [[advertised]] and [[marketed]] as part of the line.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtolovecomics.com/2016/10/25/resurrxion/&lt;/ref&gt; So called crossover events are often followed by a line of tie-in comics to the event miniseries from other unrelated titles to connect them. 

[[Dark Horse Comics]] has several lines which focuses on their licensed film properties such as ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. The [[Aliens (Dark Horse Comics line)|''Aliens'' line]] consists only of limited series, one-shots and graphic novels due to the publishers wish to allow artistic freedom.

'''''Live Audio Wrestling''''' (also known as '''''The LAW''''') was a Canadian [[sports radio]] [[talk show]] hosted by "The Mouth" Dan Lovranski and Jason Agnew. The program primarily covered news and events surrounding [[professional wrestling]] (such as [[WWE]]) and [[mixed martial arts]]. First premiering in May 1997 as an internet radio show, ''The LAW'' later shifted to conventional radio on several stations in the Toronto area, and moved to [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]] in 2011, where it remained until its cancellation on October 30, 2017.

A new video podcast series, also called ''Live Audio Wrestling'', is set to air as part of [[Impact Wrestling]]'s [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] platform. Most of the shows making up the original ''Live Audio Wrestling'' have since migrated to a new website, known as "Post Wrestling".

==History==
[[File:Oldlaw.png|left|thumb|Original logo used until July 31, 2005]]

''Live Audio Wrestling'' started on May 23, 1997, as an internet radio show through ''Virtually Canadian''. The first guest of ''The LAW'' was [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]. The show aired online for a year and a half before moving to [[CJCL]], ''The Fan 590''{{emdash}}however, it was still only broadcast online, since the show was broadcast as replacement programming due to [[NBA]] policies prohibiting the station's online feed from airing [[Toronto Raptors]] games. In an effort to obtain studio time, the show would be taped early in the morning. Due to popular demand and viewer support, ''The LAW'' soon became part of ''The Fan'''s normal lineup, airing in the early afternoon on Saturdays.&lt;ref name="Layingdownthelaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laying down The LAW on radio |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingFeatures/thelaw.html|publisher=Canoe|access-date=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show later expanded to include a two-hour late-night program on Sunday nights from 1:00 to 3:00 a.m., later moved to Saturdays at 11:00 p.m. in late 1999, while the afternoon edition moved to 5:00 p.m.&lt;ref name="JeffMarekchat "&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeff Marek chat  |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingChats/jul18_marek.html|publisher=Canoe|access-date=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, [[Dave Meltzer]] of the ''[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' began a weekly segment during the program.&lt;ref name="15yrs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The LAW unbroken after 15 years |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2012/05/07/19728966.html|publisher=Canoe|access-date=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to CFYI===
''The LAW'' aired on The Fan 590 until September 2000 when it moved to rival station [[CFMJ|CFYI Talk 640]] as a companion to the station's recently acquired radio broadcasts of [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] games. The evening broadcast was moved from Saturdays to Sundays. In April 2001, the afternoon edition of ''The LAW'' was dropped during the station's re-launch under the Mojo Radio format, while ''The LAW'' remained on the station through 2006

In January 2005, [[Fight Network]] purchased a majority stake in ''The LAW'' and in February of that same year they announced that they had secured an agreement with [[The Canadian Press|Broadcast News]] for national distribution the program, via [[#Fight Network Radio|Fight Network Radio]].

====Fight Network Radio====
During the CFYI and CFRB era, ''The LAW'' was also [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] to several other radio stations in Canada through a network known as ''Fight Network Radio''. Former affiliates of the group (aside from its flagship Toronto stations) included:

* [[CKST]] - [[Vancouver]] 
* [[CFRN (AM)|CFRN]] - [[Edmonton]]
* [[CFGO]] - [[Ottawa]]
* [[CHMJ]]- [[Vancouver]]
* [[CJOB]] - [[Winnipeg]]

===Move to CFRB===
In July 2006, ''The LAW'' moved to [[CFRB]] and retained its 11pm time-slot. In the fall of 2006, Live Audio Wrestling announced that in the future, the show would begin to air a [[simulcast]] of the show on [[Fight Network]], however the announcement never came to fruition.

The show is ranked No. 1 in the demographic of male, on talk radio in the [[Toronto]] market, in its time slot. In April 2006, The Bureau of Broadcast Measurement released their spring ratings with The LAW ranking No. 1 among Males 25 - 49 on Sunday nights with an 18.7 share and also scoring a 17.8 share among Males 18 – 34.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

====Live Audio Xtra====
Starting in the winter of 2007, John Pollock began to host an extended, online edition of ''The LAW'' called ''Live Audio Xtra''. The segment is available to those who listen to the archived edition of the show on ''The LAW'' website, as an add-on to the original radio production. Shortly after its launch, Dan Lovranski began to co-host the segment, answering e-mail questions. Starting with the January 20th 2008 edition, ''Live Audio Xtra'' began to take call-in questions from listeners who were unable to get on the air during the radio portion of the program. This segment of the show was discontinued for a brief period of time, but returned to The LAW in 2011.

===Move to satellite radio, interim podcast===
''The LAW'' aired its final edition on CFRB on January 11, 2009, moving to the [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] channel [[Hardcore Sports Radio]] (later known as [[The Score Television Network|The Score]] Satellite Radio), maintaining its Sunday night timeslot, and still being produced from CFRB's studios. Despite no longer being aired on conventional radio, the program was still billed as being a part of ''Fight Network Radio''. After the closure of The Score Satellite Radio in August 2011, ''The LAW'' briefly became a podcast on the Fight Network website, using the same format as the radio versions (but without call-in segments).

===Move to CHUM===
On October 9, 2011, ''The LAW'' moved to [[CHUM (AM)|CHUM]]; while the program maintained its traditional 11:00 p.m. timeslot, it is preempted by ''[[NFL on Dial Global#Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' during the [[National Football League|NFL]] season.&lt;ref name="Timechange"&gt;{{cite web|title=LAW May 13 Update - Dick 'The Destroyer' Beyer on The LAW |url=http://fightnetwork.com/news/31409:law-may-13-update-dick-the-destroyer-beyer-on-the-law/|publisher=Fight Network|access-date=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The LAW'' began airing on CHUM's sister station [[CFTE]] in [[Vancouver]] on September 9, 2012. ''The LAW'' currently does not air on any other [[TSN Radio]] station.

===Cancellation===
On the morning of October 30, 2017, the LAW issued a statement:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = Effective immediately, Live Audio Wrestling (The LAW) is being placed on a short hiatus. The program will be relaunched with a new format in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!
 |author = Live Audio Wrestling

}}
This announcement came just fourteen hours after the October 29 edition of The LAW was made available for podcasting. Many fans were caught off guard as the hosts had signed off planning for a big show for the next week, including a returning John Pollock reviewing [[Bound for Glory (2017)|Impact Bound For Glory]] and [[UFC 217|UFC 217: Bisping vs. St-Pierre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightnetwork.com/law/oct-30-edition-of-the-law-feat-one-man-gang-dave-meltzer/|title=Oct. 30 Edition of The LAW feat. One Man Gang &amp; Dave Meltzer - Fight Network|website=FightNetwork.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on the Wrestling Observer / Figure Four Online website in Dave Meltzer's October 30 Daily Update that;

{{Quote box
 |quote  = Very sorry to report that Live Audio Wrestling has been canceled and John Pollock and Jason Agnew were let go by The Fight Network. It's sad that the Impact acquisition has devastated Anthem's television network, first losing [[Robin Black]] and now Pollock, who is the total real deal as a reporter. I've been doing that show every weekend for 19 years and have enjoyed it greatly. John, Jason and Dan Lovranski have been great to work with and I wish the best to all of them

On the October 31 edition of Wrestling Observer Radio Meltzer also stated "The amount of money that they're (Anthem) losing on Impact, has led to them doing cuts on the Fight Network" and "All the particulars (Presenters) that were on the show you know, are going to be gone." He went on to speculate that The LAW may be turned into a "Impact promotional show".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f4wonline.com/daily-updates/daily-update-raw-ratings-law-njpw-junior-tag-team-tournament-245381 Daily Update: Raw ratings, The LAW, NJPW junior tag team tournament By Dave Meltzer (Oct 30, 2017 4:09 pm)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-radio/wor-talent-update-cuts-raw-recap-survivor-series-teams-more-245451|title=WOR: Talent update, cuts, RAW recap, Survivor Series teams, more!|date=October 31, 2017|website=f4wonline.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the day after the shutdown of the LAW, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', under the temporary titles of ''John Pollock and Wai Ting Review Raw'' and ''John Pollock and Wai Ting Review SmackDown'', respectively. On their first episode as independent podcasters, both hosts (Pollock had been one of Fight Network's longest-tenured employees, and, at the time of their release, one of the few remaining full-time journalists) discussed the news of being released from Fight Network (also stating that Dan "The Mouth" Lovranski and Jason Agnew were released), thanking their fans for all the support they received, their plans for their "future endeavours", alongside the review of ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/OCT31RAWREVIEW|title=Oct. 31 John Pollock &amp; Wai Ting Review Raw|first=|last=John Pollock &amp; Wai Ting|date=October 31, 2017|publisher=|access-date=November 2, 2017|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Impact Wrestling announced that a new show with the ''Live Audio Wrestling'' name will air as part of its [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] channel, as a video podcast hosted by [[Jeremy Borash]], though as of April 2018 it has yet to air, owing to Borash's subsequent departure.  Aside from the name, it has no connection to the original show.

[[File:POST_Wrestling_(Official_logo).png|Right|thumb|POST Wrestling (Pollock Offsets Ting)]]
The spiritual successor of ''Live Audio Wrestling'' in its original form, titled "POST Wrestling" and run in its entirety by John Pollock and Wai Ting (the name is an abbreviation of "Pollock Offsets Ting"), was announced on December 15, 2017, and launched on December 24, 2017, with their Christmas show that they had been doing from their days on the LAW.  The two temporary podcasts were folded into the Post Wrestling banner, becoming ''Rewind-a-Raw'' and ''Rewind-a-SmackDown'', while other LAW podcasts announced their relaunches under the Post Wrestling umbrella.  The spiritual successor to the ''Live Audio Wrestling'' radio show, titled ''Sunday Night's Main Event'' was announced on April 3, 2018, and set to air the following Sunday, immediately following [[Wrestlemania 34]]; aside from their common origins, Post Wrestling and ''Sunday Night's Main Event'' are not formally associated with each other.

===Trivia===
Due to the popularity of the show, [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s [[Off the Record with Michael Landsberg|Off the Record]] has had all past and current co-hosts of the radio program, excluding John Pollock, as guest panelists on the program, over the years.

== Spinoff series ==
Over the years, there have been several radio shows and podcasts that have complemented the LAW. Since the shutdown of the LAW, these shows were also put on hiatus, with many of them migrating to Post Wrestling upon the latter's launch in December 2017.

=== Former ===

==== Review-A-Raw ====
As a spinoff of ''Review-A-Wai'', John Pollock and Wai Ting also review each week's edition of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' in a separate podcast series. As with ''Review-A-Wai'', each episode John Pollock and Wai Ting run down the previous episode of ''WWE Raw'' and end by reading listener feedback. The first episode of '''''Review-A-Raw''''' was posted on July 6, 2010.  For a time in 2011, ''Review-A-Raw'' was available as a live podcast, airing over the internet via [[Stickam]] immediately following ''WWE Raw'', but it reverted to a taped format over technical issues resulting in one or both hosts being knocked off of the air.

As announced during a live ''Review-A-Wai'' podcast held immediately prior to [[WrestleMania 31]], the ''Review-A-Raw'' name expanded to also encompass a television series broadcast on Fight Network, with John Pollock and Wai Ting as co-hosts. The televised version of ''Review-A-Raw'' is effectively a televised recording session of the podcast, with the actual ''WWE Raw'' review content identical in both versions.  However, some segments have been modified to suit the television audience, such as the omission of listener feedback and a shorter banter portion at the start of the show that more directly relates to the co-hosts' positions at Fight Network.  As both the podcast and televised shows are produced in the same sitting, there may be segments omitted from the televised portion; a selection of segments from the podcast version may be, at their discretion, posted to the Fight Network's [[YouTube]] page as ''Review-A-Raw Extra''; the first ''Review-A-Raw Extra'' segment was dedicated to a contest selecting the televised series' theme music.  As the podcast version takes precedence, the television edition of the show is likely to be pre-empted in the event of other Fight Network commitments by either host; this first occurred on July 5, 2016, where Jason Agnew would host an audio-only edition in lieu of the televised show, due to John and Wai covering [[UFC 200]] for Fight Network.  The final "podcast-only" episode of ''Review-A-Raw'' was posted March 31, 2015, with the first episode of the televised series aired on Fight Network on April 7, 2015.

In January 2016, John Pollock and Wai Ting also produced an additional televised segment, ''Raw in 3 Minutes'', co-branded with Fight Network's ''Fight News Now'' branding; both the full televised version and ''Raw in 3 Minutes'' is available from the ''Live Audio Wrestling'' YouTube channel.  In mid-2017, ''Review-A-Raw'' was made into a web-only video series alongside ''Review-a-SmackDown'', ending the run of ''Raw in 3 Minutes''.

The last episode of ''Review-a-Raw'' was posted on October 23, 2017. Following the shutdown of the LAW a week later, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of ''Raw'' under the temporary title of ''John Pollock and Wai Ting Review Raw''. The full-time replacement for ''Review-a-Raw'' under the Post Wrestling banner, ''Rewind-a-Raw'', launched on December 25, 2017.

==== Review-A-SmackDown ====
On selected weeks with a live episode of [[WWE SmackDown]], a third LAW podcast starring John Pollock and Wai Ting is also available for download on Wednesdays. Like ''Review-A-Raw'' and ''Review-An-Impact'', '''''Review-A-SmackDown''''' reviews the previous episode of ''WWE SmackDown'', ending with listener feedback. The first episode of ''Review-A-SmackDown'' was posted on August 31, 2011, with Jason Agnew filling in for Wai Ting; the first episode with Wai Ting was posted on December 1, 2011.  Up until the second [[WWE brand extension]], ''Review-A-SmackDown'' would be produced only on a show-by-show basis, and not every live episode of ''WWE SmackDown'' would be reviewed.

''Review-A-SmackDown'' would become a weekly podcast with the second WWE brand extension, complementing ''Review-A-Raw''.  Unlike ''Review-A-Raw'', however, ''Review-A-SmackDown'' is intended to remain an audio-only podcast, and not a show that is meant to air on Fight Network.  The first regular episode of ''Review-A-SmackDown'' was posted on July 19, 2016, covering the [[WWE draft]] that kicked off the second WWE brand extension.

For a brief time in 2017, ''Review-a-Smackdown'' was also made available as a web video, under the same format as ''Review-a-Raw''.  The last episode of ''Review-a-Smackdown'' was posted on October 25, 2017.  Following the shutdown of the LAW later that week, John Pollock and Wai Ting continued to post audio reviews of ''SmackDown'' under the temporary title of ''John Pollock and Wai Ting Review SmackDown''.  The full-time replacement of ''Review-a-SmackDown'', under the Post Wrestling banner, ''Rewind-a-SmackDown'', launched on December 27, 2017.

==== whtsNXT ====
'''''whtsNXT''''' (pronounced as "what's next") is a podcast hosted by Jason Agnew and technical producer Braden Herrington, focusing on [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], while incorporating elements from ''Bite Network Radio''.  The name was chosen to not only reflect the product being reviewed (a show based on developmental wrestling), but also the fact that this was Braden's first foray into radio broadcasting (having joined shortly after the LAW debuted on TSN Radio as one of his first industry jobs), and a turning point in Agnew's television career (having left [[Bite TV]] since the LAW debuted on TSN Radio, leaving him with no permanent work in television aside from ''[[Splatalot]]'').  It is seen as continuing in the "rite of passage" of LAW hosts moving up the ranks (Dan Lovranski, Jason Agnew, John Pollock, and Wai Ting were all, at one point, technical producers on The LAW), with the veteran Agnew guiding the rookie Braden, akin to ''NXT'' itself.  The first episode was posted on October 7, 2013 as an addition to the LAW's podcast, but thereafter was separately posted on Thursdays thereafter.

"Bartender" Dave debuted on the January 21st 2016 edition of "whtsNXT" alongside Jason Agnew, he has since become a regular guest host on the show. Since Takeover's moved to Saturdays on the same weekend as the [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|WWE's Big 4 events]], Takeover reviews have been added onto the end of The LAW podcast under the title of "whtsNXTra". Also since 2017 whtsNXT has chosen to skip the review of the post-Takeover NXT episodes, stating there's no point in reviewing a review show.

The last episode of ''whtsNXT'' was posted on October 26, 2017. A spiritual successor under the Post Wrestling banner, titled ''upNXT'' and hosted by Braden Herrington and Bartender Dave, was launched on March 22, 2018.

==== Review-A-Wai ====
'''''"Review-A-Wai"''''' is a weekly review podcast starring John Pollock and Wai Ting, which was originally presented immediately following the archived episode of the LAW and was later made available separately.  The first episode was posted on September 13, 2009.

The two primarily review older wrestling pay-per-view events from the mid to late 1990s, but have since branched out to other media relating to wrestling and mixed martial arts.  Notably, in a homage to an early ''"Ask-a-Wai"'' episode where John and Wai reviewed a wrestling-related pornographic film, the second and third anniversary shows had John and Wai review a wrestling-related pornographic film; the visible discomfort of Wai reviewing the film has led them to discontinue reviewing wrestling-related pornographic films.  Reviews of classic events often contain audio clips from the show(s) they are reviewing; at the end of the show, John and Wai also respond to listener feedback after the review.  On occasion, they air relevant clips from previous interviews conducted with various wrestling personalities and/or interview people involved with the event being reviewed, including clips from past ''"Live Audio Wrestling"'' shows.  Each episode also ends with a piece of music specifically selected by one of the co-hosts, often relating to the show being reviewed.

On occasion, when either co-host is unavailable, a substitute co-host has joined the other co-host; most notably, [[Arda Ocal]] has been a guest reviewer on ''"Review-A-Wai"'' on several occasions during the years that the LAW and ''"Aftermath"'' ([[The Score Television Network]]'s wrestling analysis show, co-hosted by Arda Ocal) were promoted together.  Damian Abraham has also been a frequent guest reviewer, especially if the review contains a punk rock element.

The show ceased to be an add-on to the archived episode of the LAW in 2010 when the ''"Review-A-Wai"'' portion became as long as the archived episode of the LAW itself. ''"Review-A-Wai"'' was moved to a Wednesday release schedule following its second anniversary show, and later to late Tuesdays following the debut of ''"whtsNXT"'' so as to avoid multiple LAW podcasts being released on the same day.  With the launch of ''"Review-A-SmackDown"'' as a regular weekly series, ''"Review-A-Wai"'' became a biweekly series posted on Fridays, alternating with ''"Bauer &amp; Pollock"''. Following the end of ''"Bauler &amp; Pollock"'', ''"Review-A-Wai"'' will continue to be a biweekly series on Fridays alternating with ''"Keep It 2000"''.

The final episode of ''Review-a-Wai'' was posted on October 19, 2017, with an announced episode that would have aired had the LAW not been shutdown.  The first episode of the spiritual successor of ''Review-a-Wai'' under the Post Wrestling banner, ''Rewind-a-Wai'', launched with the review intended for the announced episode.

==== Japanese Audio Wrestling ====
'''''Japanese Audio Wrestling''''' is a monthly podcast hosted by Chris Charlton and WH Park, both having previously contributed to various LAW-related shows and podcasts, focusing in on Japanese wrestling.  The first episode was posted on August 1, 2012. New host Jojo Remy joined the show on the January 6th, 2017, replacing the leaving pair of Chris Charlton &amp; WH Park. From the 2017 April 3 edition WH Park has made a number of returning guest appearances.

Although put on hiatus with the shutdown of the LAW in October 2017, as part of the launch of Post Wrestling, it was announced that ''Japanese Audio Wrestling'' would continue under the Post Wrestling banner with a new name, with no specified timeframe for a relaunch.

* '''G1 Climax podcast'''
Related to ''Japanese Audio Wrestling'' is the LAW's daily coverage of the [[G1 Climax]] tournament each year, with John Pollock recapping most days of the tournament and Chris Charlton and WH Park recapping the remaining days of the tournament.

==== The MMA Report with John Pollock ====
'''''The MMA Report with John Pollock''''' is a radio show hosted by John Pollock on [[TSN Radio]], first airing on July 5, 2012. It airs Friday at midnight on TSN Radio (though the show itself is available as a podcast on the LAW podcast feed one day before), and is touted as "the third hour" of the LAW as repeats of the show air immediately after the LAW on weeks without an [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] pay-per-view (when ''The UFC Post Fight Show'' airs in its place instead).  As with the LAW, it is also broadcast in the Vancouver market (formerly [[CFTE]] and presently [[CKST]]) since 2013.

The show is also considered to be a spiritual successor to ''[[Live Audio Wrestling#Fight Network Radio|Fight Network Radio]]'', due to John Pollock's past and present connections.

==== Keep It 2000 ====
In December 2016, Brian Mann and Nate Milton return with a new podcast, '''Keep It 2000''' ''(billed as "A Podcast On A Pole")''. They embark on the worst decision of their lives – fully chronicling every [[WCW Nitro]] from the year 2000.  Often considered the worst time period for any major wrestling promotion, these 52 episodes could prove to be the thing that finally breaks these podcasting brothers apart.

The final episode of ''Keep it 2000'' as a LAW podcast was posted on October 14, 2017. As part of the Post Wrestling launch in December 2017, it was announced that ''Keep it 2000'' would continue under the Post Wrestling umbrella; the first episode of ''Keep it 2000'' under the Post Wrestling umbrella was posted on January 25, 2017.

==== British Audio Wrestling ====
'''''British Audio Wrestling''''' is a British Wrestling focused podcast launched by Martin Bushby and Oli Court,  with the first episode posted on January 6, 2017. The pair were joined by Richard Benson of The Indy Corner from Episode 2 onwards. The show focuses in on UK promotions "[[Progress Wrestling]]", "[[Revolution Pro Wrestling]]", "Fight Club: PRO" &amp; "Over The Top Wrestling" and also covers "[[World of Sport (UK TV series)#World of Sport Wrestling .282016.29|ITV World of Sport Wrestling]]" &amp; the "[[WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament]]".

The final episode of ''British Audio Wrestling'' was posted on October 17, 2017.  As part of the Post Wrestling launch in December 2017, it was announced that ''British Audio Wrestling'' would continue under the Post Wrestling umbrella under a new name, later revealed to be the ''British Wrestling Experience''. The first episode of the ''British Wrestling Experience'' launched on January 18, 2018.

==== Bauer &amp; Pollock ====
'''''Bauer &amp; Pollock''''' is a co-production between ''Live Audio Wrestling'' and ''[[Major League Wrestling]]'', where John Pollock and [[Court Bauer]] discuss the business of professional wrestling and mixed martial arts. Although initially designed to be a biweekly series, it was moved to a weekly format soon after, available on both the MLW and LAW podcast feeds.  The show was originally posted on Fridays, but was moved to late Wednesdays to avoid having multiple LAW podcasts being posted on the same day.  With the launch of ''Review-A-SmackDown'' as a weekly series, ''Bauer &amp; Pollock'' became a biweekly series posted on Fridays, alternating with ''Review-A-Wai''. After a lengthy hiatus on 12 January 12, 2017, "The Final Edition" of Bauer &amp; Pollock was uploaded. The reason behind the decision to end Bauer &amp; Pollock was the large workloads of each host and inability to find a common free day to do the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightnetwork.com/law/the-final-edition-of-bauer-pollock/|title=The Final Edition of Bauer &amp; Pollock - Fight Network|website=FightNetwork.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2017, Court &amp; John returned for a "One-Off" special, continuing to do almost one show every month since.&lt;ref&gt;http://fightnetwork.com/category/news/?s=Bauer &amp; Pollock LiveAudioWrestling.com/Bauer&amp;Pollock&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ask-A-Wai / Bite Network Radio ====
'''''Ask-A-Wai''''' was an add-on to the end of each LAW broadcast starting in September 2008, and starred John Pollock and Wai Ting, then call screener on the LAW. It was taped immediately following ''Live Audio Xtra'', and was a general discussion podcast and generally unrelated to wrestling.  In late 2009, Jason Agnew joined Ask-A-Wai as a co-host, though retaining the same format as before.

''Ask-A-Wai'' ended with the move of the LAW from CFRB to [[The Score Satellite Radio|Hardcore Sports Radio]], though the ''Ask-A-Wai'' format would be succeeded with the ''[[BiteTV|Bite Network]] Radio'' podcast.  ''Bite Network Radio'' itself would be hosted by Jason Agnew and John Pollock, retaining the format of ''Ask-A-Wai'', and occasionally featuring Wai Ting and other members from their circle of friends.  Like ''Ask-A-Wai'', ''Bite Network Radio'' was taped immediately following the LAW.

''Bite Network Radio'' ended with the move of the LAW to [[TSN Radio]], as the studios at TSN could no longer accommodate all of the regular hosts.  Though ''The Late Shift'', a radio show hosted by Jason Agnew on CFRB, is touted as the spiritual successor of Bite Network Radio, it follows a different format and has no formal association to the LAW.

Starting in 2011 with [[UFC 140]], The LAW started to present a '''UFC post fight show''' on TSN Radio 1050. The show airs after the conclusion of the most recent [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] event and provides results and opinions from callers and [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] journalists.  Though originally branded as a LAW show, since the launch of ''The MMA Report'' the show has used the latter show's branding.

==== Review-An-Impact ====
Each Saturday (some episodes may be delayed to Sunday), former WWE writer [[Brian Mann]] and frequent LAW contributor Nate Milton review the previous edition of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]''.

Originally hosted by John Pollock and Wai Ting as a counterpart to ''Review-a-Raw'', the first episode of '''''Review-An-Impact''''' was posted on November 5, 2010.  Since September 2011, Nate Milton (nicknamed "The Godfather, TNAte" in the LAW community) has been featured in a recurring segment on ''Review-An-Impact'' where he provides separate analysis of the episode; this was often in the form of an interview with one of the co-hosts. In the event that either host was unavailable, Nate takes on the role of co-host for the entire podcast in place of the segment.  In late 2014, due to Wai Ting's other commitments, Nate Milton became a co-host on a more full-time basis, though the arrangement lasted for only a few weeks due to the termination of ''Impact Wrestling'' on Spike TV; Wai Ting's final episode of Review-An-Impact was on October 23, 2014.

With the relaunch of ''Impact Wrestling'' on [[Destination America]], ''Review-An-Impact'' was revamped with Brian Mann as the lead host, initially with John Pollock as co-host in the pilot episode on January 8, 2015, and with Nate Milton as co-host on a full-time basis on the following episode.  Due to being the first "all-American podcast" in the LAW family, and with neither co-host hosting another LAW podcast, ''Review-An-Impact'' also expanded their scope to include their commentary on general wrestling news, diversity issues in professional wrestling, pop culture (largely as a result of Brian later joining [[Yahoo! Movies]]), and politics in general.

With the declining relevance of TNA in North American professional wrestling in 2015 (and the impending end of the TNA/Destination America partnership), ''Live Audio Wrestling'' decided to terminate coverage of TNA following the [[Bound for Glory (2015)|2015 Bound for Glory]] event; the final regular episode of ''Review-an-Impact'' (an episode dedicated to counting down the "Top 10 moments in [[Impact Wrestling]] history") aired on October 3, 2015.

==== Keep It 100 ====
Billed as "the realest show about being fake", ''Keep it 100'' is a podcast that serves as a spiritual successor to ''Review-An-Impact'', hosted by Brian Mann and Nate Milton.  The idea behind the show came from the viewer feedback segments from ''Review-an-Impact'', where general questions regarding the co-hosts' opinions started to dominate the discourse as opposed to feedback related to episodes of the episodes of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]'' being reviewed.  With ''Live Audio Wrestling'' deciding to terminate coverage of TNA, it was agreed that the viewer feedback segment would effectively be expanded to cover the entire show.

The concept of this podcast, where the co-hosts must answer every question asked of them with absolute truth, was largely inspired by the segment of the same name on ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]''.  Similar to its predecessor, topics covered by the show are primarily focused on general wrestling news, diversity in professional wrestling, wrestling as it relates to pop culture, with a slight nod to politics.  The first episode aired on October 9, 2015.

Due to the hosts' other commitments, ''Keep It 100'' aired for only seven weeks as a weekly series, though various special shows have been posted on an irregular basis, including those dedicated to covering TNA special events.

==== Review-A-Merica ====
'''''"Review-A-Merica"''''' was a one-off podcast covering the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]] from the perspective of two Canadians (John and Wai).

In 2016, Brian and Nate revived the '''''"Review-A-Merica"''''' podcast for a series of shows covering the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] from a "wrestling with democracy" perspective.

==== Ask-A-Wai Video Podcast ====
The ''Ask-A-Wai'' name would later be reused for a video podcast series featuring John Pollock and Wai Ting in late 2011, as a complement to ''Review-A-Wai'', where John Pollock and Wai Ting answered questions submitted by ''Review-A-Wai'' fans regarding pro wrestling and mixed martial arts. Though originally filmed in the "''Review-A-Wai'' studios" at [[Fight Network]], later entries were filmed in various locations in and around downtown Toronto.  A short-lived revival of ''Ask-A-Wai'' was also posted as a YouTube series on the ''Live Audio Wrestling'' YouTube channel in 2015, it ended in May 2016.

The ''Ask-A-Wai'' name would be used following the shutdown of the LAW, as a monthly audio podcast for [[Patreon]] supporters of Post Wrestling.

==== CWCeen ====
In 2016, a separate show, '''''CWCeen''''', was added to the end of ''whtsNXT'', covering the [[WWE Cruiserweight Classic (2016)|WWE Cruiserweight Classic]].  This show was hosted by Braden Herrington and Wai Ting, and includes banter on their common love of hip-hop, as well as the fact that Braden Herrington had joined Fight Network after leaving TSN Radio.

==End of Year Awards==
Awards are given over the course of two episodes: the Best of episode, typically the last episode of the year under consideration or the first episode of the following year, and the Worst of episode, awarded the first week without a pay-per-view event after the Best of episode. Each host of the show nominates a pick in each category, and may also name '''''"ties" ({{Tooltip|&amp;|(tied)}})''''' and '''''"honourable mentions" ({{Tooltip|h/m|(honorable mention)}})''''' in each category.

Both Wai Ting and Braden Herrington have officially joined the other three hosts to hand out their Best of Awards &amp; Worst of Awards. Ting in both 2012 and 2013, &amp; Herrington in both 2014 and 2016.

''' Worst Pay-Per-View '''&lt;br /&gt;
Up until 2009, there was a single award covering both wrestling and mixed martial arts pay-per-view events.  In 2009, this category was split to two separate awards for wrestling events and mixed martial arts events, and in 2011 the mixed martial arts event category was no longer restricted to pay-per-view events, instead focusing on [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]]s in general.

''' Worst Book '''&lt;br /&gt;
Like its Best of counterpart, Jason Agnew does not usually give a pick due to his commitments with other shows precluding him from reading too many wrestling or mixed martial arts books; though he formally did not have a pick for 2010, he did make a joke pick for 2010, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">[[File:Mukylolagt.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Muky copy of the Mattel Lola GT70.]]
'''Muky''' was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] brand of [[die-cast toy|die-cast]] [[toy]] [[automobile|car]] models. The brand was popular in Argentina between the 1970s and the 1980s.  Most were diecast seconds or knockoffs of early Mattel Hot Wheels.

==Company==
Muky was made by Induguay S.A. "Fabrica de Juguetes Muky" (in Spanish: "Muky Toy Factory"). Established by the DeConti brothers, the company was located in the city of Gualeguay, Entre Rios province, 145 miles north of Buenos Aires (Frasinetti No date).

Virtually all of the models made by Muky were copies of early Mattel [[Hot Wheels]] like the Custom Corvette, the Lola T70, the Custom Eldorado, or the Dodge Deora. Thus the company is often called the "Hot Wheels of Argentina" (Weber and Sahakangas website). Muky were not as popular, or as collectible today, as the country's [[Buby]] toys, which made Argentine Ramblers and Falcons and other vehicles that may have been more familiar to children there (Sinclair 1976).

==Change of Management==
In the late 1970s, because of the worsening economic environment in Argentina, the DeConti brothers moved to Brazil and began manufacturing toys there called Super veloz.  In 1984 or 1985, a certain Dell Arciprete bought Muky, and using most of the same dies, again began making Mukys (Frasinetti No date).  Arciprete's Muky also added a few new vehicles.  The Arciprete family ran a fumigation business at the same time as Muky (Frasinetti No date).

The later Mukys were numbered from eight to 40, numbers one through eight having been lost along the line somewhere. Also, these later models' chassis were cast in plastic and Mukys were distributed to Uruguay and Spain, besides the patria Argentina (Frasinetti No date).   

==Questions on Tooling==
How Induguay came to possess the Mattel dies is uncertain; one story is that the DeConti brothers stole the dies from Mattel, but two other prevalent theories exist, both logical. One is that the models were carefully copied from blueprints (Frasinetti 2009; Frasinette No date). Another is that third party agents, with the approval of Mattel, sold some dies to the De Contis (Frasinetti 2009). In any event, perusal of catalogs of old and new models shows that few of the 37 models originally manufactured by Induguay were ever reissued by Mattel. Apparently, the Arciprete family has kept the tooling and doesn't deny that they might again someday make more Mukys (Frasinetti No date).

'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first is what is otherwise called '[[Elements of music|rudiments]]', currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. [...] The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. [...] The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music — a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016}}{{Dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.&lt;ref&gt;See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains "musica instrumentalis" as beneath the "true" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' ("It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows").&lt;/ref&gt; However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, chapters 4–7 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15–17}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] or [[Ph.D]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.

==History==

===Prehistory===
{{Main article|Prehistoric music}}

Preserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|Gǔdí]], and [[Anasazi flute]].

===Antiquity===

====Mesopotamia====
{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}

Several surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|Kümmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, "All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years."{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43–44}}

====China====
{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}

Much of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"&gt;Joseph S.C. Lam, "China.", §II, "History and Theory", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed November 15, 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&amp;nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bagley, "The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[Lüshi chunqiu]] from about 239&amp;nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the "Yellow Bell." He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''lülü'' or later the ''shierlü''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

The ''lülü'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40–41}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''lülü'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41–42}}

The two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the "Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds," or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&amp;nbsp;BCE) as pitches of "superior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of "inferior generation," that is, the pitches of Ling Lun’s female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}

"Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' ("Record of music", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468–c376&amp;nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi’s claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' ("Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants")."&lt;ref name="oxfordmusiconline.com"/&gt;

====India====
The [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 – 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE to 200&amp;nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''Śrutis''), scales (''Grāmas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''Mūrchanās'', modes?), melodic types (''Jātis''), instruments, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nāțyaśāstra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol. II, Calcutta, The Asiatic Society, 1961. See particularly pp. 5–19 of the Introduction, ''The Ancient Indian Theory and Practice of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{see also|Musical system of ancient Greece|List of music theorists#Antiquity}}

Early preserved Greek writings on music theory include two types of works:&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen, "Greek Music Theory", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
The Latin treatise ''De institutione musica'' by the Roman philosopher [[Boethius]] (written c. 500) was a touchstone for other writings on music in medieval Europe. Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes. Several centuries later, treatises began to appear which dealt with the actual composition of pieces of music in the [[plainchant]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists §5 Early Middle Ages}}: "Boethius could provide a model only for that part of theory which underlies but does not give rules for composition or performance. The first surviving strictly musical treatise of Carolingian times is directed towards musical practice, the Musica disciplina of Aurelian of Réôme (9th century)."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ninth century, [[Hucbald]] worked towards more precise pitch notation for the [[neume]]s used to record plainchant.

[[Guido d'Arezzo]]' wrote in 1028 a letter to Michael of Pomposa, entitled ''Epistola de ignoto cantu'',&lt;ref&gt;For a modern edition of the letter, see [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/gui_epi.html].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the practice of using syllables to describe notes and intervals. This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony "come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=§5 Early Middle Ages}}

During the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' ("The art of measured chant") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.

As Western musical influence spread throughout the world in the 1800s, musicians adopted Western theory as an international standard—but other theoretical traditions in both textual and oral traditions remain in use. For example, the long and rich musical traditions unique to ancient and current cultures of Africa are primarily oral, but describe specific forms, genres, performance practices, tunings, and other aspects of music theory.{{sfn|Kubik|2010|loc=passim}}{{sfn|Ekwueme|1974|loc=passim}}

[[Sacred Harp]] music uses a different kind of scale and theory in practice. The music focuses around the solfege "fa, sol, la" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving "shape notes", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for "singing by note" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=0-8203-0426-3|location=United States of America|pages=4–5, 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals of music==
{{Main article|Aspect of music}}
Music is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; "music theory" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}

===Pitch===
{{Main article|Pitch (music)}}
[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&amp;nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]
Pitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Specific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&amp;nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.

The difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single "class" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class—the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}

[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.

===Scales and modes===
{{Main article|Musical scale| Musical mode}}
[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]
Notes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

The most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)—they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

In traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73–74}}

The interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.

===Consonance and dissonance===
{{Main article|Consonance and dissonance}}
{{double image|right|Perfect octave on C.png|175|Minor second on C.png|175|The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}|The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}|A consonance|A dissonance}}
[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.
Consonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and "wants to" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}

Context and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the Common Practice era, the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]’s concept of "emancipated" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as "higher," more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.--&gt;}}

===Rhythm===
{{Main article|Rhythm}}
[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]
Rhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.

Through increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented. There are conventions in most musical traditions for regular and hierarchical accentuation of beats to reinforce a given meter. [[Syncopation|Syncopated]] rhythms contradict those conventions by accenting unexpected parts of the beat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syncopation|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t237/e10023|website=Oxford Dictionary of Music|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="Syncopation is achieved by accenting a weak instead of a strong beat, by putting rests on strong beats, by holding on over strong beats, and by introducing a sudden change of time‐signature."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing simultaneous rhythms in more than one time signature is called [[polyrhythm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyrhythm|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/22059|website=Grove Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=11 August 2017|quote="The superposition of different rhythms or metres."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars. The most highly cited of these recent scholars are [[Maury Yeston]],{{sfn|Yeston|1976}} [[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]],{{sfn|Lerdahl and Jackendoff|1985}} [[Jonathan Kramer]],{{sfn|Kramer|1988}}  and [[Justin London]].{{sfn|London|2004}}

A [[melody]] is a series of tones sounding in succession that typically move toward a climax of tension then resolve to a state of rest. Because melody is such a prominent aspect in so much music, its construction and other qualities are a primary interest of music theory.

The basic elements of melody are pitch, duration, rhythm, and tempo. The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3–47}}

A chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|Károlyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords. Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern Western, West African,{{sfn|Mitchell|2008}} and Oceanian{{sfn|Linkels|n.d.|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Specific page citation within this twelve-page article needed.--&gt;}} music, whereas they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}}

The most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triads]], so called because they consist of three distinct notes: further notes may be added to give [[seventh chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s, or [[added tone chord]]s. The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note—so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.

A series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]. To describe this, chords are numbered, using [[Roman numerals]] (upward from the key-note),{{sfn|Schoenberg|1983|loc=1–2}} per their [[diatonic function]]. Common ways of [[#Notation|notating or representing chords]]{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=77}} in western music other than conventional [[staff notation]] include [[Roman numerals#Music theory|Roman numerals]], [[figured bass]] (much used in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]]), [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and various systems of [[chord chart]]s typically found in the [[lead sheet]]s used in [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|popular music]] to lay out the sequence of chords so that the musician may play accompaniment chords or improvise a solo.

===Harmony===

In [[music]], harmony is the use of simultaneous [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].{{sfn|Malm|1996|loc=15|quote=Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music.}} The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.{{sfn|Dahlhaus|2009}} Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.{{sfn|Jamini|2005|loc=147}} [[Counterpoint]], which refers to the interweaving of melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the relationship of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Timbre===
{{Main article|Timbre}}
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:
[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called "color", or "tone color," is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called "...the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.

[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and "sweet" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Dynamics====

{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}
{{Main article|Dynamics (music)}}
[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]
In music, "[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.

The conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally "half soft") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or "pushed" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').

Greater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''più piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''decrescendo''), often called "[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.

====Articulation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
{{Main article|Articulation (music)}}
[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[marcato]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--The linked article says there are two symbols commonly used to indicate "marcato": the one so indicated here, and the one that is here described as "martellato". Which authority says the latter is incorrect?--&gt; [[tenuto]].]]
Articulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.

For example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as "separated" or "detached" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).

There are a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' ("separated", "detached"); ''[[martelé (bowstroke)|martelé]]'' (heavily accented or "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain "in-between" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.

===Texture===
{{Main article|Musical texture}}
[[File:Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s "[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]]," mm. 1–7{{audio|Sousa - "Washington Post March," m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]
In [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many "layers" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.

The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}

Common types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.--&gt;

===Form or structure===
[[File:Canon example.png|thumb|A musical [[canon (music)|canon]]. ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' calls a "canon" both a compositional technique and a musical form.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/canon-music|title=Canon &amp;#124; music|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main article|Musical form}}
The term musical form (or musical architecture) refers to the overall structure or plan of a piece of music, and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.{{sfn|Brandt|2007}} In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."{{sfn|Scholes|1977}} According to [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]], musical form is "the shape or structure of the work." He describes it through difference: the distance moved from a [[Repetition (music)|repeat]]; the latter being the smallest difference. Difference is quantitative and qualitative: ''how far'', and ''of what type'', different. In many cases, form depends on statement and [[Restatement (music)|restatement]], unity and variety, and [[contrast (music)|contrast]] and connection.{{sfn|Middleton|1999|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}}

===Expression===
{{Main article|Musical expression}}
[[File:1Francisco20violinista.jpg|thumb|Right|220px|A violinist performing]]
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing music with emotional communication. The elements of music that comprise expression include dynamic indications, such as forte or piano, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], differing qualities of timbre and articulation, color, intensity, energy and excitement. All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.

Expression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--&gt; Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?--&gt;}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

===Notation===
{{Main article|Musical notation|Sheet music}}
[[File:Tibetanmusicalscore.jpg|thumb|[[Tibet]]an musical score from the 19th century]]
Musical notation is the written or symbolized representation of music. This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kodály Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.

In standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.

In Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.

==Music theory as academic discipline==
The scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.

===Analysis===
{{Main article|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}
[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Melisande]]''
are analyzed differently by Leibowitz, Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.
{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]
Musical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards."{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Varèse]]'s claim that, "to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868–1935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erläuterungen'' ("Elucidations"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8–9, pp. 49–51, vol. 10, pp. 40–2; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201–05; 2, p. 193-97. English translation, ''Der Tonwille'',{{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 2, p. 117-18 (the translation, although made from vols. 8–9 of the German original, gives as original pagination that of ''Das Meisterwerk'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} 1; the text is the same). The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially § 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.&lt;/ref&gt; The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.

Although Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=§ 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.

Transformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}

===Music perception and cognition===
[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]
{{Further information|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}
Music psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], [[skill]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to music theory through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QCfUoD4m7E4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=Ethnomusicology+can+benefit+from+psychological+approaches+to+the+study+of+music+cognition+in+different+cultures.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S1ffy-zJ_D&amp;sig=MHHfRNiZSsLSqtelThi5cvmrZnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiezMnRypXZAhUJSY8KHVgoApcQ6AEISDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnomusicology%20can%20benefit%20from%20psychological%20approaches%20to%20the%20study%20of%20music%20cognition%20in%20different%20cultures.&amp;f=false|title=Time in Indian Music: Rhythm, Metre, and Form in North Indian Rag Performance|last=Martin|first=Clayton|last2=Clayton|first2=Martin|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195339680|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Genre and technique===
{{Main article|Music genre|Musical technique}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008930-0019, Beethovenhalle Bonn, Kammerkonzert Kölner Trio.jpg|thumb|A Classical [[piano trio]] is a group that plays [[chamber music]], including [[sonata]]s. The term "piano trio" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word "form", as part of the compound expression ; the word "style" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.--&gt;

Music can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, "Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre—both are violin concertos—but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form."{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or "basic musical language."{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}

Others, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432–33}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that "since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}

Musical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's "most striking and distinctive characteristic" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[étude]]s (meaning "study") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.

===Mathematics===
{{Main article|Music and mathematics}}
[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is "the basis of sound" and sound itself "in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties", simply because nature itself "is amazingly mathematical".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42–43}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22–24}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.
[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]
In the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}

===Serial composition and set theory===
[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]
{{Further information|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}
In music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called "[[parameter (music)|parameters]]"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Integral serialism" or "total serialism" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post–World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are "general serialism" and "multiple serialism".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5–6}}

Musical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Musical semiotics===
{{Further information|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]
Music semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels. Following [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Kofi Agawu]] adopts the idea of musical semiosis being introversive or extroversive—that is, musical signs within a text and without.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} "Topics," or various musical conventions (such as horn calls, dance forms, and styles), have been treated suggestively by Agawu, among others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The notion of [[Musical Gestures|gesture]] is beginning to play a large role in musico-semiotic enquiry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

:"There are strong arguments that music inhabits a semiological realm which, on both [[ontogenetic]] and [[phylogenetic]] levels, has developmental priority over verbal language."{{sfn|Middleton|1990|loc=172}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1976}}{{sfn|Nattiez|1990}}{{sfn|Nattiez1989}}{{sfn|Stefani|1973}}{{sfn|Stefani|1976}}{{sfn|Baroni|1983}}{{sfn|''Semiotica''|1987|loc=66:1–3}}{{clarify |date=November 2018|reason=The quotation cannot stem from all these references at once!}}

Writers on music semiology include Kofi Agawu (on topical theory,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} [[Heinrich Schenker]],{{sfn|Dunsby and Stopford|1981|loc=49-53}}{{sfn|Meeùs|2017|loc=81-96}} Robert Hatten (on topic, gesture){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Raymond Monelle]] (on topic, musical meaning){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (on introversive taxonomic analysis and ethnomusicological applications){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, [[Anthony Newcomb]] (on narrativity){{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}, and [[Eero Tarasti]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} (generally considered the founder of musical semiotics).

[[Roland Barthes]], himself a semiotician and skilled [[amateur]] pianist, wrote about music in ''Image-Music-Text,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''The Responsibilities of Form,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''Eiffel Tower,''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} though he did not consider music to be a semiotic system{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

Signs, meanings in music, happen essentially through the connotations of sounds, and through the social construction, appropriation and amplification of certain meanings associated with these connotations. The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music’s Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.

===Education and careers===
[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]
Music theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT&gt;{{cite web|last=McCreless|first=Patrick|title=Society for Music Theory|work=[[Grove Music Online]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.&lt;ref name=GroveSMT/&gt; This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Société d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be/index.html Société belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft für Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Meeùs|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.

As part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).

Most music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}&lt;!--How competitive is "very"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--&gt; Applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired—called an "ABD", for "[[All But Dissertation]]" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and Ph.D students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

'''The Mystere incident''' was an [[EverQuest]] controversy revolving around a virtual player named "Mystere", banned from the game by Verant (EverQuest's developer) over a controversial role-playing story. Mystere, a male player on the Brell Serilis server who roleplayed and posted both as the female dark elf "Mystere" and, less frequently, a male Iksar character "Vhasst", wrote a fan fiction story which depicted the [[rape]] of a dark elf girl of "barely 14 seasons". This story was posted under the name "Vhasst" on July 11, 2000 to third-party Brell Serilis server boards not affiliated with Verant or Sony;

At some point afterwards, an anonymous party contacted Verant complaining about Mystere's story. On October 4, 2000, Mystere was abruptly kicked out of EverQuest, and the story was soon after removed from the [[IGN]] message board where it was originally posted. Upon contacting Mystere, George Scotto, head of customer service, informed him that he had been banned. According to Mystere:

{{bquote|He told me that I had been banned for a very disturbing story I had written. I was further told that Sony 'didn't want my kind of people' playing their game. After attempting to defend myself by saying that it was a roleplay story only, and wasn't even posted on their boards, I was informed that the council had made their decision and it was immutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamegirladvance.com/mmog/archives/2002/10/21/stripping_the_dark_from_dark_elf_in_eq.html Gamegirladvance.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029130557/http://www.gamegirladvance.com/mmog/archives/2002/10/21/stripping_the_dark_from_dark_elf_in_eq.html |date=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This incident was discussed in two GameSpot articles under News and Features about the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark expansion.  The first, on October 6, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/everquest-fan-fiction-controversy/1100-2637913/]&lt;/ref&gt; was a mention of the incident and the stir it had caused in the EverQuest gaming community.  The second, on October 10, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/verant-qanda/1100-2638977/]&lt;/ref&gt; being a Q&amp;A with Sony / Verant's John Smedley to get the publisher's perspective on what had occurred.

The incident also led to the removal of a quest in the game which requires the player to [[murder]] a pregnant halfling (due to criticism that the quest was as violent as anything in Mystere's story), became the subject of academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060620203245/http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/yjolt/files/20042005Issue/1_Garlick_052005.doc Google cache: "Player, Pirate or Conducer?  A Consideration of the Rights of Online Gamers"]&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired a [[Penny Arcade (webcomic)|Penny Arcade]] cartoon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2000/10/11 |title=An Official Accident |publisher=Penny Arcade! |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a week-long story arc in the [[PvP]] webcomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvponline.com/comic/2000/10/09/mon-oct-09/ |title=Archive " Mon Oct 09 |publisher=PvPonline |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, on February 16, 2006, [[John Smedley (video games)|John Smedley]] brought up the incident again on his blog.&lt;ref name="stationblog.wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stationblog.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/virtual-jail/ |title=Virtual Jail |publisher=Stationblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716085300/http://stationblog.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/virtual-jail/ |archivedate=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his post, he claims that Verant took the heat silently over the debacle because the full story could not be disclosed to the public, and involved allegations of criminal behavior:

{{bquote|...we couldn't tell the real story, which involved one player accusing this banned player of something that, if true, would have crossed major real-life moral and legal lines. I personally spoke with the person accused and there was enough that made me uncomfortable to decide the right thing to do was to keep this person out of our games altogether. The "fan fiction" story this player wrote certainly was a part of this decision, particularly when combined with the accusation made in-game...&lt;ref name="stationblog.wordpress" /&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2015}}}}

'''O'Neill's Adventureland''' was a small [[amusement park]] located in [[Edmondson Park, New South Wales|Edmondson Park]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The park was promoted in the 1970s and 1980s on television commercials with the lyric "Something for mum and something for dad, something for grandma and old grandad... at Adventureland".

The park operated under the name of Adventureland Sydney and was open throughout the year. Rides included the Warthog ghost train, giant slide, water slide, miniature train, dodgem cars and many more.

More recently the park has been used as a set for the television show ''[[Double the Fist]]''.  The rides at the park have also featured in movies such as ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=From Adventureland to `Prawnland' Fist is double the fun | newspaper=Liverpool Leader | page= 4 | date= 27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was also used extensively in the 1983 Australian drama ''[[Hostage (1983 film)|Hostage]]'', and was where the first section of the movie was based. This movie was known internationally as ''The Christine Maresch Story'', and starred [[Judy Nunn]] and Kerry Mack.

The park now opens occasionally, operating only portable rides.

The '''organisation of sport in Australia''' has been largely determined by its Federal system of government –  [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] and [[States and territories of Australia|six states and two territories governments]] and [[Local government in Australia|local governments]].&lt;ref name=profile&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian sport : a profile|year=1985|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|location=Canberra|isbn=0644036672}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three levels play an important role in terms of funding, policies and facilities. Each major sport is managed by a national sports organisation, with state counterparts that manage community sporting clubs.  Umbrella or peak organisations represent the interests of sports organisations or particular sport issues. Education sector plays a small role through universities and schools. Private sector's involvement is extensive in professional sport through facilities, club ownership and finance/sponsorship.

==Government==
Government involvement in sport up until the 1970s was fairly limited with local governments playing a major role through the provision of sporting facilities.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; However, this changed over the next two decades with an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 2001–2002 finding that approximately $2&amp;nbsp;billion was spent on sport by three levels of government – 10 per cent from the Australian Government, 40 per cent from state and territory governments, and the remaining 50 per cent from local government.&lt;ref name=crawford&gt;{{cite book|title=Future of Sport in Australia|year=2010|publisher=Dept. of Health and Aging|location=Canberra|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/1DDA76A44E5F4DD4CA257671000E4C45/$File/Crawford_Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; State, territory and local government spending was predominantly directed to facilities and their upkeep.&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt;  This amount most likely has increased since that survey.

National Approach
In 1973, the Recreation Minister’s Council was established to provide a forum for Australian Government and State and Territory Minister’s responsible for sport and recreation to discuss matters  of interest.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; With government's taking an increased involvement in sport, it became the Sport and Recreation Minister’s Council.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; More recently is referred to as Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers.&lt;ref name=msrm&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting of Sport and Recreation Ministers|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/information/casro/about_us/msrm|work=Australian Sports Commission website|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meeting is assisted by the Committee of Australian Sport and Recreation Officials (CASRO) previously called the Standing Committee on Sport and Recreation (SCORS).&lt;ref name=msrm/&gt; The Meeting works cooperatively on issues such as match fixing, sport participation and water safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport and Recreation Ministerial Council Meeting|url=http://www.regional.gov.au/sport/minister/releases/2012/kl027.aspx|work=Department of Regional Australia, Local Government and thy Arts, Sport Minister Release, 11 July 2012|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Minister's signed the ''National Sport and Active Recreation Policy Framework''.&lt;ref name=framework&gt;{{cite book|title=National Sport and Recreation Active Framework|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|location=Canberra|isbn=9781921739521|pages=2011|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/467563/National_Sport_and_Active_Recreation_Policy_Framework.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework "provides a mechanism for the achievement of national goals for sport and active recreation, sets out agreed roles and responsibilities of governments and their expectations of sport and active recreation partners." &lt;ref name=framework/&gt;

In 1993, National Elite Sports Council was established to provide a forum for communication, issues management and national program co-ordination across the high performance in Australia.&lt;ref name=bloomfield/&gt; It includes representatives from AIS, State Institute /Academies, [[Australian Olympic Committee]], [[Australian Paralympic Committee]], and the [[Australian Commonwealth Games Association]].&lt;ref name=asc&gt;{{cite web|title=High performance sport in Australia|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/ais/australias_winning_edge/high_performance_sport_in_australia|work=Australian Sports Commission website|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Jim|title=More than sunshine &amp; vegemite : success the Australian way|year=2007|publisher=Halstead Press|location=Sydney|isbn=1920831347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2011, ''National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement'' provides "guidance on how the sector will operate, with a principal focus on the delivery of the high performance plans of national sporting organisations."&lt;ref name=nisia&gt;{{cite book|title=National Institute System Intergovernmental Agreement, June 2011|year=2011|url=http://www.regional.gov.au/sport/programs/files/IA_national_institute_system.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Government===
Australian Government provided small amounts of funding in the 1950s and 1960s through the support of the [[National Fitness Council]] and international sporting teams such as the Australian Olympic team.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; The [[Australian Government]]'s serious involvement and investment into sport came with it establishing the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) in 1981.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; AIS was set up to improve Australia's performances in international sport which had started to decline in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in Australia winning no gold medals at the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]].&lt;ref name=bloomfield/&gt; In 1985, the [[Australian Sports Commission]] (ASC) was established to improve the [[Australian Government]]'s administration of sport in terms of funding, participation and elite sport.&lt;ref name=bloomfield/&gt; The 1989 Senate Inquiry into drugs in sport resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sport Drug Agency (now called [[Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority]] (ASADA)) in 1990 to manage Australia's anti-doping program.&lt;ref name=bloomfield/&gt; The [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]] is supported by the Office of Sport located in their department. The Office's works with the key agencies ASC and ASADA in the development of sport. Currently, the Office's main focus is in integrity of sport and bidding and hosting of major events in Australia.

===State Governments===
State and Territory governments have a department with responsibility for sport and recreation. These departments provide assistance to state sports organisations, develop and manage sporting facilities, provide financial assistance for major sporting events and develop policies to assist sports across their state or territory.  Each Australian State and Territory has established its own institute/academy of sport – [[ACT Academy of Sport]] (established 1989), [[New South Wales Institute of Sport]] (1996), [[Northern Territory Institute of Sport]] (1996), [[Queensland Academy of Sport]] (1991), [[South Australian Sports Institute]] (1982), [[Tasmanian Institute of Sport]] (1985), [[Victorian Institute of Sport]] (1990) and [[Western Australian Institute of Sport]] (1984).&lt;ref name=bloomfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloomfield|first=John|title=Australia's sporting success : the inside story|year=2003|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn=0868405825}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutes/academies and the AIS work together through the National Institutes Network and the National Elite Sports Council.  Victoria and New South Wales have established regional academies.

Many state governments have facility management trusts to manage their major sporting precincts and facilities. Examples are Sydney Olympic Park Authority (New South Wales) and State Sports Centre Trust (Victoria).

===Local Governments===
There are 560 local councils across Australia. Local governments generally focus on the provision of facilities such as swimming pools, sporting fields, stadiums and tennis courts.&lt;ref name=local&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport and recreation in local government.|year=1998|publisher=Australian Sports Commission|location=Canberra|isbn=0642263450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment into sports development programs for local clubs is generally limited. In national sporting issues, local governments may be represented by [[Australian Local Government Association]].

==Sports Organisations==

===National Sports Organisations===
in 2012, there were 102 national sports organisations (NSO) in Australia recognised by the Australian Sports Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Sports Directory|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/about/australian_sport_directory|work=Australian Sports Commission website|accessdate=25 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303204458/http://www.ausport.gov.au/about/australian_sport_directory|archivedate=3 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 63 NSO's received funding from ASC in 2011–2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Sports Commission Annual Report 2011-2012|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/about/publications/annual_reports/annual_report_2011-2012|work=Australian Sports Commission website|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these organisations are affiliated to an international organisation and where appropriate to the [[Australian Olympic Committee]], [[Australian Paralympic Committee]], [[Australian Commonwealth Games Association]] and the [[Confederation of Australian Sport]]. These organisations manage the participation and high performance sport programs of the sport.

Several of the national sports organisations run professional sports competitions/leagues:
* [[Cricket Australia]] – [[Sheffield Shield]]
* [[Australian Football League]] – [[Australian Football League|AFL League]]
* [[Australian Rugby League Commission]] – [[National Rugby League]]
* [[Australian Rugby Union]] – [[Super Rugby]]  
* [[Football Federation Australia]] – [[A-League]] and [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]]
* Basketball – [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|National Basketball League]] and [[Women's National Basketball League]]
* [[Netball Australia]] – [[ANZ Championship]]
* [[Baseball Australia]] – [[Australian Baseball League]]

There are other leagues where athletes receive little remuneration. These include:
* [[Bowls Australia]]
* [[Sporting shooters association of Australia]]
* [[Cricket Australia]] – [[Women's National Cricket League]]
* [[Hockey Australia]] – [[Australian Hockey League]] (Men and Women)
* [[Australian Water Polo]] – [[Australian National Water Polo League]] (Men and Women)
* [[Australian Parachute Federation]] – Australian National Skydiving League

===State Sports Organisations===

National sports organisation generally have eight affiliated state sports organisations that manage the activities of clubs in their state. This means there are over 800 state sports organisations in Australia.&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Most states have an organisation that represents their interests. These include Vicsport, NSW Sports Federation, ACTSPORT, Tasmanian Sports Federation, Western Australian Sports Federation, Sport SA, and Sports Federation of Queensland.

===Clubs===
Community sporting clubs are regarded as the lifeblood of Australian sport. These sporting clubs are affiliated to national and state sporting organisations. In 2010, [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] found that 2.3&amp;nbsp;million or 14% of the adult population undertook voluntary work with the sport and recreation organisations, most likely to be sporting clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Volunteers in Sport, Australia, 2010|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/185E7CB7EDFE8FA3CA2579CD000CF19D?opendocument|work=Australian Bureau of Statistics website|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the club level, volunteers include coaches, officials and administrators. Clubs generally receive their limited income from membership fees. Professional sporting clubs have been established to compete in national and international leagues such as [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]], [[ANZ Championship]] and [[Super 15]].

==Educator Sector==

===Universities===
University sport in Australia is based primarily around the provision of sporting clubs and facilities. Only a few universities offer individual athletic scholarships. This is very different from the United States system organised by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] which has well organised sports programs with scholarships. There has been a recent trend for universities to become involved with professional sporting teams. [[University of Canberra]] is a major sponsor the [[ACT Brumbies]]&lt;ref name=brumbies&gt;{{cite news|title=University of Canberra joins forces with the Brumbies|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/university-of-canberra-joins-forces-with-brumbies-20120131-1qqig.html|accessdate=25 February 2013|newspaper=Canberra Times|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] has developed a strong partnership with the [[Western Bulldogs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VU and the Western Bulldogs: an iconic partnership for the west|url=http://www.vu.edu.au/engage-with-us/community/western-bulldogs|work=Vicroria University website|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sport Schools===
Most State Education Departments have established special sports high schools. These schools offer opportunities for talent sports students to develop sport skills in an environment that balances their sporting and education commitments. [[Westfield Sports High]] in Sydney is an example of a specialist school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Jak|title=New sports school : a marriage of sport and education.|journal=Sport Report|year=1991|volume=11|issue=3|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peak Organisations==
There are a range of peak or umbrella organisations that represent the specific interests and provide advice to governments, sports organisations and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Sports Organisations|url=http://www.ausport.gov.au/information/finding_sport_information/national|work=Australian Sports Commission website|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private Sector==
This sector contributes to sport through facilities, finance and sponsorship. All professional sports competitions and their teams rely heavily on private sponsorship. This sponsorship is provided to national sports organisations and community clubs but at greatly reduced level. Only high profile sports organisations such as [[Australian Football League]], [[Australian Rugby Union]], [[Australian Rugby League Commission]] and [[Football Federation Australia]] have substantial sponsorship income. Many sporting venues have been renamed to include the sponsor's name to increase revenue. Examples include [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]], [[Lang Park|Suncorp Stadium]] and [[Subiaco Oval|Paterson's Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Telstra Dome to become Etihad Stadium.|journal=Australasian Leisure Management|date=Nov–Dec 2008|issue=71|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many professional sporting teams have a private ownership model. This is a growing trend but it has not been without its difficulties.&lt;ref name=roar&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornby-Howell,|first=Nick|title=Private ownership in Australian sport|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/11/20/private-ownership-in-sport/|work=The Roar, 20 November 2012|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Private Parts''''' is the first book written by American radio personality [[Howard Stern]]. Released on October 7, 1993 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], it is the fastest-selling book in the company's history.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Stern|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Bark|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Private Parts (1997 film)|later adapted into a film in 1997]] starring Stern and [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] as themselves.&lt;ref name="Private Parts Film"&gt;{{Harv|Thomas|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early chapters are autobiographical, covering Stern's upbringing and early career, while later chapters are more in the style of a [[memoir]], covering recurring themes from his radio show such as sex, flatulence, and celebrities.

Stern's choices for the title were ''I, Moron'', ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', and ''Penis''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Fink | first= Mitchell | title = The Insider | publisher = People Magazine, Vol. 40 | date= August 30, 1993 | url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106152,00.html | accessdate = January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the last was considered as Stern thought it would lead to the amusing newspaper headline "Howard Stern's ''Penis'' is a bestseller") but were refused by the publisher, although ''Mein Kampf'' would be used as the title of the book's fifth chapter regarding the beginning of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news01/5-7-01.htm |title=For The Week Of 5/7/2001 to 5/11/2001 |accessdate=2009-05-08 |last=Mercer |first=Mark |work=MarksFriggin.com |date=2001-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news07/12-3.htm |title=For the week of 12/03/2007 to 12/07/2007 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |last=Mercer |first=Mark |work=MarksFriggin.com |date=2001-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They then compromised with the title ''Private Parts'', suggested by Stern's co-host [[Robin Quivers]],  which Stern liked as a sexual pun referring to the personal "private parts" of his life with a popular euphemism for genitalia.

The book received mixed reviews from critics, often drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce's ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]''. Like Stern's radio show, it received a great deal of opposition due to its content. It is number 86 on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of the "100 Most Frequently [[list of banned books|challenged books]] Between 1990 and 1999."&lt;ref name="ALA Challenge"&gt;"[http://www.ala.org/bbooks/100-most-frequently-challenged-books-1990–1999 100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999]" American Library Association. Retrieved 8 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A paperback edition was released in September 1994, where [[Pocket Books]], a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, printed a further 2.8 million copies.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5D7133BF932A25753C1A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title= Where Some See Just a Shock Jock, Sirius Sees a Top Pitchman  |accessdate=2009-05-09 |last=Carter |first=Bill |work=The New York Times |date=2004-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1995, Stern published a second book called ''[[Miss America (book)|Miss America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Stern|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular success ==
Upon its release, ''Private Parts'' quickly became the fastest-selling title in publisher Simon &amp; Schuster's history.&lt;ref name="Tops Limbaugh's Mark"&gt;{{Harv|Bark|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sales were supported by Stern's book signing tour of various cities across the United States, with the largest crowd attendances ever.&lt;ref name="Goodman-SternsComplaint"&gt;
{{Harv|Goodman|1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The success was in spite of mixed reviews and the refusal by several stores to carry the book over objections to its content.&lt;ref name='Stores Shy'&gt;
{{Harv|Barron|1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Caldor]] chain of department stores modified the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] which was displayed in stores to remove ''Private Parts'' from the top position, moving all subsequent books up one.&lt;ref name='Stores Shy'/&gt; The inclusion of the book in library lists was also frequently challenged in subsequent years.&lt;ref name="ALA Challenge"/&gt; The book spent five weeks at the top of the non-fiction list from the weeks of October 9 to November 6, 1993 before being displaced by ''See, I Told You So'' by [[Rush Limbaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations | last= New York Times | year= Oct 1993 | year2= Nov 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Private Parts'' spent a total of twenty weeks on the ''NY Times'' Best Seller list, hitting the number one spot after a week of its release.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;

== Upbringing and rise to stardom ==
In the book's opening acknowledgements Stern thanks his co-author [[Larry Sloman|Larry "Ratso" Sloman]] as well as his staff and family. The first chapter is a story of a male listener of Stern's show masturbating while driving on his way to work to an interview of a woman about her first lesbian sexual encounter. Chapters two through six focus on Stern's upbringing and family. Initially Stern focuses on his birth, parents, sister and family through marriage. He then moves out to focus on his upbringing in [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt, Long Island]] where he was one of few white boys in a predominantly black neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="FewWhiteMen"&gt;{{Harv|Stern|1993|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stern also uses this chapter to relay his thoughts on the topics from the time the book was published such as [[Spike Lee]] and his film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', and [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]. The fourth chapter deals with Stern's adolescent sexual development including his earliest sexual experiences. He also details his sex life in college and the courtship of his eventual marriage to his wife Alison.

The fifth and sixth chapters deal with Stern's career in radio from childhood interest through his rise to prominence. Stern cites an early interest in radio from the age of five,&lt;ref name="Always be in radio at 5"&gt;{{Harv|Stern|1993| p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his father's assistance and encouragement in growing his early career. His days in college radio are detailed followed by his earliest jobs at radio stations along the East Coast of the United States. He then details his career at radio stations [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and finally [[WFAN|WNBC]] in [[New York City]]. Stern's conflict with management at various radio stations are relayed, including a rather detailed conflict with WNBC Program Director [[Kevin Metheny]] (whom he refers to as ''Pig Virus'').

== Stern's show and views ==
Chapters seven through eighteen move through a variety of topics beginning with his celebrity interviews. This includes individuals such as Sandi Korn, [[Bob Hope]], [[Jessica Hahn]], [[Richard Simmons]], and [[Sylvester Stallone]] and his family. The book then moves into Stern's views on various groups especially the [[French people|French]], the [[Germans]], [[Filipino people|Filipinos]], and "everybody else".&lt;ref name="I hate everybody"&gt;{{Harv|Stern|1993| p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book then details the [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]] character including the origins, and his appearance on the 1992 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. This is followed up by a listing of various regulars on his show referred to as [[the Wack Pack]]. Celebrities are revisited as Stern details those who irritate him, such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Arsenio Hall]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Stern follows this up by revisiting his various sexual topics with stories of [[stripper]]s, nudity, masturbation, and more lesbian sexual encounters.

Stern then returns to the familiar topic of celebrities, this time detailing feuds he has had with people such as the musical group [[Bon Jovi]], [[Sam Kinison]], [[Magic Johnson]], and a physical altercation with [[Elaine Boosler]] at the [[Grammy Award]]s. Stern revisits homosexuality once again, this detail his musings on gay men. He then goes into comedy as he lists various comedians of the day and gives his opinion, including show regulars Kinison and [[Andrew Dice Clay]]. Lesbianism is revisited for the last time as another lesbian sex story is relayed. The seventeenth chapter details his interviews conducted by staff members [[Gary Dell'Abate]] and [[John Melendez|"Stuttering John" Melendez]]. The last chapter is reserved for Stern's critics and their efforts to have his show prohibited, and his response to them. An afterword is written by two [[Psychology|psychologists]] who analyze Stern's personality and provide their professional opinion of the man.

== Criticism ==
Stern's venture into literature drew much of the same criticism as his radio show. ''Private Parts'' drew favorable comparisons to Lenny Bruce and his book ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]'', but it was also characterized as nothing more than an extension of his radio show with little more to offer. Stern was praised for his [[Populism|populist]] message and attracting a group of people who normally do not read either by choice or for lack of ability. Another frequent criticism was that the material was juvenile, with little more to offer than stories of "breasts, behinds, penises, masturbation, defecation, and the expulsion of gas".&lt;ref name="Goodman-SternsComplaint"/&gt;

=== Comparisons to Lenny Bruce ===
The book frequently drew comparisons to [[Lenny Bruce]]'s 1965 autobiography ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Goodman|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Jefferson|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Saracino|1994}}; {{Harvnb|Gleiberman|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances the comparison was favorable, citing Stern's as the best book by a comedian since Bruce's.&lt;ref name="Santiago-PlainDealer"&gt;{{Harv|Santiago|1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Others felt Stern fell short of the mark, or at least not influencing people as suggested by his ratings in certain [[Media market|radio market]]s.&lt;ref name="Kening"&gt;{{Harv|Kening|1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extension of radio show ===
As the host of a highly rated radio show, the comparison between the book and his radio show was inevitable. The radio show was often the starting point from which the reviewer based their opinion of the book.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Saracino|1994}}; {{Harvnb|Greto|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the praise for the book came in spite of the critic's distaste for the show,&lt;ref name="Goodman-SternsComplaint"/&gt; but often it was used to damn the book as nothing more than a collection of radio show highlights in print, but in more explicit detail.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Kening|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Freeman|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Naudi|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Cobb|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; Critics would sometimes qualify that they could not adequately relay the stories because of their papers' editorial standards.&lt;ref name="Goodman-SternsComplaint"/&gt;

=== Mass appeal ===
With the considerable audience from his radio show, Stern was able to sell the first printing of his book within hours of its release.&lt;ref name="Mills-Gross"&gt;{{Harv|Mills|1993}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This was in spite of a perception of Stern's listeners who were considered to not be given to reading books, or even illiterate.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Macintyre|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Roeper|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; The strong sales were seen as reflection of his populist appeal to a middle-class white male demographic who compose a large part of the fan base of his show.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Macintyre|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Greto|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Gardner|1994}})&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason given for his appeal at the time was as [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] from a push towards what was considered [[political correctness]].&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Goodman|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Jefferson|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Macintyre|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Greto|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juvenile ===
Another frequent observation about the book was that it was juvenile both in its topics and layout. This included being compared to a comic book for its heavy use of pictures and varying fonts.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Goodman|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Jefferson|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Pintarich|1993}})
&lt;/ref&gt; Margo Jefferson of the New York Times enjoyed the way it broke up the book, as this allowed readers to read the passages out of sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Jefferson|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance on stories of body parts, functions, and human sexuality were also cited as a reason for what constituted the entirety of the book, and were not seen as compelling to some readers.&lt;ref&gt;({{Harvnb|Kening|1993}}; {{Harvnb|Naudi|1993}})&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance the review was given by a high school student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Saracino|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Roppongi'''|六本木||literally "six trees"}} is a district of [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan, famous for the affluent [[Roppongi Hills]] development area and popular night club scene. A few foreign [[embassies]] are located near Roppongi, and the [[night life]] is popular with locals and foreigners alike. It is in the central part of Tokyo, south of [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]] and north of [[Azabu]].

==History==
[[File:Roppongi Area from Tokyo Tower.jpg|thumb|View of the Roppongi area]]
The name "Roppongi", which appears to have been coined around 1660, literally means "six trees". Six very old and large [[Zelkova serrata|zelkova]] trees used to mark the area; the first three were cleared, and the last were destroyed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weekender.co.jp/new/030207/roppongi-030207.html |title=''Tokyo Weekender'' – Weekender Archives: Roppongi – A history of our favorite watering hole |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212322/http://www.weekender.co.jp/new/030207/roppongi-030207.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend has it that the name comes from the fact that six ''[[daimyō]]s'' lived nearby during the [[Edo period]], each with the [[kanji]] character for "tree" or a kind of tree in their names. Roppongi was not extensively populated until after the [[Meiji Restoration]], although the area was trafficked for centuries and served as the site of the cremation of Shōgun [[Tokugawa Hidetada]]'s wife in 1626.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;Gary Cooper, [http://www.weekender.co.jp/new/030207/roppongi-030207.html Good ol' six trees—the way it was] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212322/http://www.weekender.co.jp/new/030207/roppongi-030207.html |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Tokyo Weekender''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, the Third Imperial Guard of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] was moved to a site near Roppongi (now home to the Pacific bureau of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''). The influx of soldiers led to the area's rise as a [[nightlife district]], briefly interrupted by the [[Great Kanto earthquake]] which flattened the area in 1923.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt; Roppongi was administratively part of [[Azabu|Azabu Ward]] from 1878 to 1947.

[[File:Akasaka Press Center overview.JPG|thumb|US Army heliport and ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' office in Roppongi-Nanachōme]]
[[File:Apartment complex for US embassy employees Roppongi Tokyo.jpg|thumb|[[Embassy of the United States, Tokyo|US Embassy]] Housing Compound in Roppongi-Nichōme]]
After [[World War II]], during which the area was again destroyed, this time by aerial bombing raids, the [[United States Army]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Occupied Japan|government]] officials occupied several facilities in the area, beginning Roppongi's reputation as a neighborhood with large numbers of [[Gaijin|non-Japanese]]. Several large US military installations were located in the nearby area, with [[Akasaka Press Center|Hardy Barracks]] probably the most significant (the US Embassy Housing Compound and [[Akasaka Press Center]] including Hardy Barracks Recreational Lodging, ''Stars and Stripes'' office and heliport are still there). Surrounding the military installations were many Japanese-owned restaurants, pool halls, bars, and brothels which catered to US military personnel but were also often frequented by Japanese customers.

Starting in the late 1960s, Roppongi became popular among [[Japanese people]] and [[Gaijin|foreigners]] alike for its [[disco]] scene, which attracted many of Tokyo's entertainment elites. Contributing to the international scene was the location of several foreign embassies and foreign corporate offices in the Roppongi area. However, many dance clubs shut down in the [[recession]] following the [[Friday the 13th mini-crash|market crash of 1989]].

The Roppongi area received a major economic boost in 2002–2003 when the [[Izumi Garden Tower]] and the [[Roppongi Hills]] high-rise complexes were completed. These projects brought high-end office and condominium space to Roppongi for the first time. The [[Tokyo Midtown]] project, which was completed in 2006, and includes the first Tokyo [[Ritz-Carlton]] Hotel, continued this trend.

==Nightlife==
The area features numerous bars, nightclubs, strip clubs, restaurants, hostess clubs, [[cabaret]]s, and other forms of entertainment. Among the [[expatriate]] community, the area tends to be favored by business people, students, and off-duty US military personnel. Overall, the neighborhood caters to a younger crowd.

[[File:Roppongi kosaten 0105.jpg|thumb|Roppongi crossing]]
Clubs can range from large, multi-level establishments, to smaller one-room clubs located in upper levels of buildings.
In more recent times some of the larger venues with known [[Yakuza]] connections have closed.
[http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2008/08/24/site-of-notorious-gangster-playpen-in-roppongi-now-vacant/] Around Roppongi crossing are a number of clubs which feature foreign performers. There are also a number of both foreign- and Japanese-operated bars catering to different crowds. Recently, Roppongi has enjoyed a growing reputation for its organized events such as art festivals, dart and billiard tournaments, pub crawls [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/12/31/food/on-a-pub-crawl-every-drink-is-one-for-the-road/#.UsQTjfQW2Sp/], robot exhibitions, beauty pageants, and so on.

Restaurants in Roppongi vary from upscale Japanese fare to popular international restaurants.

==Controversies==
In the past, Roppongi had a reputation as an area with high [[Yakuza]] presence, whether as customers at Roppongi establishments, conducting business, or managing or owning clubs and bars in the area. Although still exerting some influence in Roppongi, in recent times they appear to have shifted much of their presence to other districts in the Tokyo area.&lt;ref name="whiting"&gt;Robert Whiting, ''Tokyo Underworld : The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japan'' (Vintage Departures, 2000) {{ISBN|0-375-72489-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/624/feature.asp Feature: Dark Matter]," ''Metropolis'', March 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Nigeria]]n immigrants to Japan began opening a number of bars and nightclubs in the area, following an earlier group of innovators who had been in business in Roppongi for many years.  The Nigerians were noted for using visible, high-pressure tactics to draw customers to their bars. In 2009 and 2010 a series of drink-spiking incidents, in which customers reported being drugged and robbed, were linked to Nigerian-owned bars.  The incidents resulted in the United States embassy in Japan warning US citizens to avoid certain bars and clubs in Roppongi.  An investigation by ''[[The Japan Times]]'' in July 2011 found that though drink spiking occurred, most of the incidents did not involve criminal activity. Many customers claimed unusually severe hangovers after nights spent in Nigerian-run establishments. Similar complaints are often made about non-Nigerian bars in Roppongi that offer unlimited drink packages and often lace drinks with hard liquor to minimize customer consumption and increase profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trying to tame Tokyo's adult playground|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/26/world/la-fg-japan-roppongi26-2010jan26|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Dreux, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110719zg.html Japan's Nigerians pay price for prosperity]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 19 July 2011, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Dreux, "[http://metropolis.co.jp/features/feature/something-my-spirit-wanted/ 'Something My Spirit Wanted']", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', #905, 29 July - 11 August 2011, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rune Klan''',(born 15 October 1976 in [[Silkeborg]]) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[comedian]] and [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]]. He has released an instructional video for magicians called ''Three Pieces of Silver''. Klan has lived in the [[Middle East]] and in [[Canada]] and has toured in the U.S. where he has taught other magicians. In 2008 he was awarded the Tribini Prize by [[Dyrehavsbakken|Bakken]], for "his extraordinary ability to combine stand-up comedy with magic (...) and has managed to renew traditional entertainment, and also being able to convey it to the younger generation"

Rune Klan and [[Mick Øgendahl]], have together made the show ''Tak for i aften'' and ''Tak for i aften on Tour''.

Rune Klan had a show called ''Hokus Fucking Pokus'', which was broadcast on Danish TV, on Channel 5 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rune Klans Trylleshow til efteråret|url=http://tvtid.tv2.dk/nytomtv/article.php/id-23835215.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Joshua Jay]] wrote ''Rune's World'', published by Vanishing Inc. Magic in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rune's World|url=http://www.vanishingincmagic.com/magic/money-magic/runes-world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rune has toured Denmark with "Det Røde Show", "Rune Klan Går Large", "Det Blå Show" and "Det Stribede Show". All of which displayed his unique combination of magic and stand-up comedy.

==Trilogies ==
Rune Klan's 3 first one-man shows: "Rune Klan l tre-i-en", "Rune Klan Går Large" and "Det Blå Show" each have three different colour themes. Red, green and blue. These three publications together form a trilogy that deals with [[RGB colours]].

"[[Det Stribede Show]]' is the latest of Rune's new trilogy. "[[Det Stribede Show]]" was a national success and was released on DVD in 2014. The show featured a new live musical element by the South African musician "[[Daniel Rosenfeldt]]" to compliment Rune's magic.

Based on previous statements from Rune in various [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abmKfgWbQmg interviews] in 2013, in connection with [[The Stribede Show]] Rune mentions that this show is the start of a new trilogy, where the following 2 shows, respectively, will be called "[[Polka Dot Show]]" and "[[The Checkered Show]]"

'''Ruski Car''' or '''Russian Tsar''' ({{lang-sr|Руски цар}}) is a commercial-residential building and a restaurant in downtown [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]]. It is located in [[Knez Mihailova Street]], a pedestrian zone and a commercial hub of the city. One of the most luxurious restaurants in the city at the time, it was described as a place where "people come to be seen".&lt;ref name=Politika&gt;{{Citation | author = Nikola Belić, Daliborka Mučibabić| title = "Ruski car" menja ime u "Vapijano" | newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 13 May 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/218606/Ruski-car-menja-ime-u-Vapijano }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, finished in 1926, was declared a [[cultural monument]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/kafana_ruski_car.html Zavod za zaštitu spomenika kulture grada Beograda]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

The building is located on the corner of 7 Knez Mihailova (the official address) and 29 [[Obilićev Venac]] Streets. It is situated in the western extension of the [[Republic Square, Belgrade|Republic Square]], across the Cultural Center of Belgrade and in the vicinity of Hotel Majestic, with the [[National Theater in Belgrade]] being right across the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beograd - plan i vodič |date=1999 |publisher=Geokarta |isbn=86-459-0006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beograd - plan grada|date=2006|publisher=M@gic M@p|isbn=86-83501-53-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The original restaurant was opened in 1890. Almost immediately it became the gathering place for the city elite and the distinguished guests from abroad. The esteemed venue was described as a place where "people come to be seen". It was named Ruski Car ("Russian Tsar") after [[Alexander II of Russia]], who was assassinated in 1881.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

=== Interbellum ===
 
The present building was constructed between 1922 and 1926 after the design of the architect [[Petar Popović (architect)|Petar Popović]], and with the assistance of the architect [[Dragiša Brašovan]] in the development of the project. The construction works were done by Milan Sekulić and his company "Arhitekt".&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;&lt;ref name=spomenik&gt;[http://spomenicikulture.mi.sanu.ac.rs/spomenik.php?id=585 Cultural monuments in Serbia - [[Kafana]] "Ruski Car"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the building has not significantly changed since the erection: the residential area is on the upper floors, the business space in the mezzanine and the restaurant on the ground floor and in the basement. The name of the old, ground floor venue of "Ruski Car", which was demolished to make room for the new building, was kept. During the [[Interbellum]], it was an elegant Belgrade restaurant, the meeting place for both noble citizens and the intellectual elite of that time. The meetings of Serbian engineers and architects were held in the Ruski Car both before and after the [[World War I]]. Distinguished regular guests in this period included [[Veljko Petrović (poet)|Veljko Petrović]], [[Branislav Nušić]] and {{ill|Mihajlo Petrov|sr}}.&lt;ref name=spomenik/&gt;

=== After 1945 ===

The new Communist authorities after the [[World War II]] confiscated the building and nationalized it in 1960. That year, the first Belgrade's "express restaurant", a self-serving buffet restaurant with cooked meals, was open in the building. The name of the tavern was changed to "Zagreb", the original luxurious interior was demolished and the expensive cutlery was replaced with the plastic plates.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

The city owned company "Stari Grad" managed the restaurant. In the 1990s it leased it to the Serbian-Australian Jack Samardžija, who restored the venue to resemble the pre-1960 look and renamed it back to Ruski Car.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

=== 21st century ===

In 1998 the leaseholder became Snežana Bulić, wife of a criminal {{ill|Jusuf Bulić|sr}}, who was killed that same year. "Stari Grad" was privatized by the "Midlend" company, but "Ruski Car" was excluded from the agreement and was separately sold by "Stari Grad" directly to Snežana Bulić in 2002 and the ownership later shifted to her son, Dragan Aca Bulić. Zoran Antonijević, whose father and other relatives constructed the building and were the owners since 1934, applied for the edifice to be returned to him when the process of the restitution of the confiscated properties began in Serbia. After the venue was sold, he filed a suite against "Stari Grad" and its successor. State Directory for properties issued a statement saying that the restitution law didn't exist at the time and that the property could be sold.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt;

In May 2012, Bulić leased the restaurant to the German [[Vapiano]] restaurant chain for 10 years. Vapiano reshuffled the venue, reopened it in June and changed its name.&lt;ref name=Politika/&gt; The public protested, asking that city, if nothing else, marks the façade with the name "Ruski Car", regardless of how the name of the restaurant may be changed, but city didn't do it. In August 2013, the court ruled, within the process for the tax evasion by Bulić, that the property was acquired by the criminal activities and ordered for the restaurant to be taken away from Bulić and placed under the administration of the Directory for the seized property. From that point, Vapiano stopped paying the rent and in April 2014 the Directory temporarily closed the restaurant. After reaching an agreement with Vapiano, the venue was reopen after a month and a half. In December 2014, after Bulić's appeal, the court returned the restaurant to him, until the final judgment is ruled. During these processes, some business data surfaced into the public. It turned out that Vapiano was paying €40,000 per moth, which is stupendously high for Belgrade. Vapiano claimed that the rate would become gradually lower, after reaching a total of €750,000. Due to the all data presented, including other unlikely sums like Vapiano's claim that in April-May 2014 they lost €200,000 due to the temporary closing or that they invested €1,2 million in adaptation of the restaurant, reporters discussed the possibility that the entire business is a money laundering scheme. In August 2014 Antonijević died, but his descendants continued the restitution process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.blic.rs/vesti/beograd/zatvoren-restoran-vapijano-zbog-duga-za-zakup/cc6q033 |author= M.Nikolić |title= =Zatvoren restoran "Vapijano" zbog duga za zakup |date= 23 April 2014 | publisher= [[Blic]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2014&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=941869 |title= Aci Buliću vraćen bivši "Ruski car” |date= 29 December 2014| publisher= [[B92]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Nikola Belić | title = Ključevi "Ruskog cara" u ugovoru "Vapijana" sa Acom Bulićem| newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 26 April 2014 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/291129/Beograd/Kljucevi-Ruskog-cara-u-ugovoru-Vapijana-sa-Acom-Bulicem }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Nikola Belić | title = Država vratila bivši „Ruski car” Draganu Aci Buliću | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 29 December 2014 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/314746/Drzava-vratila-bivsi-Ruski-car-Draganu-Aci-Bulicu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=car&gt;{{Citation | author = Daliborka Mučibabić, Radojka Ćoralić | title = „Vapijano” napustio "Ruskog cara" | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 16 January 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/347280/Vapijano-napustio-Ruskog-cara }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vapiano left the premises in January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.turistickisvet.com/vesti/restoraterstvo/-vapiano--se-iselio-iz--ruskog-cara-.html |title= "Vapiano" se iselio iz "Ruskog cara" |date= 15 January 2016| publisher= Turistički svet |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by this time the state quit prosecuting Bulić for tax evasion so he remained the owner. The Antonijević family is still legally fighting for the building. There are several other examples in the Knez Mihailova and Obilićev Venac streets where nationalized property was sold in the late 1990s by the, so called, "Šešelj law", but the courts later annulled the contracts and returned the properties to the pre-war owners.&lt;ref name=car/&gt;

In October 2016 news appeared claiming that the first Belgrade's [[Hard Rock Café]] will be open in the building of Ruski Car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mondo.rs/a950990/Info/Drustvo/Ruski-car-Hard-Rock-Cafe-Umesto-Ruskog-cara-Hard-Rock-cafe.html |title= Hard Rock Cafe umesto "Ruskog cara" |date= 26 October 2016| publisher= Mondo.rs |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/srbija.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_id=1192148 |title= Čuveni Hard rok kafe stiže na mesto Ruskog cara |date= 25 October 2016| publisher= B92 |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2017, the venue is still closed.

== Architecture ==

As a whole, the building has characteristics of [[academism|academic]] [[mannerism]] and represents a typical large building erected in the city center in order to be rented. The decorations bear elements of [[Baroque Revival architecture|neo-baroque]] in the design of the corner dome, whereas the corpus of the building is much closer to the academic variant of [[Art Nouveau]], specifically the [[Vienna Secession|secession]].&lt;ref name=spomenik/&gt;

== Protection ==

The tavern is situated within the Knez Mihailova [[Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Exceptional Importance]], which was declared in 1979, by "The Official Gazette of the Socialist Republic of Serbia", No. 14/79.

The building itself was declared a cultural monument by the city's decision, announced in the "Official Gazette of the City of Belgrade", No. 16/87, from 10 July 1987.&lt;ref name=spomenik/&gt;

'''Silas Field Leachman''' (20 August 1859 &amp;ndash; 28 April 1936) was an [[United States|American]] pioneer recording artist, possibly the first person to make recordings in [[Chicago]] and known for making hundreds of thousands of [[phonograph]] [[cylinder recording]]s in the 1890s.

[[File:Silas Leachman.jpg|thumb|Silas Leachman, ca. 1895, from Chicago Talking Machine Company ad]]

He was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and worked on the [[railroad]] before marrying and moving to Chicago in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=1880usfedcen&amp;h=10689429&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record%3aOtherRecord&amp;rhSource=7602  1880 US Census, Louisville, Kentucky]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=1900usfedcen&amp;h=11207555&amp;indiv=try&amp;o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&amp;rhSource=7884  1900 US Census, Chicago, Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt;  He began recording for the [[North American Phonograph Company|North American Phonograph Company's]] Chicago branch around 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1893|title=The Famous Record Maker of Chicago|url=https://archive.org/stream/Phonogram3_2/Phonogram%203_2#page/n25/mode/1up|journal=Phonogram|volume=Vol. 3, No. 2|pages=331|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then recorded prolifically for the [[Chicago Talking Machine Company]] in the later 1890s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Jim|date=July 1955|title=Silas F.

He later recorded for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and, after 1901, [[Victor Records|Victor]].&lt;ref name=loc&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/169/  Library of Congress: Silas Leachman]. Retrieved 26 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a report first published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1895, he recorded in a wide range of styles, often under assumed names, and by that time claimed to have personally produced almost 250,000 cylinders.  The report sets out in detail Leachman's work, at the very start of the recording industry:&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news |title= Sings for Phonograph: A Chicago Man with a Voice Makes $50 a Day Preparing Cylinders |author= |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNNBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eLgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5981,1399159&amp;dq=silas+leachman&amp;hl=en|newspaper= Baltimore American|date= May 12, 1895|page=14|accessdate=30 July 2012}} This is a reprint of an article originally published in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Away out in the extreme northwestern part of the city, near the Milwaukee Railroad tracks, Silas Leachman puts in four or five hours every day singing at the top of his lungs, though not a soul is in hearing but his wife.  When he gets tired of singing, he varies the proceedings by preaching a negro sermon, or gives an imitation of an Irish wake, and altogether conducts himself in a way that would lead the neighbors to consider him a fit subject for a lunatic asylum &amp;mdash; if there were any neighbors, but there are not.&lt;br /&gt;This is the very reason Mr. Leachman chose the lonely spot for his residence.  No one ever goes out there to hear him sing, and yet he is getting rich at it.  He earns something over $50 every day, though he never sees one of his auditors. Mr. Leachman sings for phonographs, and, as he has a monopoly of the business in the West, he contrives to keep busy, and has even been heard to express a wish that he were twins. He has better protection in his monopoly than a copyright or an injunction, or unlimited legal talent could afford. Nature gave him the peculiar qualities that enable him to reproduce his voice perfectly on the wax cylinders.  Hundreds of persons have attempted to break in on his profitable monopoly, but the results of their efforts put an effectual stop to their attempts. And so Mr. Leachman goes on enjoying the monopoly and reaping the profits thereof.&lt;br /&gt;There are four other men in the East that also do work for the phonograph; but while they have to have a man to play the piano while they sing, another to make the announcement, another to change the cylinders, and a fourth to keep the machines in order, Mr. Leachman is the entire show in himself.  Furthermore, he can give an unlimited number of impersonations, while the other four men are limited to a few specialties each.  Mr. Leachman is a natural mimic, and therein lies the secret of his success.  He sings ballads, negro melodies, and Irish, Chinese and Dutch dialect songs.  He plays his own accompaniment on the piano and takes care of the machines.  He prepares three "records", as the wax cylinders are called, at one time.&lt;br /&gt;To do this three phonographs are placed near the piano, with the horns at one side pointing away from the keyboard at an angle of forty-five degrees.  The horns have to be placed very carefully, for a fifth of an inch makes a great difference in the tone the cylinders will reproduce.  When the horns have been adjusted exactly right, Mr. Leachman seats himself at the piano, and, turning his head away over his right shoulder, begins to sing as loud as he can, and that is pretty loud, for he is a man of powerful physique, and has been practicing loud singing for four years.  He has been doing this work until his throat has become calloused so that he no longer becomes exhausted after singing a short time.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as he has finished one song, he slips off the wax cylinders, puts on three fresh ones without leaving his seat, and goes right on singing until a passing train compels him to stop for a short time. In the four years he has been in the business he has made nearly 250,000 records.  So great is the demand for them that he cannot fill his orders.  It is such exceedingly hard work that he cannot sing more than four hours a day.  He gets thirty-five cents for every cylinder that he prepares.  He has a repertoire of four hundred and twenty pieces, and his work is put on the market under a score of names.  He has a remarkable memory, and, after once hearing a song, cannot only repeat the words and music correctly, but can imitate excellently the voice and expression of the singer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[baritone]], he became best known for "[[coon songs]]"&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; - stereotypical portrayals of African American life - although little regard was paid to the quality of the performances themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fYXYrAqAdv4C&amp;dq=%22silas+leachman%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Elijah Wald, ''How the Beatles Destroyed Rock n Roll:An Alternative History of American Popular Music'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p.87]&lt;/ref&gt; His popular recordings included "[[Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow]]" (1892), "Dem Golden Slippers" (1894), "I Guess I'll Have To Telegraph My Baby" (1899), and "[[Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home?]]" (1902).&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 269| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2013}}
A '''talk show'''  or '''chat show''' is a [[television programming]] or [[radio program]]ming genre in which one person (or group of people) discusses various topics put forth by a [[List of talk show hosts|talk show host]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|last=Stelter |first=Brian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/business/media/01cooper.html |title=Anderson Cooper to Host Daytime Talk Show  |publisher=[[NYTimes.com]] |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, guests consist of a group of people who are learned or who have great experience in relation to whatever issue is being discussed on the show for that episode. Other times, a single guest discusses their work or area of expertise with a host or co-hosts. A '''call-in show''' takes live phone calls from callers listening at home, in their cars, etc. Sometimes, guests are already seated but are often introduced and enter from backstage. There have been [[List of talk show hosts|many notable talk show hosts]]; in many cases, the shows have made their hosts famous.

==Subgenres==
There are several major formats of talk shows. Generally, each subgenre predominates during a specific programming block during the broadcast day.

* [[Breakfast television|Breakfast chat or early morning shows]] that generally alternate between news summaries, political coverage, feature stories, celebrity interviews, and musical performances.
* Late morning chat shows that feature two or more hosts or a celebrity panel, and focus on entertainment and lifestyle features.
* Daytime [[tabloid talk show]]s, generally featuring a host, a guest or a panel of guests, and a live audience that interacts extensively with the host and guests. These shows may feature celebrities, political commentators, or "ordinary" people who present unusual or controversial topics.
* "Lifestyle" or self-help programs, which generally feature a host or hosts who are medical practitioners, therapists, or counselors, and guests who seek intervention, describe medical or psychological problems, or offer advice.
* Evening panel discussion shows which focus on news, politics, or popular culture.
* [[Late-night talk show]]s that feature celebrity guests who talk about their work and personal lives as well as their latest films, TV shows, music recordings, or other projects they'd like to promote to the public. The hosts are often comedians who open the shows with comedy monologues.
* [[Sunday morning talk show]]s are a staple of network programming in North America. These shows feature elected political figures and candidates for office, commentators, and journalists.
* [[Aftershow]]s which feature in-depth discussion about a program on the same network that aired just before (for example, ''[[Talking Dead]]'').
* [[Parody|Spoof]] talk shows, such as ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Nite Live]]'', ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', and ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', where the interviews are mostly scripted, and shown in a humorous and satirical way, or the show engages in subverting the norms of the format.

These formats are not absolute. Syndicated "daytime" shows may appear overnight in some markets, and some afternoon programs have similar structures to late night talk shows.

These formats may vary across different countries or markets. Late night talk shows are especially significant in the [[United States]]. Breakfast television is a staple of [[British television]]. The daytime talk format has become popular in [[Latin America]] as well as the United States.

Talk-radio host [[Howard Stern]] also hosted a talk show that was syndicated nationally in the USA, then moved to satellite radio's [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]]. The [[tabloid talk show]] genre, pioneered by [[Phil Donahue]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/business/msnbc-cancels-the-phil-donahue-talk-show.html?ref=phildonahue |title=MSNBC Cancels the Phil Donahue Talk Show&amp;nbsp;— New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=February 26, 2003 |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |first=Bill |last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt; but popularized by [[Oprah Winfrey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tannen |first=Deborah |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/opinion/29tannen.html?_r=1&amp;ref=phildonahue |title=Op-Ed Contributor&amp;nbsp;— Donahue Talked, Oprah Listened |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was extremely popular during the last two decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/05/arts/stern-reportedly-rules-out-late-night-tv-talk-show.html |title=Stern Reportedly Rules Out Late-Night TV Talk Show&amp;nbsp;— New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=January 5, 1994 |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |first=Bill |last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics are hardly the only subject of American talk shows, however. Other radio talk show subjects include ''Car Talk'' hosted by [[NPR]] and ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' hosted by [[Art Bell]] and [[George Noory]] which discusses topics of the [[paranormal]], [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], [[fringe science]], and the just plain weird. Sports talk shows are also very popular ranging from high-budget shows like ''[[The Best Damn Sports Show Period]]'' to [[Max Kellerman]]'s original [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show ''Max on Boxing''.

==History==
Talk shows have been broadcast on [[television]] since the earliest days of the medium. [[Joe Franklin]], an [[United States|American]] radio and television personality, hosted the first television talk show. The show began in 1951 on WJZ-TV (later [[WABC-TV]]) and moved to WOR-TV (later [[WWOR-TV]]) from 1962 to 1993.&lt;ref name=Hinckley&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Hinckley |title=Joe Franklin: Truth in Packaging |work=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1999/11/26/1999-11-26_joe_franklin_truth_in_packag.html |date=November 26, 1999 |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703060057/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1999/11/26/1999-11-26_joe_franklin_truth_in_packag.html |archivedate=July 3, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' is the world's longest-running talk show; having debuted in 1954, it continues to this day. The show underwent some minor title changes until settling on its current title in 1962, and despite a brief foray into a more news-style program in 1957 and then reverting that same year, it has remained a talk show. Ireland's ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' is the second-longest running talk show in television history, and the longest running talk show in Europe, having debuted in 1962.

[[Steve Allen]] was the first host of ''The Tonight Show'', which began as a local New York show, being picked up by the NBC network in 1954. It in turn had evolved from his late-night radio talk show in Los Angeles.  Allen pioneered the format of late night network TV talk shows, originating such talk show staples as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music, although the series' popularity was cemented by second host [[Jack Paar]], who took over after Allen had left and the show had ceased to exist.
[[File:Paar and cavett 1973.JPG|thumb|right|[[Dick Cavett]] and [[Jack Paar]]]]

TV news pioneer [[Edward R. Murrow]] hosted a talk show entitled ''Small World'' in the late 1950s and since then, political TV talk shows have predominantly aired on [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday mornings]].

Syndicated daily talk shows began to gain more popularity during the mid-1970s and reached their height of popularity with the rise of the [[tabloid talk show]]. Morning talk shows gradually replaced earlier forms of programming&amp;nbsp;— there were a plethora of morning [[game show]]s during the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, and some stations formerly showed a morning movie in the time slot that many talk shows now occupy.

Current late night talk shows such as ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]], [[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' have aired featuring celebrity guests and comedy sketches. Syndicated daily talk shows range from [[tabloid talk show]]s, such as ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'' and ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'' to celebrity interview shows like ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'', ''[[Better (TV series)|The Better Show]]'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show|Ellen]]'' to industry leader ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' which popularized the former genre and has been evolving towards the latter. On November 10, 2010, Oprah Winfrey invited several of the most prominent American talk show hosts - [[Phil Donahue]], [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Ricki Lake]], and [[Montel Williams]] - to join her as guests on her show. The 1990s in particular saw a spike in the number of "tabloid" talk shows, most of which were short-lived and are now replaced by a more universally appealing "interview" or "lifestyle TV" format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Talk-Show-Hosts-Together-for-the-First-Time_1 |title=Donahue, Sally Jessy, Geraldo, Montel, Ricki: Talk Show Hosts—Where Are They Now? |publisher=Oprah.com |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talk shows have more recently started to appear on Internet radio.  Also, several Internet [[blogs]] are in talk show format including the Baugh Experience.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The current world record for the longest talk show is held by [[Rabi Lamichhane]] from Nepal by staying on air
for 62 hours from April 11 to 13, 2013 breaking the previous record set by two Ukrainians by airing the show for 52 hours in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22140317 | work=BBC News | title=Nepali hosts longest-ever talk show | date=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Talk shows around the world==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Guinessworldrecordfortalkshow.jpeg]] --&gt;
[[Rabi Lamichhane]] from [[Nepal]] holds the present world record for longest ever talk show.

In [[Japan]], panel shows&amp;nbsp;— called "tooku bangumi" (トーク番組）in Japanese&amp;nbsp;— are very commonplace, accounting for about 30% of daytime and prime-time programming on the four main television stations. Due to language and cultural differences, Japanese TV stations could not freely use syndicated programs (mostly from Europe and North America) and therefore turned to [[panel game|panel shows]], which could be produced cheaply and easily, to fill time during daytime programming.

Japanese panel shows are distinct in generally not employing regular panelists but instead having a panel made up of different freelance comedians and celebrities each program, although the program is generally hosted by the same [[compere (host)|compere]]. Talk shows evolved in tandem with the [[Japanese variety show]] and it is very common for talk shows to borrow variety elements, typically by having celebrity guests attempt some kind of amusingly incongruous activity. Often, one of the guests will be a [[gaijin tarento]] (foreign talent) in order to provide comedy or to comment on matters related to Western culture. Comedic material is commonly written and rehearsed before tapings with or [[laugh track|without a live audience]].

Korean and Taiwanese talk shows have used the panel format similar to Japanese programs and rely on famous celebrities and comedic banter than topics. Their programs often shorten interviews from lengthy tapings.

In [[Brazil]], [[Jô Soares]] inaugurated the genre with Jô Soares Onze e Meia ("Jô Soares Eleven Thirty") from 1988 to 1999. In 2000, Soares took his show's format to Rede Globo, where it was then called [[Programa do Jô]], and hosts the program until the present day. Jô's main competitors are [[Danilo Gentili]] and [[Fábio Porchat]].

'''The Criterion Collection, Inc.''' (or simply '''Criterion''') is an American [[home video]] distribution company which focuses on licensing "important classic and contemporary films" and selling them to [[Cinephilia|film aficionados]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/about_us|title=Criterion Mission Statement|accessdate=March 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criterion is noted for helping to standardize a number of new ideas, such as the [[letterbox]] format for widescreen films, adding bonus features, commentary tracks, doing film restoration, and releasing special editions for home video.

==History==
The Criterion Collection company was founded in 1984 by [[Robert Stein (computer pioneer)|Robert Stein]], Aleen Stein, and [[Joe Medjuck]], who later were joined by [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]]. In 1985, the Steins, William Becker, and Jonathan B.

In March 1994, [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck GmbH]] bought 20 percent of Voyager for US$6.7 million; the 4 founders each retained a 20 percent owner’s share.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

In 1997, the Voyager Company was dissolved (Aleen Stein founded the Organa LLC CD-ROM publishing company), and [[Holtzbrinck]] Publishers sold the “Voyager” brand name, 42 CD-ROM titles, the Voyager web site, and associated assets, to Learn Technologies Interactive, LLC (LTI).&lt;ref name="Organa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aleen Stein|url=http://www.organa.com/aleen.html|publisher=Organa Online|accessdate=August 17, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809092621/http://www.organa.com/aleen.html|archive-date=August 9, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Stein sold 42 Voyager titles to LTI from his Voyager–Criterion company share. The remaining 3 partners, Aleen Stein, William Becker (President) and Jonathan Turell (CEO) owned the Criterion Collection company,&lt;ref name="Organa"/&gt; which has a business partnership with [[Janus Films]], and had one with Home Vision Entertainment (HVE) until 2005, when Image Entertainment bought HVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|work=About Home Vision|url=http://www.homevision.com/history.php|publisher=Home Vision Entertainment|accessdate=August 17, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020627202911/http://www.homevision.com/history.php|archivedate=June 27, 2002|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 4, 2013, it was announced that [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] will now handle distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/sony-pictures/sony-inks-distribution-admin-deal-criterion-31792|title=Sony Inks Distribution, Admin Deal With Criterion|publisher=|access-date=March 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402181912/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/sony-pictures/sony-inks-distribution-admin-deal-criterion-31792|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home Vision Entertainment===
In 1986, [[Charles Benton]] founded Home Vision Entertainment (HVE), the home-video division of Public Media Inc. (PMI), which he had previously founded in 1968. The HVE company sold, advertised, marketed, and distributed Criterion Collection DVDs, and also sold its own HVE brand of DVDs (co-produced with Criterion), including [[Merchant Ivory Productions|The Merchant Ivory Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hasan|first=Mark Richard|title=DVD Review|url= http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/dvd.asp?ID=9|publisher=Music From the Movies|date=September 2004|accessdate=August 22, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608062030/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/dvd.asp?ID=9 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Classic Collection, a joint venture between Home Vision Entertainment and Janus Films. The latter enterprise published HVE imprint films, for which Janus Films owned the video rights, but which were unavailable from the Criterion Collection; however, Criterion published the Classic Collection films. In 2005, [[Image Entertainment]] bought HVE, thus it became the exclusive distributor of Criterion Collection products until 2013.

===Online ventures and marketing===
The Criterion Collection began to provide [[video-on-demand]] (VOD) in partnership with ''[[Mubi (website)|MUBI]]'' (formerly ''The Auteurs'') in 2008. In February 2011, Criterion began switching its VOD offerings exclusively to [[Hulu Plus]].&lt;ref name="NetflixHuluNYT"&gt;{{cite news |title= As Netflix Goes After TV Fans, Hulu Chases Movie Buffs |first= Ryan |last= Lawler |url= https://www.nytimes.com/external/gigaom/2011/02/15/15gigaom-as-netflix-goes-after-tv-fans-hulu-chases-movie-b-79625.html?ref=technology |newspaper= The New York Times |publisher= The New York Times Company |location= New York |issn= 0362-4331 |oclc= 1645522 |date= February 15, 2011 |accessdate=March 30, 2011 |quote= "Hulu is looking to court movie buffs to its subscription Plus offering, announcing Tuesday that it has acquired streaming rights for hundreds of classic films from The Criterion Collection.

On October 26th, 2018, Warner Bros. Digital Networks and Turner announced that FilmStruck would be shutting down on November 29th due to a lack of subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/filmstruck-shutdown-warnermedia-turner-1202998364/|title=WarnerMedia to Shut Down FilmStruck Subscription-Streaming Service|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Todd|last=Spangler|date=October 26, 2018|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criterion stated in a blog post that in wake of this, they were currently "trying to find ways we can bring our library and original content back to the digital space as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=News About FilmStruck |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6008-news-about-filmstruck |website=The Criterion Collection |accessdate=26 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16th, 2018, Criterion announced that they would be launching The Criterion Channel as a standalone service in Spring 2019 in partnership with [[WarnerMedia]] (the previous owners of FilmStruck). They also announced that the service will also be available through WarnerMedia's upcoming steaming platform when it launches in Q4 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New, Independent Criterion Channel to Launch Spring 2019 |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/6044-new-independent-criterion-channel-to-launch-spring-2019 |website=The Criterion Collection |accessdate=16 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criterion also maintains a [[YouTube]] channel with which it markets its films. One notable feature is the "Three Reasons" playlist it has produced in which the company overlays in a few words or phrases three reasons, presumably, why the film is worth watching or has made it into the Criterion catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA90CFF58FCFD7A66&amp;feature=plcp|title=Three Reasons|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, other users in YouTube have used the "Three Reasons" format to promote their own nominations.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2DhhAWFdeA Three Reason: Punishment Park]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ9g51YvEfA&amp;feature=related Three Reason: The Devils]''&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|7}}, no new "Three Reasons" video has been released by Criterion since June 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=criterioncollection Videos|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/criterioncollection/videos|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2016, British film magazine ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' revealed in their April 2016 issue that Criterion would be expanding its releases to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Webmaster|title=Criterion to Begin Releasing on Blu-ray in the UK|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=18621|accessdate=6 March 2016|work=Blu-ray.com|publisher=Blu-ray.com|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=Ryan|title=The Criterion Collection is expanding to the UK on April 18|url=http://criterioncast.com/news/the-criterion-collection-is-expanding-to-the-uk-on-april-18th|accessdate=6 March 2016|work=CriterionCast|publisher=CriterionCast LLC|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first six titles were released on April 18, 2016.

==Contributions and influence==
Commercially, the Criterion Collection video company pioneered the correct aspect ratio [[letterbox]]ing presentation of movies, as well as commentary soundtracks, multi-disc sets, special editions, and definitive versions. These ideas and the special features introduced by the Criterion Collection have been highly influential, and have become de facto industry-wide standards for premium home video releases.

===Letterboxing===
With its eighth laserdisc release, ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', Criterion introduced the [[letterbox]] format, which added black bars to the top and bottom of the [[4:3]] standard television set in order to preserve the original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Criterion Collection|title=Invasion of the Body Snatchers|url=http://chaumurky.net/criterion/catalogpage-135.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040905170637/http://chaumurky.net/criterion/catalogpage-135.html|archivedate=September 5, 2004|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Criterion made letterboxing the standard presentation for all its releases of films shot in widescreen aspect ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Criterion Collection|title=FAQ|url=http://www.criterion.com/help#q5|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary soundtracks===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2018}}
The Criterion Collection's second catalog title, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), was the debut of the scene-specific [[audio commentary]] contained in a separate analog channel of the laserdisc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-party.com/mp/2011/01/the-first-audio-commentary.html|title=The First Audio Commentary|website=Media Party|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured US film historian [[Ronald Haver]] reporting about the production, cast, screenplay, production design and special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O10Iy8JH8z4C&amp;pg=PA110|title=The DVD Revolution: Movies, Culture, and Technology|last=Barlow|first=Aaron|date=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275983871|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also is the commentator for the ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' (1941), ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) laserdiscs. Typically, the chapter-indexed commentaries are exclusive to the Criterion releases and their initial DVD reissues; they became collector’s items when the original-owner studios re-issued titles previously licensed to Criterion (with newly produced commentary tracks or not).

===Special editions===
The Criterion Collection began in 1984 with the releases of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) and ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) on laserdisc, the latter's source negatives courtesy of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyIklbmfRJw|title=Entertainment Tonight: Criterion LaserDiscs - 1985|date=January 11, 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later became notable for pioneering the “special edition” DVD concept, containing bonus materials ([[Trailer (film)|trailers]], commentaries, documentaries, alternate endings, deleted scenes, et cetera), "a film school in a box", as it were,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|authorlink=Neda Ulaby|title=Criterion DVD Collection|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1956135|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|date=June 2004| accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the success of which established the special edition version in the DVD business. In 2006, taking advantage of better film-transfer and film-restoration technologies, Criterion published improved-image versions, with bonus materials, of early catalog titles such as ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), and ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954).

===Film restoration===
Originally, the Criterion company released art, genre, and mainstream movies on laserdisc such as ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992), ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996). Increasingly, the Criterion Collection has also focused on releasing [[world cinema]], mainstream cinema classics, and critically successful obscure movies. Using the best available source materials, the company produced technologically improved and cleaner versions. For example, ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' (1928), ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931),  ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (1945), ''[[The Third Man]]'' (1949), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973) discs contain film-cleaning and film-restoration demonstrations, comparing the restored and un-restored images.

===Licenses===
Some previously licensed Criterion Collection titles, such as ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' (1972), are now commercially unavailable as new product, and are only available in resale (used) form. Titles such as ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' (1992), ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' (1989), and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985), became unavailable when their publishing licenses expired, or when Criterion published improved versions, such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1946), ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (1931), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), and ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'' (1954). As of September 2018, 188 of the 954 titles (19 percent) from the [[List of Criterion Collection Laserdisc releases]] have been re-released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/charade.htm |title= |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=dvdbeaver.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the film ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963), which had become a [[public domain|public-domain]] property for lacking the legally required [[copyright]] notice. The Criterion company produced a digitally cleaned edition under license from [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for the initial edition, and for the later [[anamorphic widescreen]] re-release edition of the film.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Periodically, Criterion does release material on DVD/Blu-ray licensed from the studios they previously dealt with, for example Sony, Fox, MGM/UA, Disney, and Universal; these new releases are generally done on a case-by-case basis.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

[[File:Criterion logo.jpg|thumb|right|112px|The original "Criterion" logo]]
The Criterion Collection began publishing [[laserdiscs]] on December 1, 1984 with its release of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. In 1998, Criterion began publishing DVDs as well. On March 16, 1999, Criterion issued its final laserdisc release, [[Michael Bay]]'s ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criterion Collection Laserdiscs|url=http://www.laserdiscworld.com/criterion-collection-laserdiscs/|access-date=November 29, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119154752/http://www.laserdiscworld.com/criterion-collection-laserdiscs/|archive-date=January 19, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with its laserdiscs, Criterion's early DVD editions of widescreen films were presented in the letterbox format, but Criterion did not enhance its discs for [[16:9]] monitors until mid-1999 with its release of ''[[Insomnia (1997 film)|Insomnia]]'' (1997), catalog number 47.&lt;ref name="FAQS"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQS|url=http://www.criterion.com/asp/faq.asp|publisher=The Criterion Collection|accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video-on-demand services===
On November 25, 2008, on its web site, Criterion began offering video-on-demand (VOD) downloading services, for US$5.00 per select movie, marking the beginning of a cross-promotional [[Video on demand|VOD]] service from the Criterion and [[The Auteurs (website)|The Auteurs]] web sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/library/online |title=Films – Online – The Criterion Collection |publisher=Criterion.com |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, many Criterion titles also became available through the [[Hulu]] Plus premium subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/criterion |title=The Criterion Collection |publisher=Hulu |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, [[FilmStruck]], a film streaming service from [[Turner Classic Movies]], succeeded [[Hulu]] as the exclusive streaming service for the Criterion Collection.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

===Eclipse===
{{See also|Eclipse (company)}}
Eclipse is a line started in 2007 separate from The Criterion Collection. It is described by Criterion as "a selection of lost, forgotten, or overshadowed classics in simple, affordable editions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criterion help|url=http://www.criterion.com/help#q9|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sold in multi-DVD sets only.

==Product pricing==
The retail list prices for Criterion Collection releases typically range from US$30 to US$40 for one-disc and two-discs sets, respectively, while boxed sets typically range from US$80 to US$200. Twice-yearly sales at 50 percent off full price are held both at the Criterion website and at the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] website and stores.

Janus Films' "Essential Art House" collection consists of Janus-owned Criterion movies without many special features, as lower-cost alternatives to individual purchases of regular Criterion titles.

Demand for out-of-print Criterion Collection releases has spawned the business of [[counterfeit]] (bootleg) copies, often advertised as a Criterion Collection "Asian" edition to disguise their [[counterfeit|bootleg]] nature.&lt;ref name="FAQS" /&gt; The company’s website instructs buyers to shop carefully, advises about identifying bootleg merchandise, and notes that the Criterion Collection never published Asian editions of its movie catalog.

'''''The Orion Conspiracy''''' is a [[graphic adventure]] video game that was released in 1995. The game was published by [[Domark]] and developed by [[Divide By Zero (company)|Divide By Zero]]. The game was released on [[MS-DOS]] and later the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system.

==Synopsis==
In the year 2160, the universe is run by corrupt corporations and governments that will do anything in order to get what they want. On a space station, Devlin McCormack has just buried his estranged son, only to receive news afterwards that he was murdered. Devlin seeks to unravel the conspiracy behind his son's murder.

==Comic book==
The game came with a 12-page comic book produced especially to be packaged with the game. It details the backstory of Devlin McCormack and his family. Devlin is the sole survivor of an attack on his ship during the Company Wars, sustaining permanent damage to his lungs due to smoke inhalation. Returning home and unable to work, (making him a social outcast in the company-centric colony) Devlin becomes severely depressed, combined with survivor's guilt. The toll of this drives his son Danny to leave home and become estranged from the family. Devlin's wife commits suicide shortly thereafter. The comic ends years later, with Devlin arriving at the space station for Danny's funeral.

==Plot==
An accident kills an engineer named Danny McCormack. While repairing a [[Space probe|probe]], an explosion sends his scout ship out of control and it falls into a nearby [[black hole]]. Soon Devlin McCormack arrives to attend the funeral on Cerberus. After the funeral, Devlin receives an anonymous tip that confirms his son was murdered. Devlin vows to kill whoever was responsible for this.

The base is shared by the staff of competing companies - Kobayashi (whom Danny worked for) and Mogami-Hudson. The leader of Kobayashi refuses to let a civilian stay on the station, so Devlin sabotages the navigation computer of one of the shuttles. This forces him to stay until a supply shuttle visits the station sometime in the coming weeks. Unable to gain access to Danny's possessions due to company policy, Devlin instead blackmails a senior officer to get them. He finds some love letters, which to his surprise show his son had a gay lover named Steve Kaufmann. Kaufmann walks in and angrily confronts Devlin over the destructive relationship Devlin had with his son before storming off.

Devlin retires to his quarters for the night but awakes to find out Kaufmann has been murdered. As he was the last person to see him alive, Devlin is arrested and confined to the observatory (as the station lacks a proper brig). He escapes by cutting off the only air vent in the room, which tricks the computer into opening the door to restore the air supply.

After escaping, Devlin discovers unusual eggs on a cargo shuttle. Doctor Chu walks in and reveals herself to be a [[shape-shifting]] [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] responsible for placing the eggs, with a plan to replace the Cerberus crew and spread themselves throughout the galaxy. Devlin flees, but eventually kills the creature by igniting a fuel tank in the engine room.

Maintenance Officer Meyer arrives after hearing the explosion and, afraid of being fired for incompetence, asks Devlin to keep the engine damage a secret so he can fix the problem without anyone ever knowing. Roland overhears the conversation from outside the room and attempts to escape on the transport, unwittingly carrying the alien eggs with him. Devlin is forced to break into the station's [[Armory (military)|armoury]] and destroy the ship with Cerberus' laser cannon to prevent the aliens spreading throughout the galaxy.

Devlin is then confronted by an armed and furious Captain Shannon. It turns out Shannon's wife served on Devlin's ship, which was destroyed in the Company Wars, and Shannon believes Devlin left her to die. Shannon arranged Danny's transfer to Cerberus station and sabotaged the probe to kill him, so that Devlin would feel the pain of losing a loved one just as he had. As Shannon is about to kill Devlin, Meyer jumps him from behind and Shannon is shot dead in the struggle.

While this is happening, Ward is in an armed stand-off with the rest of the Kobayashi crew; he witnessed an alien changing from human form and went on a berserk rampage. Brooks impatiently attempts to snatch a [[grenade]] from Ward's hand which detonates, making the corridor unstable. Devlin and LaPaz retrieve Brooks' body and seal the corridor from the outside seconds before it [[Uncontrolled decompression|de-pressurizes]].

The engines on Cerberus need a replacement part which can only be found on the probe which killed Danny. Devlin flies out on a scout shuttle to retrieve the part but while he was out, Mogami-Hudson attempt to kill the aliens by cutting off all life-support on the station. (apart from inside their own labs) Devlin uses the shuttle to bomb Mogami-Hudson's power lines from the outside, returning control of the station to Kobayashi and devastating the Mogami-Hudson lab. Devlin goes looking for survivors and discovers a fatally wounded scientist; before dying, she admits they found the shape-shifting aliens within the asteroid and revived several of them.

Devlin suggests evacuating the station, but Meyer points out the shuttle's navigation computer is still wiped. LaPaz reveals that the pilot (Brooks) has a backup stored in a chip inside her head, which is why LaPaz saved her corpse from being flushed out into space. While Devlin retrieves the chip, Meyer discovers a [[booby-trap]] on the shuttle intended for Devlin. Meyer needs time to disarm the trap, so Devlin and LaPaz hunt down and destroy one of the shape-shifters using a [[corrosive]] formula developed by Mogami-Hudson. The remaining two return to the shuttle, only for Meyer to tell them Lowe (who disappeared during the hunt) was a shape-shifter whom he had just fought off.

Since Lowe could use the laser cannons to shoot down their craft as they try to leave, the survivors decide to activate the station's [[self-destruct]] as it will shut down all systems 30 seconds prior to detonation - including the laser cannons. Devlin sets the self-destruct and booby-traps the switch with a concussion charge. Lowe, attempting to override the self-destruct, is blown up and Devlin races back to the shuttle, which escapes the station as it explodes.

==Development==
The game has a fullscreen, minimalistic interface. The game utilizes SVGA graphics combined with (new for the time) computer-generated cutscenes. In difference to traditional point 'n' click adventures of the time, verbs and actions are only shown when an object or character is clicked on, rather than being permanently displayed on screen. Verb or item icons that do not apply to the object are not displayed.

This design for interacting with objects is not implemented consistently, however. For example; if you have to give an item to a character at ''any'' point during the game, the 'Give' option will always be displayed regardless of whether or not you actually have the right item. However, if you have to use an item on something else, the option to use said item only appears once you have the item in question.

==Reception==
''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that "this is quite simply a bad game. Unless you're desperate for a new science fiction adventure, give ''The Orion Conspiracy'' a miss."&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=9|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=September 1995|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tom and Jerry''''' is an American [[animation|animated]] series of [[short film]]s created in 1940 by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]]. It centers on a rivalry between its two title characters, [[Tom (Tom and Jerry)|Tom]], a cat, and [[Jerry (Tom and Jerry)|Jerry]], a mouse, and many [[List of Tom and Jerry characters#Recurring characters|recurring characters]], based around [[slapstick]] comedy.

In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] from 1940 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-02-17/tom-and-jerrys-75th-anniversary-proves-cat-and-mouse-games-never-get-old/ |title=Tom and Jerry's 75th anniversary proves cat and mouse games never get old |last=Jones |first=Paul |date=2015-02-17 |work=Radio Times |access-date=2018-02-10 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, they won seven [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Awards for Animated Short Film]], tying for first place with [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' with the most awards in the category. After the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]] closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with [[Gene Deitch]] directing an additional 13 ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts for [[Rembrandt Films]] from 1961 to 1962. ''Tom and Jerry'' then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking ''[[Looney Tunes]]''. [[Chuck Jones]] then produced another 34 shorts with [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|Sib Tower 12 Productions]] between 1963 and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat|The Mansion Cat]]'' in 2001, ''[[The Karate Guard]]'' in 2005, and ''A Fundraising Adventure'' in 2014, making a total of [[Tom and Jerry filmography|164 shorts]].

A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (1975 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]'' (1975), ''[[The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show]]'' (1980–82), ''[[Tom and Jerry Kids]]'' (1990–93), ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' (2006–08), and ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]'' (2014–present). The first feature-length film based on the series, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'', was released in 1992, and 13 [[#Feature films|direct-to-video films]] have been produced since 2002.

==Plot==
The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry). The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, there are also several instances within the cartoons where they display genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escaped the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger. And despite their endless attacks on one another, they’ve saved each other’s lives every time they were truly in danger.

The cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation such as Tom using everything from axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand, Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent due to their frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a [[waffle iron]] or a [[Mangle (machine)|mangle]], kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]], club or [[mallet]], letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on.&lt;ref name="DailyTeleL"&gt;{{cite news|title=Master cartoonist who created Tom and Jerry draws his last|last=Whitworth |first=Melissa |date=December 20, 2006|work=The Daily Telegraph (LONDON)|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, ''Tom and Jerry'' has often been criticized as excessively violent. Despite the frequent violence, there is no blood or gore in any scene.&lt;ref name="Sennett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|author2=Joseph Barbera |author3=with Ted Sennett |title=The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity|year=1989|publisher=Viking Studio Books|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-670-82978-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="Smoodin"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smoodin|first=Eric|title=Cartoon and Comic Classicism: High-Art Histories of Lowbrow Culture|journal=American Literary History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|volume=4|issue=1 (Spring, 1992)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|134}}

Music plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director [[Scott Bradley (composer)|Scott Bradley]] created complex scores that combined elements of [[jazz]], classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs, as well as songs from MGM films, including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'', which both starred [[Judy Garland]] in a leading role.

Generally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters are able to speak English on rare occasions and are thus not mute. For example, the character [[Mammy Two Shoes]] has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.

== Production ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Before 1954, all ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were produced in the standard [[Academy ratio]] and format; in 1954 and 1955, some of the output was dually produced in dual versions: one Academy-ratio negative composed for a flat [[widescreen]] (1.75:1) format and one shot in the [[CinemaScope]] process. From 1955 until the close of the MGM cartoon studio a year later, all ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were produced in CinemaScope, some even had their soundtracks recorded in [[Perspecta|Perspecta directional audio]]. All of the Hanna and Barbera cartoons were shot as successive color exposure negatives in [[Technicolor]]; the 1960s entries were done in [[Metrocolor]]. The 1960s entries also returned to the standard Academy ratio and format, too. The 2005 short ''[[The Karate Guard]]'' was also filmed in the standard Academy ratio and format.

==Characters==
{{original research|section|date=May 2017}}
{{Main|List of Tom and Jerry characters}}

===Tom and Jerry===
{{Main|Tom Cat|Jerry Mouse}}
[[Tom Cat|Tom]] (named "Jasper" in his debut appearance) is a grey and white [[Domestic short-haired cat|domestic shorthair cat]]. ("Tom" is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while [[Jerry Mouse|Jerry]] (named "Jinx" in his debut appearance) is a small, brown, [[house mouse]] who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry, sometimes in revenge, and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry. By the final "fade-out" of each cartoon, Jerry usually emerges triumphant, while Tom is shown as the loser.

However, other results may be reached. On rare occasions, Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or he pushes Tom a little too far. In ''[[The Million Dollar Cat]]'' Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal, especially mice; he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates. In ''[[Timid Tabby]]'' Tom's look-alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge. Occasionally and usually ironically, they both lose, usually because Jerry's last trap or attack on Tom backfires on him or he overlooks something. In Chuck Jones' ''[[Filet Meow]]'', Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterwards, the shark scares Jerry away as well. Finally, they occasionally end up being friends, although within this set of stories, there is often a last minute event that ruins the truce. One cartoon that has  a friendly ending is ''[[Snowbody Loves Me]]''.

Both characters display [[Sadism and masochism|sadistic]] tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event. However, when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party, the other will develop a conscience and save him. Occasionally, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks. Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty, and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to [[torture]] and humiliate them both. Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens, or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary. This is the case in [[Posse Cat]], when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner, but Tom then reneges. Other times however, Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved.

Tom changes his love interest many times. The first love interest is Toots who appears in ''[[Puss n' Toots]]'', and calls him "Tommy" in ''[[The Mouse Comes to Dinner]]''. He is also interested in a cat called Toots in ''[[The Zoot Cat]]'' although she has a different appearance to the original Toots. The most frequent love interest of Tom's is [[Toodles Galore]], who never has any dialogue in the cartoons.

Despite five shorts ending with a depiction of Tom's apparent death, his demise is never permanent; he even reads about his own death in a flashback in ''[[Jerry's Diary]]''. He appears to die in explosions in ''[[Mouse Trouble]]'' (after which he is seen in [[heaven]]), ''[[Yankee Doodle Mouse]]'' and in ''[[Safety Second]]'', while in ''[[The Two Mouseketeers]]'' he is guillotined offscreen. The short ''[[Blue Cat Blues]]'' ends with both Tom and Jerry sitting on the railroad tracks with the intent of [[suicide]] while the whistle of an oncoming train is heard foreshadowing their imminent death.

====Tom and Jerry speaking====
Although many supporting and minor characters speak, rarely do Tom and Jerry so themselves. Tom, most famously, sings while wooing female cats; for example, Tom sings [[Louis Jordan]]'s "[[Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby]]" in the 1946 short ''[[Solid Serenade]]''. In that one as well as ''[[Zoot Cat]]'', Tom, when romancing a female cat, woos her in a French-accented voice similar to that of screen actor [[Charles Boyer]]. At the end of ''[[The Million Dollar Cat]]'' after beginning to antagonize Jerry he says, "Gee, I'm throwin' away a million dollars... BUT I'M HAPPY!" In ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring]]'', Jerry says, "No, no, no, no, no," when choosing the shop to remove his ring. In ''[[The Mouse Comes to Dinner]]'' Tom speaks to his girlfriend Toots while inadvertently sitting on a stove: "Say, what's cookin'?", to which Toots replies "You are, stupid." Another instance of speech comes in ''[[Solid Serenade]]'' and ''[[The Framed Cat]]'', where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner. Co-director William Hanna provided most of the squeaks, gasps, and other vocal effects for the pair, including the most famous sound effects from the series, Tom's leather-lunged scream (created by recording Hanna's scream and eliminating the beginning and ending of the recording, leaving only the strongest part of the scream on the soundtrack) and Jerry's nervous gulp.

The only other reasonably common vocalization is made by Tom when some external reference claims a certain scenario or eventuality to be impossible, which inevitably, ironically happens to thwart Tom's plans – at which point, a bedraggled and battered Tom appears and says in a haunting, echoing voice "Don't you believe it!", a reference to the then-popular 1940s radio show ''Don't You Believe It.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.day3media.com/DontYouBelieveIt.mp3 Sample audio: introduction to an episode of ''Don't You Believe It'', January 4, 1947 (mp3 audio)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131005035853/http://www.myoldradio.com/old-radio-episodes/don-t-you-believe-it-ep-154/1 Recording of ''Don't You Believe It'' from January 4, 1947. ''My Old Radio Show''. Retrieved October 2, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mouse Trouble]]'', Tom says "Don't you believe it!" after being beaten up by Jerry (this also happens in ''[[The Missing Mouse]]''). In the 1946 short ''[[Trap Happy]]'', Tom hires a [[Butch (Tom and Jerry)|cat]] disguised as a mouse exterminator who, after several failed attempts to dispatch Jerry, changes profession to ''Cat'' exterminator by crossing out the "Mouse" on his title and writing "Cat", resulting in Tom spelling out the word out loud before reluctantly pointing at himself. One short, 1956's ''[[Blue Cat Blues]]'', is narrated by Jerry in [[voiceover]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]) as they try to win back their ladyfriends. Both Tom and Jerry speak more than once in the 1943 short ''[[The Lonesome Mouse]]'', while Jerry was voiced by [[Sara Berner]] during his appearance in the 1945 MGM musical ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''. ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'' is the first (and so far only) installment of the series where the famous cat-and-mouse duo regularly speak. In that movie, Tom was voiced by [[Richard Kind]], and Jerry was voiced by [[Dana Hill]].

===Spike and Tyke===
{{Main|Spike and Tyke (characters)}}
In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike (known as "Killer" and "Butch" in some shorts), an angry, vicious but easily duped [[American Bulldog|bulldog]] who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute (aside from howls and biting noises) as well as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions (performed by [[Billy Bletcher]] and later [[Daws Butler]]) modeled after comedian [[Jimmy Durante]]. Spike's coat has altered throughout the years between grey and creamy tan. The addition of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series (''[[Spike and Tyke]]'').

Most cartoons with Spike in it have a system; usually Spike is trying to accomplish something (such as building a dog house or sleeping) when Tom and Jerry's antics stop him from doing it. Spike then (presumably due to prejudice) singles out Tom as the culprit and threatens him that if it ever happens again, he will do "something horrible" to him (effectively forcing Tom to take the blame) while Jerry overhears; afterwards Jerry usually does anything he can to interrupt whatever Spike is doing while Tom barely manages to stop him (usually getting injured in the process). Usually Jerry does eventually wreck whatever Spike is doing in spectacular fashion and leaving Tom to take the blame, forcing him to flee from Spike and inevitably lose (usually due to the fact that Tom is usually framed by Jerry and that Spike just doesn't like Tom). Off-screen, Spike does something to Tom and finally Tom is generally shown injured or in a bad situation while Jerry smugly cuddles up to Spike unscathed. Tom sometimes can get irritated with Spike on some occasions (example is in [[That's My Pup!]], when Spike forced Tom to run up a tree every time his son barked, causing Tom to hang Tyke on a flag pole). At least once however, Tom does something that benefits Spike, who promises not to interfere ever again; causing Jerry to frantically leave the house and run into the distance (in [[Hic-cup Pup]]). Spike is well known for his famous "''Listen pussycat!''" catchphrase when he threatens Tom, his other famous catchphrase is "''That's my boy!''" normally said when he supports or congratulates his son.

Tyke is described as a cute, sweet looking, happy and a lovable puppy. He is Spike's son, but unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates (mostly towards his father) by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling. Tyke's father Spike would always go out of his way to care and comfort his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son and they get along like friends, although most of time they would be taking a nap or Spike would teach Tyke the main facts of life of being a dog. Like Spike, Tyke's appearance has altered throughout the years, from grey (with white paws) to creamy tan. When [[Tom and Jerry Kids]] first aired, this was the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak.

===Butch and Toodles Galore===
{{Main|Butch (Tom and Jerry)|Toodles Galore}}
Butch is a black, cigar-smoking cat who also wants to eat Jerry. He is the most frequent adversary of Tom. However, for most of the episodes he appears in, he is usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles. Butch was also Tom's chum as in some cartoons, where Butch is leader of Tom's alley cat buddies, who are mostly [[Lightning (Tom and Jerry)|Lightning]], [[Topsy (Tom and Jerry)|Topsy]], and [[Meathead (Tom and Jerry)|Meathead]]. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most shorts.

Both characters were originally introduced in [[Hugh Harman]]'s 1941 short ''[[The Alley Cat (1941 film)|The Alley Cat]]'', but were integrated into ''Tom and Jerry'' rather than continuing in their own series.

===Nibbles===
{{main|Nibbles (Tom and Jerry)}}
Nibbles is a small grey mouse who often appears in shorts as Jerry's nephew. He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry's command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. This can lead to such results as "getting the cheese" by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry's example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. Many times Nibbles is an ally of Jerry in fights against Tom, including being the second Mouseketeer. He is given speaking roles in all his appearances as a Mouseketeer, often with a high-pitched French tone. However, during a short in which he rescued Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.

===Mammy Two Shoes===
{{main|Mammy Two Shoes}}
Mammy Two Shoes is a heavy-set middle-aged [[Mammy archetype|mammy]] who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters. Voiced by character actress [[Lillian Randolph]], she is often seen as the owner of Tom. Her face was only shown once, very briefly, in ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]''. Mammy's appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a [[mammy archetype]] now often regarded as [[racist]].&lt;ref name=race/&gt; She was mostly restored in the DVD releases of the cartoons, with an introduction by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] explaining the importance of African-American representation in the cartoon series, however stereotyped.

==History==
"Tom and Jerry" was a commonplace phrase for youngsters indulging in riotous behaviour in 19th-century London. The term comes from ''Life in London, or Days and Nights of Jerry Hawthorne and his elegant friend Corinthian Tom'' (1823) by [[Pierce Egan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=2|year=1989|chapter=Tom and Jerry}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Brewer]] notes no more than an "unconscious" echo of the [[Regency era]] original in the naming of the cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McMahon|first1=Seán|last2=O'Donoghue|first2=Jo|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase &amp; Fable|year=2004|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-304-36334-6|page=799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanna-Barbera era (1940–1958)===
[[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] were both part of the [[Harman and Ising|Rudolf Ising]] unit at the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon studio]] in the late 1930s. After the financial disaster of a series of MGM cartoons based upon the ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids|Captain and the Kids]]'' comic strip characters, Barbera, a storyman and character designer, was paired (out of desperation) with Hanna, an experienced director, to start directing films for the Ising unit. In their first discussion for a cartoon, Barbera suggested a cat-and-mouse cartoon titled ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]''. "We knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought," as he recalled in an interview.&lt;ref name="LeonardMaltin"&gt;{{Cite video|people=[[Leonard Maltin]]|title=Interview with Joseph Barbera|medium=Digital|publisher=[[Archive of American Television]]|date=1997|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/joseph-barbera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna and other employees complained that the idea wasn't very original; nevertheless, the short was completed in late 1939, and released to theaters on February 10, 1940. ''Puss Gets The Boot'' centers on Jasper, a gray tabby cat trying to catch a mouse named Jinx (whose name is not mentioned within the cartoon itself), but after accidentally breaking a houseplant and its stand, the African American housemaid Mammy has threatened to throw Jasper out if he breaks one more thing in the house. Naturally, Jinx uses this to his advantage, and begins tossing any and everything fragile, so that Jasper will be thrown outside. ''Puss Gets The Boot'' was previewed and released without fanfare, and Hanna and Barbera went on to direct other non-cat-and-mouse related shorts such as ''[[Gallopin' Gals]]'' (1940) and ''[[Officer Pooch]]'' (1941). "After all," remarked many of the MGM staffers, "haven't there been enough cat-and-mouse cartoons already?"

The pessimistic attitude towards the cat and mouse duo changed when the cartoon became a favorite with theater owners and with the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], which nominated the film for the ''Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons'' of 1941. It lost to another MGM cartoon, Rudolph Ising's ''[[The Milky Way (1940 short film)|The Milky Way]]''.

Producer [[Fred Quimby]], who ran the MGM animation studio, quickly pulled Hanna and Barbera off the other one-shot cartoons they were working on, and commissioned a series featuring the cat and mouse. Hanna and Barbera held an intra-studio contest to give the pair a new name by drawing suggested names out of a hat; animator John Carr won $50 with his suggestion of ''Tom and Jerry'', at the time best known as the name of [[Tom and Jerry (mixed drink)|a Christmastime mixed drink]].&lt;ref name="BarberaAutoBio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tom and Jerry'' series went into production with ''[[The Midnight Snack]]'' in 1941, and Hanna and Barbera rarely directed anything but the cat-and-mouse cartoons for the rest of their tenure at MGM. Barbera would create the story for each short while Hanna would supervise production.

Tom's physical appearance evolved significantly over the years. During the early 1940s, Tom had an excess of detail—shaggy fur, numerous facial [[wrinkle]]s, and multiple eyebrow markings, all of which were streamlined into a more workable form by the end of the 1940s. In addition, he also looked like a more realistic cat early on; evolving from his quadrupedal beginnings Tom to become increasingly and almost exclusively bipedal. By contrast, Jerry's design remained essentially the same for the duration of the series. By the mid-1940s, the series had developed a quicker, more energetic and violent tone, due to the inspiration from the work of their colleague in the MGM cartoon studio, [[Tex Avery]], who joined the studio in 1942.

Even though the theme of each short is virtually the same – cat chases mouse – Hanna and Barbera found endless variations on that theme. Barbera's storyboards and rough layouts and designs, combined with Hanna's timing, resulted in MGM's most popular and successful cartoon series. Thirteen entries in the ''Tom and Jerry'' series (including ''Puss Gets The Boot'') were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons; seven of them went on to win the Academy Award, breaking the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney studio]]'s winning streak in that category. ''Tom and Jerry'' won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series.

''Tom and Jerry'' remained popular throughout their original theatrical run, even when the budgets began to tighten in the 1950s and the pace of the shorts slowed slightly. However, after [[television]] became popular in the 1950s, [[box office]] revenues decreased for theatrical films, and short subjects. At first, MGM combated this by going to all-CinemaScope production on the series. After MGM realized that their re-releases of the older cartoons brought in just as much money as the new cartoons did, the studio executives decided, much to the surprise of the staff, to close the animation studio. The MGM cartoon studio was shut down on May 15, 1957, and the last of the 114 Hanna-Barbera ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts, ''[[Tot Watchers]]'', was released on August 1, 1958. Hanna and Barbera established their own television animation studio, [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]], on July 7, 1957, which went on to produce hit TV shows, such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'' and [[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!|Scooby-Doo]].

===Gene Deitch era (1961–1962)===
In 1961, MGM revived the ''Tom and Jerry'' franchise, and contracted European animation studio [[Rembrandt Films]] to produce 13 ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="cell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rembrandtfilms.com/buyraretom-jerry.html|title=Rare Tom &amp; Jerry Cell|publisher=[[Rembrandt Films]]|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Define"&gt;Brion, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/access/108884830.html?dids=108884830:108884830&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+11%2C+1962&amp;author=&amp;pub=Wall+Street+Journal&amp;desc=Popeye%2C+Tom+%26+Jerry+Join+Trend+to+Shift+Production+Overseas&amp;pqatl=google|title=Popeye, Tom &amp; Jerry Join Trend to Shift Production Overseas|accessdate=August 17, 2010|date=June 11, 1962|author=MacDougall, Kent|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehman"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Animated Cartoons of the Vietnam Era: A Study of Social Commentary in Films and Television Programs, 1961–1973|author=P.

Snyder]].&lt;ref name="cell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehman"/&gt; Deitch himself wrote most of the cartoons, with occasional assistance from [[Larz Bourne]] and [[Eli Bauer]]. [[Stěpan Koniček]] provided the musical score for the Deitch shorts. Sound effects were produced by [[electronic music]] composer [[Tod Dockstader]]. The majority of vocal effects and voices in Deitch's films were provided by [[Allen Swift]].&lt;ref name="date"&gt;Grimes, William (April 27, 2010).

Deitch states that, being a "[[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] man", he was not a fan of the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, thinking they were "needlessly violent".&lt;ref name="DeitchDVD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deitch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=chapter&amp;chapter=20|title=Tom &amp; Jerry: The First Reincarnation|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|year=2001|author=Deitch, Gene|accessdate=September 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226202824/http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=chapter&amp;chapter=20|archivedate=December 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after being assigned to work on the series, he quickly realized that "nobody took [the violence] seriously", and it was merely "a parody of exaggerated human emotions".&lt;ref name="DeitchDVD"&gt;{{cite video |people=Deitch, Gene |date=2015 |title=''Tom and Jerry...and Gene'' in Tom and Jerry: The Gene Deitch Collection |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also came to see what he perceived as the "biblical roots" in Tom and Jerry's conflict, similar to [[David and Goliath]], stating "That's where we feel a connection to these cartoons: the little guy can win (or at least survive) to fight another day."&lt;ref name="DeitchDVD"/&gt;

Since the Deitch/Snyder team had seen only a handful of the original ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts, and since the team produced their cartoons on a tighter budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered [[surrealist]] in nature, though this was not Deitch's intention.&lt;ref name="Define"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deitch"/&gt; The animation was [[Limited animation|limited]] and jerky in movement, compared to the more fluid Hanna-Barbera shorts. Background art was done in a more simplistic, angular, [[Art Deco]]-esque style. The soundtracks featured sparse and echoic [[electronic music]], futuristic [[sound effects]], heavy [[reverb]], and dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken. According to Jen Nessel of ''[[The New York Times]]'', "The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;Nessel, Jen (August 9, 1998). [http://www.fortheloveofprague.com/9_media.html "...a spicy, funny memoir!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020557/http://www.fortheloveofprague.com/9_media.html |date=July 11, 2011 }}. ''The New York Times''. Retrieved August 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas Hanna-Barbera's shorts generally took place in and outside of a house, Deitch's shorts opted for more exotic locations, such as a 19th-century whaling ship, the jungles of [[Nairobi]], an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] acropolis, or the Wild West. In addition, Mammy Two-Shoes was replaced as Tom's owner by [[Clint Clobber]], a bald, overweight, short-tempered, middle-aged white man who was also much more brutal and violent in punishing Tom's actions as compared to previous owners, by beating and thrashing Tom repeatedly, stomping on his hand, searing his head with a grill, forcing him to drink an entire carbonated beverage, slamming his fingers with a lunchbox lid and even wrapping a shotgun over his head and firing it.

To avoid being linked to Communism, Deitch romanized the Czech names of his crew in the [[opening credits]] of the shorts (e.g. Stêpan Koniček became "Steven Konichek" and Vaclav Lidl became "Victor Little"). In addition, these shorts are among the few ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons not to carry the "Made In Hollywood, U.S.A." phrase on the end title card; due to Deitch's studio being behind the [[Iron Curtain]], the production studio's location is omitted entirely on it.&lt;ref name="Deitch"/&gt; After the 13 shorts were completed, Joe Vogel, the head of production, was fired from MGM. Vogel had approved of Deitch and his team's work, but MGM decided not to renew their contract after Vogel's departure.&lt;ref name="Deitch"/&gt; The final of the 13 shorts, ''[[Carmen Get It!]]'', was released on December 21, 1962.&lt;ref name="Define"/&gt;

Deitch's shorts were commercial successes. In 1961, the ''Tom and Jerry'' series became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, dethroning ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', which had held the position for 16 years; this success was repeated once more in 1962.&lt;ref name="Lehman"/&gt; However, unlike the Hanna-Barbera shorts, none of Deitch's films were nominated for nor did they win an [[Academy Award]].&lt;ref name="Lehman"/&gt; In retrospect, these shorts are often considered the worst of the ''Tom and Jerry'' theatrical output.&lt;ref name="DeitchDVD"/&gt; Deitch stated that due to his team's inexperience as well as their low budget, he "hardly had a chance to succeed", and "well understand[s] the negative reactions" to his shorts. He believes "They could all have been better animated – truer to the characters – but our T&amp;Js were produced in the early 1960s, near the beginning of my presence here, over a half-century ago as I write this!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/tom-jerry-the-gene-deitch-collection/|title=Tom &amp; Jerry – The Gene Deitch Collection -|website=cartoonresearch.com|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the criticism, some fans wrote positive letters to Deitch, stating that his ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts were their personal favorites due to their quirky and surreal nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/06/21/tom-and-jerry-the-gene-deitch-collection-dvd-review/ | title='Tom and Jerry: The Gene Deitch Collection' – DVD Review| publisher= Rotoscopers.com | first= Jonathan |last=North |date= June 21, 2015|accessdate= November 6, 2015| archivedate= September 12, 2015| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912040746/http://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/06/21/tom-and-jerry-the-gene-deitch-collection-dvd-review/ | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shorts were released on DVD in 2015 in [[Tom and Jerry: The Gene Deitch Collection]].

===Chuck Jones era (1963–1967)===
After the last of the Deitch cartoons were released, [[Chuck Jones]], who had been fired from his 30-plus year tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons, started his own animation studio, [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|Sib Tower 12 Productions]] (later renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts), with partner Les Goldman. Beginning in 1963, Jones and Goldman went on to produce [[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection|34 more ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts]], all of which carried Jones' distinctive style (and a slight psychedelic influence).

Jones had trouble adapting his style to ''Tom and Jerry'''s brand of humor, and a number of the cartoons favored full animation, personality and style over storyline. The characters underwent a slight change of appearance: Tom was given thicker [[eyebrow]]s (resembling Jones' [[Grinch]], [[Count Blood Count]] or [[Wile E. Coyote]]), a less complex look (including the color of his fur becoming gray), sharper ears, longer tail and furrier cheeks (resembling Jones' Claude Cat or Sylvester), while Jerry was given larger eyes and ears, a lighter brown color, and a sweeter, [[Porky Pig]]-like expression.

Some of Jones' ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons are reminiscent of his work with [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner]], included the uses of [[blackout gag]]s and gags involving characters falling from high places. Jones co-directed the majority of the shorts with layout artist [[Maurice Noble]]. The remaining shorts were directed by [[Abe Levitow]] and [[Ben Washam]], with [[Tom Ray]] directing two shorts built around footage from earlier ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons directed by Hanna and Barbera, and Jim Pabian directed a short with Maurice Noble. Various vocal characteristics were made by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[June Foray]]. These shorts contain a memorable opening theme, in which Tom first replaces the MGM lion, then is trapped inside the "O" of his name.&lt;ref name="50yrs"/&gt;

Though Jones's shorts were generally considered an improvement over Deitch's, they nevertheless had varying degrees of critical success. MGM ceased production of ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts in 1967, by which time Jones had moved on to television specials and the feature film ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]''.&lt;ref name="50yrs"/&gt; The shorts were released on DVD in 2009 in [[Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection]].

===''Tom and Jerry'' hit television===
Beginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons began to appear on television in heavily edited versions. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two Shoes and remove her by pasting over the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat white Irish woman; occasionally, as in ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]'', a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by [[June Foray]]. However, recent telecasts on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by [[Thea Vidale]] to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks. The standard ''Tom and Jerry'' opening titles were removed as well. Instead of the roaring [[Leo the Lion (MGM)#Tanner (1934–1956)|MGM Lion]] sequence, an opening sequence featuring different clips of the cartoons was used instead. The title cards were also changed. A pink title card with the name written in white font was used instead.

Debuting on [[CBS]]' Saturday morning schedule on September 25, 1965, ''Tom and Jerry'' moved to CBS Sundays two years later and remained there until September 17, 1972.

===Second Hanna-Barbera era: ''The Tom and Jerry Show'' (1975)===
In 1975, Tom and Jerry were reunited with Hanna and Barbera, who produced new ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (1975 TV series)|Tom and Jerry cartoons]]'' for Saturday mornings. These 48 seven-minute short cartoons were paired with ''[[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]]'' and ''[[The Mumbly Cartoon Show|Mumbly]]'' cartoons, to create ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (1975 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape Show]]'', ''[[The Mumbly Cartoon Show|The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show]]'', and ''[[The Mumbly Cartoon Show|The Tom and Jerry/Mumbly Show]]'', all of which initially ran on ABC Saturday mornings between September 6, 1975 and September 3, 1977. In these cartoons, Tom and Jerry (now with a red bow tie), who had been enemies during their formative years, became nonviolent pals who went on adventures together, as Hanna-Barbera had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children's TV. This 1975-styled format was no longer used in the newer Tom and Jerry entrees.&lt;ref name="50yrs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=T.R.|title=Tom and Jerry: Fifty Years of Cat and Mouse|year=1991|publisher=Crescent Books|location=New York, NY|isbn= 0-517-05688-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filmation era (1980–1982)===
[[Filmation|Filmation Studios]] (in association with [[MGM Television]]) also tried their hands at producing a ''Tom and Jerry'' TV series. Their version, ''[[The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show]]'', debuted in 1980, and also featured new cartoons starring [[Droopy]], Spike (from Tom &amp; Jerry, and the same version also used in Droopy), Slick Wolf, and [[Barney Bear]], not seen since the original MGM shorts. The Filmation ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were noticeably different from Hanna-Barbera's efforts, as they returned ''Tom and Jerry'' to the original chase formula, with a somewhat more "[[slapstick]]" humor format. This incarnation, much like the 1975 version, was not as well received by [[audience]]s as the originals, and lasted on [[CBS]] Saturday mornings from September 6, 1980 to September 4, 1982.&lt;ref name="50yrs"/&gt;

===Tom and Jerry's new owners===
In 1986, MGM was purchased by [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]] founder [[Ted Turner]]. Turner sold the company a short while later, but retained MGM's pre-1986 film library, thus ''Tom and Jerry'' became the property of [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]] (where the rights stand today via [[Warner Bros.]]), and have in subsequent years appeared on Turner-run stations, such as [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The WB]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], and [[Turner Classic Movies]].

===Third Hanna-Barbera era: ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' (1990–1994)===
One of the biggest trends for Saturday morning television in the 1980s and 1990s was the child versions of famous classic cartoon stars "babyfication" of older, classic cartoon stars, and on March 2, 1990, ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry Kids|Tom and Jerry Kids]]'', co-produced by Turner Entertainment Co. and Hanna-Barbera Productions (which would be sold to Turner in 1991) debuted on [[Fox Kids]] and for a few years, aired on British children's block, [[CBBC]]. It featured a youthful version of the famous cat-and-mouse duo chasing each other. As with the 1975 H-B series, Jerry wears his red bowtie, while Tom now wears a red cap. Spike and his son Tyke (who now had talking dialogue) and Droopy and his son Dripple, appeared in back-up segments for the show, which ran until November 18, 1994. ''Tom and Jerry Kids'' was the last Tom and Jerry cartoon series produced in 4:3 (full screen) aspect ratio.

===One-off productions (2001; 2005)===
In 2001, a new television special titled ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat]]'' premiered on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a [[habitrail]], is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not "blame everything on the mouse".

In 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, titled ''[[The Karate Guard]]'', which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, [[storyboard]]ed by Joseph Barbera and [[Iwao Takamoto]] and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005. As part of the celebration of ''Tom and Jerry''{{'}}s sixty-fifth anniversary, this marked Barbera's first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna's original MGM cartoon shorts, and last overall; he would die shortly after production ended. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006.

===Warner Bros. era (2006–present)===
During the first half of 2006, a new series called ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' was produced at [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Thirteen half-hour episodes (each consisting of three shorts, some of them—like ''The Karate Guard''—were produced and completed in 2003 as part of a 30-plus theatrical cartoon schedule aborted after the financial disaster of ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'') were produced, with only markets outside of the United States and United Kingdom signed up. The show then came to the UK in February 2006 on [[Boomerang (UK &amp; Ireland)|Boomerang]], and it went to the U.S. on [[Kids' WB]] on [[The CW]].&lt;ref name="toynews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=194&amp;itemid=9316 |title=Kids' WB! on The CW Announces 2006–2007 "Too Big for Your TV" Saturday Morning Programming Schedule – Cartoons |publisher=ToyNewsI.com |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tales'' is the first ''Tom and Jerry'' TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the slapstick. The series was canceled in 2008, shortly before the Kids' WB block shut down. ''Tales'' is also the first ''Tom and Jerry'' production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (which was aired on Cartoon Network in the United States) but cropped to 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio (which was aired on The CW and Boomerang in the United States).

[[Cartoon Network]], which began rerunning the ''Tom and Jerry Tales'' in January 2012, subsequently aired a second series consisting of two 11-minute shorts per episode that likewise sought to maintain the look, core characters and sensibility of the original theatrical shorts. Similar to other reboot works like ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' and ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'', several episodes the new series brought Tom and Jerry into contemporary environments, telling new stories and relocating the characters to more fantastic worlds, from a medieval castle to a mad scientist's lab. Titled ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]'', the series is produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], with [[Sam Register]] serving as executive producer in collaboration with [[Darrell Van Citters]] and [[Ashley Postelwaite]] at [[Renegade Animation]]. Originally slated for an undated 2013 Cartoon Network premiere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartoon Network Upfront Presentation 2013|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/od/picturegallerie1/ss/Cartoon-Network-Upfront-Presentation-2013_9.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=January 3, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103190551/http://animatedtv.about.com/od/picturegallerie1/ss/Cartoon-Network-Upfront-Presentation-2013_9.htm|archivedate=January 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being pushed back to April 9, 2014, this is the second ''Tom and Jerry'' production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.bcdb.com/tom-jerry-show-coming-cartoon-network-4850/|title=The Tom and Jerry Show Coming to Cartoon Network|publisher=Big Cartoon News|date=October 8, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121206014416/http://blog.bcdb.com/tom-jerry-show-coming-cartoon-network-4850/|archivedate=December 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the United States==
When shown on terrestrial television in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (from 1967 to 2000, usually on the [[BBC]]) ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were not edited for violence, and Mammy was retained. As well as having regular slots (mainly after the evening BBC News with around two shorts shown every evening and occasionally shown on children's network [[CBBC]] in the morning), ''Tom and Jerry'' served the BBC in another way. When faced with disruption to the schedules (such as those occurring when live broadcasts overrun), the BBC would invariably turn to ''Tom and Jerry'' to fill any gaps, confident that it would retain much of an audience that might otherwise channel hop. This proved particularly helpful in 1993, when ''[[Noel's House Party]]'' had to be cancelled due to an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb scare at [[BBC Television Centre]]—''Tom and Jerry'' was shown instead, bridging the gap until the next programme.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In 2006, a mother complained to [[OFCOM]] of the smoking scenes shown in the cartoons, since Tom often attempts to impress love interests with the habit, resulting in reports that the smoking scenes in ''Tom and Jerry'' films may be subject to censorship.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5271470.stm | work=BBC News | title=Smoke's no joke for Tom and Jerry | date=August 21, 2006 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its lack of dialogue, ''Tom and Jerry'' was easily translated into various foreign languages. ''Tom and Jerry'' began broadcast in [[Japan]] in 1965. A 2005 nationwide survey taken in Japan by [[TV Asahi]], sampling age groups from teenagers to adults in their sixties, ranked ''Tom and Jerry'' #85 in a list of the top 100 "[[anime]]" of all time; while their web poll taken after the airing of the list ranked it at #58 – the only non-Japanese animation on the list, and beating anime classics like ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', ''[[A Little Princess Sara]]'', and the ultra-classics ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' (in Japan, the word "anime" refers to ''all'' animation regardless of origin, not just Japanese animation).&lt;ref name="anime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/anime100/contents/ranking/cur/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124035134/http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/anime100/contents/ranking/cur/index.html |archivedate=November 24, 2005 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=November 24, 2005 |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tom and Jerry'' also serve as long-time licensed mascots for [[Gifu]]-based Juroku Bank.
Unlike some other Western cartoons such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' and ''[[Postman Pat]]'', whose characters had to be doctored to have five fingers in each hand instead of the original four,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/720419.stm Bob the Builder fixed for Japan], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tom and Jerry'' aired in Japan without such edits, as did other series starring non-human protagonists such as ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

''Tom and Jerry'' have long since been popular in [[Germany]]. The different shorts are usually linked together with key scenes from ''[[Jerry's Diary]]'' (1949), in which Tom reads about his and Jerry's past adventures. The cartoons are introduced with rhyming [[German language]] verse, and when necessary, a German voice spoke the translations of English labels on items and similar information.

The show was aired in mainland [[China]] by CCTV in the mid-1980s to early 1990s, and was extremely popular at the time. Collections of the show are still a prominent feature in Chinese book stores.  

In the [[Philippines]], the series was aired on [[ABS-CBN]] from 1966 until its closure due to the country's declaration of martial law in 1972, with the later Hanna-Barbera shorts from [[Barbecue Brawl]] to [[Tot Watchers]] and all of Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones shorts. [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]] aired most of Hanna-Barbera shorts from 1977 until 1989. ABS-CBN would later return to the air after the [[People Power Revolution|restoration of democracy]] in 1986 and airing the same shorts as in the pre-martial law era and lasted until the end of 1988.

Even though [[Gene Deitch]]'s shorts were created in Czechoslovakia (1960–1962), the first official TV release of ''Tom and Jerry'' was in 1988. It was one of the few cartoons of western origin broadcast in Czechoslovakia (1988) and Romania (until 1989) before the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1989.

The Pakistani ice cream brand [[OMORÉ]] has launched a chocolate bar ice cream based on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandsynario.com/tom-jerry-comes-to-pakistan-with-omore-choco-bar/|title=Tom &amp; Jerry Comes to Pakistan with Omore Choco Bar - Brandsynario|date=August 25, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feature films==
Tom and Jerry's first feature film appearance was in the 1945 MGM musical ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'', in which Jerry performs a dance number with [[Gene Kelly]]. In this scene, Tom also made a cameo as a servant. Filmmakers had wanted [[Mickey Mouse]] for the scene, but [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] had rejected the deal, as the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney studio]] was focusing on its own cartoons to help pay off its debts after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob Thomas.''Building a Company: Roy O. Disney and the Creation of an Entertainment Empire''. Eventually Disneys lent out their effects wizard [[Joshua Meador]] to spruce up MGM's 1956 ''[[Forbidden Planet]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; William Hanna and Joe Barbera supervised animation for the scene.

Tom and Jerry's second feature film appearance was swimming with [[Esther Williams]] in a dream sequence in another MGM big-screen musical, ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' (1953).

On October 1, 1992, the first international release of ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'' arrived when the film was released overseas to theaters in [[Europe]]&lt;ref name=VarietyFilm&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Joseph|title=Review: Tom and Jerry |url=https://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/tom-and-jerry-the-movie-1200430861/|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=October 2, 1992|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819152708/http://variety.com/1992/film/reviews/tom-and-jerry-the-movie-1200430861/|archivedate=August 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then domestically by [[Miramax Films]] on July 30, 1993,&lt;ref name=LATimesFilm&gt;{{cite news|title=Movie Review: Tom and Jerry': A Bland Cat-and-Mouse Chase : The formulaic story feels like a rerun and borrows characters from many other classics.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-30/entertainment/ca-18331_1_tom-jerry-cats|last=Solomon|first=Charles|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 30, 1993|accessdate=August 19, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019164803/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-30/entertainment/ca-18331_1_tom-jerry-cats|archivedate=October 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; with future video and DVD releases that would be sold under [[Warner Bros.]], which, following [[Miramax#Disney era|Disney's acquisition of Miramax]] and [[Turner Broadcasting System#1990s|Turner's subsequent merger]] with [[Time Warner]], had acquired the film's distribution rights. Barbera served as creative consultant for the picture, which was produced and directed by [[Phil Roman]]. The film was a musical with a structure similar to MGM's blockbusters, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''. In 2001, Warner Bros. (which had, by then, merged with Turner and assumed its properties) released the duo's first direct-to-video movie, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring]]'', in which Tom covets a ring that grants mystical powers to the wearer, and has become accidentally stuck on Jerry's head. It would mark the last time Hanna and Barbera co-produced a ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon together, as William Hanna died shortly after ''The Magic Ring'' was released.

Four years later, [[Bill Kopp]] scripted and directed two more ''Tom and Jerry'' DTV features for the studio, ''[[Tom and Jerry: Blast Off to Mars]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Fast and the Furry]]'', the latter one based on a story by Barbera. Both were released on DVD in 2005, marking the celebration of Tom and Jerry's 65th anniversary. In 2006, another direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers]]'', tells the story about the pair having to work together to find the treasure. Joe came up with the storyline for the next film, ''[[Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale]]'', as well as the initial idea of synchronizing the on-screen actions to music from Tchaikovsky's ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]''. This DTV film, directed by [[Spike Brandt]] and [[Tony Cervone]], would be Joe Barbera's last ''Tom and Jerry'' project due to his death in December 2006. The holiday-set animated film was released on DVD in late 2007, and dedicated to Barbera. A new direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes]]'', was released on August 24, 2010. It is the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie produced without any of the characters' original creators. The next direct-to-video film, ''[[Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz]]'', was released on August 23, 2011 and was the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie made for [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. It had a preview showing on Cartoon Network.

The characters in this shot have turned into black stereotypes after a passing car splashed mud on their faces. Scenes such as this are frequently highly edited or cut from modern broadcasts of ''Tom and Jerry'']]

Like many animated cartoons from the 1930s to the early 1950s, ''Tom and Jerry'' featured racial stereotypes.&lt;ref name=race&gt;

After explosions, for example, characters with blasted faces would resemble stereotypical blacks, with large lips and bow-tied hair. Perhaps the most controversial element of the show is the character Mammy Two Shoes, a poor black maid who speaks in a stereotypical "black accent" and has a rodent problem. Joseph Barbera, who was responsible for these gags, claimed that the racial gags in ''Tom and Jerry'' did not reflect his racial opinion; they were just reflecting what was common in society and cartoons at the time and were meant to be humorous.&lt;ref name="LeonardMaltin" /&gt; Today, the blackface gags are often censored when these shots are aired. Mammy Two-Shoes' voice was re-dubbed by Turner in the mid-1990s to make the character sound less stereotypical; the resulting accent sounds more Irish. Three shorts in particular, ''[[His Mouse Friday]]'',{{efn|This has since been removed from circulation due to the on-running depictions on [[Stereotypes of African Americans|black stereotypes]] involving cannibals.}} the depiction of cannibals, in ''[[Casanova Cat]]'', a scene where the face of Jerry is blackened by Tom with cigar smoke and ''[[Mouse Cleaning]]'' where Tom is shown as blackface has been removed from the Blu-ray DVD edition.

In Tom and Jerry's ''Spotlight Collection'' DVD, a disclaimer by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] warns viewers about the potentially offensive material in the cartoons and emphasizes that they were "wrong then and they are wrong today", borrowing a phrase from the Warner Bros. Golden collection. This disclaimer is also used in the ''Tom and Jerry Golden Collection: Volume 1'' on [[iTunes]].

As of 2011, most shorts that feature Mammy Two Shoes, except ''[[Part Time Pal]]'', are rarely seen on [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]]. There are other shorts (''[[The Lonesome Mouse]]''{{efn|This short contains a dark gag reference where Jerry paint marks on a picture of Tom's face like [[Adolf Hitler]] and then spits on it.}} and ''[[Blue Cat Blues]]''{{efn|The subplot of this short is considered dark since it had references of [[alcoholism]] and [[suicide]].}}) that are found inappropriate for the attended audiences rather than just having racist contents and are censored from the two channels as well.

In 2006, the [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|British version of the Boomerang channel]] made plans to edit ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons being aired in the UK where the characters were seen to be smoking. There was a subsequent investigation by UK media watchdog [[OFCOM|Ofcom]].&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; It has also taken the U.S. approach by censoring blackface gags, though this seems to be random as not all scenes of this type are cut.

In 2013, it was reported that [[Cartoon Network (Latin America)|Cartoon Network]] of Brazil censored 27 shorts on the grounds of being "politically incorrect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/noticia/2013/09/cartoon-network-considera-tom-e-jerry-politicamente-incorreto.html |title= Cartoon Network tira do ar 'Tom e Jerry': politicamente incorreto |date= September 25, 2013|accessdate=September 25, 2013|publisher= [[O Globo]]|language=Portuguese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222154559/http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/noticia/2013/09/cartoon-network-considera-tom-e-jerry-politicamente-incorreto.html|archivedate=February 22, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an official release, the channel confirmed that it had censored only two shorts (''[[The Two Mouseketeers]]''{{efn|This short has a dark offscreen ending where Tom was [[guillotine]]d.}} and ''[[Heavenly Puss]]''{{efn|The subplot of this short is considered dark since it had a reference of [[damnation]] in [[Hell]].}}) "by editorial issues and appropriateness of the content to the target audience—children of 7 to 11 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.judao.com.br/televisao/cartoon-network-confirma-censurou-episodios-tom-jerry/|title= Cartoon Network confirma que tirou do ar "apenas" DOIS episódios de Tom &amp; Jerry|date= September 26, 2013|accessdate= September 26, 2013|publisher= Judão|language= Portuguese|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130928063124/http://www.judao.com.br/televisao/cartoon-network-confirma-censurou-episodios-tom-jerry/|archivedate= September 28, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other formats==
{{Main|List of Tom and Jerry video games}}
''Tom and Jerry'' began appearing in [[comic book]]s in 1942, as one of the features in ''Our Gang Comics''. In 1949, with MGM's live-action ''[[Our Gang]]'' shorts having ceased production five years earlier, the series was renamed ''Tom and Jerry Comics''. The pair continued to appear in various books for the rest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="comics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://funnies.goldenagecartoons.com/doubletrouble/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825004657/http://funnies.goldenagecartoons.com/doubletrouble/ |archivedate=August 25, 2006 |title=Tom and Jerry Comics |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=August 25, 2006 |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pair have also appeared in a number of [[video game]]s as well, spanning titles for systems for the [[Sega Genesis]] plus also [[Sega Game Gear]] and the [[Sega Master System]] and their rival console around the 1990s, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Nintendo 64]] to more recent entries for [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and [[GameCube]] and also on the portable [[Nintendo]] consoles, [[Game Boy]] and [[Nintendo DS]].

==Cultural influences==
Throughout the years, the term and title ''Tom and Jerry'' became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related "cat and mouse fight" metaphor has. Yet in ''Tom and Jerry'' it was not the more powerful Tom who usually came out on top.

In January 2009, IGN named Tom and Jerry as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/66.html |title=IGN – 66.

In 1945, Jerry made an appearance in the live-action MGM musical feature film ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'', in which, through the use of special effects, he performs a dance routine with [[Gene Kelly]]. Tom is briefly seen in ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''. He appears as a servant, offering King Jerry some food on a tray.

Both Tom and Jerry appear with [[Esther Williams]] in a dream sequence in another big-screen musical, ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'' (1953).

In 1973, the magazine [[National Lampoon (magazine)|''National Lampoon'']] referenced ''Tom and Jerry'' in a violence-filled [[comic book]] parody, ''Kit 'n' Kaboodle''.&lt;ref name="debate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silverbox.com/krusty/debate3.html |title=Who Were Itchy &amp; Scratchy Modeled After? |work=The Krusty the Clown Homepage |publisher=The Krusty the Clown Homepage |year=1999 |accessdate=September 17, 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991118212950/http://silverbox.com/krusty/debate3.html |archivedate=November 18, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7306.html |last=Simonson |first=Mark |work=Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site |title=June 1973 |year=1997 |accessdate=September 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810061413/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7306.html |archivedate=August 10, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kit 'n' Kaboodle|journal=National Lampoon |date=June 1973|volume=6|issue=6|page=33|url=https://archive.org/details/NationalLampoon1973_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show]]'' is a spoof of ''Tom and Jerry''—a "cartoon within a cartoon".&lt;ref name="DailyTeleL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tvguide"&gt;{{cite news |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |date=2000-10-21 |publisher=''[[TV Guide]]'' |first=Joe |last=Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groening1"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an episode of the series titled "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]", ''Worker and Parasite'', a replacement cartoon for ''Itchy &amp; Scratchy'', is a reference to [[History of Russian animation|Soviet-era animation]].&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;Groening, Matt.

In an interview found on the DVD releases, several ''[[MADtv]]'' cast members stated that Tom and Jerry is one of their biggest influences for slapstick comedy. Also in the [[Cartoon Network]] show ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'', Tom and Jerry appear in three segments "Celebrity Birthdays", "Mickey Mouse Exterminator Service", and "Tom and Jury". [[Johnny Knoxville]] from ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' has stated that watching ''Tom and Jerry'' inspired many of the stunts in the movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n10/htdocs/behind-the-scenes-with-johnny-knoxville-554.php | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GaygARUQ?url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v17n10/htdocs/behind-the-scenes-with-johnny-knoxville-554.php | archivedate=May 13, 2013 | title=Behind the Scenes with Johnny Knoxville | work=Vice Magazine | accessdate=December 3, 2010 | deadurl=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}

In the pre-video era, ''Tom &amp; Jerry'' cartoons were a popular subject for [[8 mm film|8mm]] home movies, with the UK-based Walton Films issuing dozens of titles as colour one-reel Super 8 films, in both silent and sound editions. Walton's agreement with MGM obligated them to release the films in slightly edited form, even though the single-reel format would have comfortably accommodated the cartoons' seven to eight minute running time.

MGM/UA released a series of ''Tom &amp; Jerry'' laserdisc box sets in the 1990s. ''The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry'' volumes 1 and 2, contain all the MGM shorts up to (but not including) the Deitch Era, including letterboxed versions of the shorts filmed in CinemaScope. The cartoons are all intact save for ''[[His Mouse Friday]]'' (dialogue has been wiped) and ''[[Saturday Evening Puss]]'', which is the re-drawn version with June Foray's voice added. A third volume to ''The Art of Tom &amp; Jerry'' was released and contains all of the Chuck Jones-era ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts.

There have been several ''Tom and Jerry'' DVDs released in [[DVD region code|Region]] 1 (the United States and Canada), including a series of two-disc sets known as the ''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection]]''. There have been negative responses to Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, due to some of the cartoons included on each having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two-Shoes dialogue. A replacement program offering uncut versions of the shorts on DVD was later announced. There are also negative responses to Vol. 3, due to ''[[Mouse Cleaning]]'' and ''[[Casanova Cat]]'' being excluded from these sets and ''His Mouse Friday'' being edited for content with an extreme zooming-in towards the end to avoid showing a particularly race-based caricature.

There have been two ''Tom and Jerry'' DVD sets in [[DVD region code|Region]] 2. In Western Europe, most of the ''Tom and Jerry'' shorts have been released (only two, ''[[The Million Dollar Cat]]'' and ''[[Busy Buddies]]'', were not included) under the name ''[[Tom and Jerry: Classic Collection]]''. Almost all of the shorts contain re-dubbed Mammy Two-Shoes tracks. Despite these cuts, ''His Mouse Friday'', the only ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoon to be completely taken off the airwaves in some countries due to claims of racism, is included, unedited with the exception of zooming-in as on the North American set. These are regular TV prints sent from the U.S. in the 1990s. Shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in [[pan and scan]]. ''[[Mouse Cleaning]]'' and ''[[Casanova Cat]]'' are presented uncut as part of these sets.

''[[Tom and Jerry: Classic Collection]]'' is available in six double-sided DVDs (issued in the United Kingdom) and 12 single-layer DVDs (issued throughout Western Europe). Another ''Tom and Jerry'' [[DVD region code|Region]] 2 DVD set is available in Japan. As with ''Tom and Jerry:Classic Collection'' in Western Europe, almost all of the shorts (including ''His Mouse Friday'') contain cuts. ''[[Slicked-up Pup]]'', ''[[Tom's Photo Finish]]'', ''[[Busy Buddies]]'', ''[[The Egg and Jerry]]'', ''[[Tops with Pops]]'' and ''[[Feedin' the Kiddie]]'' are excluded from these sets. However, most of these cartoons are included in the UK version.
