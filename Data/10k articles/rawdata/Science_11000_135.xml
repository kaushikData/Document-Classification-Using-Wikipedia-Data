'''50 Things That Made the Modern Economy''' began as a weekly economic history [[Radio documentary|documentary radio]] series on the [[BBC World Service]] presented by economist and journalist [[Tim Harford]]. The first episode was broadcast on Saturday 5 November 2016, and all episodes are available as [[podcast]]s.

Harford explained his motivation "to paint a picture of economic change by telling the stories of the ideas, people, and tools that had far-reaching consequences". He was fascinated by the many unexpected outcomes, such as "the impact of the fridge on global politics, or of the gramophone on income inequality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/51st-thing-that-made-the-modern-economy "BBC World Service invites suggestions for the ’51st Thing’ that made the modern economy"], ''[[BBC World Service]]'', 19 August 2017. Retrieved on 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was subsequently released by Harford as a book titled '''Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy''' in the UK published by [[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown Books]], and as '''Fifty Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy''' in the US published by [[Riverhead Books]]. The hardcover and eBook editions were released on 6 July 2017 in the UK and the US edition was released on 29 August 2017. A paperback edition has been announced for May 2018.

A public call was made for suggestions for a '''51st thing''' in August 2017. Harford chose his six favourite submissions for an online vote from late September to 6 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|title=Vote for the 51st Thing!|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005133320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|archive-date=5 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning item was announced as the [[Credit Card]] in an episode released on 28 October 2017.

Each of the nine-minute long programmes introduces the story of fifty products or inventions that have revolutionised the modern world.

The '''A307 road''' runs {{convert|13.2|mi|km}} through SW London and NW Surrey.  It is primary at the north-east end; the remainder is non-primary, generally superseded in the mid-twentieth century in two stages by newer alignments of the [[Portsmouth Road]], the Kingston bypass and Esher bypass of the [[A3 road (Great Britain)|A3 road]] which runs along a slightly oblique axis.

==Route==

===London Borough of Richmond Upon Thames, Greater London - Kew and Richmond===

It begins at the junction with the A205 South Circular Road beside [[Kew|Kew Green]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.4827|-0.2869|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A307 road (northern end)}})}}, where it is named Kew Road. It then runs towards [[Richmond, London|Richmond upon Thames or Richmond, London]], through the west of Kew. At the junction with the A316 in Richmond it becomes a non-primary A-road through the town centre then heads through [[Petersham, London|Petersham]] where for fewer than 100 metres it kinks west and then travels south through [[Ham, London|Ham]].  A [[B roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B-class road]], the B353, leaves the A307 in Kew and runs around the town centre and up Richmond Hill and by-passing Richmond, before rejoining the A307 at Petersham.

===Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, Greater London - Kingston upon Thames, Surbiton and part of Long Ditton===

It bisects the north of the town before becoming the western half of the one-way system in [[Kingston upon Thames]]. Here it is briefly merged with the A308.   It leads south to the northern end of the [[A240 road|A240]], for 200m travels west to the River Thames, and resuming south becomes at last the old version of the [[Portsmouth Road]] (which is also its name here). It runs next to the [[River Thames]], heading through [[Surbiton, London, England|Surbiton]]. It passes a junction with the A243, shortly before exiting the borough at [[Seething Wells]] there next to [[Long Ditton]].

===Thames Ditton, Esher and Cobham, Surrey===  

The Thames which is curved alongside [[Thames Ditton]] veers away from its now almost straight south-west course; the road passes through [[Hinchley Wood]], going through the [[Scilly Isles, Surrey|Scilly Isles roundabout]] with the [[A309 road|A309]]. It forms the [[High Street]] of [[Esher]], crosses the A3 (new Portsmouth Road) by way of a bridge north of Cobham, before terminating near a junction of the A3 in [[Cobham, Surrey|Cobham]] {{nowrap|({{coord|51.3321|-0.4178|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A307 road (southern end)}}),}} which is generally also known as Portsmouth Road.

==History and events==
The A307 follows the old route of the Portsmouth Road, particularly the section south of the junction with the [[A308 road|A308]]. Since two major projects of the 1930s and 1960s respectively the Portsmouth Road, the [[A3 road|A3 (Portsmouth Road)]] of today, has been diverted away from towns/villages instead through [[buffer zone|buffer land]] {{convert|1|mi}} or more from urban centres and is a tripled or dualled (duplicated as described at the time) in each direction.

[[Robert Clive]] ("Clive of India") diverted it slightly believing it ran too close to his house at [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]], the Landscape Garden of which remains and which it still borders.

A [[watchmen (law enforcers)|watchman's]] box that also served as a [[village lock-up]], dating from 1787 is next to the 'Fox &amp; Duck' in Petersham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/hamandpetersham.com/www/thehamlock-up |title=The Petersham Lock-Up |publisher=Ham and Petersham Association|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for the north section, Kew Road and Richmond Road, passed from the crown to the [[Crown Commissioner|Commissioner of Works]] under the [[Crown Lands Act 1851]].

===In living memory===
The A307 was closed during 1979 and 1980 for a total of almost 18 months by the repeated collapse of a [[Sewerage|sewer]] and fresh water culvert in the road's narrowest section which is in Petersham, an ordeal referred to as the [[Petersham Hole]].  The route has sometimes been used from a few hundred metres south of the Richmond Gate of [[Richmond Park]] to Kingston as part of the [[London-Surrey cycle classic]] events routes, depending on the availability of Park Road, Kingston which avoids the hairpin and sharper descent at Richmond Gate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36069">'''Advanced Gemini''' is a number of proposals that would have extended the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] program by the addition of various missions, including [[human spaceflight|manned]] [[low Earth orbit]], [[circumlunar]] and [[moon landing|lunar landing]] missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by [[NASA]], and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as [[Agena Target Vehicle]]s, and allowing the crew to perform tethered [[Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]].

A range of applications were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, [[space station]] crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the [[Agena target vehicle]] on more powerful upper stages such as the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]], which could propel the spacecraft to the [[Moon]], to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it to land on the Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before [[Apollo program|Apollo]] was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.

Some of the Advanced Gemini proposals used "off-the-shelf" Gemini spacecraft, unmodified from the original program, while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew, dock with space stations, visit the Moon, and perform other mission objectives. Other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a [[parasail]] to the spacecraft, in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing.

==Background==
{{main|Project Gemini}}
[[File:Gemini 6 7.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Gemini 7]] in orbit|alt=A black and white spacecraft, with the Earth below it.]]
Gemini was the second American manned orbital spaceflight program, after [[Project Mercury|Mercury]]. It was intended to demonstrate technologies and techniques required for the [[Apollo program]], such as [[Extra-vehicular activity|extra-vehicular activities]], [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and docking, maneuvering in orbit and long duration flight.&lt;ref name="Titans"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Barton C.|author2=Grimwood, James M.|title=On The Shoulders of Titans|publisher=NASA History Office|year=1977|series=NASA History Series|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19780012208_1978012208.pdf|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gemini spacecraft]], which was built by [[McDonnell Aircraft]], was derived from the earlier [[Mercury spacecraft]], but modified to accommodate two [[astronaut]]s.&lt;ref name="Titans"/&gt; It was also equipped with a larger equipment module, allowing it to support longer missions, and maneuver in orbit. It was launched by the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket flying from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 19|Launch Complex 19]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;ref name="GFL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Joel W.|author2=LeBrun, Art|title=Go For Launch: An Illustrated History of Cape Canaveral|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Canada|year=2006|isbn=1-894959-43-4|pages=218–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, twelve missions were launched, ten of which were manned. Following two unmanned test flights, the first manned flight, [[Gemini 3]], was launched on 23 March 1965. The program concluded on 15 November 1966, with the successful recovery of [[Gemini 12]].&lt;ref name="Titans"/&gt;

Many other applications were envisaged for the Gemini spacecraft at various stages before, during, and after the two years in which it was used by NASA for manned spaceflight.&lt;ref name="PPDP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/data/6264gmcc.pdf|title=Preliminary Project Development Plan for an Advanced Manned Space Program Utilizing the Mark II Two Man Spacecraft|last=Space Task Group|date=1961-08-14|publisher=NASA|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA-GFamily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craftfam/gemini.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822151630/http://astronautix.com/craftfam/gemini.htm|archivedate=2008-08-22|title=Gemini |last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although none of these proposals ever made it into operation, many were considered seriously, and in some cases flight hardware was constructed prior to cancellation. In the case of the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]], a Gemini spacecraft was launched on a suborbital demonstration flight in support of the program.&lt;ref name="EA-G"/&gt; In some cases technology developed in the Advanced Gemini program has been reintegrated into other programs, such as components from the [[Titan III|Titan IIIM]], which was to have launched MOL, being used to upgrade other Titan rockets.&lt;ref name="EA-Titan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/t/titan.html|title=Titan|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military applications==
{{main|Blue Gemini|Manned Orbital Development System|Manned Orbital Laboratory&lt;!--|Gemini B--&gt;}}
[[File:Gemini-B 1.jpg|right|225px|thumb|The Gemini B spacecraft|alt=A spacecraft in a museum, displaying a United States Air Force color scheme]]
The [[United States Air Force]] intended to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed [[space stations]], the [[Manned Orbital Development System]] and later the [[Manned Orbital Laboratory]] (MOL).&lt;ref name="EA-G"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemini.htm|title=Gemini|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426032520/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemini.htm|archivedate=2009-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stations would have been launched by [[Titan IIIM]] rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, eliminating the need for rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the [[heat shield]] to allow access to the space station.&lt;ref name="EA-G"/&gt;

[[File:MOL Launch.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Launch of Gemini&amp;nbsp;B and OPS&amp;nbsp;0855|alt=A rocket launching]]
In order to give its astronauts experience before these programs started, the [[Blue Gemini]] program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions.&lt;ref name="Titans"/&gt; This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown a two-man [[Agena target vehicle|Agena]] rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions.&lt;ref name="TSR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/582/1|title=The Blue Gemini blues|last=Day|first=Dwayne A.|date=2006-03-20|publisher=The Space Review|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed missions included tests of the [[Astronaut Mobility Unit]] which was designed to assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a [[radar imaging]] system.&lt;ref name="TSR" /&gt;

[[File:MOL USAF.png|right|thumb|225px|Gemini separating from MOL in orbit|alt=Artist's impression of two spacecraft separating from each other, backdropped against the Earth]]
MOL Launches would have been conducted from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], and [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex 6]] at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a [[Titan IIIC]]. It consisted of the [[Gemini B]] spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the [[Gemini 2]] test flight, atop [[OPS 0855]], a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations would have been designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.

The MOL program was cancelled on 10 June 1969, in favor of unmanned reconnaissance satellites.&lt;ref name="EA-MOL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/mol.htm|title=MOL|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721035424/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/mol.htm|archivedate=2009-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems developed for the program were later used on unmanned missions, while the [[space suit]]s which were under development were transferred to NASA.&lt;ref name="EA-MOL"/&gt; The Titan IIIM rocket which was to launch MOL never flew, however some of the upgrades that were built into it were later used to upgrade other [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rockets — the stretched first and second stages became the [[Titan III|Titan 34]], which was used as the core of some later [[Titan IIIB]] flights, and on the [[Titan 34D]]. The seven-segment [[solid rocket booster]]s were later introduced on the [[Titan IV]]A.&lt;ref name="EA-Titan"/&gt;

==Gemini Ferry==
Several Gemini Ferry spacecraft were proposed to provide transportation of crews and cargo to NASA and USAF space stations in low Earth orbit. NASA contracted McDonnell to conduct a study into what modifications would be needed to allow the Gemini spacecraft to support this. Three spacecraft were envisioned; a manned spacecraft to transport crew to the stations, a manned spacecraft with a cargo module for both crew and cargo delivery, and a dedicated unmanned spacecraft to resupply the station every three or four months.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt;

The studies looked at minimizing required modifications to the Gemini spacecraft. Three docking methods were considered. The first was use of the existing docking system used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer could only have been accomplished by means of an [[Extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).&lt;ref name="MORL"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750069218_1975069218.pdf|title=Gemini Spacecraft Study for MORL Ferry Missions|date=1963-11-13|work=NASA Technical Reports Server|publisher=McDonnell Aircraft Corporation|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt; A second method would have seen the spacecraft dock in the same way, but after docking, the spacecraft would be swung round and attached to the side of the space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required.&lt;ref name="MORL" /&gt; The final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the docking port.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt;

A modified version of the spacecraft was proposed, which would have included a cargo module attached to the back of a modified equipment module.&lt;ref name="EA-GF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemferry.htm|title=Gemini Ferry|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft would have approached the station, and docked backwards using a port on the rear of the cargo module. If one of the forward docking configurations had been used for the Gemini itself, the docking would have been controlled remotely from the station, with the Gemini then separating from the cargo module and flying around the station to dock normally on a different port.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt; The rear-docking Gemini would have simply remained attached to the cargo module, with the crew boarding the station through it. Its docking would have been controlled by its own crew, from a station at the back of the cargo module.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt;

Two Gemini-derived spacecraft were considered for unmanned resupply flights. The first of these would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port at the front of the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt; The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt; The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.&lt;ref name="MORL"/&gt;

Crew-only or cargo-only supply missions would have been launched aboard a Titan II, and the [[Saturn I]] or [[Saturn IB]] would have been used for the combined crew and cargo spacecraft. Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's [[ejection seat]]s would not have been able to propel the crew far enough in the event of an explosion, so a [[Launch escape system|launch escape tower]] was proposed, based on the one used on the [[Mercury spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="MORL" /&gt; The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-GF"/&gt;

==Big Gemini==
{{main|Big Gemini}}
[[File:Big Gemini.png|right|200px|thumb|Big Gemini (Titan IIIG version)|alt=Drawing of a spacecraft which consists of a descent module, and a large cylindrical module behind it]]
[[Big Gemini]], or Big G, grew out of a 1963 proposal called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets.&lt;ref name="EA-Trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemsport.htm|title=Gemini Transport|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607025753/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemsport.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, and to be able to dock with space stations, in support of [[Apollo Applications Program|Apollo Applications]] and MOL missions. It would have been launched by a [[Heavy lift launch vehicle]]; either a [[Titan III|Titan IIIG]] or [[Saturn INT-20]], the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar payload capacity.&lt;ref name="EA-Big"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/bigemini.htm|title=Big Gemini|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611001322/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/bigemini.htm|archivedate=11 June 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape and mass of the spacecraft would have varied depending on the rocket that was to launch it. The Saturn-launched version had a short, conical cargo module, and a total mass of {{convert|47300|kg}} whereas the Titan IIIG-launched version featured a longer, cylindrical module, with a total mass of {{convert|59000|kg}}.&lt;ref name="EA-Big"/&gt; The Titan IIIM version would have been much shorter and lighter, with a mass of {{convert|15600|kg}}, as that rocket had less payload capacity than the Titan IIIG or Saturn.&lt;ref name="EA-Big"/&gt; The IIIG variant would have carried twelve crew, while the others had a maximum capacity of nine. Use of the NASA variant with the Apollo Service Module was also considered.&lt;ref name="EA-Big"/&gt;

Once in orbit, Big G would have docked with space stations using an Apollo docking probe mounted on the rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on the rear of the re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which would have been used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the [[launch escape system]] developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.

Big G would have made landings on land, using a [[parasail]] or [[paraglider]] to guide it onto a runway or dry lake, such as the one at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. It would have landed using skids derived from the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name="EA-Big"/&gt;

===Circumlunar missions===
[[File:GeminiCentaur.svg|right|thumb|330px|The Gemini-Centaur proposal for circumlunar missions|alt=Drawing of a spacecraft and a rocket stage docked together]]
A number of studies investigated sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the [[Transtage]], the second stage of a Titan II, four different types of [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]], including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the [[RM-81 Agena|Agena-D]], an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel.&lt;ref name="Hammersmith"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/data/gemlu64b.pdf|title=Advanced Gemini, Circumlunar Mission|last=Hammersmith|first=John L.|date=1964-04-03|publisher=NASA|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, while the Gemini would launch on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.

Other proposals involved launching the Gemini spacecraft on a Titan IIIC, and refueling in low Earth orbit before proceeding to the Moon,&lt;ref name="Hammersmith"/&gt; and a single launch architecture using a three-stage variant of the Saturn IB.&lt;ref name="Hammersmith"/&gt;

The Gemini-Centaur proposal was predicted to have been able to achieve a 72-hour circumlunar flight.&lt;ref name="Hammersmith"/&gt; The Centaur would have performed [[trans-lunar injection]], before separating from the Gemini spacecraft.

Some concerns were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's heat shield would not have been able to protect it during the higher speed [[ballistic reentry]] associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker heat shield and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several [[solid rocket motor]]s would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.&lt;ref name="Hammersmith"/&gt;

=== Lunar orbit missions ===
The Gemini spacecraft would have rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="AGMCS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/data/6407gmfo.pdf|title=Advanced Gemini Missions Conceptual Study|date=1964-07-30|publisher=NASA|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along which they would coast until they reached the Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.&lt;ref name="AGMCS"/&gt;

This architecture would have used a Titan II to launch the Gemini spacecraft, with a Saturn IB launching the upper stages.&lt;ref name="AGMCS"/&gt;

=== Lunar landing ===
[[File:Gemini LOR lander.svg|thumb|One of the early proposals for a lightweight one-man lander|alt=Drawing of a small spacecraft]]
Using the Gemini spacecraft for a manned Lunar landing was considered as early as the original [[Mercury Mark II]] proposal which led to the Gemini program.&lt;ref name="EA-LOR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemnilor.htm|title=Gemini LOR|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial proposal was for a [[Lunar orbit rendezvous]] mission, using a Gemini spacecraft and a lightweight, open cockpit lander, launched by a [[Saturn C-3]] rocket. It was the first time that Lunar orbit rendezvous was proposed as part of a lunar landing concept.&lt;ref name="EA-LOR"/&gt; The spacecraft would have been tested in Low Earth orbit before the Lunar missions, using two Titan II launches. The lander, which was designed by NASA's [[Langley Research Center]], would have had a mass of no more than {{convert|4372|kg}}. Some of the proposals had a mass as low as {{convert|1460|kg}}, with [[cryogenic propellant]]s being used in place of heavier [[hypergolic propellant]].&lt;ref name="EA-LOR"/&gt; The proposal was intended to provide a faster and lower-cost alternative to the Apollo program, which was at that time proposing a [[direct ascent]] landing.&lt;ref name="EA-LOR"/&gt;

Another proposal would have used a [[Saturn V]] to achieve a direct ascent mission profile.&lt;ref name="EA-LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemander.htm|title=Gemini Lunar Lander|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090605164346/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemander.htm| archivedate= 5 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft consisted of four modules. The Retrograde Module would have been powered by an [[RL10]] engine, and used to propel the spacecraft during the trans-lunar coast. During landing, it would be used for the initial phases of powered descent. At an altitude of {{convert|1800|m}} above the Lunar surface, the RM would have been jettisoned, and a second module, the Terminal Landing Module, would have performed the final descent.&lt;ref name="EA-LL"/&gt; After landing, the spacecraft would have stayed on the Moon for a day, before it was propelled back to Earth. Launch from the Lunar Surface and trans-Earth injection would have been performed by the Service Module, which would also have contained components of the life support system, and other systems which were located in the Equipment Module of the Earth orbit Gemini spacecraft. The Reentry Module was based on the Gemini capsule, but would have been modified to allow it to reenter the atmosphere at the higher velocity that would have been required by a Lunar flight.&lt;ref name="EA-LL"/&gt; It was seen as the last effort by NASA managers and engineers who still advocated the direct ascent mission profile, and was intended to be cheaper, faster and safer than the Apollo lunar orbit rendezvous technique.&lt;ref name="EA-LL"/&gt;

=== Apollo rescue ===
{{see also|Apollo program}}
Due to the risks associated with the Lunar landing, a number of rescue spacecraft were proposed, to be used to allow the crew of an Apollo mission to return to Earth safely in the event of a problem. Many of these designs were based around the Gemini spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemcraft.htm|title=Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these proposals was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, which was designed to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo.&lt;ref name="EA-LORV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemilorv.htm|title=Gemini LORV|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for Lunar orbit insertion and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth.&lt;ref name="EA-LORV"/&gt; Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.&lt;ref name="EA-LORV"/&gt;

Another proposed spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, was designed to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned [[Apollo landing site]], and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS.&lt;ref name="EA-LSSS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemelter.htm|title=Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, while the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-LSSS"/&gt; It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts while they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-LSSS"/&gt;

The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was intended to fly a direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], or from the [[Apollo Service Module]], would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt; The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt; The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt;

Following the [[Apollo 1]] fire in January 1967, NASA conducted a safety review of the Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule to make room for the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point while they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt; Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt; The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="EA-LSRS"/&gt;

==Other proposals==
A number of other applications were considered for the Gemini spacecraft.

===Manned Orbital Telescope===
The Manned Orbital Telescope was a proposal for a manned spacecraft for [[astronomy|astronomical]] or [[Sun|solar]] observation.&lt;ref name="Telescope"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660017399_1966017399.pdf|title=A System Study of a Manned Orbital Telescope|date=October 1965|work=NASA Technical Reports Server|publisher=Boeing|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and would have been launched on a Saturn IB.&lt;ref name="EA-GO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gematory.htm|title=Gemini Observatory|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607030010/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gematory.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which would have been used to rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module. The larger capsule would have been used to accommodate the crew of the spacecraft which required rescuing.&lt;ref name="EA-RG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/resemini.htm|title=Rescue Gemini|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607025819/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/resemini.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite===
Another proposed mission would have seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a [[Pegasus (satellite)|Pegasus]] satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have either been launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, and then one of the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels.&lt;ref name="EA-Intercept"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemector.htm|title=Gemini Satellite Inspector|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607030018/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemector.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.&lt;ref name="EA-Intercept"/&gt;

===Gemini Paraglider===
[[File:Gemini paraglider.JPG|right|thumb|alt=A spacecraft on wheels, suspended from a large triangular wing, in flight close to the ground.|Gemini [[paraglider]]]]
Several missions were proposed to demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft had originally been designed to land using a flexible [[Rogallo wing]] and a set of skis or wheels,&lt;ref name="ParagliderReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680072651_1968072651.pdf|title=Paraglider Landing System Test Program Final Report|date=December 1965|work=NASA Technical Reports Server|publisher=North American Aviation|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this was abandoned in favor of [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]]s under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing.&lt;ref name="ParagliderWane"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Barton C.|author2=Grimwood, James M.|title=On The Shoulders of Titans|publisher=NASA History Office|year=1977|edition=Online|series=NASA History Series|chapter=Paraglider on the Wane|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch7-3.htm|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ParagliderCancelled"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hacker|first=Barton C.|author2=Grimwood, James M.|title=On The Shoulders of Titans|publisher=NASA History Office|year=1977|edition=Online|series=NASA History Series|chapter=Titan II Makes the Grade, But Not Paraglider|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4203/ch8-2.htm|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would have landed this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.&lt;ref name="EA-GP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemlider.htm|title=Gemini Paraglider|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607025747/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gemlider.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Winged Gemini===
Another alternative landing concept was the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="EA-WG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/winemini.htm|title=Winged Gemini|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607025824/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/winemini.htm|archivedate=7 June 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal arose soon after the cancellation of the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]], and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached to a set of wings developed during the [[ASSET (spaceplane)|ASSET]] program.&lt;ref name="EA-WG"/&gt; This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a [[Titan IIIA]] or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five [[solid rocket motor]]s.&lt;ref name="EA-WG"/&gt;

===Long-duration missions===
There were also proposals to use the Gemini spacecraft to conduct long-duration missions to small, purpose-built space stations in low-Earth orbit. One proposal saw a space station based on the Agena, which would have been used to provide propulsion and attitude control for the station. A pressurized module between the Agena and the docking adapter would have been used by the crew for accommodation and to conduct experiments. The crew would have boarded the Agena by means of an inflatable tunnel between the hatches and its airlock.&lt;ref name="EA-ED"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/extemini.htm|title=Extended Mission Gemini|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607030000/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/extemini.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pecan (spacecraft)|Pecan]] spacecraft was a similar proposal.&lt;ref name="EA-GPN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gempecan.htm|title=Gemini Pecan|last=Wade|first=Mark|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=2009-07-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607030029/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/gempecan.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Anticipatory Systems''''' &lt;ref&gt;''Anticipatory Systems: Philosophical, Mathematical, and  Methodological Foundations'', Robert Rosen, 2nd edition, with contributions by Judith Rosen, John J. Klineman and Mihai Nadin, 2012, lx + 472 pp., Springer, New York {{ISBN|978-1-4614-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], conceived in the 1970s and published for the first time in 1985. The book describes the way that biological systems anticipate the environment. The book draws from mathematics, in particular [[category theory]], in describing the way systems can anticipate.

The first five chapters of the book are about modeling: Rosen shows that natural systems, physical things in the world, are modeled by formal systems, which are at their heart mathematical. These formal systems simulate the natural systems. But in order to provide anticipatory knowledge, they must produce predictions ahead of the predicted phenomena.

== Publication History ==
The first edition of ''Anticipatory Systems'' was published in 1985 by [[Pergamon Press]]. The second edition of ''Anticipatory Systems'' was published in 2012 by [[Springer (publisher)|Springer]].

== Publication details ==
The second edition includes a fifty-page prolegomena by [[Mihai Nadin]], as well as contributions by Judith Rosen and [[John J. Kineman]]. The book is the 27th volume in the International Federation for Systems Research International Series on Systems Science and Engineering, a series edited by [[George Klir]].

== Critical reception ==
A review &lt;ref&gt;E. Minch, A Review of Anticipatory Systems, ''[[International Journal of General Systems]]'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; by Eric Minch of the first edition called the book "radical and profound".

== Related work ==
Rosen followed this book with a text called ''Life Itself'' that discussed the mathematical, scientific, and ethical issues related to generating artificial life.

A. H. Louie, one of Rosen's students, published a tutorial article on the book, explaining, among other things, the mathematical concepts behind the book &lt;ref&gt;A.H. Louie, (2010) "Robert Rosen's anticipatory systems", ''Foresight'', Vol. 12 Iss: 3, pp.18 - 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Errata for the first  edition ==
Conjunction and disjunction terms are reversed in the text, pages 60–68, but the mathematical expressions are correct.

Footnote 8 missing from page 384: probably the reference on 382 should be to footnote 7.

Pages 327 and 328 are swapped.

'''''Blindness''''' ({{lang-pt|Ensaio sobre a cegueira}}, meaning ''Essay on Blindness'') is a [[novel]] by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] author [[José Saramago]]. It is one of his most famous novels, along with ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]''. In 1998, Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and ''Blindness'' was one of his works noted by the committee when announcing the award.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Plot summary==
''Blindness'' is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of [[blindness]] afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortunes of a handful of characters who are among the first to be stricken and centers on "the doctor's wife," her husband, several of his patients, and assorted others, who are thrown together by chance. After lengthy and traumatic quarantine in an asylum, the group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the unexplained good fortune that the doctor’s wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures.

The first part of the novel follows the experiences of the central characters in the filthy, overcrowded asylum where they and other blind people have been quarantined. Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside.

Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuse to allow in basic medicines, so that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing a break out, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting upon food delivery.

Conditions degenerate further as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to rape and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees battle each other and burn down the asylum, only to discover that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive.

The story then follows the doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” as they attempt to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.

=== The doctor's wife===

The doctor's wife is the only character in the entire novel who does not lose her sight. This phenomenon remains unexplained in the novel. Unwilling to leave her husband to be interned, she lies to the doctors and claims to be blind. At this point she is interned with the rest of the afflicted. Once inside, she attempts to help the compound organize, but she is increasingly unable to hold back the animality of the compound. When one ward begins withholding food and demanding that the women of other wards submit to being raped in return for food, she kills the leader of their ward. Once they escape the compound, she helps her group survive in the city. The doctor's wife is the de facto leader of their small group, although in the end she often serves their disabled needs.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blindness/study-guide/character-list |title=Blindness Characters |publisher=GradeSaver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The doctor===

The doctor is an ophthalmologist stricken blind after treating a patient with what will come to be called "the white sickness". He is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Much of this really comes from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is going on on the ward and relay this to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor's office when the epidemic begins to spread.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The girl with the dark glasses ===

The girl with the dark glasses is a former part-time prostitute who is struck blind while with a customer. She seemingly contracted the “white-blindness” while visiting the doctor due to conjunctivitis (hence the dark glasses). She is unceremoniously removed from the hotel and taken to the quarantine. Once inside, she joins the small group of people who were contaminated at the doctor's office. When the car thief gropes her on the way to the lavatory, she kicks him – giving him a wound from which he will eventually die. While inside, she also takes care of the boy with the squint, whose mother is nowhere to be found. At the end of the story, she and the old man with the black eye patch become lovers.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The old man with the black eye patch ===

The old man with the black eye patch is the last person to join the first ward. He brings with him a portable transistor radio that allows the internees to listen to the news. He is also the main architect of the failed attack on the ward of hoodlums hoarding the food rations. Once the group escapes the quarantine, the old man becomes the lover of the girl with the dark glasses.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The dog of tears ===

The dog of tears is a dog that joins the small group of blind when they leave the quarantine. While he is mostly loyal to the doctor's wife, he helps the whole group by protecting them all from packs of dogs who are becoming more feral by the day. He is called the dog of tears because he became attached to the group when he licked the tears off the face of the doctor's wife.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The boy with the squint ===

The boy with the squint was a patient of the doctor's, which is most likely how he became infected. He is brought to the quarantine without his mother and soon falls in with the group in the first ward. The girl with the dark glasses feeds him and takes care of him like a mother.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The car thief ===

After the first blind man was struck blind in traffic, a car thief brought him home and, subsequently stole his car. Soon after he went blind, the car thief and the first blind man re-encounter one another in the quarantine, where they soon come to blows. They have no time to resolve their issues, though, since the car thief is the first internee killed by the guards. He is gunned down while trying to ask the guards for medication for his infected leg.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The first blind man ===

The first man to go blind is struck blind in the middle of traffic, waiting at a stoplight. He is immediately taken home and then to the doctor's office, where he infects all of the other patients. He is one of the principal members of the first ward - the ward with all of the original internees. He is also the first to regain his sight, when the epidemic is finally over.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The first blind man's wife ===

The wife of the first blind man goes blind soon after helping her husband to the quarantine. They are reunited by pure chance in the quarantine. Once inside, she also joins the first ward with the doctor and the doctor's wife. When the ward of hoodlums begins to demand that the women sleep with them in order to be fed, the first blind man's wife volunteers to go, in solidarity with the others.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The man with the gun ===

The man with the gun is the leader of the ward of hoodlums that seizes control of the food supply in the quarantine. He and his ward take the rations by force and threaten to shoot anyone who doesn't comply. This ward extorts valuables from the other internees in exchange for food and, when the bracelets and watches run out, they begin to rape the women. He is later stabbed to death by the doctor's wife.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The blind accountant ===

This man is not one of those afflicted by the "white sickness"—rather he has been blind since birth. He is the only one in the ward who can read and write braille and who knows how to use a walking stick. Additionally, he is the second in command to the man with the gun in the ward of hoodlums. When the doctor's wife kills the man with the gun, the blind accountant takes the gun and tries to seize control but he is unable to rally support. He dies when one of the rape victims sets fire to the ward.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

==Style==
Like most works by Saramago, the novel contains many long, breathless sentences in which commas take the place of periods, quotation marks, semicolons and colons. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue means that the speakers' identities (or the fact that dialogue is occurring) may not be immediately apparent to the reader. The lack of [[proper noun|proper]] character names in ''Blindness'' is typical of many of Saramago's novels (e.g. ''[[All the Names]]''). The characters are instead referred to by descriptive appellations such as "the doctor's wife", "the car thief", or "the first blind man". Given the characters' blindness, some of these names seem ironic ("the boy with the squint" or "the girl with the dark glasses").

The city afflicted by the blindness is  never named, nor the country specified. Few definite identifiers of culture are given, which contributes an element of timelessness and universality to the novel. Some signs hint that the country is Saramago's homeland of [[Portugal]]: the main character is shown eating [[chouriço]], a spicy sausage, and some dialogue in the original [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] employs the [[T-V distinction|familiar "tu" second-person singular]] verb form (a distinction absent in most of [[Brazil]]). The church, with all its saintly images, is likely of the Catholic variety.

==Sequel and adaptation==
Saramago wrote a sequel to ''Blindness'' in 2004, titled ''[[Seeing (novel)|Seeing]]'' (''Ensaio sobre a lucidez'', literal English translation ''Essay on lucidity''), which has also been translated into English. The new novel takes place in the same country featured in ''Blindness'' and features several of the same characters.

An English-language [[Blindness (2008 film)|film adaptation of ''Blindness'']] was directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]].  Filming began in July 2007 and stars [[Mark Ruffalo]] as the doctor and [[Julianne Moore]] as the doctor's wife. The film opened the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

An outdoor performance adaptation by the Polish group [[Teatr KTO]], was first presented in June 2010.  It has since been performed at a number of venues,  including the [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College Quad]] of Edinburgh University during the 2012 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

Shortly before his death, Saramago gave German composer Anno Schreier the rights to compose an opera based on the novel. The libretto is written in German by Kerstin Maria Pöhler. Like the German translation of the novel, the opera's title is "Die Stadt der Blinden". It saw its first performance on November 12, 2011 at the [[Zurich Opera House]].

The main concepts of the '''Cannon–Bard theory''' are that emotional expression results from the function of [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamic structures]], and emotional feeling results from stimulations of the dorsal thalamus. The physiological changes and subjective feeling of an emotion in response to a stimulus are separate and independent; arousal does not have to occur before the emotion. Thus, the [[Thalamus|thalamic region]] is attributed a major role in this theory of emotion. The theory is therefore also referred to as the '''thalamic theory of emotion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=1Yn6NZgxvssC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=cannon+bard+theory+thalamic+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rCnIHr8t4K&amp;sig=fCIXhduavPxplh1godQ0Oc7qT-o&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cannon%20bard%20theory%20thalamic%20theory&amp;f=false |title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories |last=J.E. Roeckelein |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |isbn=9780080460642 |pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Walter Bradford Cannon]] (1871–1945) was a [[Physiology|physiologist]] at [[Harvard|Harvard University]], who is perhaps best known for his classic treatise on [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Friedman 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=B.H.|title=Feelings and the body: The Jamesian perspective on autonomic specificity of emotion|journal=Biological Psychology|year=2010|volume=84|pages=383–393|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2009.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Bard (1898–1977) was a doctoral student of Cannon's, and together they developed a model of [[emotion]] called the Cannon–Bard Theory.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Physiological Society|title=Philip Bard|url=http://the-aps.org/fm/presidents/intropb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cannon was an experimenter who relied on studies of animal physiology.  Through these studies, Cannon and Bard highlighted the role of the brain in generating [[Physiology|physiological responses]] and feelings; a role that is important in their explanation of emotion experience and production.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2010" /&gt;

A dominant theory of emotion of Cannon's time was the [[James–Lange theory]] of emotion, and Cannon recognized that to test this theory, an examination of emotional expression with no visceral afferent feedback was required.  This was necessary because the link between visceral changes and the feedback required to stimulate cerebral manifestations of an emotion would no longer be present.&lt;ref name="McCarty 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarty|first=R.|title=Encyclopedia of Stress|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=9780123739476|pages=62–64|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739476001604|edition=2nd|authorlink=Fight-or-flight response}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, Cannon experimented with severing [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent nerves]] of the [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic branch]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in cats.  Cannon compiled his experimental results in 1915, then refined and expanded them, and finally proposed his model of emotion as a challenge and alternative to the James–Lange theory of emotion.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2010" /&gt;

The James–Lange theory&lt;ref name="James 1922"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=W.|title=The emotions|year=1922|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.|location=Baltimore|author2=C.G. Lange}}&lt;/ref&gt;  relies on the backflow of impulses from the periphery to account for unique emotional experiences; impulses that [[William James]] assumed to come from all parts of the organism, including the muscles, skin, and the [[Viscus|viscera]]. The viscera were attributed a major role by James.  The [[Viscus|viscera]] are composed of smooth muscle and glands.  Cannon identified and outlined five issues with the James–Lange theory's notion of the vasomotor center as the explanation of emotional experience.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=W.B.|title=The James-Lange theory of emotions: A critical examination and an alternative theory|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=1927|volume=39|pages=106–124|doi=10.2307/1415404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalgleish 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalgleish|first=T.|title=The emotional brain|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|year=2004|volume=5|issue=7|pages=582–589|doi=10.1038/nrn1432|pmid=15208700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Total separation of the viscera from the central nervous system does not alter emotional behaviour.
#:In an experiment, cats were kept alive and healthy after having their sympathetic nervous systems completely removed.  Removal of this system resulted in the abolishment of all the reactions under control of the [[vasomotor center]], the region that the James–Lange theory purported to be responsible for emotional experiences.  However, it was found that destroying these functions had little or no effect on the animals' emotional responses.  The cats displayed the typical signs of rage in response to a barking dog, and the animals displayed full emotional expression in all organs that had not had their connections to the brain destroyed.&lt;ref name="Friedman 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt;
# The same visceral changes occur in very different emotional states and in non-emotional states.
#:The [[sympathetic nervous system]] functions as a single unit.  Visceral changes brought on/caused by sympathetic nervous system action include: increased heart rate; contraction of arterioles; dilatation of bronchioles; increased levels of blood sugar; sweating; widening of the pupils and erection of hairs; and discharge of adrenin.  These physiological changes can be seen in great excitement under any circumstances, including in distinguishable emotional states such as fear and rage, as well as situations of fever, asphyxia, and exposure to cold temperatures.  Cannon articulated that these responses of the [[Viscus|viscera]] are too uniform to offer a means of distinguishing emotions that have varying subjective qualities.  He postulated that if emotions were the result of impulses from the viscera, we could expect fear, rage, chilliness, asphyxia, and fever to feel similarly, which is not the case. 
#The viscera are relatively insensitive structures.
#:Cannon wrote that there is a common belief that the more deeply the body is penetrated, the more sensitive it becomes; however, this is not the case.  In the nerves distributed to the viscera the [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent sensory fibers]] may be only 1/10th as numerous as the efferent sensory fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langley|first=J.N.|author2=H.K. Anderson|title=The constituents of the hypogastric nerves|journal=Journal of Physiology|year=1894|volume=17|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, in the case of the viscera, we are unaware of the contractions and relaxations of the digestive processes.  Such processes are undemonstrative and beyond our physical awareness, even when marked changes are induced in them.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt; 
# Visceral changes are too slow to be a source of emotional feeling.
#:As previously stated, the viscera are composed of [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] and glands, which are typically sluggish in their responses.  It has been found that the latent period of the psychogalvanic response in man is approximately 3 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wells|first=F.L.|author2=A. Forbes|title=On certain electrical processes in the human body and their relations to emotional reactions|year=1911|volume=2|issue=16|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has also been noted that the latent period of affective responses to photos of men and women can end within 0.8 seconds.  The James–Lange theory contends that such affective responses result from reverberations from the viscera.  Cannon pointed out that the time required for nerve impulses to travel from the brain to the periphery and back to the brain again could not occur quickly enough to be the cause of such emotional responses.  
# Artificial induction of the visceral changes typical of strong emotions does not produce them.
#:When adrenalin is injected it induces the physiological responses typical of sympathetic nervous system activity previously discussed (dilation of bronchioles, constriction of blood vessels, increased blood sugar etc.).  These changes are typical of intense emotional states.  Therefore, if these visceral changes were artificially induced by the injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenalin]], one would expect the emotions to follow, as articulated by the James–Lange theory of emotion.  When this experiment was done, participants experienced no specific emotions.  However, it was found that an emotional response may develop only when the adrenalin as injected subsequent to discussing with patients their sick children or their dead parents.  Thus, injection of adrenalin had an effect when an emotional mood already existed in participants.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt;

==Further criticisms of the James–Lange theory==

William James argued that there were either special centers for cerebral processes that accompany emotion, or they occurred in the ordinary motor and sensory centers of the cortex.&lt;ref name="James 1922" /&gt;  Cannon responded by positing that there may not be one or the other, that there may be cortical processes and special centers that accompany emotional responses.  He outlined two ideas regarding the existence of two sources of cerebral processes of emotions.

;Emotional expression results from action of subcortical centers.

Cannon summarized research done by Bechterev regarding emotional expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bechterev|first=W.|title=Die bedeutung der sehhugel auf grund von experimentellen und pathologischen daten|journal=Virchows Archiv|year=1887|volume=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this research, it was argued that emotional expression must be independent of the cortex because the expression of emotions cannot always be inhibited or controlled (e.g. laughing from being tickled) because visceral changes occur independent of our control, and because these responses, which cannot be inhibited, are seen soon after birth before cortical management is developed.  Furthermore, after cerebral hemispheres were removed from animal test subjects, correct affective responses could be elicited by appropriate stimulations.  These emotional effects were no longer present when the optic [[thalamus]] was removed from the animals; thus, it was concluded that this region plays a significant role in the expression of emotions.
[[File:Diencephalon small.gif|thumb|left|Location of the human [[diencephalon]] (red), a brain area implicated in the [[sham rage]] response in cats studied by Cannon and Britton.]]
To further support the assertion that emotional expression results from action of subcortical centers, Cannon and Britton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=W.B.|author2=S.W. Britton|title=Pseudoaffective medulliadrenal secretion|journal=American Journal of Physiology|year=1925|volume=72|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed further experimental research with cats. Cats were decorticated, and after a period of recovery they spontaneously displayed the behaviours characteristic of intense fury.  This response, referred to as [[sham rage]], continued to be displayed after ablation of all brain regions anterior to the diencephalon.&lt;ref name="Dalgleish 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pribram 1969"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinken|first=P.J.|title=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|year=1969|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Group|location=Amsterdam|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once the lower posterior portion of the thalamic region was removed, the display of sham rage by the cats subsided.  Based on this finding, it was concluded that the thalamus was a region from which, in the absence of cortical control, impulses are discharged which evoke an extreme degree of "emotional" activity, both muscular and visceral.
Based on these findings and observations, Cannon asserts that the optic thalamus is a region in the brain responsible for the neural organization for the different emotional expressions.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt;

;Thalamic processes are a source of affective experience.

There are numerous reported and cited cases of patients with unilateral [[lesion]]s in the thalamus region who have a tendency to react excessively to affective [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. For example, pin pricks, painful pressure, and excessive heat or cold all cause more distress on the damaged side of the body as compared to the normal side.&lt;ref name="Pribram 1969" /&gt; Similar results can be observed from agreeable stimuli: warmth stimuli may cause intense pleasure, demonstrated by facial expressions of enjoyment and exclamations of delight by the individual. The increased influence of stimuli resulting in excessive responses was attributed to the release of the thalamus from cortical inhibition.  When the thalamus is released from cortical control, the affective states and responses are increased; thus, it was concluded that the thalamic region is occupied with the affective component of sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Head|first=Henry|title=Studies in Neurology|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cannon 1931"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=W.B.|title=Again the James-Lange and the thalamic theories of emotion|journal=Psychological Review|year=1931|volume=38|pages=281–295|doi=10.1037/h0072957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cannon–Bard theory==
[[File:Cerebrum animation small.gif|thumb|Location of the human cerebrum (red).]]
Based on the previous discussion of the purported faults regarding the James–Lange theory of emotion's explanation, Cannon put forward a theory of emotion based on thalamic processes.

According to Cannon, an external stimulus activates receptors and this excitation starts impulses toward the cortex.  Upon arriving in the cortex, the impulses are associated with conditioned processes that determine the direction of the subsequent response.  It is this response that stimulates the thalamic processes.  Once the thalamic processes are activated, they are ready to discharge.  The thalamic neurons fire in a special combination in a given emotional expression.  These neurons then discharge precipitately and intensely.  Cannon wrote that within and near the thalamus, the neurons responsible for an emotional expression lie close to the relay in the sensory path from the periphery to the cortex, and when these neurons fire in a particular combination they innervate muscles and viscera and excite afferent paths to the cortex by direct connection or irradiation.

The key component of the Cannon–Bard theory of emotion is that when the thalamic discharge occurs, the bodily changes occur almost simultaneously with the emotional experience. The bodily changes and emotional experience occur separately and independently of one another; physiological arousal does not have to precede emotional expression or experience.  The theory asserts that the thalamic region is the brain area responsible for emotional responses to experienced stimuli.&lt;ref name="Dalgleish 2004" /&gt;

Cannon summarises the observations that serve as the basis for his theory of emotion which claims the thalamic region is the coordinating center for emotional reactions.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1931" /&gt;  First, after the removal of the [[cerebrum]] [[anterior]] to the thalamus in animal test subjects, the animals continue to display rage-like emotional responses.  These reactions cease when the thalamus is then removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bard|first=P.|title=A diencephalic mechanism for the expression of rage with special reference to the sympathetic nervous system|journal=American Journal of Physiology|year=1928|volume=84|pages=490–516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, a tumor on one side of the thalamus can result in unilateral laughter or grimace under the appropriate conditions, although cortical and voluntary control of the same muscles is bilateral.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt;  Lastly, temporary impairment of cortical control of lower centers from light amnesia or permanent impairment by disease (e.g. tumor or lesion) can cause uncontrollable and prolonged weeping or laughing.&lt;ref name="Cannon 1927" /&gt;

==Additional theories of emotion==
[[File:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|thumb|The location of the [[limbic system]], the key brain area in the [[Papez circuit|Papez-MacLean theory of emotion]].]]
The Cannon–Bard theory of emotion was formulated as a challenge and alternative to James–Lange theory. The [[Papez circuit|Papez-Maclean theory]] is another influential theory of emotion that differs from the Cannon–Bard theory in terms of the area that is considered to be responsible for emotion expression.  [[James Papez]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papez|first=J.|title=A proposed mechanism of emotion|journal=Archives of Neurological Psychiatry|year=1937|volume=38|pages=725–743|doi=10.1001/archneurpsyc.1937.02260220069003}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially suggested that the interconnections among structures of the [[limbic system]] were ideally constituted to handle the long-lasting, intense aspects of experience that are typically associated with emotion.&lt;ref name="Pribram 1969" /&gt;
The [[Papez circuit|circuit]] originally proposed by Papez consisted of the [[hippocampus]], the ipsilateral mammillary body, the [[Anterior nuclei of thalamus|anterior nucleus of the thalamus]], the [[cingulate cortex]], the [[parahippocampal gyrus]], and the [[entorhinal cortex]], returning to the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mesulam|first=M|title=Principles of cognitive and behavioral neurology|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul D.

There is also the [[two-factor theory of emotion]], as proposed by [[Stanley Schachter]] and [[Jerome E. Singer]].

The '''characteristic time''' is an estimate of the order of magnitude of the reaction time scale of a system.  It can loosely be defined as the inverse of the reaction rate.  In chemistry, the characteristic time is used to determine whether the problem needs to be solved as an equilibrium problem or a kinetic problem.

* For [[RC circuit]]s, the characteristic time is the time the [[capacitor]] takes to discharge by 1/''e'' (approximately 63%) of the way to the final voltage.
* In various fields of [[physics]] and [[astrophysics]], the characteristic or [[relaxation time]] refers to the time needed for a system to relax under external stimuli.

'''Citizen Design Science''' is the combination of [[Citizen Science]] and [[Design science|Design Science]]. Design Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckminster Fuller Institute|title=Design Science|url=https://bfi.org/design-science|website=BFI.org|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is known since the early 1960s when [[Buckminster Fuller]] defined it as systematic designing, whereas half a decade later [[Herbert A. Simon]] saw it more as the study of the design process. The term Citizen Science emerged in the 1990s as work that citizens of all ages and backgrounds conduct under the guidance of scientists, collecting data or inventing processes or artefacts. A contemporary example is the [[Zooniverse (citizen science project)|Zooniverse]] platform that enables people to “contribute to real discoveries in fields ranging from astronomy to zoology”.
Citizen Design Science is a combination of both concepts for urban systems: it adds the combination of human observation, cognition, experience and local knowledge into a scientific framework that improves the planning, design, management and transformation of buildings and cities. Design Science contributes the methods and instruments, Citizen Science adds data and inventions. Thus, Citizen Design Science bundles individual observations and inventions into a bottom up flow of data and information to improve the planning and functioning of a city. As such this concept is taught at [[ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture|ETH Zurich]] and online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mooc-List|title=FC-01x Future Cities|url=https://www.mooc-list.com/course/fc-01x-future-cities-edx?static=true|website=Mooc-List|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Confocal microscopy''', most frequently '''confocal laser scanning microscopy''' ('''CLSM''') or '''laser confocal scanning microscopy''' ('''LCSM'''), is an optical imaging technique for increasing [[optical resolution]] and [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] of a [[micrograph]] by means of using a [[Spatial filter|spatial pinhole]] to block out-of-focus light in image formation.&lt;ref name=Pawley_2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Pawley JB (editor) |title=Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2006 |edition = 3rd  |isbn=0-387-25921-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures (a process known as [[optical sectioning]]) within an object. This technique is used extensively in the scientific and industrial communities and typical applications are in [[life sciences]], [[semiconductor]] inspection and [[materials science]].

Light travels through the sample under a conventional microscope as far into the specimen as it can penetrate, while a confocal microscope only focuses a smaller beam of light at one narrow depth level at a time. The CLSM achieves a controlled and highly limited [[depth of focus]].

== Basic concept ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Minsky Confocal Reflection Microscope.png|thumb|Confocal point sensor principle from Minsky's patent]]
The principle of confocal imaging was patented in 1957 by [[Marvin Minsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Filed in 1957 and granted 1961. {{cite patent|US|3013467}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aims to overcome some limitations of traditional wide-field [[fluorescence microscope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/ConfocalMemoir.html Memoir on Inventing the Confocal Scanning Microscope], ''Scanning'' '''10''' (1988), pp128–138.&lt;/ref&gt; In a conventional (i.e., wide-field) [[fluorescence microscope]], the entire [[Laboratory specimen|specimen]] is flooded evenly in light from a light source. All parts of the specimen in the optical path are excited at the same time and the resulting [[fluorescence]] is detected by the microscope's [[photodetector]] or [[camera]] including a large unfocused background part. In contrast, a confocal microscope uses point illumination (see [[Point Spread Function]]) and a pinhole in an optically conjugate plane in front of the detector to eliminate out-of-focus signal – the name "confocal" stems from this configuration. As only light produced by fluorescence very close to the [[focal plane]] can be detected, the image's [[optical resolution]], particularly in the sample depth direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. However, as much of the light from sample fluorescence is blocked at the pinhole, this increased resolution is at the cost of decreased signal intensity – so long [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]s are often required. To offset this drop in signal after the ''pinhole'', the light intensity is detected by a sensitive detector, usually a [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT) or [[avalanche photodiode]], transforming the light signal into an electrical one that is recorded by a computer.&lt;ref name=Theory&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Fellers TJ, Davidson MW | title = Introduction to Confocal Microscopy | work = Olympus Fluoview Resource Center | publisher = National High Magnetic Field Laboratory | year = 2007 | url = http://www.olympusconfocal.com/theory/confocalintro.html | accessdate = 2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D imaging requires scanning over a regular raster (i.e., a rectangular pattern of parallel scanning lines) in the specimen. The beam is scanned across the sample in the horizontal plane by using one or more ([[servomechanism|servo]] controlled) oscillating mirrors. This scanning method usually has a low reaction [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and the scan speed can be varied. Slower scans provide a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]], resulting in better [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] and higher resolution.

The achievable thickness of the focal plane is defined mostly by the wavelength of the used light divided by the [[numerical aperture]] of the [[objective lens]], but also by the optical properties of the specimen. The thin [[optical sectioning]] possible makes these types of microscopes particularly good at 3D imaging and surface profiling of samples.

Successive slices make up a 'z-stack' which can either be processed by certain software to create a 3D image, or it is merged into a 2D stack (predominately the maximum pixel intensity is taken, other common methods include using the standard deviation or summing the pixels).&lt;ref name=Pawley_2006 /&gt;

[[Image:MP-30-GFP.jpg|thumb|[[Green Fluorescent Protein|GFP]] fusion protein being expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The fluorescence is visible by confocal microscopy.]]

Confocal microscopy provides the capacity for direct, noninvasive, serial [[optical sectioning]] of intact, thick, living specimens with a minimum of sample preparation as well as a marginal improvement in lateral resolution.&lt;ref name=Theory /&gt; Biological samples are often treated with [[fluorophore|fluorescent dyes]] to make selected objects visible. However, the actual dye concentration can be low to minimize the disturbance of biological systems: some instruments can track single fluorescent molecules. Also, [[transgenic]] techniques can create organisms that produce their own fluorescent chimeric molecules (such as a fusion of GFP, [[green fluorescent protein]] with the protein of interest). Confocal microscopes work on the principle of point excitation in the specimen (diffraction limited spot) and point detection of the resulting fluorescent signal. A pinhole at the detector provides a physical barrier that blocks out-of-focus fluorescence. Only the in-focus, or central spot of the airy disk, is recorded. Raster scanning the specimen one point at a time permits thin optical sections to be collected by simply changing the z-focus. The resulting images can be stacked to produce a 3D image of the specimen.

== Techniques used for horizontal scanning ==
Four types of confocal microscopes are commercially available:

Confocal laser scanning microscopes use multiple mirrors (typically 2 or 3 scanning linearly along the x- and the y- axes) to scan the laser across the sample and "descan" the image across a fixed pinhole and detector.

Spinning-disk ([[Nipkow disk]]) confocal microscopes use a series of moving pinholes on a disc to scan spots of light. Since a series of pinholes scans an area in parallel, each pinhole is allowed to hover over a specific area for a longer amount of time thereby reducing the excitation energy needed to illuminate a sample when compared to laser scanning microscopes. Decreased excitation energy reduces [[phototoxicity]] and [[photobleaching]] of a sample often making it the preferred system for imaging live cells or organisms.

Microlens enhanced or dual spinning-disk confocal microscopes work under the same principles as spinning-disk confocal microscopes except a second spinning-disk containing micro-lenses is placed before the spinning-disk containing the pinholes. Every pinhole has an associated microlens. The micro-lenses act to capture a broad band of light and focus it into each pinhole significantly increasing the amount of light directed into each pinhole and reducing the amount of light blocked by the spinning-disk. Microlens enhanced confocal microscopes are therefore significantly more sensitive than standard spinning-disk systems. [[Yokogawa Electric]] invented this technology in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentbuddy.com/Patent/5162941|title=Analytics for US Patent No. 5162941, Confocal microscope|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Programmable array microscopes (PAM) use an electronically controlled [[spatial light modulator]] (SLM) that produces a set of moving pinholes. The SLM is a device containing an array of pixels with some property ([[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], [[reflectivity]] or [[optical rotation]]) of the individual pixels that can be adjusted electronically. The SLM contains [[microelectromechanical systems|microelectromechanical mirror]]s or [[liquid crystal]] components. The image is usually acquired by a [[charge coupled device]] (CCD) camera.

Each of these classes of confocal microscope have particular advantages and disadvantages. Most systems are either optimized for recording speed (i.e. video capture) or high spatial resolution. Confocal laser scanning microscopes can have a programmable sampling density and very high resolutions while Nipkow and PAM use a fixed sampling density defined by the camera's resolution. Imaging [[frame rate]]s are typically slower for single point laser scanning systems than spinning-disk or PAM systems. Commercial spinning-disk confocal microscopes achieve frame rates of over 50 per second&lt;ref name="nanofocus"&gt;{{cite web | title=Data Sheet of NanoFocus ''µsurf'' spinning-disk confocal white light microscope | url=http://www.nanofocus.com/products/usurf/usurf-explorer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a desirable feature for dynamic observations such as live cell imaging.

In practice, Nipkow and PAM allow multiple pinholes scanning the same area in parallel&lt;ref name="Sensofar"&gt;{{cite web | title=Data Sheet of Sensofar 'PLu neox' Dual technology sensor head combining confocal and Interferometry techniques, as well as Spectroscopic Reflectometry| url=http://www.sensofar.com/products/products_neox.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; as long as the pinholes are sufficiently far apart.

Cutting-edge development of confocal laser scanning microscopy now allows better than standard video rate (60 frames per second) imaging by using multiple microelectromechanical scanning mirrors.

Confocal [[X-ray fluorescence]] imaging is a newer technique that allows control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analyzing buried layers in a painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Confocal X-ray Fluorescence Imaging and XRF Tomography for Three Dimensional Trace Element Microanalysis | author=Vincze L | journal = Microscopy and Microanalysis | volume=11 | issue=Supplement 2 | year=2005 | doi=10.1017/S1431927605503167 | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=326128&amp;jid=MAM&amp;volumeId=11&amp;issueId=S02&amp;aid=326127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution enhancement==
CLSM is a scanning imaging technique in which the [[angular resolution|resolution]] obtained is best explained by comparing it with another scanning technique like that of the [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM). CLSM has the advantage of not requiring a probe to be suspended nanometers from the surface, as in an [[atomic force microscope|AFM]] or [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]], for example, where the image is obtained by scanning with a fine tip over a surface. The distance from the objective lens to the surface (called the ''working distance'') is typically comparable to that of a conventional optical microscope. It varies with the system optical design, but working distances from hundreds of micrometres to several millimeters are typical.

In CLSM a specimen is illuminated by a point laser source, and each volume element is associated with a discrete scattering or fluorescence intensity. Here, the size of the scanning volume is determined by the spot size (close to [[diffraction]] limit) of the optical system because the image of the scanning laser is not an infinitely small point but a three-dimensional diffraction pattern. The size of this diffraction pattern and the focal volume it defines is controlled by the [[numerical aperture]] of the system's objective lens and the wavelength of the laser used. This can be seen as the classical resolution limit of conventional optical microscopes using wide-field illumination. However, with confocal microscopy it is even possible to improve on the resolution limit of wide-field illumination techniques because the confocal aperture can be closed down to eliminate higher orders of the diffraction pattern{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. For example, if the pinhole diameter is set to 1 [[Airy disk|Airy unit]] then only the first order of the diffraction pattern makes it through the aperture to the detector while the higher orders are blocked, thus improving resolution at the cost of a slight decrease in brightness. In fluorescence observations, the resolution limit of confocal microscopy is often limited by the [[signal to noise ratio]] caused by the small number of photons typically available in fluorescence microscopy. One can compensate for this effect by using more sensitive photodetectors or by increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser point source. Increasing the intensity of illumination laser risks excessive bleaching or other damage to the specimen of interest, especially for experiments in which comparison of fluorescence brightness is required. When imaging tissues which are differentially refractive, such as the spongy mesophyll of plant leaves or other air-space containing tissues, spherical aberrations that impair confocal image quality are often pronounced. Such aberrations however, can be significantly reduced by mounting samples in optically transparent, non-toxic perfluorocarbons such as [[perfluorodecalin]], which readily infiltrates tissues and has a refractive index almost identical to that of water [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123335070/abstract].

==Uses==
CLSM is widely used in numerous [[biological science]] disciplines, from [[cell biology]] and [[genetics]] to [[microbiology]] and [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Juan Carlos Stockert, Alfonso Blázquez-Castro|chapter=Chapter 6 Fluorescence Instrumental and Techniques|pages=180-184|title=Fluorescence Microscopy in Life Sciences|url=https://ebooks.benthamscience.com/book/9781681085180/|accessdate=24 December 2017|year=2017|publisher=Bentham Science Publishers|isbn=978-1-68108-519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in quantum optics and nano-crystal imaging and spectroscopy.

===Biology and medicine===
[[File:STD Depth Coded Stack Slices through Cells.png|thumb|Example of a stack of confocal microscope images showing the distribution of actin filaments throughout a cell.]]
Clinically, CLSM is used in the evaluation of various eye diseases, and is particularly useful for imaging, qualitative analysis, and quantification of endothelial cells of the [[cornea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patel DV, McGhee CN |title=Contemporary in vivo confocal microscopy of the living human cornea using white light and laser scanning techniques: a major review |journal=Clin. Experiment. Ophthalmol. |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=71–88 |year=2007 |pmid=17300580 |doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2007.01423.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used for localizing and identifying the presence of filamentary fungal elements in the [[cornea]]l stroma in cases of [[fungal keratitis|keratomycosis]], enabling rapid diagnosis and thereby early institution of definitive therapy. Research into CLSM techniques for [[endoscopic]] procedures ([[endomicroscopy]]) is also showing promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoffman A, Goetz M, Vieth M, Galle PR, Neurath MF, Kiesslich R |title=Confocal laser endomicroscopy: technical status and current indications |journal=Endoscopy |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1275–83 |year=2006 |pmid=17163333 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-944813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pharmaceutical industry, it was recommended to follow the manufacturing process of thin film pharmaceutical forms, to control the quality and uniformity of the drug distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Le Person S, Puigalli JR, Baron M, Roques M Near infrared drying of pharmaceutical thin film: experimental analysis of internal mass transport Chemical Engineering and Processing 37, 257-263, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optics and crystallography===
CLSM is used as the data retrieval mechanism in some [[3D optical data storage]] systems and has helped determine the age of the [[Magdalen papyrus]].

==Variants and enhancements==

===Improving axial resolution===
The point spread function of the pinhole is an ellipsoid, several times as long as it is wide. This limits the axial resolution of the microscope. One technique of overcoming this is [[4Pi Microscope|4{{pi}} microscopy]] where incident and or emitted light are allowed to interfere from both above and below the sample to reduce the volume of the ellipsoid. An alternative technique is '''confocal theta microscopy'''. In this technique the cone of illuminating light and detected light are at an angle to each other (best results when they are perpendicular). The intersection of the two point spread functions gives a much smaller effective sample volume. From this evolved the [[Light sheet fluorescence microscopy|single plane illumination microscope]]. Additionally [[deconvolution]] may be employed using an experimentally derived [[point spread function]] to remove the out of focus light, improving contrast in both the axial and lateral planes.

===Super resolution===
There are confocal variants that achieve resolution below the diffraction limit such as [[stimulated emission depletion microscopy]] (STED).
Besides this technique a broad variety of other (not confocal based) super-resolution techniques are available like PALM, (d)STORM, SIM, and so on. They all have their own advantages such as ease of use, resolution, and the need for special equipment, buffers, or fluorophores.

===Low-temperature operability===
To image samples at low temperatures, two main approaches have been used, both based on the [[laser scanning confocal microscopy]] architecture. One approach is to use a [[Cryostat#Types|continuous flow cryostat]]: only the sample is at low temperature and it is optically addressed through a transparent window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirschfeld | first1 = V. | last2 = Hubner | first2 = C.G. | year = 2010 | title = A sensitive and versatile laser scanning confocal optical microscope for single-molecule fluorescence at 77 K | url = | journal = [[Review of Scientific Instruments]] | volume = 81 | issue = 11| pages =  113705| doi = 10.1063/1.3499260 | bibcode = 2010RScI...81k3705H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible approach is to have part of the optics (especially the microscope objective) in a [[cryogenic storage dewar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grazioso | first1 = F. | last2 = Patton | first2 = B. R. | last3 = Smith | first3 = J.M. | year = 2010 | title = A high stability beam-scanning confocal optical microscope for low temperature operation | url = | journal = [[Review of Scientific Instruments]] | volume = 81 | issue = 9| pages = 093705–4 | doi = 10.1063/1.3484140 | bibcode = 2010RScI...81i3705G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This second approach, although more cumbersome, guarantees better mechanical stability and avoids the losses due to the window.

[[File:Minski-confocal-patent-figure1.gif|thumbnail|upright= 2|Scheme from Minsky's patent application showing the principle of the transmission confocal scanning microscope he built.]]
In 1940 Hans Goldmann, [[ophthalmologist]] in [[Bern]], Switzerland, developed a [[slit lamp]] system to document eye examinations.&lt;ref name="Goldmann"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Hans Goldmann| title= Spaltlampenphotographie und –photometrie| journal= Ophthalmologica | volume= 98| issue= 5/6| year= 1939| pages= 257–270| doi =10.1159/000299716}} Note: Volume 98 is assigned to the year 1939, however on the first page of the article January 1940 is listed as publication date.&lt;/ref&gt; This system is considered by some later authors as the first confocal optical system.&lt;ref name="ImagingandMicroscopy"&gt;{{cite journal| author= Colin JR Sheppard| title= Confocal Microscopy. The Development of a Modern Microscopy| journal= Imaging &amp; Microscopy|date=3 November 2009}}[http://www.imaging-git.com/science/light-microscopy/confocal-microscopy online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters"&gt;Barry R. Masters: Confocal Microscopy And Multiphoton Excitation Microscopy. The Genesis of Live Cell Imaging. SPIE Press, Bellingham, Washington, USA 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8194-6118-6}}, S. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 Zyun Koana published a confocal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Zyun Koana| title= | journal= Journal of the Illumination Engineering Institute | volume= 26 | issue= 8| year= 1942| pages= 371–385| online= | doi =}} The article is available on the [https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/browse/jieij1917 website of the journal]. The pdf-file labeled „P359 - 402“ is 19020 kilobyte in size and contains also neighboring articles from the same issue. Figure 1b of the article shows the scheme of a confocal transmission beam path.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="ImagingandMicroscopy"/&gt; A figure in this publication clearly shows a confocal transmission beam path. 

In 1951 Hiroto Naora, a colleague of Koana, described a confocal microscope in the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] for [[spectrophotometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Naora | first1 = Hiroto | year = 1951 | title = Microspectrophotometry and cytochemical analysis of nucleic acids. | url = | journal = Science | volume = 114 | issue = 2959| pages = 279–280 | doi = 10.1126/science.114.2959.279 | pmid = 14866220 |bibcode = 1951Sci...114..279N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first confocal ''scanning'' microscope was built by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1955 and a patent was filed in 1957. The scanning of the illumination point in the focal plane was achieved by moving the stage. No scientific publication was submitted and no images made with it were preserved.&lt;ref name="minsky1957"&gt;Marvin Minsky: ''Microscopy Apparatus.'' [http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03013467&amp;PageNum=1&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE US Patent 3.013.467], filed 7.&amp;nbsp;November 1957, granted 19.&amp;nbsp;December 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memoir"&gt;{{cite journal| author= [[Marvin Minsky]]| title= Memoir on inventing the confocal scanning microscope| journal= Scanning| volume= 10| issue= 4| year= 1988| pages= 128–138| doi =10.1002/sca.4950100403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Tandem-Scanning-Microscope ===
[[File:Petran-Patent-Figure2-cutout.png|thumbnail|Scheme of Petráň's Tandem-Scanning-Microscope. Red bar added to indicate the Nipkow-Disk.]]
In the 1960s, the [[Czechoslovak]] Mojmír Petráň from the Medical Faculty of the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]] in [[Plzeň]] developed the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope, the first commercialized confocal microscope. It was sold by a small company in Czechoslovakia and in the United States by Tracor-Northern (later Noran) and used a rotating [[Nipkow disk]] to generate multiple excitation and emission pinholes.&lt;ref name="Masters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cox: Optical Imaging Techniques in Cell Biology. 1. edition. CRC Press, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL, USA 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-3919-7}}, pages 115-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czechoslovak patent was filed 1966 by Petráň and Milan Hadravský, a Czechoslovak coworker. A first scientific publication with data and images generated with this microscope was published in the journal Science in 1967, authored by M. David Egger from [[Yale University]] and Petráň.&lt;ref name="pmid6030094"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Egger MD, Petrăn M |title=New reflected-light microscope for viewing unstained brain and ganglion cells |journal=Science |volume=157 |issue=786 |pages=305–7 |date=July 1967  |pmid=6030094 |doi=10.1126/science.157.3786.305 |bibcode = 1967Sci...157..305E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a footnote to this paper it is mentioned that Petráň designed the microscope and supervised its construction and that he was, in part, a "research associate" at Yale. A second publication from 1968 described the theory and the technical details of the instrument and had Hadravský and [[Robert Galambos]], the head of the group at Yale, as additional authors.&lt;ref name="JOSA"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=MOJMÍR PETRÁŇ |author2=MILAN HADRAVSKÝ |author3=M. DAVID EGGER |author4=ROBERT GALAMBOS | title= Tandem-Scanning Reflected-Light Microscope| journal= Journal of the Optical Society of America| volume= 58| issue= 5| year= 1968| pages= 661–664| doi =10.1364/JOSA.58.000661|bibcode = 1968JOSA...58..661P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1970 the US patent was granted. It was filed in 1967.&lt;ref name="petranpatent"&gt;Mojmír Petráň, Milan Hadravský: ''METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR IMPROVING THE RESOLVING, POWER AND CONTRAST.'' [http://www.google.com/patents/US3517980?printsec=drawing&amp;dq=ininventor:%22Milan+Hadravsky%22&amp;ei=g0qlUOe3H8fe4QTMuIGADA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online] at Google Patents, filed 4.&amp;nbsp;November 1967, granted 30.&amp;nbsp;June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1969: The first confocal laser scanning microscope ===
In 1969 and 1971, M. David Egger and Paul Davidovits from [[Yale University]], published two papers describing the first confocal ''laser'' scanning microscope.&lt;ref name="PMID5799022"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidovits | first1 = P. | last2 = Egger | first2 = M. D. | year = 1969 | title = Scanning laser microscope. | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 223 | issue = 5208| page = 831 | doi = 10.1038/223831a0 | pmid = 5799022 |bibcode = 1969Natur.223..831D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID20111173"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidovits | first1 = P. | last2 = Egger | first2 = M. D. | year = 1971 | title = Scanning laser microscope for biological investigations. | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 1615–1619 | doi = 10.1364/AO.10.001615 | pmid = 20111173 |bibcode = 1971ApOpt..10.1615D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was a point scanner, meaning just one illumination spot was generated. It used epi-Illumination-reflection microscopy for the observation of nerve tissue. A 5&amp;nbsp;mW Helium-Neon-Laser with 633&amp;nbsp;nm light was reflected by a semi-transparent mirror towards the objective. The objective was a simple lens with a focal length of 8.5&amp;nbsp;mm. As opposed to all earlier and most later systems, the sample was scanned by movement of this lens (objective scanning), leading to a movement of the focal point. Reflected light came back to the semitransparent mirror, the transmitted part was focused by another lens on the detection pinhole behind which a photomultiplier tube was placed. The signal was visualized by a CRT of an oscilloscope, the cathode ray was moved simultaneously with the objective. A special device allowed to make [[Polaroid film|Polaroid photos]], three of which were shown in the 1971 publication.

The authors speculate about fluorescent dyes for in vivo investigations. They cite Minsky’s patent, thank Steve Baer, at the time a doctoral student at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine|Albert Einstein School of Medicine]] in [[New York City]] where he developed a confocal line scanning microscope,&lt;ref&gt;Barry R. Masters: Confocal Microscopy And Multiphoton Excitation Microscopy. The Genesis of Live Cell Imaging. SPIE Press, Bellingham, Washington, USA 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8194-6118-6}}, pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt; for suggesting to use a laser with ‘Minsky’s microscope’ and thank Galambos, Hadravsky and Petráň for discussions leading to the development of their microscope. The motivation for their development was that in the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope only a fraction of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; of the illumination light participates in generating the image in the eye piece. Thus, image quality was not sufficient for most biological investigations.&lt;ref name="ImagingandMicroscopy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inoue"&gt;{{cite book| author= Shinya Inoué | editor= James Pawley| title= Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy | edition= 3.| publisher= Springer Science and Business Media LLC| year= 2006| chapter= Chapter 1: Foundations of Confocal Scanned Imaging in Light Microscopy| pages= 1–19| ISBN= 978-0-387-25921-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1977–1985: Point scanners with lasers and stage scanning ===
In 1977 [[Colin Sheppard|Colin J. R. Sheppard]] and [[Amarjyoti Choudhury]], [[Oxford]], UK, published a theoretical analysis of confocal and laser-scanning microscopes.&lt;ref name="DOI10.1080/713819421"&gt;C.J.R. Sheppard, A. Choudhury: ''Image Formation in the Scanning Microscope.'' In: ''Optica Acta: International Journal of Optics.'' 24, 1977, S.&amp;nbsp;1051–1073, {{DOI|10.1080/713819421}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probably the first publication using the term "confocal microscope."&lt;ref name="ImagingandMicroscopy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt;

In 1978, the brothers [[Christoph Cremer]] and [[Thomas Cremer]] published a design for a confocal laser-scanning-microscope using fluorescent excitation with electronic autofocus. They also suggested a laser point illumination by using a „4π-point-[[hologramme]]“.&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Cremer, T. Cremer: ''Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field.'' In: ''Microscopica acta.'' Band 81, Nummer 1, September 1978, S.&amp;nbsp;31–44, {{ISSN|0044-376X}}. {{PMID|713859}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This CLSM design combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with [[fluorescent marker]]s for the first time.

In 1978 and 1980, the Oxford-group around Colin Sheppard and [[Tony Wilson (scientist)|Tony Wilson]] described a confocal with epi-laser-illumination, stage scanning and [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] as detectors. The stage could move along the optical axis (z-axis), allowing optical serial sections.&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt;

In 1979 [[Fred Brakenhoff]] and coworkers demonstrated that the theoretical advantages of optical sectioning and resolution improvement are indeed achievable in practice. In 1985 this group became the first to publish convincing images taken on a confocal microscope that were able to answer biological questions.&lt;ref name="PMID14519550"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amos|first1=W.B.|last2=White|first2=J.G.|authorlink1=William Bradshaw Amos|authorlink2=John Graham White|title=How the Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope entered Biological Research|journal=Biology of the Cell|volume=95|issue=6|year=2003|pages=335–342|pmid=14519550|pmc=|doi=10.1016/S0248-4900(03)00078-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after many more groups started using confocal microscopy to answer scientific questions that until now had remained a mystery due to technological limitations.

In 1983 I. J. Cox und C. Sheppard from Oxford published the first work whereby a confocal microscope was controlled by a computer.
The first commercial laser scanning microscope, the stage-scanner SOM-25 was offered by Oxford Optoelectronics (after several take-overs acquired by BioRad) starting in 1982. It was based on the design of the Oxford group.&lt;ref name="Masters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID18195988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cox | first1 = I. J. | last2 = Sheppard | first2 = C. J. | year = 1983 | title = Scanning optical microscope incorporating a digital framestore and microcomputer. | url = | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 22 | issue = 10| page = 1474 | pmid = 18195988 | doi=10.1364/ao.22.001474|bibcode = 1983ApOpt..22.1474C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Starting 1985: Laser point scanners with beam scanning ===
In the mid-1980s, [[William Bradshaw Amos]] and [[John Graham White]] and colleagues working at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]] built the first confocal beam scanning microscope.&lt;ref name="White1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=J. G.|title=An evaluation of confocal versus conventional imaging of biological structures by fluorescence light microscopy|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=105|issue=1|year=1987|pages=41–48|issn=0021-9525|doi=10.1083/jcb.105.1.41|pmc=2114888|pmid=3112165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=wbajgw&gt;{{cite web|author=Anon|year=2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117112042/https://royalsociety.org/people/john-white-12519/|archivedate=2015-11-17|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/john-white-12519/|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|title=Dr John White FRS|website=royalsociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage with the sample was not moving, instead the illumination spot was, allowing faster image acquisition: four images per second with 512 lines each. 
Hugely magnified intermediate images, due to a 1-2 meter long beam path, allowed the use of a conventional [[iris diaphragm]] as a ‘pinhole’, with diameters ~1&amp;nbsp;mm. First micrographs were taken with long-term exposure on film before a digital camera was added. A further improvement allowed zooming into the preparation for the first time. [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]], [[Leica Microsystems|Leitz]] and [[Cambridge Instruments]] had no interest in a commercial production.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) finally sponsored development of a prototype. The design was acquired by [[Bio-Rad]], amended with computer control and commercialized as ‘MRC 500’. The successor MRC 600 was later the basis for the development of the first [[Two-photon excitation microscopy|two-photon-fluorescent microscope]] developed 1990 at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name="PMID14519550" /&gt;

Developments at the [[University of Stockholm]] around the same time led to a commercial CLSM distributed by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] company Sarastro. The venture was acquired in 1990 by Molecular Dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Brent Johnson| title= Image Is Everything| journal= The Scientist|date=1 February 1999}} [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/19279/title/Image-Is-Everything/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; but the CLSM was eventually discontinued. In Germany, [[Heidelberg Instruments]], founded in 1984, developed a CLSM which was initially meant for industrial applications, rather than Biology. This instrument was taken over in 1990 by [[Leica Microsystems|Leica Lasertechnik]]. Zeiss already had a non-confocal flying-spot laser scanning microscope on the market which was upgraded to a confocal. A report from 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Diana Morgan| title= Confocal Microscopes Widen Cell Biology Career Horizons| journal= The Scientist|date=23 July 1990 }} [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11261/title/Confocal-Microscopes-Widen-Cell-Biology-Career-Horizons/ online]&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning “some” manufacturers of confocals lists: Sarastro, Technical Instrument, Meridian Instruments, Bio-Rad, Leica, Tracor-Northern and Zeiss.&lt;ref name="PMID14519550" /&gt;

In 1989, [[Fritz Karl Preikschat]], with son Ekhard Preikschat, invented the scanning [[laser diode]] microscope for particle-size analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4871251|title=Apparatus and method for particle analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5012118|title=Apparatus and method for particle analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and Ekhard Preikschat co-founded Lasentec to commercialize it. In 2001, Lasentec was acquired by [[Mettler Toledo]] (NYSE: MTD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt.com/us/en/home/products/L1_AutochemProducts/FBRM-PVM-Particle-System-Characterization.html|title=Particle Size Distribution Analysis|first=Mettler-Toledo International Inc. all rights|last=reserved|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About ten thousand systems have been installed globally, mostly in the pharmaceutical industry to provide in-situ control of the crystallization process in large purification systems.

The '''Cooperative Web''' or Co-Web refers to a browser-based platform that promises to replicate the power of face-to-face communications via web-touch without sacrificing the quality of human interactions. A Co-Web enabled
situational application exploits direct high-definition video mixed with web based telepresence to further increase conversational productivity. The objective of the Cooperative Web is to enrich collaborative web meetings with a browser metaphor that supports simultaneous interactions between meeting participants.

== Overview ==
A convergence is occurring between various technologies associated with the notion of live web meetings. The phrase [[Web conferencing]] has been used to describe group discussions over the internet. These discussions are often implemented using [[Synchronous conferencing]] protocols and are commonly used for webinars, where one meeting participant lectures to other participants while presenting some information that is rendered to all participants by a common client application (web or [[fat client]]). The term [[Telepresence]] refers to a set of [[technologies]] which allow a person to
feel as if they were present, to give the appearance that they were present, or to have an effect, at a location other than their true location. Telepresence requires that the [[sense]]s of the user, or users, are provided with such
[[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] as to give the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, the user(s) may be given the ability to affect the remote location.  As the analysts at [http://www.idc.com IDC] describe, the goal is to create a sensory experience that communicates the full range of human interactions in a live meeting.  

While many Telepresence solutions have focused on the ambiance aspects of remote meeting environments and while
most web conferencing solutions have focused on the integration of webinar and telephony features into collaboration software offerings/services, little has been done to simulate or reflect the asynchronous or simultaneous aspects of 
live meetings over the internet. Ideally what is required is a set of technologies that enrich communications with sensory elements that provide a ''just-like-being-there'' experience for live meetings. The sensory experience should  
include a range of sight, sound, and touch interactions. However, the current state of web conferencing and 
telepresence solutions focus mainly on the sight and sound aspects of a meeting and fall short on the interaction capabilities of participants. Moreover, web conferencing and telepresence solutions are typically not vendor neutral and tend to be pricey.

Users have the ability to incorporate webinar capabilities into an Immersive or Adaptive Telepresence solution to extend meeting attendance. Yet this injection of Telepresence Lite capabilities all along the Telepresence solution spectrum still does not address support for simultaneous interactions with the material being presented in a meeting. 

Orthogonal to this convergence in the technologies that support live web meetings, the [[web browser]] platform has evolved to a point whereby the mediation of user interactions amongst meeting attendees is possible. The common browser has raised the bar of expectation by users. Regardless of your browser of choice, your ability to access web applications simply and efficiently has become the norm. The overall browser experience has improved due in part by the broad adoption of web standards by browser providers and by the sheer economics and reach of the [[web browser]] platform. Essentially, the browser has evolved into the ubiquitous application container for the web.

== Solution Concepts ==
People meet, gather, huddle for business and personal endeavors. The majority of the discussions associated with these conferencing activities tend to be associated with decisions. Typically, the decision making process incorporates the analysis of one or more visualizations of data. The Cooperative Web pertains to a set of technologies and associated architectures that promise to empower decision agility with respect to information available for evaluation
via web-based applications.

While Cooperative Web solutions can incorporate digital components (audio, video) to replicate the face-face meeting experience with the human sensory elements of sight and sound, the interactive sensory element is a differentiating factor.  A core value proposition of this technology is that it provides all meeting participants with the ability to manipulate data and drive web centric applications that are used in the decision making process.

In consideration to [http://www.idc.com IDC's] call for the ability to develop a low-cost plug-and-play Telepresence solution that can be easily adopted by medium-sized companies to extend the reach and promise of Telepresence, the
Cooperative Web offers solution vendors and composite web application developers the ability to develop standards based web applications that can be used in collaborative communication-oriented meetings.

== Sample Solution Scenarios Characteristics ==
* Webinar whereby Audio, Video and Co-Web enabled applications are combined
* Traditional teleconference or phone conversations aided by a Co-Web enabled application (this would be useful when broadband limitations exists or when video cameras are not present)
* ''Ad hoc'' just-in-time web conference
* Video conferencing meeting whereby a remote mobile attendee is required

== Solution Scenarios ==
* TeleMedicine: Remote health care or diagnosis
* E-Learning or Distance Learning
* Call Center Support
* Financial Analyst Briefing

== Conceptual Architecture ==
The maturity of service-oriented-architectures has fueled an ecosystem of ajax-based gadgets (widgets) that encapsulate content services (REST, WSDL). These gadgets, standalone fragments of a web page, make up the information rich web palette that can be assembled, wired and shared in composite web applications.

Lets assume that the gadgets used in a given web page all publish the events associated with user-interactions to a predefined mediation server whereby all participants in a managed web meeting were notified of the interactions. Now,
each instance of the gadgets in the web page (running in each meeting participants browser) would receive these remote interaction events as if they were locally triggered. The result would be that each meeting participant would broadcast his/her web page interactions and also subscribe to the results associated with interactions of other meeting participants.

== Comparison with Telepresence ==
The following attributes most common associated with Telepresence solutions are&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvetelepresence.com/files/eyeGazeStudy.pdf|title=Telepresence|publisher=dvetelepresence.com|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Quality of Image
* True Eye Contact
* Life Size Image
* Proximity of image
* Sound quality
* Full complement of content presentation capabilities

the reality is that many of top selling solutions focus more on the features associated with sight and sound and complementary ambiance aspects like high-end furniture. However, few focus on extending the Telepresence experience with interactive presentation capabilities. ''Cooperative Web'' enabled applications are complementary to the spectrum of Telepresence solutions as they extend the scope of the browser-based platform to allow all meeting participants to share browser applications in a live online meeting.

As described by [http://www.gartner.com/ Gartner], the spectrum of Telepresence solutions can range from Lite to Adaptive to Immersive. Cooperative Web enabled applications can be leveraged along all points on the solution spectrum to help enrich the ''just-like-being-there'' aspects of the Telepresence experience.

Typically, sophisticated technologies are required for a user to be given a convincing telepresence experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9781558606432|title=Sophistication|publisher=sciencedirect.com|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, one of the benefits of Cooperative Web solutions is the ubiquity of the technology dependencies. The cost of entry for adoption has been reduced to a common browser, a few JavaScript libraries and some browser plug-ins. The net result is that the Cooperative Web not only extends the reach of Telepresence solutions, this technology also improves the overall experience of remote communications. 

However, in its raw state, a Co-Web enabled application does not require a Telepresence environment nor a hosted  Web Conferencing solution. The minimum requirement is a mediation server and a co-web enabled application.

Lowe (born in [[Harrisburg, Arkansas]]) got his BA from [[Hendrix College]] and his PhD in [[organic chemistry]] from [[Duke University]] on synthesis of natural products, before spending time in [[Germany]] on a [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Humboldt Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Odyssey Medal: Derek Lowe|url=https://www.hendrix.edu/odysseymedal/default.aspx?id=68045|publisher=Hendrix College|language=en|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=linkedin/&gt;

'''Epidemiology of representations''', or cultural epidemiology, provides a conceptual framework for explaining cultural phenomena by how mental representations get distributed within a population. The theory appeals to an analogy with medical [[epidemiology]]; because "...macro-phenomena such as [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] and [[epidemic]] diseases are unpacked in terms of patterns of micro-phenomena of individual [[pathology]] and inter-individual transmission".&lt;ref name="Sperber2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperber|first=D.|title=Conceptual tools for a natural science of society and culture (Radcliffe-Brown Lecture in Social Anthropology 1999)|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|year=2001|volume=111|pages=297–317|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Representations get transferred via so called cognitive causal chains (cf. Table 1). The stability of public productions and mental representations (constituting a cultural phenomenon) is explained via ecological and psychological factors. The latter include properties of the human mind and cultural epidemiologists have emphasized the significance of evolved properties: the existence of naïve theories, domain-specific abilities, principles of relevance.&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;

The theory has been formulated mainly by the French social and cognitive scientist [[Dan Sperber]] for the study of society and culture, by taking into account evidence from [[anthropology]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

== Theory of cognitive causal chains ==

=== Cognitive causal chains ===
A cognitive causal chain (CCC) links a mental representation (e.g. satisfaction, justification, truth-value or similarity of content) with individual behaviors and mental processes (e.g. perception, inference, remembering, and the carrying out of an intention). More generally, it links something that can be perceived with the evolved and domain-specific process that makes it perceivable; for example, a [[visual perception]] of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] that leads to a mental representation of the stimulus that triggered it.

Here is an example of a CCC:

:On October 31, at 7:30 p.m., Mrs. Jones's doorbell rings. Mrs. Jones hears the doorbell, and assumes that there is somebody at the door. She remembers it is [[Halloween]]: she enjoyed receiving treats as a child, and now, as an adult, she enjoys giving them. She guesses that there must be children at the door ready to trick-or-treat, and that, if she opens, she will be able to give them the candies she has bought for the occasion. Mrs. Jones decides to open the door, and does so.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

=== Social cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) ===
Social cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) are inter-individual CCCs. A SCCC always implies individual CCCs but a CCC just leads to a SCCC if it involves an inter-individual act of [[communication]] or other effective forms of non-communicative interaction.

Here is an example of a SCCC involving an act of communication (ringing a doorbell):

:Billy and Julia are following the Halloween practice of going from door to door in the street, hoping to be given candies. When they reach Mrs. Jones's door, Billy rings the bell with the intention of letting the house owner know that someone is at the door, and of making her open the door ... [plug in Mrs. Jones's story as told above] ... Mrs. Jones opens the door. Billy and Julia shout 'trick or treats!' Mrs. Jones gives them candies.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

=== Cultural cognitive causal chains ===
Human interaction involves many cases of ad-hoc cultural cognitive causal chains (SCCCs) that do not follow a significant long-term pattern over many people. Yet, other SCCCs can be long-lasting, systematical, and across a large population; for example, the Halloween custom mentioned above. The latter kinds of SCCCs arguably stabilize mental representations intra- and inter-individually to an extent that they can be considered as cultural if their behavior (practices and resulting artifacts) significantly represent their population. A CCCC therefore always implies SCCCs but a SCCC just leads to a CCCC if it involves one or more SCCCs that significantly indicate mental representations or public productions.

== Cultural stability, diversity, and massive modularity ==
Epidemiology of representations suggests that both cultural diversity and stability (macro-level) together can be explained by the [[Modularity of mind#Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity|massive modularity]] of the human brain and mind (micro-level) and SCCCs. This means that the manifold of human cultural behavior is ultimately explained by the manifold of [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] human cognitive abilities ([[mental representation]]s) and respective SCCC. This claim would have broad impact, when applicable. It is discussed in further detail by Sperber and Hirschfeld for the cases of [[folkbiology]], folksociology, and [[supernaturalism]].&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=D.; Hirschfeld, L.|title=Culture, Cognition, and Evolution|year=1999|publisher=In Robert Wilson &amp; Frank Keil (eds) MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=cxi-cxxxii|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/?p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Here is an example: Think about a human cognitive sub-system that must have been very important for human cognitive evolution (i.e. a module with an [[innate]] basis); like the ability that allows humans to recognize and interpret visual patterns as faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=A.|title=Imitation,Memory, and the Representation of Person|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|year=1994|volume=17|pages=83–99|doi=10.1016/0163-6383(94)90024-8|last2=Keith Moore|first2=M.|pmc=4137868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=J.|author2=Johnson, M.H.|title=CONSPEC and CONLERN: a two-process theory of infant face recognition|journal=Psychological Review|year=1991|volume=98|series=2|pages=164–81|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.164|pmid=2047512|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can call this cognitive sub-system the human "face recognition module". It was most likely built by evolution to recognize and interpret animal faces via decoding [[facial expressions]] produced by a complex system of [[facial muscles]]. Humans with certain types of brain damage lose this ability (c.f. [[prosopagnosia]], [[Social-Emotional Agnosia]]). Yet, the module also processes visual input that is relatively similar to patterns of natural faces. Such can be cultural artifacts like portraits, caricatures, masks, and made-up faces.

According to the epidemiology of representation the [[effectiveness]] (defined by its [[Relevance theory|relevance]]) of a public production depends on the extent to which it exploits a human cognitive module. Cultural artifacts "...rely on and exploit a natural disposition. Often, they exaggerate crucial features, as in caricature or in make up, and constitute what [[Ethology|ethologists]] call '[[Superstimulus|superstimuli]].'"&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt; Two domains of cognitive modules can therefore be distinguished: the proper, natural domain and the actual, cultural domain. In the above example, the first relates to natural faces, the second to portraits, caricatures, masks, and made-up faces. Those categories can intersect, like shown in Figure 2. Since made-up faces literally overlap the proper with the actual domain, they are the most effective and relevant public product in the example. Therefore, they lead to the most stable CCCC, if they significantly reflect the population's behavior. The other stimuli in the cultural domain will theoretically be as efficient and stable depending on the extent that they exploit the "face perception module".&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;

[[File:Domains of a cognitive module.png|thumb|right|Figure 2: A hypothetical [[Venn diagram]] of the cognitive domains of the "human face module".]]

== Inter-individual stability of mental representations ==
Epidemiology of representations states that there must be a SCCC, the mechanism inter-linking a mental representation with an individual behavior, for the latter and explains its stability over time and space by the [[Relevance theory|relevance theoretical]] status of the underlying behavior. There are three minimal conditions for an inter-individual replication that ensures transfer stability.

For ''b'' to be an actual replication of ''a'',
# ''b'' must be caused by ''a'' (together with situational and background conditions)
# ''b'' must be similar in [[Relevance theory|relevant]] respects to ''a''
# ''b'' must inherit from ''a'' the properties that make it [[Relevance theory|relevantly]] similar to ''a''.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;

Here is an example:

Imagine one (A) produces a line-drawing (a), see Figure 3, and then shows it to a friend (B) for ten seconds. An asks the friend ten minutes later to reproduce it as exactly as possible with another line-drawing (b). After that, a second person is shown for ten seconds the figure drawn by your friend and presented with the same task. This is iterated with nine further participants. Now, theoretically, it is most likely that each drawing will differ from its model (a) and that the more distant two drawings are in the chain, the more they are likely to differ. Imagine further, you conduct exactly the same little experiment, but with the line-drawing in Figure 4. The result, you theoretically get this time, may be such that "...the distance in the chain of two drawings on the one hand, and their degree of difference on the other hand should be two variables independent of one another.";&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt; meaning that it was a chain of stable replications.

Theoretically, this is because Figure 4 looks like a five-branched star, drawn without lifting the pencil, whereas Figure 3 has no [[Perception|perceivable]] meaning (at least in our [[western culture]]), the second chain is a SCCC but not so the first. Arguably and on the one hand, the second causal chain was driven by perceiving the shared meaning of the stimulus by inferring the underlying mental representation and a sequential reproduction of by new behavior. On the other hand, the first causal chain was driven by  mere [[imitation]] that does not crucially depends on recognition of the underlying meaning. There are forms of inter-individual transfer of behavior that blend reproduction and imitation to different extends. However, the more the meaning of a stimulus is actually reproduced rather than imitated by a subject, the more stable the transfer of the underlying mental representation is supposed to be over time.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000&gt;{{cite book|last=Sperber|first=D.|title=An Objection to the Memetic Approach to Culture|year=2000|publisher=in Robert Aunger ed. Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science|location=Oxford|url=http://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/meme.pdfh16Q&amp;cad=rja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology of representations,  cognitive science and domain specificity ==
Like cognitive science, the epidemiology of representations is also based on the assumption that [[domain-specific|domain specificity]] characterizes cognitive abilities or mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Bermudez /&gt; Epidemiology of representations assumes that human animals are cognitively predefined by their evolved neurophysiology (i.e. their cognition is [[Modularity of mind#Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity|massively modular]]). However, it also acknowledges that [[cognitive development]] plays a functional role for the formation of mental representations, concepts, intuitive theories, and the like.&lt;ref name="Sperber2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SperberHirschfeld /&gt;
Accordingly, theories in cognitive science argue that humans are evolutionarily equipped with a certain brain-body setup (c.f. [[common coding theory]]) that allows them to encode and decode specific kinds of information to their memory via interacting with their environment. This is [[Sensory receptor|sensory]]-specific (i.e. [[Visual perception|visual]]-, [[Acoustics|acoustic]]-, [[Touch|tactile]]-, and [[Olfaction|olfactory perception]] etc.) and task or reasoning specific (i.e. formulation of intuitive theories). Hence, by these theories, humans are assumed to have (1) an [[Psychological nativism|innate]] cognitive potential that (2) is realized during a natural cognitive development.&lt;ref name=Bermudez&gt;{{cite book|last=Bermúdez|first=José Luis|title=Cognitive science: An introduction to the science of the mind|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carey2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=S.|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for the first argument comes from fields like [[evolutionary anthropology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], stating that evolution has been selecting merely those animals that have evolved adaptive mental and neural mechanisms to efficiently cope with specific challenges regarding their environment (e.g. getting food, shelter, mates, etc.).&lt;ref name=CosmidesTooby&gt;{{cite book|last=Cosmides|first=L.; Tooby, J.|title=In J. Barkow, L. Cosmides, and J. Tooby, eds., The Adapted Mind|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=163–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the second argument comes from [[cognitive development]], stating that animals (especially humans) in their infancy are highly sensitive to input patterns, since their cognitive system automatically and rapidly adapts their environment.&lt;ref name=Carey2009 /&gt;

Since the human brain is organized into areas that focus on the processing of distinct sensory input and output and also interact with one another, humans are assumed to learn and perform best in processing those patterns of information for which their neurophysiological system has been evolved.&lt;ref name=Bermudez /&gt; Mental representations manifest, for example, in human [[long-term memory]] (Figure 1). Other evidence for massive modularity is that human cognitive performance for respective domains correlates with the degree of damage to the corresponding cortical areas.&lt;ref name=Kandel&gt;{{cite book|last=Kandel|first=E.R.; Schwartz, J.H.; Jessell, T.M.|title=Principles of Neural Science|year=2000|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Organization of LTM.png|thumb|right|Figure 1: Organization of long-term memory and their localization in the human brain according to experimental neuropsychology{{deletable image-caption|Saturday, 28 July 2018|F7}}]] --&gt;

== Epidemiology of representations versus memetics ==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology and culture|}}
The cognitive approach in the epidemiology of representations differs from other [[Philosophical theory|philosophical theories]] with evolutionary orientation, such as [[memetics]], formulated by the British [[Ethology|ethologist]] and [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] (cf.&lt;ref name=Dawkins1976&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=R.|title=The Selfish Gene|year=1976|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawkins1982&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=R.|title=The Extended Phenotype|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Roughly speaking, the three crucial differences between the two approaches are the following:
# epidemiology of representations atomizes culture to [[mental representation]]s and individual [[behavior]], whereas memetics atomizes culture to [[memes]]
# individual behavior in SCCC is replicated, whereas memes are imitated (cf. Inter-Individual Stability of Mental Representations)
# stability of mental representation over time is explained by [[relevance theory|relevance]] and [[domain specificity]] of individual behavior, whereas stability of memes depends on the benefit of their own transmission.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt;

With the epidemiology of representations, Sperber has argued that the notion of meaning is disregarded in memetics and that this is questionable since the study of [[society]] and [[culture]] without an explanation of how meaning is perceived and reproduced is contradictory.&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt; If memetics, nevertheless, attempts to explain culture based on evolutionary biology, it will need to present empirical evidence for the transfer of memes, that is "...showing that elements of culture inherit all or nearly all their [[Relevance theory|relevant]] properties from other elements of culture that they replicate ".&lt;ref name=Sperber2000 /&gt;

The '''Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph''' ('''UVC''') was one of the experiments deployed on the lunar surface by the [[Apollo 16]] [[astronauts]].  It consisted of a [[telescope]] and [[camera]] that obtained astronomical images and spectra in the far [[ultraviolet]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

== Instrument ==
The Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph was a tripod mounted, f/1.0, 75&amp;nbsp;mm electronographic [[Schmidt camera]] weighing 22&amp;nbsp;kg.  It had a 20° field of view in the imaging mode, and 0.5x20° field in the spectrographic mode.&lt;ref name="ares"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experiment Operations During Apollo EVAs |url=http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/docs/ApolloCat/Part1/UVC.htm |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220145727/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/docs/ApolloCat/Part1/UVC.htm |archivedate=20 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spectroscopic data were provided from 300 to 1350 [[Ångström]], with 30 Å resolution, and images were provided in two passbands ranges, 1050-1260 Å and 1200-1550 Å.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Far-Ultraviolet Camera/Spectroscope|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1972-031C&amp;ex=10|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were two corrector plates made of [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF) or [[calcium fluoride]] (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which could be selected for different bands of UV.&lt;ref name="ares" /&gt;  The camera contained a [[cesium iodide]] (CsI) [[photocathode]] and used a film cartridge&lt;ref name="nssdc" /&gt; which was recovered and returned to earth for processing.

The experiment was placed on the [[Descartes Highlands]] region of lunar surface where Apollo 16 astronauts [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Charles Duke]] landed in April 1972.  To keep it cool and eliminate solar glare, it was placed in the shadow of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]].  It was manually aimed by the astronauts, who would re-point the telescope at targets throughout the lunar stay.&lt;ref name="ares" /&gt;

== Experiment goals ==
The goals of the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph spanned across several disciplines of [[astronomy]].  Earth studies were made by studying the Earth's upper atmosphere's composition and structure, the [[ionosphere]], the [[geocorona]], day and night [[airglow]], and [[aurorae]].  [[Heliophysics]] studies were made by obtaining spectra and images of the solar wind, the solar bow cloud, and other gas clouds in the solar system.  Astronomical studies by obtaining direct evidence of intergalactic hydrogen, and spectra of distant galaxy clusters and within the Milky Way.  Lunar studies were conducted by detecting gasses in the lunar atmosphere, and searching for possible volcanic gasses.  There were also considerations to evaluate the lunar surface as a site for future astronomical observatories.&lt;ref name="ares" /&gt;

== Results ==
[[File:Earth in ultraviolet from the Moon (S72-40821).jpg|thumb|right|This is a picture of [[Earth]] in [[ultraviolet light]], taken from the surface of the [[Moon]].

The film cartridge was removed during the third and final [[extravehicular activity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 16|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo16_prt.htm|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to earth. The rest of the instrument package was left on the lunar surface.  A total of 178 frames of film were obtained of 11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George R. Carruthers|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/george-carruthers|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  different targets including: the Earth's upper atmosphere and aurora, various nebulae and star clusters, and the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 16 Mission|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_16/experiments/f_ultra/|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was digitally scanned and saved on tape. Files from these tapes can be requested from NASA. Most of the Apollo 16 and Skylab photos have been converted to JPGs by a third party enthusiast and can be viewed here:

The principal investigator and chief engineer of the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph was Dr. [[George Robert Carruthers]], who was working at the [[US Naval Research Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/carruthers.html|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Dr. Carruthers was given a patent for "Image Converter for Detecting Electromagnetic Radiation Especially in Short Wave Lengths".  For this and his further work, he received the 2012 [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McKinney|first=Donna|title=NRL's Dr. George Carruthers Honored with National Medal of Technology and Innovation|url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2013/dr-george-carruthers-honored-with-national-medal-of-technology-and-innovation|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second spare telescope was slightly modified and later flown on [[Skylab 4]].  It was given an [[aluminum]] (Al) and [[magnesium fluoride]] (MgF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) mirror rather than [[rhenium]].

The '''Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem''' (GYE) is one of the last remaining large, nearly intact [[ecosystem]]s in the northern [[temperate zone]] of the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="ecosystem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schullery |first=Paul |url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |title=The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem |work=Our Living Resources |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927172031/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/noframe/r114.htm |archivedate=2006-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located within the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], in areas of northwestern [[Wyoming]], southwestern [[Montana]], and eastern [[Idaho]], and is about 18 million acres.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/our-work/greater-yellowstone-ecosystem#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yellowstone National Park]] and the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] 'hotspot' are within it.&lt;ref&gt;Initial wikipedia article was based on [[public domain]] [http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm Biology.usgs.gov content written by Paul Schullery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}, from the [[U.S. National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict over ecological and resource management has been controversial, and the area is a flagship site among conservation groups that promote [[ecosystem management]]. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) is one of the world's foremost natural laboratories in [[landscape ecology]] and [[Holocene]] [[geology]], and is a world-renowned recreational destination. It is also home to the diverse [[native plant]]s and [[animals of Yellowstone]].

==History==
Yellowstone National Park boundaries were drawn in 1872 to include all the known [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|geothermal basins in the region]]. No other landscape ecology considerations were incorporated into boundary decisions. By the 1970s, however, the [[grizzly bear]]'s (''Ursus arctos'') range in and near the park became the first informal minimum boundary of a theoretical "Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem" that included at least {{convert|16000|km2|acre}}. Since then, definitions of the greater ecosystem's size have steadily grown larger. A 1994 study listed the size as {{convert|76890|km2|acre}}, while a 1994 speech by a Greater Yellowstone Coalition leader enlarged that to {{convert|80000|km2|acre}}.

In 1985 the [[United States House of Representatives]] Subcommittees on Public Lands and National Parks and Recreation held a joint subcommittee hearing on Greater Yellowstone, resulting in a 1986 report by the [[Congressional Research Service]] outlining shortcomings in inter-agency coordination and concluding that the area's essential values were at risk.

===Federal protection===
Federally managed areas within the GYE include: 
* [[United States National Park Service]] (NPS) — [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Grand Teton National Park]], and [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway]].
* [[United States National Forest Service]] (USFS) — [[Gallatin National Forest|Gallatin]], [[Custer National Forest|Custer]], [[Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest]], [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest|Caribou-Targhee]], [[Bridger-Teton National Forest|Bridger-Teton]], and [[Shoshone National Forest]]s
* [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) — [[National Elk Refuge]], [[Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge|Red Rock Lakes]] and [[Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge]]s

Ten distinct [[National Wilderness Preservation System|National Wilderness Area]]s have been established within the GYE's [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s since 1966, mandating a higher level of [[habitat]] protection than the USFS otherwise uses.

The GYE also encompasses some privately held and state lands surrounding those managed by the U.S. Government.

[[The Trust for Public Land]] has protected 67,000 acres over about 40 projects in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Ecosystem management by species==
The great ecosystem concept has been most often advanced through concerns over individual [[species]] rather than over broader ecological principles. Though 20 or 30 or even 50 years of information on a population may be considered long-term by some, one of the important lessons of Greater Yellowstone management is that even half a century is not long enough to give a full idea of how a species may vary in its occupation of a wild ecosystem.

The Yellowstone hot springs are important for their diversity of [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria. These bacteria have been useful in studies of the evolution of [[photosynthesis]] and as sources of thermostable [[enzyme]]s for [[molecular biology]]. Although the smell of [[sulfur]] is common and there are some sulfur fixing [[cyanobacteria]], it has been found that [[hydrogen]] is being used as an energy source by [[extremophile]] [[microbe]]s.

[[File:Current and projected Whitebark Pine distribution in YNP.jpg|thumb|right|Current (top) and projected (bottom) distribution of [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'')]] in Yellowstone National Park.]]

===Flora===
{{See also|Category: Flora of the Rocky Mountains}}
Among [[native plant]]s of the GYE, [[Pinus albicaulis|whitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'')]] is a species of special interest, in large part because of its seasonal importance to grizzly bears, but also because its distribution could be dramatically reduced by relatively minor [[global warming]]. In this case, researchers do not have a good long-term data set on the species, but they understand its ecology well enough to project declining future [[conservation status]]. A more immediate and serious threat to whitebark pines is an introduced [[rust (fungus)|fungal rust]] disease, [[White Pine Blister Rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), which is causing heavy mortality in the species. Occasional resistant individuals occur, but in the short to medium term, a severe population decline is expected.

Estimates of the decline of [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspen (''Populus tremuloides'')]] on the park's northern range since 1872 range from 50% to 95%. Perhaps no conservation controversy underway in Greater Yellowstone more clearly reveals the need for comprehensive interdisciplinary research.&lt;br&gt;
Several factors are suspected in the quaking aspen's changing status, including: 
*[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] influences on numerous [[mammal]] species and on [[fire ecology]]-return intervals before the creation of the park in 1872.
*European influences on [[wildfire]] frequency since 1886; regional [[climate]] warming.
*Human harvests of [[North American beaver|beaver]] and [[ungulate]]s in the first 15 years of the park's history, and of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and other [[predator]]s before 1930.
*Human settlement on traditional ungulate migration routes north of the park since 1872; ungulate (especially [[elk]]) effects on all other parts of the ecosystem since 1900; and human influences on elk distribution in the park.

===Fauna===
{{See also|Category: Fauna of the Rocky Mountains}}
Anecdotal information on grizzly bear abundance dates to the mid-19th century, and administrators have made informal population estimates for more than 70 years. From these sources, ecologists know the species was common in Greater Yellowstone when [[Europe]]ans arrived and that the population was not isolated before the 1930s, but is now. Researchers do not know if bears were more or less common than now.

A 1959-1970 [[bear]] study suggested a grizzly bear population size of about 176, later revised to about 229.&lt;ref&gt;http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm#23489 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later estimates have ranged as low as 136 and as high as 540; the most recent is a minimum estimate of 236,&lt;ref&gt;http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm#23525 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925064249/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/noframe/r114.htm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but biologists think there may be as many as 1,000 bears in the ecosystem. Although the Greater Yellowstone population is relatively close to recovery goals, the plan's definition of recovery is controversial. Thus, even though the population may be stable or possibly increasing in the short term, in the longer term, continued [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss, climate change, and increasing [[human]] activities may well reverse the trend.

[[Yellowstone cutthroat trout]] (''Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri'') have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in [[Yellowstone Lake]] itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only three decades ago when the numbers of this [[fish]] were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, does not begin to restore the species' historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive lake trout. An aggressive lake trout removal program has caused the cutthroats to rebound.

Early accounts of [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'') in Greater Yellowstone described [[herd]]s of hundreds seen ranging through most major [[valley|river valley]]s. These populations were decimated by 1900, and declines continued among remaining herds. On the park's northern range, pronghorn declined from 500-700 in the 1930s to about 122 in 1968. By 1992 the herd had increased to 536.

====Gray Wolf reintroduction====
{{main|Wolf reintroduction|History of wolves in Yellowstone}}
The park is a commonly cited example of [[apex predator]]s affecting an ecosystem through a [[trophic cascade]]. After the reintroduction of the [[gray wolf]] in 1995, researchers noticed drastic changes occurring. [[Elk]], the primary prey of the gray wolf, became less abundant and changed their behavior, freeing riparian zones from constant grazing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21852">Political science as a separate field is a rather late arrival in terms of [[social sciences]]. However, the term "political science" was not always distinguished from [[political philosophy]], and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also [[moral philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[political theology]], [[history]], and other fields concerned with [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] determinations of what ought to be and with [[Deductive reasoning|deducing]] the characteristics and functions of the ideal [[State (polity)|state]].

==Western==

===Ancient===
The antecedents of Western politics can be traced back to the [[Socrates|Socratic]] political philosophers, and [[Aristotle]] ("The Father of Political Science") (384–322 BC). These authors, in such works as ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and ''[[Laws (Plato)|Laws]]'' by Plato, and ''[[Politics (Dima)|The Politics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' by Aristotle, analyzed political systems philosophically, going beyond earlier Greek poetic and historical reflections which can be found in the works of epic poets like [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], historians like [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], and dramatists such as [[Sophocles]], [[Aristophanes]], and [[Euripides]].

During the height of the [[Roman Empire]], famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while statesmen like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments. Nearly a thousand years elapsed, from the foundation of the city of Rome in 753 BC to the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] or the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. In the interim, there is a manifest translation of [[Ancient Greece#Hellenistic Greece|Hellenic culture]] into the Roman sphere. The Greek gods become Romans and Greek philosophy in one way or another turns into Roman law e.g. [[Stoicism]]. The Stoic was committed to preserving proper hierarchical roles and duties in the state so that the state as a whole would remain stable. Among the best known Roman Stoics were philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the emperor [[Max Aurelius]]. Seneca, a wealthy Roman patrician, is often criticized by some modern commentators/historians for failing to adequately live by his own precepts. [[The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius]], on the other hand, can be best thought of as the philosophical reflections of an emperor divided between his philosophical aspirations and the duty he felt to defend the Roman Empire from its external enemies through his various military campaigns. According to Polybius, Roman institutions were the backbone of the empire but [[Goldman Law]] is the [[wikt:medulla|medulla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aabriel Abraham |title=Ventures in political science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMwpeKhifwcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=political+science+Roman+Stoics#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20science%20Roman%20Stoics&amp;f=false |page=29 |year=2002 |publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn=978-1-58826-055-0 |quote=Polybius attributes the remarkable growth and power of Rome to its political institutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of monotheism and, particularly for the Western tradition, Christianity, brought to light a new space for politics and political action. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity, redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Separation of church and state|church and state]] were clarified and contested in this period.

The Arabs lost sight of Aristotle's political science but continued to study Plato's ''Republic'' which became the basic text of Judeo-Islamic [[political philosophy]] as in the works of [[Alfarabi]] and [[Averroes]]; this did not happen in the Christian world, where Aristotle's ''Politics'' was translated in the 13th century and became the basic text as in the works of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Muhsin |first=Mahdi |title=Alfarabi and the foundation of Islamic political philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6BF52Uw9BIC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Political+science+Plato%27s+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20science%20Plato's%20republic&amp;f=false |page=35 |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-226-50186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
During the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct empirical observation of political institutions and actors. In the Prince Machiavelli posits a [[Realpolitik|realist]] viewpoint, arguing that even evil means should be considered if they help to create and preserve a desired regime. Machiavelli therefore also argues against the use of idealistic models in politics, and has been described as the father of the "politics model" of political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Ruth |title=Political science in theory and practice: the 'politics' model|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nB0LuuYYCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Political+science+Plato+the+republic#v=onepage&amp;q=Political%20science%20Plato%20the%20republic&amp;f=false|page=89 |year=1996 |publisher=M. E. Sharpe |isbn=978-1-56324-939-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavelli takes a different tone in his lesser known work, the Discourses of Livy. In this work he expounds on the virtues of republicanism and what it means to be a good citizen. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Michelle T.|date=2013|title=The Virtues of Republican Citizenship in Machiavelli’s Discourses on Livy|jstor=10.1017/s0022381613000030|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=75|issue=2|pages=317–329|doi=10.1017/s0022381613000030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.

===Enlightenment===
The works of the French philosophers Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot to name a few are paragon for political analysis, social science, social and political critic. Their influence leading to the French revolution has been enormous in the development of modern democracy throughout the world.

Like Machiavelli, [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], believed that a strong central power, such as a monarchy, was necessary to rule the innate selfishness of the individual but neither of them believed in the [[divine right of kings]]. [[John Locke]], on the other hand, who gave us [[Two Treatises of Government]] and who did not believe in the divine right of kings either, sided with Aquinas and stood against both Machiavelli and Hobbes by accepting Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas' preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believed man comes into this world with a mind that is basically a [[tabula rasa]]. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for [[natural law]] is based on reason and equality, seeking peace and survival for man.

The new Western philosophical foundations that emerged from the pursuit of reason during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era helped pave the way for policies that emphasized a need for a separation of church and state. Principles similar to those that dominated the material sciences could be applied to society as a whole, originating the [[social sciences]]. Politics could be studied in a laboratory as it were, the social [[social environment|milieu]]. In 1787, [[Alexander Hamilton]] wrote: "...The science of politics like most other sciences has received great improvement." (''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' Number 9 and 51). Both the marquis d'Argenson and the abbé de Saint-Pierre described politics as a science; d'Argenson was a philosopher and de Saint-Pierre an allied reformer of [[the enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=The enlightenment|page=448 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQPna6P69i0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA448&amp;dq=political+science+the+enlightenment#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20science%20the%20enlightenment&amp;f=false|volume=2 |year=1996 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=978-0-393-31366-6 |quote=The men of the Enlightenment sensed that they could realize their social ideals only by political means.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important figures in American politics who participated in the Enlightenment were [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].

===19th century===
The Darwinian models of evolution and natural selection exerted considerable influence in the late 19th century. Society seemed to be evolving ever upward, a belief that was shattered by World War I.

"History is past politics and politics present history" was the motto of the first generation of American political scientists, 1882-1900.  The motto had been coined by the Oxford professor [[Edward Augustus Freeman]], and was enshrined on the wall of the seminar room at Johns Hopkins University where the first large-scale training of America and political scientists began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Baxter Adams|title=The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MgU7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year=1883|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding professors of the field included [[Herbert Baxter Adams]] at Johns Hopkins, [[John Burgess (political scientist)|John Burgess]] and [[William Dunning]] at Columbia, [[Woodrow Wilson]] at Princeton, and [[Albert Bushnell Hart]] at Harvard.  Their graduate seminars had a thick historical cast, which typically reflected their experience in German University seminars.  However,  succeeding generations of scholars progressively cut back on the history and deliberate fashion.  The second generation wanted to model itself on the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipsett, ed., Politics and the Social Sciences (1969) pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States (1890s-1920s), political science became not only a prestigious university curriculum but also an applied science that was welcomed as a way to apply expertise to the problems of governance. Among the most prominent applied political scientists were [[Woodrow Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Hastedt, "Woodrow Wilson and Literature on Political Science," ''White House Studies'' (2011) 10#4 pp 451-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles A. Beard]], and [[Charles E. Merriam]]. Many cities and states set up research bureaus to apply the latest results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard K. Fleischman]] and R. Penny Marquette, "Chapters in Ohio Progressivism: The Cincinnati and Dayton Bureaus of Municipal Research and Accounting Reform," ''Ohio History'' (1988) 98#1 pp 133-144. [http://publications.ohiohistory.org/ohstemplate.cfm?action=detail&amp;Page=0097133.html&amp;StartPage=133&amp;EndPage=144&amp;volume=97&amp;notes=&amp;newtitle=Volume%2097%20Page%20133 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1920===

The [[American Political Science Association]], established in 1903, is the largest professional association of political scientists.

===Behavioralism===
{{main article|Behavioralism}}
Behavioralism (Behaviouralism) is an empirical approach which emerged in the 1930s in the United States. It emphasized an objective, quantified approach to explain and predict political behavior. Guy says "Behaviouralism emphasized the systematic understanding of all identifiable manifestations of political behaviour. But it also meant the application of rigorous scientific and statistical methods to standardize testing and to attempt value free inquiry of the world of politics... For the behaviouralist, the role of political science is primarily to gather and analyze facts as rigorously and objectively as possible.&lt;ref&gt;James John Guy, ''People, Politics and Government: A Canadian Perspective'' (2000) p 58&lt;/ref&gt; Petro p 6 says "Behavioralists generally felt that politics should be studied much in the same way hard sciences are studied."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolai Petro, ''The Rebirth of Russian Democracy: An Interpretation of Political Culture'' (1995) p 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is associated with the rise of the [[behavioral sciences]], modeled after the [[natural sciences]]. As Guy notes, quote=The term behaviouralism was recognized as part of a larger scientific movement occurring simultaneously in ''all'' of the social sciences, now referred to as the behavioural sciences."&lt;ref&gt;Guy, ''People, Politics and Government'' p 58&lt;/ref&gt; This means that behavioralism tries to explain behavior with an unbiased, neutral point of view.

Behavioralism seeks to examine the behavior, actions, and acts of ''individuals'' – rather than the characteristics of institutions such as legislatures, executives, and judiciaries and groups in different social settings and explain this behavior as it relates to the political.&lt;ref&gt;Hanes Walton, ''Invisible Politics'' pp 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systems====

Gunnell argues that since the 1950s the concept of system was the most important theoretical concept used by American political scientists. The idea appeared in sociology and other social sciences but [[David Easton]] specified how it could be best applied to behavioral research on politics.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Gunnell, "The Reconstitution of Political Theory: David Easton, Behavioralism, and the Long Road to System," ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' (2013) 49#2 pp 190-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
Canadian universities until the 1950s were led by British trained scholars for whom political science was not a high priority. Canadians favoured  the study of political economy. After 1950 younger scholars increasingly took American PhDs and Canadian departments promoted behavioralism and quantification.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Whitaker, "'Confused Alarms of Struggle and Flight': English-Canadian Political Science in the 1970s," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1979) 60#1 pp 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Europe====
Political science operates on a smaller scale in European universities compared to American ones.  Traditionally political studies were handled by law professors or professors of philosophy. American impulses toward behavioralism have made the ''[[European Consortium for Political Research]]'' (ECPR) is a unifying force.  It sponsors several scholarly journals including  ''[[European Political Science]]'' (EPS) (since 2001), ''[[European Journal of Political Research]]'' (EJPR) and ''[[European Political Science Review]]'' (EPSR).

==India==
In [[History of India|ancient India]], the antecedents of politics can be traced back to the ''[[Rig-Veda]]'', ''[[Vedas|Samhitas]]'', ''[[Brahmana]]s'', the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Pali Canon]]''. [[Chanakya]] (c. 350–275 BC) was a political thinker in [[Takshashila]]. Chanakya wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', a treatise on political thought, [[economics]] and social order. It discusses monetary and fiscal policies, welfare, international relations, and war strategies in detail, among other topics. The [[Manusmriti]], dated to about two centuries after the time of Chanakya is another important Indian political treatise.

==China==
Ancient China was home to several competing schools of political thought, most of which arose in the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. These included [[Mohism]] (a utilitarian philosophy), [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (a school of thought based on the supremacy of the state), and [[Confucianism]]. Eventually, a modified form of Confucianism (heavily infused with elements of Legalism) became the dominant political philosophy in China during the Imperial Period. This form of Confucianism also deeply influenced and were expounded upon by scholars in Korea and Japan.

Modern scholarship has rapidly developed in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Carlson, Mary Gallager, Kenneth Lieberthal and Melanie Manion, ''Chinese Politics: New Sources, Methods, and Field Strategies'' (Cambridge, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1995 ''The Journal of Chinese Political Science'' (JCPS) has been a refereed academic journal that publishes theoretical, policy, and empirical research articles on Chinese topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sujian Guo, ed.|title=Political Science and Chinese Political Studies: The State of the Field|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYXDKSSAJKAC|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3642295904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle East==
In medieval Persia, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Middle Eastern [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works. Averroe did not have at hand a text of Aristotle's ''Politics'', so he wrote a commentary on Plato's ''Republic'' instead.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

'''John Arnold''' (1736 – 11 August 1799) was an [[England|English]] [[watchmaker]] and [[invention|inventor]].

John Arnold was the first to design a [[watch]] that was both practical and accurate, and also brought the term "[[Chronometer watch|chronometer]]" into use in its modern sense, meaning a precision timekeeper. His technical advances enabled the quantity production of marine chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782. The basic design of these has remained, with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century. With regard to his legacy, one can say that both he and [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] largely invented the modern mechanical watch. Certainly one of his most important inventions, the overcoil [[balance spring]] is still to be found in most mechanical wristwatches to this day.

It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper, almost from the point where [[John Harrison]] ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and conventional design of his [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.

But three elements were necessary for this achievement:
* A detached [[escapement]], which gave minimal interference with the vibrating [[Balance wheel|balance]] and [[balance spring]]
* A [[Balance wheel|balance]] design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the [[balance spring]]
* A method for adjusting the balance spring, so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods, even through different degrees of balance arc

==Early life and work==
[[File:Chronometer-maker John Arnold, attributed to Mason Chamberlin.jpg|thumb|Chronometer-maker John Arnold (attributed to [[Mason Chamberlin]], ca. 1767)]]
John Arnold was apprenticed to his father, also a [[clockmaker]], in [[Bodmin]]. He probably also worked with his uncle, a [[gunsmith]]. Around 1755, when he was 19, he left England and worked as a watchmaker in [[the Hague]], [[Holland]], returning to [[England]] around 1757.&lt;ref&gt;Vaudrey Mercer: ''John Arnold and Son'', pp. 3, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, whilst at [[St Albans]], [[Hertfordshire]], he encountered William McGuire for whom he repaired a repeating watch. Arnold made a sufficient impression so that McGuire gave him a loan, enabling him to set up in business as a watchmaker at Devereux Court, [[Strand, London]]. In 1764, Arnold obtained permission to present to King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] an exceptionally small half quarter repeating watch cylinder escapement watch mounted in a ring. A similar repeating watch by Arnold has survived; it is of interest that the basic movement is Swiss in origin but finished in London. The escapement of this watch was later fitted with one of the first jewelled cylinders made of ruby.

Arnold made another watch for the King around 1768,&lt;ref&gt;Now in the Musee International D'Horlogerie at [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt; which was a gold and enamel pair cased watch with a movement that had every refinement, including minute repetition and centre seconds motion. In addition, Arnold fitted bi-metallic temperature compensation, and not only was every pivot hole jewelled but the escapement also had a stone cylinder made of ruby or sapphire. Arnold designated this watch "Number 1", as he did with all watches he made that he regarded as significant, these numbering twenty in all.&lt;ref&gt;Report from the Enquiry concerning Mudge's timekeeper by the Select Committee of the House of Commons 1793.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early productions by Arnold from 1768 to 1770 display both originality and ingenuity; this includes a centre seconds watch wound up by depressing the pendant once a day. The movement of this watch was also fully jewelled with a temperature compensation device and a ruby stone cylinder escapement.&lt;ref&gt;Crott Auctions Mannheim 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patek Phillipe Museum, Geneva&lt;/ref&gt;

These watches were made as demonstrations of Arnold's talent and, in terms of style and substance, were similar to other "conversation pieces" being made at the same time as those being produced for [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and made primarily for export to the East.

==The technical challenge==
Arnold's facility and ingenuity, coupled with his undoubted charm brought him to the attention of the [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]], who at this time was seeking a watchmaker skilled enough to make a copy of [[John Harrison]]'s successful marine timekeeper. A full and detailed description of this watch was published by the [[Board of Longitude]] in 1767, entitled "The Principles of Mr. Harrison's Timekeeper", the intention clearly being for it to act as a [[blueprint]] for future quantity production. In fact, it was a highly complex and technically very advanced piece of micro engineering, and capable of being reproduced by less than a handful of watchmakers. However, the challenge was taken up by [[Larcum Kendall]], who spent two years making a near identical copy (now known as "K1") that cost £450, a huge sum at the time. 
Although successful as a precision timekeeper, the Admiralty for obvious reasons wanted a timekeeper on every major ship, and Kendall's was too expensive and took too long to make. Kendall made a simplified version (K2) in 1771, leaving out the complicated remontoir system. But the result was still too costly and, moreover, not as accurate as the original.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert T. Gould London 1976 Ed. "The Marine Chronometer" pp. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect therefore, it was a significant occasion when in 1767, [[Nevil Maskelyne]] presented John Arnold with a copy of the "Principles of Mr. Harrison's Timekeeper" as soon as it was published, evidently with a view to encourage him to make a precision timekeeper of the same kind. 
Maskelyne subsequently encouraged Arnold by employing him on several occasions, mostly in connection with watch and clock jewelling. In 1769, Arnold modified Maskelyne's centre seconds watch by [[John Ellicott (1706–1772)|John Ellicott]], changing the [[cylinder escapement]] from [[steel]] to one made of [[sapphire]]. He lent this watch to the [[Astronomer]] [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]] for use in assessing the practicability of Maskelyne's [[Lunar distance method]] for finding the ship's [[longitude]] during the voyage of the [[Transit of Venus]] expedition to the [[West Indies]] in 1769. Around this time, Arnold also seems to have started to think about making an accurate timekeeper to find the longitude.

==Arnold's first "Watch Machines"==
Arnold's approach to precision timekeeping was completely different from that of Harrison, whose technical ethos was rooted in seventeenth and early eighteenth century theory and practice.
Arnold knew that as the balance and balance spring control the timekeeping in a portable watch, he only needed to find a way of giving the balance a consistent impulse with minimal interference from the wheel work, together with an effective temperature compensation. After making some experimental machines, he produced what could be regarded as a production model to the [[Board of Longitude]] in March 1771.

This machine was completely different from Harrison's watch. It was a [[mahogany]] box of approximately {{convert|6| x| 6| x| 3|inch}} that housed a movement that, though relatively simple, was close to the same size as Harrison's, with a balance of a similar diameter. The radical difference, however, was a newly-designed escapement that featured a horizontally-placed pivoted [[detent]] that allowed the balance to vibrate freely, except when impulsed by the escape wheel. The spiral balance spring also had a temperature compensation device similar to those in Arnold's watches, and based on Harrison's bimetallic strip of brass and steel. Arnold proposed manufacture of these timekeepers at 60 [[guineas]] each.&lt;ref&gt;Vaudrey Mercer "John Arnold and Son" Pps.24 &amp; 25 Antiquarian Horological Society Publications London 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of these timekeepers travelled with the explorers [[James Cook]] and [[Tobias Furneaux|Captain Furneaux]] during their second voyage to the southern [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1772-1775. Captain Cook also had Kendall's first timekeeper on board as well as one of Arnold's. Whereas Kendall's performed very well and kept excellent time during the voyage, only one of Arnold's was still running on their return to England in 1775. The performance of these clocks was recorded in the logbooks of astronomers [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales|first=William|title=Log book of HMS 'Resolution'|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00058|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Bayly (astronomer)|William Bayly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=William|first=Bayly|title=Log book of HMS Adventure|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-RGO-00014-00056|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  who were assessing their suitability for measuring [[longitude]].

During this period, Arnold also made at least one precision pocket watch, a miniature version of the larger marine timekeepers.

This surviving watch dates from around 1769-1770, and is signed ''Arnold No. 1 Invenit et Fecit''. The movement, which indicates centre seconds, has a steel balance with a bimetallic temperature compensation strip that acts on the flat balance spring. Though now altered, the original escapement was Arnold's horizontal pivoted detent as fitted to the larger timekeepers, which was it seems not entirely successful and needed improvements.

Around 1772, Arnold modified this escapement so that it now was pivoted vertically and acted on by a spring. This was a much more successful arrangement, and it is known that in 1772 at least two pocket timekeepers with this escapement were supplied to [[Joseph Banks]] at a cost of £100 (Arnold No.5),&lt;ref&gt;Receipt for £100 From John Arnold to Joseph Banks -Banks Papers State Library of New South Wales, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; and also Banks' fellow [[Eton College|Etonian]] Captain [[Constantine John Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave]]. In a long and detailed article on this matter published in Australiana November 2014 Vol 36 No. 4, John Hawkins details the association between these two men and the probability that this instrument is one and the same, the world's first pocket chronometer originally destined for Cook's second voyage, purchased by Banks and lent to Phipps.

In 1773, Captain Phipps made a voyage to the [[North Pole]], taking with him not only his Arnold pocket timekeeper and an Arnold box timekeeper in [[gimbal]]s, but also Kendall's "K2" timekeeper. From Phipps's account, it appears that the pocket watch performed very well indeed and was a convenient instrument for ascertaining the longitude.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine John Phipps "A voyage towards the North Pole" London 1774.&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely that before 1775, Arnold's earliest pocket chronometers, such as those supplied to Phipps and Banks, were plain watches with centre seconds motion, largely resembling Maskelyne's cylinder watch by Ellicott. Certainly, those few surviving examples are of this caliper such as No. 3.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum Cat. No.4&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1772, Arnold had finalized the design of his pocket timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement caliper, this being around 50&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, larger than a conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted detent escapement and spiral compensation curb. However, the latter appears to have proved ineffective, which seems to have substantially slowed the rate of production.

Even though he produced a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of balance spring adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the balance spring had to somehow be incorporated into the balance itself and not act on the balance spring directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.

==Arnold's first patent of 1775==
In 1775, Arnold took out a [[patent]]&lt;ref&gt;G.B. Patent No.1113 30 December 1775.&lt;/ref&gt; for a new form of compensation balance with a [[bimetallic strip|bimetallic]] spiral at the centre. This spiral actuated two weighted arms, making them move in and out from the centre, changing the radius of gyration, and thus the period of oscillation.
 
In the same patent, he included a new helical balance spring. This shape reduced lateral thrust on the balance pivots as they rotated, and reduced random errors from the "point of attachment" effect, which any balance with a flat spring suffers from. As Arnold stated rather succinctly in a 1782 letter to the Board of Longitude, "...the power in all parts of the spring is uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Memorial by Arnold to the Board of Longitude 7 December 1782 (Vaudrey Mercer - Arnold &amp; Son p. 199).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that Arnold had recognized the technical advantages of a balance spring of this form clearly demonstrates a high degree of insight. The balance that was the subject of the patent appears to have been an unsuccessful design. Certainly, some marine chronometers used this balance, but none have survived. Pearson records a balance of this kind in his possession that was 2.4&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;See the article 'Compensation Balance' in Vol.9 of Rees' Cyclopedia (Written by Revd. Pearson 1800-15)).&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1772 to 1775, Arnold also made about thirty five pocket timekeepers. Not many, about ten of these, survive and none in their original form, as Arnold was constantly upgrading their specification. They appear to have originally had a pivoted detent escapement, with a steel balance and a helical balance spring. A spiral bimetallic curb acting on this spring was intended to provide the temperature compensation, but this system evidently did not work, as every watch was subsequently altered and improved by Arnold shortly afterwards. Surviving chronometers from this series include Numbers 3,29 &lt;ref&gt;Page 31-33 Randall &amp; Good - Catalogue of Precision Watches in the British Museum. Cambridge University Press 1990 {{ISBN|0-7141-0551-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 28.&lt;ref&gt;Clockmakers Company Collection, Guildhall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further experimentation and invention by Arnold led to a breakthrough in the late 1770s. He redesigned the compensation balance and developed two designs that showed promise. Known as the "T" and "S" balances, and marked as such in Arnold's 1782 patent (probably because of their appearance), both employed bimetallic strips of brass and steel with weights attached, which changed the radius of gyration with change in temperature. Although these probably needed a lot of adjustment, they appear to have worked well compared to his previous attempts at a compensation balance.

==A revolution in precision timekeeping==

Around 1777, Arnold redesigned his chronometer, making it larger in order to accommodate the new "T" balance that worked with his pivoted detent escapement and patented helical spring. The first chronometer of this pattern was signed "Invenit et Fecit" and given the fractional number 1 over 36, as it was the first of this new design.

It is generally known as ''Arnold 36'' and was, in fact, the first watch that Arnold called a ''[[Chronometer watch|chronometer]]'', a term that subsequently came into general use and still means any highly accurate watch. The [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] tested Arnold 36 for thirteen months, from 1 February 1779 to 6 July 1780. The testers placed it in several positions during the trial, and even wore it and carried it around. The watch exceeded all expectations, as it demonstrated great accuracy. The timekeeping error was 2 minutes 32.2 seconds, but the error in the last nine months amounted to just one minute. The greatest error in any 24 hours was only four seconds, or one nautical mile of longitude at the [[equator]].

Subsequently, Arnold produced a pamphlet that detailed the trial and results, with attestations of veracity from all those concerned with the tests. Maskelyne's assistant, the Rev. [[John Hellins]], was in charge of the pamphlet.&lt;ref&gt;"An account kept during thirteen months in the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory at Greenwich]] of the going of a pocket chronometer made on a new construction by John Arnold....."London 1780.&lt;/ref&gt; The astonishing performance of this watch caused controversy, because many thought the result was either a fluke or a "fix" of some kind, particularly as [[Maskelyne]] was, effectively, one of Arnold's patrons.

From a technical point of view, however, the design was entirely sound and highly accurate over long periods. Arnold evidently learned the lessons that Harrison had learned before him—using a large, quickly oscillating balance (18,000 beats per hour) with small pivots. Arnold's detent escapement provided minimal interference with the controlling helical balance spring, since the temperature compensation was in the balance itself. Harrison had suggested this as a prerequisite, though he never developed the idea. 
Arnold's pivoted detent escapement did not need oil on acting surfaces, with the advantage that the rate of action did not deteriorate, and remained stable for long periods. At the time, only [[vegetable oil]] was available, which degraded quickly compared to modern [[lubricant]]s.

This chronometer, 60mm in diameter, is housed in a gold case, and miraculously has survived in perfect and original condition. It can be seen in the collections of the [[National Maritime Museum]], [[Greenwich]], [[London]], having been saved for the nation in 1993.

In Britain, prior to Harrison's marine watch, a small, or very small watch (Such as Arnold's ring watch) was generally regarded as the ultimate test of watchmaking skill, especially with regard to complex and accurate watches. Both Harrison and Arnold however, demonstrated that an accurate watch had to be of large diameter, so by the end of the 18th century, a watch of large size was considered the primary characteristic of a well made and superior watch.

==Arnold's second patent of 1782==
In 1782, Arnold took out another patent to protect the latest and most important inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably [[Thomas Earnshaw]], had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modified his detent escapement by mounting the detent on a spring to create the spring detent [[escapement]].

During the same period, between 1779 and 1782, Arnold finalized the form of his chronometer watches. Through continuous experimentation, he worked out a way to make an effective but simple form of compensation balance. At the same time, he discovered a simple modification to his helical balance spring that let develop concentrically and, also, confer the property of [[isochronism]] on the oscillating balance. Not only this, but adjustments to the compensation balance and the balance spring could be carried out in a simple, calculated way. These were the main subjects of the patent, which he took out in 1782.

The balance consisted of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to the form of the balance spring—a coil of smaller radius at each end of the helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the ''Overcoil [[balance spring]]'' is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.

Another part of the patent concerned the escapement—a modification of Arnold's pivoted detent escapement that essentially mounted the detent on a spring. The specification only shows the part of this escapement that is the method of impulse on the impulse roller.

==Patents and plagiarism==
The fact that Arnold had gained great success by modifying the technology of the timekeeper by means of simple yet effective mechanical techniques, also meant that other watchmakers could copy these methods and use them without permission. This is why Arnold took out his patents.

Two other makers also made precision watches with the detached escapement: Josiah Emery and John Brockbank. Both were friends of Arnold, and both employed the highly skilled workman and escapement maker [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. Josiah Emery used, with Arnold's permission, an earlier form of his compensation balance and helical balance spring, in conjunction with the detached lever escapement of [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]].&lt;ref&gt;Plate 178 P.290 The English Watch Camerer Cuss. Antique Collectors Club publication 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-85149-588-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; John Brockbank employed Earnshaw to make his pattern of chronometer, but with Brockbank's design of compensation balance.&lt;ref&gt;Pages 3-15 "An Appeal to the public" Thomas Earnshaw   British Horological Institute reprint 1986. {{ISBN|0-9509621-2-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1780, while making these chronometers for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted detent by mounting the locking piece on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots. Arnold managed to see this new idea and promptly took out the 1782 patent for his own design of spring detent, but it is not known whether this preceded Earnshaw's own idea.&lt;ref&gt;Page 3 - "An Appeal to the public" Thomas Earnshaw   British Horological Institute reprint 1986. {{ISBN|0-9509621-2-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, there has been a great deal of debate over who invented the spring detent escapement, Arnold or Earnshaw. This argument, first initiated by Earnshaw, has been continued by [[horology|horological]] historians (such as [[Rupert Gould]]) to present day. However, the argument is irrelevant. 
In recent years, research has established that Arnold's success was not due to the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible [[plagiarism]] to Earnshaw, warning him in no uncertain terms not to use his Helical balance spring.&lt;ref&gt;Page 15 "An Appeal to the public" Thomas Earnshaw   British Horological Institute reprint 1986. {{ISBN|0-9509621-2-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a year later, in 1783, Earnshaw—through another watchmaker, Thomas Wright—took out a patent that included Earnshaw's pattern of integral compensation balance and spring detent escapement in the multiple specification. However, both of these were undeveloped and compared to Arnold's were of little use, the balance especially having to be redesigned.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wright "Watch or Timekeeper" G.B. Patent No.2489 25/4/1783.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pages 13 - 14 "An Appeal to the public" Thomas Earnshaw   British Horological Institute reprint 1986. {{ISBN|0-9509621-2-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after much argument, the [[Board of Longitude]] granted Earnshaw and Arnold awards for their improvements to chronometers. Earnshaw received  [[Pound sterling|£]]2500 and John Arnold's son, John Roger Arnold, received [[Pound sterling|£]]1672. The bimetallic compensation balance and the spring detent escapement in the forms designed by Earnshaw have been used essentially universally in [[marine chronometer]]s since then. For this reason, Earnshaw is also generally regarded as one of the pioneers of chronometer development.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{cite book | author=Gould, Rupert T. | title=The Marine Chronometer. Its History and Development | pages=116–128 | location=London | publisher=J. D. Potter | year=1923 | isbn=0-907462-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, because Arnold's balance spring patents were in force (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could not use the helical balance spring until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, in the case of the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat balance springs only,&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of precision watches in the British Museum. 1990 {{ISBN|0-7141-0551-1}} Cat. No. 58 P.80. This chronometer by Earnshaw also originally had a flat spring, later converted to helical.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clutton &amp; Daniels - Catalogue of clocks and watches in the Collection of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers  Sothebys publication 1975 {{ISBN|0-85667-019-7}} Page 58 Catalogue No. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; but post 1800, practically every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.

Arnold was the first to produce marine and pocket chronometers in significant quantities at his factory at [[Well Hall]], [[Eltham]] from around 1783. During the next 14 or 15 years, he produced hundreds before he had any kind of commercial competition.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Staeger 1997 - 100 years of Precision Timekeepers from John Arnold to Arnold &amp; Frodsham 1763-1862. Private Publication. See pages 161-182.&lt;/ref&gt; The facts prove that authors such as Gould and [[Dava Sobel|Sobel]] are quite incorrect in their assertion that there was commercial rivalry between Arnold Sr. and Earnshaw.&lt;ref&gt;Antiquarian Horology Volume 17 No.4 Pages 368 - 371 This is demonstrated by the fact that between 1783 and 1796, even excluding marine chronometers, Arnold is known to have produced at least 500 pocket chronometers, whilst Earnshaw made only a few chronometers, perhaps less than fifty, during this period. Today only a handful of Earnshaw chronometers are known that date from before 1796 and, significantly, all have (or originally had) flat springs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arnold and Breguet==
The important French watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] became a great friend of Arnold. In 1792, the [[Duke of Orléans#Tenth creation .281660.29|Duke of Orleans]] met Arnold in London and showed him one of Breguet's clocks. Arnold was so impressed that he immediately travelled to [[Paris]] and sought permission for Breguet to take on his son as his apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;David Salomons, ''Breguet 1747-1823, (London, 1921, privately published), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold appears to have given Breguet ''[[Full Powers|carte blanche]]'' to incorporate or develop any of Arnold's inventions and techniques into his own watches.&lt;ref&gt;George Daniels "The Art of Breguet" Sotheby Parke Bernet 1975 {{ISBN|0-85667-004-9}} Figs 108, 109, 111 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

These included his balance designs, helical springs made of steel or gold, the spring detent escapement, the overcoil balance spring, and even the layout of an Arnold dial design that Breguet incorporated into his own. These were made from engine-turned gold or silver—a pattern that became the classic and distinctive ''Breguet dial''. Arnold's pattern first appeared in 1783, on the enamel dials Arnold designed for his small chronometers, and the proportions and layout of their figuring is identical to that of the classic "Breguet" type of engine turned metal dials which appeared around 1800, and which were quite unlike anything else made in France or Switzerland at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Staeger 1997 - 100 years of Precision Timekeepers from John Arnold to Arnold &amp; Frodsham 1763 - 1862. Private Publication. See Page 164 Fig.1 Compare this to reference 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of precision watches in the British Museum. 1990 {{ISBN|0-7141-0551-1}} Cat. No 176 Plate 140b.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arnold and the 'Tourbillon'===

Arnold also appears to have been the first to think of the concept of the [[Tourbillon]]; this must have derived from his known work on the recognition and elimination of positional errors. In the [[Tourbillon]] device, the balance and escapement is continuously rotated and virtually eliminates errors arising from the balance wheel not being perfectly balanced whilst in vertical positions. Arnold appears to have experimented with this idea but died in 1799, before he could develop it further.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Reid 'A Treatise on Clock and Watch making' Second Edition p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is known that Breguet made a successful and practical Tourbillon mechanism around 1795 but, nevertheless, he acknowledged Arnold as the inventor by presenting his first Tourbillon in 1808 to Arnold's son John Roger. As a tribute to his friend Arnold Sr., he incorporated his first Tourbillon mechanism into one of Arnold's early pocket chronometers, Arnold No.11. An engraved commemorative inscription on this watch reads:

:''"The first Tourbillon timekeeper by Breguet incorporated into one of the first works of Arnold. Breguet's homage to the revered memory of Arnold, given to his son AD 1808."''

This important and significant watch is now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection of clocks and watches.&lt;ref&gt;Randall and Good - Catalogue of Precision Watches in the British Museum 1990 P. 201 Cat. No. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the time of Arnold's death in 1799, he was the most famous watchmaker in the world, recognized for his preeminence as the inventor of the precision chronometer.

==John Roger Arnold==
[[File:Arnold and Dent Pocket Watch.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch by Arnold and Dent hallmarked 1835]]
Arnold's son '''John Roger Arnold''' was born in 1769 and served an apprenticeship with both his father and the eminent [[France|French]] watchmaker [[Abraham Louis Breguet]]. He became Master of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] in 1817. From 1787, he and his father founded the company Arnold &amp; Son. After his father's death in 1799, John Roger continued the business, taking [[Edward John Dent|John Dent]] into partnership between 1830 and 1840. After his death in 1843, the company was bought by [[Charles Frodsham]].

[[File:PhilHardingArchaeologist.jpg|thumb|John Gater (left) with archaeologist [[Phil Harding (archaeologist)|Phil Harding]] at a ''[[Time Team]]'' shoot in 2007]]
'''John Gater''' is a British [[Archaeological geophysics|archaeological geophysicist]], who has regularly featured on ''[[Time Team]]'' &amp;ndash; the [[Channel 4]] [[archaeological]] television series &amp;ndash; since 1993.

He was educated at the [[University of Bradford]] and graduated with a [[BSc]] Archaeological Sciences in 1979. He worked with [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] (for five years), the Ancient Monuments Laboratory ([[English Heritage]]) and Bradford University Research.

In 1986 he set up Geophysical Surveys of Bradford (GSB), an independent consultancy in geophysics for archaeology. In 1983 he became a member of the [[Institute of Field Archaeologists]] and is now also an [[associate editor]] for the ''Journal of Archaeological Prospection''.

On 21 July 2006, Gater was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Science]] by the University of Bradford for his "distinguished contributions to the field of Archaeological Geophysics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070610012338/http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/archsci/depart/gaffney_gater.php Honorary Doctorates for Chris Gaffney and John Gater&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DVD set ''The Very Best Time Team Digs'', John states that, as of the time of the DVD's production, his favourite dig was [[Turkdean]] (the only site where the quality of the archaeological data was so good that ''Time Team'' returned at a later date to dig it again).

'''KIC 8462852'''&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt; (also '''Tabby's Star''' or '''Boyajian's Star''') is an [[F-type main-sequence star]] located in the [[constellation]] [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] approximately {{convert|1470|ly|pc}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="Soubiran2018" /&gt; Unusual light fluctuations of the star, including up to a 22% dimming in brightness, were discovered by [[citizen scientists]] as part of the [[Planet Hunters]] project.

The main source of information about the luminosity fluctuations of KIC 8462852 is the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|''Kepler'' space observatory]]. During its primary and extended mission from 2009 to 2013 it continuously monitored the [[light curve]]s of over 100,000 stars in a patch of sky in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/faq/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706213754/http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/faq/|archive-date=6 July 2016|title=Kepler: FAQ |publisher=NASA |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luminosity==
Observations of the [[luminosity]] of the star by the ''Kepler'' space telescope show small, frequent, non-periodic dips in brightness, along with two large recorded dips in brightness roughly 750 days apart. The amplitude of the changes in the star's brightness, and the aperiodicity of the changes, mean that this star is of particular interest for astronomers.&lt;ref name="SLT-20151015" /&gt; The star's changes in brightness are consistent with many small masses orbiting the star in "tight formation".&lt;ref name="ATL-20151013" /&gt;

The first major dip, on 5 March 2011, reduced the star's brightness by up to 15%, and the next 726 days later (on 28 February 2013) by up to 22%. (A third dimming, around 8%, occurred 48 days later.) In comparison, a planet the size of Jupiter would only obscure a star of this size by 1%, indicating that whatever is blocking light during the star's major dips is not a planet, but rather something covering up to half the width of the star.&lt;ref name="SLT-20151015" /&gt; Due to the failure of two of ''Kepler''{{'s}} [[reaction wheel]]s, the star's predicted 750-day dip around February 2015 was not recorded.&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSCI-20150918"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28191-citizen-scientists-catch-cloud-of-comets-orbiting-distant-star/ |title=Citizen scientists catch cloud of comets orbiting distant star |work=[[New Scientist]] |last=Aron |first=Jacob |date=18 September 2015 |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light dips do not exhibit an obvious pattern.&lt;ref name="Michael2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/the-great-et-paradox/ |title=The Great ET Paradox: Why We are Likely to Find Them Before They Find Us |journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |first=George |last=Michael |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=16–18 |date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the day-long dimmings, a study of a century's worth of photographic plates suggests that the star has gradually faded from 1890 to 1989 by about 20%, which would be unprecedented for any F-type main-sequence star.&lt;ref name="NS-20160115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20160113"/&gt; Teasing accurate magnitudes from long-term photographic archives is a complex procedure, however, requiring adjustment for equipment changes, and is strongly dependent on the choice of comparison stars. Another study, examining the same photographic plates, concluded that the possible century-long dimming was likely a data artifact, and not a real astrophysical event.&lt;ref name="AXV-20160208"/&gt; Another study from plates between 1895 and 1995 found strong evidence that the star has not dimmed, but kept a constant flux within a few percent, except a 8% dip on 24 October 1978, resulting in a period of the putative occulter of 738 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv=1609.09290 |last1=Hippke |first1=Michael |title=Sonneberg plate photometry for Boyajian's Star in two passbands |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=837 |issue=837 |pages=85 |last2=Kroll |first2=Peter |last3=Matthei |first3=Frank |last4=Angerhausen |first4=Daniel |last5=Tuvikene |first5=Taavi |last6=Stassun |first6=Keivan G |last7=Roshchina |first7=Elena |last8=Vasileva |first8=Tatyana |last9=Izmailov |first9=Igor|last10=Samus|first10=Nikolay N |last11=Pastukhova |first11=Elena N |last12=Bryukhanov |first12=Ivan |last13=Lund |first13=Michael B |year=2016 |doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aa615d |bibcode=2017ApJ...837...85H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third study, using light measurements by the ''Kepler'' observatory over a four-year period, determined that KIC 8462852 dimmed at about 0.34% per year before dimming more rapidly by about 2.5% in 200 days. It then returned to its previous slow fade rate. The same technique was used to study 193 stars in its vicinity and 355 stars similar in size and composition to KIC 8462852. None of these stars exhibited such dimming.&lt;ref name="Montet2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=KIC 8462852 Faded Throughout the ''Kepler'' Mission |arxiv=1608.01316 |first1=Benjamin T. |last1=Montet |first2=Joshua D. |last2=Simon |date=3 August 2016 |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/830/2/L39 |volume=830 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |page=L39 |bibcode=2016ApJ...830L..39M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a possible {{convert|1574|day|year|adj=on|abbr=off}} periodicity in dimming of the star was reported.&lt;ref name="AAVSO-2018"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.aavso.org/apps/jaavso/article/3327/ |title=A 1,574-Day Periodicity of Transits Orbiting KIC 8462852 |journal=The Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers |first1=Gary |last1=Sacco |first2=Linh D. |last2=Ngo |first3=Julien |last3=Modolo |display-authors=1 |volume=46 |issue=1 |page=14 |date=June 2018 |bibcode=2018JAVSO..46...14S |arxiv=1710.01081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses==
Originally it was erroneously thought that, based on {{nowrap|KIC 8462852's}} [[Spectral type|spectrum and stellar type]], its changes in brightness could not be attributed to [[Variable star|intrinsic variability]].&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt; Consequently, a few hypotheses have been proposed involving material orbiting the star and blocking its light, although none of these fully fit the observed data.&lt;ref name="DISC-20170630"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Powell |first1=Corey S. |last2=Wright |first2=Jason T. |title=The Strangest (and Second-Strangest) Star in the Galaxy |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2017/06/30/wright/ |date=30 June 2017 |work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the proposed explanations involve [[interstellar dust]], a series of giant planets with very large ring structures,&lt;ref name="AT-20151016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FRB-20151016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/10/16/bizarre-star-kic-8462852-an-alien-paradise-or-a-catastrophic-wasteland/ |title=No, Astronomers Probably Haven't Found 'Alien Megastructures' |work=[[Forbes]] |authorlink=Ethan Siegel |last=Siegel |first=Ethan |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a recently captured [[asteroid]] field,&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt; the system undergoing [[Late Heavy Bombardment]],&lt;ref name="NASA-20151124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisse2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=IRTF/SPeX Observations of the Unusual Kepler Light Curve System KIC8462852 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=Carey |last1=Lisse |first2=Michael |last2=Sitko |first3=Massimo |last3=Marengo |volume=815 |issue=2 |pages=L27 |date=December 2015 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/815/2/L27 |bibcode=2015ApJ...815L..27L |arxiv=1512.00121}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an artificial megastructure orbiting the star.&lt;ref name="arXiv:1510.04606" /&gt;

As of 2018, the leading hypothesis suggests that the "missing" heat flux involved in the star's dimming can be stored within the star's interior.

===A cloud of disintegrating comets===

One proposed explanation for the reduction in light is that it is due to a cloud of disintegrating [[comet]]s orbiting the star elliptically.&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151124" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ARX-20151127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PS-20151013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popsci.com/have-we-detected-alien-megastructures-around-distant-star |title=Have We Detected Megastructures Built By Aliens Around A Distant Star?

===Younger star with coalescing material around it===
[[File:Artist’s Impression of a Baby Star Still Surrounded by a Protoplanetary Disc.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's impression of a young star with coalescing material around it]]
Astronomer Jason T. Wright and others who have studied KIC 8462852 have suggested that if the star is younger than its position and speed would suggest, then it may still have coalescing material around it.&lt;ref name="UT-20151016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laker"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://home.bt.com/news/science-news/alien-megastructure-may-explain-light-patterns-from-bizarre-star-say-scientists-11364010755958 |title='Alien megastructure' may explain light patterns from 'bizarre' star, say scientists |work=BT.com |first=Chris |last=Laker |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PSU-20151015" /&gt;

A [[Infrared#Regions within the infrared|0.8–4.2-micrometer]] spectroscopic study of the system using the [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility]] (NASA IRTF) found no evidence for coalescing material within a few [[astronomical unit]]s of the mature central star.&lt;ref name="NASA-20151124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisse2015"/&gt;

===Planetary debris field===
[[File:PIA18469-AsteroidCollision-NearStarNGC2547-ID8-2013.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of a massive collision with a proto-planet]]
High-resolution [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] and imaging observations have also been made, as well as [[spectral energy distribution]] analyses using the [[Nordic Optical Telescope]] in Spain.&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AT-20151016"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/something-were-not-sure-what-is-radically-dimming-a-stars-light |title=Something—we're not sure what—is radically dimming a star's light |work=[[Ars Technica]] |last=Rzetelny |first=Xaq |date=16 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massive collision scenario would create warm dust that glows in [[infrared]] wavelengths, but there is no observed excess infrared energy, ruling out massive planetary collision debris.&lt;ref name="SLT-20151015"/&gt; Other researchers think the planetary debris field explanation is unlikely, given the very low probability that ''Kepler'' would ever witness such an event due to the rarity of collisions of such size.&lt;ref name="arXiv:1509.03622" /&gt;

As with the possibility of coalescing material around the star, spectroscopic studies using the NASA IRTF found no evidence for hot close-in dust or circumstellar matter from an evaporating or exploding planet within a few astronomical units of the central star.&lt;ref name="NASA-20151124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lisse2015"/&gt; Similarly, a study of past infrared data from NASA's [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] found no evidence for an excess of infrared emission from the star, which would have been an indicator of warm dust grains that could have come from catastrophic collisions of meteors or planets in the system. This absence of emission supports the hypothesis that a swarm of cold comets on an unusually eccentric orbit could be responsible for the star's unique light curve, but more studies are needed.&lt;ref name="NASA-20151124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marengo2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=KIC 8462852: The Infrared Flux |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=Massimo |last1=Marengo |first2=Alan |last2=Hulsebus |first3=Sarah |last3=Willis |volume=814 |issue=1 |pages=L15 |date=November 2015 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/814/1/L15 |arxiv=1511.07908 |bibcode=2015ApJ...814L..15M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption of a planet===
In December 2016, a team of researchers proposed that KIC 8462852 swallowed a planet, causing a temporary and unobserved increase in brightness due to the release of gravitational energy. As the planet fell into its star, it could have been ripped apart or had its moons stripped away, leaving clouds of debris orbiting the star in eccentric orbits. Planetary debris still in orbit around the star would then explain its observed drops in intensity.&lt;ref name="Metzger2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Secular Dimming of KIC 8462852 Following its Consumption of a Planet |first1=Brian D. |last1=Metzger |first2=Ken J. |last2=Shen |first3=Nicholas C. |last3=Stone |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=468 |issue=4 |pages=4399–4407 |date=December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stx823 |bibcode=2017MNRAS.468.4399M |arxiv=1612.07332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the researchers suggest that the consumed planet could have caused the star to increase in brightness up to 10,000 years ago, and its stellar flux is now returning to the normal state.&lt;ref name="Metzger2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.iflscience.com/space/alien-megastructure-star-eaten-a-planet/ |title=The Alien Megastructure Star May Have Eaten A Planet |work=IFL Science |first=Jonathan |last=O'Callaghan |date=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large ringed planet followed by Trojan swarms===
Ballesteros et al. (2017) proposed a large, ringed planet trailed by a swarm of [[Trojan asteroid]]s in its L5 [[Lagrangian point]], and estimated an orbit that predicts another event in early 2021 due to the leading Trojans followed by another transit of the hypothetical planet in 2023.&lt;ref name="Ballesteros2017"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=KIC 8462852: Will the Trojans return in 2021?|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters |volume=473 |pages=L21–L25 |arxiv=1705.08427 |first1=Fernando J. |last1=Ballesteros |first2=Pablo |last2=Arnalte-Mur |first3=Alberto |last3=Fernandez-Soto |first4=Vicent J. |last4=Martinez |doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slx105 |year=2018 |bibcode=2018MNRAS.473L..21B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests a planet with a radius of 4.7 [[Jupiter radius|Jupiter radii]], large for a planet (unless very young). An early [[red dwarf]] of about {{Solar radius|0.5}} would be easily seen in [[infrared]]. The current radial velocity observations available (four runs at σ&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 400&amp;nbsp;m/s) hardly constrain the model, but new radial velocity measurements would greatly reduce the uncertainty. The model predicts a discrete and short-lived event for the May 2017 dimming episode, corresponding to the [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|secondary eclipse]] of the planet passing behind KIC 8246852, with about a 3% decrease in the stellar flux with a transit time of about 2 days. If this is the cause of the May 2017 event, the planet's orbital period is more precisely estimated as 12.41 years with a [[semi-major axis]] of 5.9 AU.&lt;ref name="Ballesteros2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAjVXoeW0AEYZJn.jpg |format=JPG |title=Orbital Diagram Hypothesis of KIC 8462852 |work=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrinsic luminosity variations===

The reddening observed during the deep dimming events of KIC 8462852 is consistent with cooling of its photosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foukal |first1=Peter |title=Reddened dimmimg of Boyajian's star supports internal storage of its "missing" flux |journal=Res Notes AAS |date=15 December 2017 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=52 |doi=10.3847/2515-5172/aaa130 |arxiv=1712.06637 |bibcode=2017RNAAS...1a..52F}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not require obscuration by dust. Such cooling could be produced by a decreased efficiency of heat transport caused e.g. by decreased effectiveness of convection due to the star's strong differential rotation, or by changes in its modes of heat transport if it is located near the transition between radiative and convective heat transport. The "missing" heat flux is stored as a small increase of internal and potential energy.&lt;ref name="Foukal2017" /&gt;

The possible location of this early F star near the boundary between radiative and convective transport seems to be supported by the finding
that KIC 8462852's observed brightness variations appear to fit the "avalanche statistics" known to occur in a [[Self-organized criticality|system close to a phase-transition]].&lt;ref name="Sigurdsson2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheikh2016"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Avalanche Statistics Identify Intrinsic Stellar Processes near Criticality in KIC 8462852 |journal=Physical Review Letters |last1=Sheikh |first1=Mohammed A. |last2=Weaver |first2=Richard L. |last3=Dahmen |first3=Karin A. |volume=117 |issue=26 |pages=261101 |date=19 December 2016 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.261101 |pmid=28059527 |bibcode=2016PhRvL.117z1101S}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Avalanche statistics" with a [[self-similar]] or [[power-law]] spectrum are a [[universality (dynamical systems)|universal property]] of [[complex system|complex dynamical systems]] operating close to a [[phase transition]] or [[bifurcation point]] between two different types of dynamical behavior. Such close-to-critical systems are often observed to exhibit behavior that is [[edge of chaos|intermediate between "order" and "chaos"]]. Three other stars in the [[Kepler Input Catalog]] likewise exhibit similar "avalanche statistics" in their brightness variations, and all three are known to be [[Stellar magnetic field#Magnetic stars|magnetically active]]. It has been conjectured that stellar magnetism may be involved in KIC&amp;nbsp;8462852.&lt;ref name="Sheikh2016" /&gt;

Some astronomers have speculated that the objects eclipsing KIC 8462852 could be parts of a [[megastructure]] made by an [[Extraterrestrial intelligence|alien civilization]], such as a [[Dyson swarm]],&lt;ref name="ATL-20151013"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/ |title=The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy |work=[[The Atlantic]] |last=Andersen |first=Ross |date=13 October 2015 |accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PSU-20151015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/astrowright/2015/10/15/kic-8462852wheres-the-flux/ |title=KIC 8462852: Where's the Flux? |work=AstroWright |publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University]] |last=Wright |first=Jason T. |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arXiv:1510.04606" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PS-20151013" /&gt; a hypothetical structure that an advanced civilization might build around a star to intercept some of its [[Insolation|light]] for their energy needs.&lt;ref name="JonesM2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconsidering macro-artefacts in SETI searches |journal=[[Acta Astronautica]] |last=Jones |first=Morris |volume=116 |pages=161–165 |date=November–December 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2015.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC-20151014"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/has-kepler-discovered-an-alien-megastructure-151014.htm |title=Has Kepler Discovered an Alien Megastructure? |work=[[Discovery.com]] |last=O'Neill |first=Ian |date=14 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SR-20150929"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=47887 |title=Prepared Statement by Andrew Siemion – Hearing on Astrobiology |work=[[House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] |publisher=SpaceRef.com |last=Siemion |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Siemion |date=29 September 2015 |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Steinn Sigurðsson, the megastructure hypothesis is implausible and disfavored by [[Occam's razor]] and fails to sufficiently explain the dimming.

==Follow-up studies==
Numerous [[optical telescope]]s continually monitor {{nowrap|KIC 8462852}} in anticipation of another multi-day dimming event, with planned follow-up observations of a dimming event using large telescopes equipped with [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectrographs]] to determine if the eclipsing mass is a solid object, or composed of dust or gas.&lt;ref name="followup"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/30948-dimming-star-alien-megastructure-mystery.html |title='Alien Megastructure' Mystery May Soon Be Solved |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=28 October 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional follow-up observations may involve the ground-based [[Green Bank Telescope]], the [[Karl G.

A [[Kickstarter]] fund-raising campaign was led by Tabetha Boyajian, the lead author of the initial study on {{nowrap|KIC 8462852's}} anomalous light curve. The project proposes to use the [[Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network]] for continuous monitoring of the star. The campaign raised over {{US$|100,000}}, enough for one year of telescope time.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popsci.com/alien-megastructure-star-just-met-its-kickstarter-goal |title='Alien Megastructure' Star Kickstarter Just Met Its Goal |work=Popular Science |last=Fecht |first=Sarah |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, more than fifty amateur astronomers working under the aegis of the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] have been providing effectively full coverage since AAVSO's alert about the star in October 2015,&lt;ref name="AAVSO's Continuous Coverage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://lsuscienceblog.squarespace.com/blog/2017/1/6/tabbys-star-the-most-mysterious-star-in-the-universe |title=Tabby's Star: The Most Mysterious Star in the Universe Needs You |website=The Pursuit |series=Physics and Astronomy |last=Jarreau |first=Paige |date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely a nearly continuous photometric record.&lt;ref name="Subreddit KIC 8462852 FAQ"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pm4lszHnawepEagciKfPKzgRHscTrOi699EYMpqMe2Q/edit |title=Subreddit FAQ |website=Subreddit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in January 2018, Boyajian et al. reported that whatever is blocking KIC 8462852 filters different wavelengths of light differently, so it cannot be an opaque object. They concluded that it is most likely [[space dust]].&lt;ref name="AXV-20180102" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NatGeoJan3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AXV-20180102deeg" /&gt;

In 2016, the [[VERITAS|VERITAS gamma-ray observatory]] was used to search for ultra-fast [[optical communication|optical transients]] from astronomical objects, with astronomers developing an efficient method sensitive to nanosecond pulses with fluxes as low as about one [[photon]] per square meter.

===EPIC 204278916===
{{main|EPIC 204278916}}
A star called [[EPIC 204278916]], as well as some other [[young stellar object]]s, have been observed to exhibit dips similar to those observed in {{nowrap|KIC 8462852}}. They differ in several aspects, however. {{nowrap|EPIC 204278916}} shows much deeper dips than {{nowrap|KIC 8462852}}, and they are grouped over a shorter period, whereas the dips at {{nowrap|KIC 8462852}} are spread out over several years. Furthermore, {{nowrap|EPIC 204278916}} is surrounded by a [[circumstellar disc|proto-stellar disc]], whereas {{nowrap|KIC 8462852}} appears to be a normal F-type star displaying no evidence of a disc.&lt;ref name="EPIC" /&gt;

Initial spectra with FRODOSpec at the two-meter [[Liverpool Telescope]] showed no changes visible between a reference spectrum and this dip.&lt;ref name="May 2017 Dimming-02" /&gt;&lt;ref name="YT-20170520" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TLW-20170520" /&gt; Several observatories, however, including the twin [[W.

Observations were taken across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Evidence of a second dimming event (named "Celeste"&lt;ref name="WTFlux-20170918" /&gt;) was observed on 13–14 June 2017, and which possibly began 11 June, by amateur astronomer Bruce L.

On 20 November 2017 (est), a fifth prominent dimming event began and had deepened to a 0.44% depth; as of 16 December 2017, the event recovered, leveled off at dip bottom for 11 days, faded again, to a current total dimming depth of 1.25%, and is now recovering again.&lt;ref name="BG-2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BG-20180101" /&gt;

Dimming and brightening events of the star continue to be monitored; related light curves are currently updated and released frequently.&lt;ref name="BG-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BG-20171114-latest"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gary |first=Bruce L. |title=Hereford Arizona Observatory photometry observations of KIC 8462852 |url=http://www.brucegary.net/ts5/ |date=14 November 2017 |work=BruceGary.net |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">The '''law of specific nerve energies''', first proposed by [[Johannes Peter Müller]] in 1835, is that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway over which the sensory information is carried.  Hence, the origin of the sensation is not important. Therefore, the difference in perception of seeing, hearing, and touch are not caused by differences in the stimuli themselves but by the different nervous structures that these stimuli excite. For example, pressing on the [[human eye|eye]] elicits sensations of flashes of [[light]] because the [[neuron]]s in the [[retina]] send a signal to the [[occipital lobe]]. Despite the sensory input's being mechanical, the experience is visual.

==Quotation==

Here is Müller's statement of the law, from ''Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen für Vorlesungen'', 2nd Ed., translated by Edwin Clarke and Charles Donald O'Malley:
::''The same cause, such as electricity, can simultaneously affect all sensory organs, since they are all sensitive to it; and yet, every sensory nerve reacts to it differently; one nerve perceives it as light, another hears its sound, another one smells it; another tastes the electricity, and another one feels it as pain and shock. One nerve perceives a luminous picture through mechanical irritation, another one hears it as buzzing, another one senses it as pain. . . He who feels compelled to consider the consequences of these facts cannot but realize that the specific sensibility of nerves for certain impressions is not enough, since all nerves are sensitive to the same cause but react to the same cause in different ways. . . (S)ensation is not the conduction of a quality or state of external bodies to consciousness, but the conduction of a quality or state of our nerves to consciousness, excited by an external cause.''

==Clarification==

As the above quotation shows, Müller's law seems to differ from the modern statement of the law in one key way. Müller attributed the [[quale|quality]] of an experience to some specific quality of the energy in the nerves. For example, the visual experience from light shining into the eye, or from a poke in the eye, arises from some special quality of the energy carried by [[optic nerve]], and the auditory experience from sound coming into the ear, or from electrical stimulation of the [[cochlea]], arises from some different, special quality of the energy carried by the [[auditory nerve]]. In 1912, [[Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian]] showed that all neurons carry the same energy, electrical energy in the form of [[action potential]]s. That means that the quality of an experience depends on the part of the brain to which nerves deliver their action potentials (e.g., light from nerves arriving at the [[visual cortex]] and sound from nerves arriving at the [[auditory cortex]]).

In 1945, [[Roger Sperry]] showed that it is the location in the brain to which nerves attach that determines experience. He studied [[amphibian]]s whose optic nerves cross completely, so that the left eye connects to the right side of the brain and the right eye connects to the left side of the brain. He was able to cut the optic nerves and cause them to regrow on the opposite side of the brain so that the left eye now connected to the left side of the brain and the right eye connected to the right side of the brain. He then showed that these animals made the opposite movements from the ones they would have made before the operation. For example, before the operation, the animal would move to the left to get away from a large object approaching from the right. After the operation, the animal would move to the right in response to the same large object approaching from the right. Sperry showed similar results in other animals including [[mammal]]s ([[rat]]s), this work contributing to his [[Nobel Prize]] in 1981.

[[File:2015 Nepal earthquake.svg|thumb|right|Aftershocks of 2015 Nepal earthquake|300px]]
The following is a list of [[aftershock]]s that occurred after the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015]]. There was some seismic activity in the [[Jumla District|Jumla district]] before the main shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us2000281p#general_summary|title=M5.0  - 51km SSE of Jumla, Nepal|work=usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002a35#general_summary|title=M4.3  - 43km SSE of Jumla, Nepal|work=usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are not [[foreshock]]s to the main shock. {{As of|2015|June|07}}, over 304 aftershocks have occurred.&lt;ref name="NSC Nepal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seismonepal.gov.np/|title=Aftershocks of Gorkha Earthquake|publisher=National Seismological Centre, Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large number of aftershocks after the earthquake is considered normal by seismologists.

According to seismologist Roger Musson, the standard pattern for aftershocks is that the biggest aftershock will be one day after, and one magnitude less. Thus, the 6.7 magnitude aftershock on 26 April 2015 following the 7.9 magnitude main shock  would fit this pattern. It is highly unlikely that the earthquake was a foreshock preceding an even larger earthquake. Therefore, an earthquake larger than 7.9 in the near future after 25 April 2015  is not expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/nepal/11565700/Nepal-earthquake-How-dangerous-are-aftershocks.html|title=Nepal Earthquake: How Dangerous Are Aftershocks?|work=The Telegraph, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of aftershocks 5.0 and higher==
The list below is incomplete and maybe inaccurate for some aftershocks.
Note: The list below shows bigger earthquakes only.

===Neuroscience===
*[[Maxwell's Spot]], a reddish spot seen in the centre of a visual field when a white surface is viewed through a dichroic filter transmitting red and blue lights. In 1856, Maxwell observed a dark spot in the blue region of a prismatic spectrum. The spot moved with his eye but disappeared upon looking elsewhere in the spectrum. He concluded that the spot was entoptic, being produced by a localized reduction of retinal illuminance that resulted from absorption of blue light by the yellow macular pigment, as the combined effects of the macular pigment and the distribution of short wavelength cones results in the [[fovea centralis]] having a lower sensitivity to blue light.

'''Maucherite''' is a grey to reddish silver white [[nickel arsenide]] mineral. It crystallizes in the [[tetragonal]] [[crystal system]]. It occurs in [[hydrothermal]] veins alongside other nickel arsenide and sulfide minerals. It is metallic and opaque with a [[Mohs hardness|hardness]] of 5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 7.83. It is also known as placodine and Temiskamite. The unit cell is of symmetry group ''P4''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2 or ''P4''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2. 

It has the [[chemical formula]]: Ni&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;As&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and commonly contains copper, iron, cobalt, antimony, and sulfur as impurities.

It was discovered in 1913 in Eisleben, [[Germany]] and was named after Wilhelm Maucher (1879–1930), a [[Germany|German]] mineral collector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">In [[fluid dynamics]], the [[fluid]] flow is often decomposed into a '''mean flow''' – and [[deviation (statistics)|deviation]]s from the [[mean]]. The [[averaging]] can be done either in space or in time, or by [[ensemble average|ensemble averaging]].

==Example==
Calculation of the mean flow may often be as simple as the [[mathematical mean]]: simply add up the given flow rates and then divide the final figure by the number of initial readings.

For example, given two [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharges]] (''Q'') of 3&amp;nbsp;m³/s and 5&amp;nbsp;m³/s, we can use these flow rates ''Q'' to calculate the mean flow rate ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;. Which in this case is ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;m³/s.

The '''Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle''', designed for [[NASA]]'s [[Project Mercury]], was the first American manned [[booster (rocketry)|space booster]]. It was used for six [[sub-orbital]] Mercury flights from 1960&amp;ndash;61; culminating with the launch of the first, and 11 weeks later, the second American (and the second and third humans) in space. The four subsequent Mercury [[human spaceflight]]s used the more powerful [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas booster]] to enter [[low Earth orbit]].

A member of the [[Redstone (rocket family)|Redstone rocket family]], it was derived from the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] [[ballistic missile]] and the [[multistage rocket|first stage]] of the related [[Jupiter-C]] launch vehicle; but to [[Human-rating certification|human-rate]] it, the structure and systems were modified to improve safety and reliability.

== Modifications from the Redstone missile==

[[Image:Redstone-jupiterc-mercuryredstone-compared.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Comparison of Mercury-Redstone (right) with Redstone missile and Jupiter-C]]NASA chose the [[U.S. Army]]'s Redstone [[Liquid-fuel rocket|liquid-fueled]] ballistic missile for its suborbital flights as it was the oldest one in the US fleet, having been active since 1953 and had&lt;ref&gt;''This New Ocean'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; many successful test flights.&lt;ref name="The Mercury-Redstone Project p. 2-2"&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 2-2, 3-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard military Redstone lacked sufficient thrust to lift a Mercury capsule into the ballistic suborbital trajectory needed for the project;&lt;ref name="The Mercury-Redstone Project p. 2-2"/&gt; however, the first stage of the [[Jupiter-C]], which was a modified Redstone with lengthened tanks, could carry enough propellant to reach the desired trajectory.  Therefore, this Jupiter-C first stage was used as the starting point for the Mercury-Redstone design.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 2-2, 3-1, 4-39 to 4-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Jupiter-C's engine, however, was being phased out by the Army, so to avoid potential complications such as parts shortages or design revisions, the Mercury-Redstone designers chose the [[Rocketdyne]] A-7 engine used on the latest military Redstones.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 4-41, 9-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Paul and William Davidson, propulsion engineers at the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA), were assigned the task of modifying the A-7 to be safe and reliable for manned flights.

During 1959, most of ABMA were preoccupied with the Saturn project, but those engineers who could find enough free time in their schedule were invited to work on man-rating the Jupiter-C. As a starting point, the most obvious step was getting rid of its staging capability as the Mercury-Redstone would not utilize upper stages. Many of the more advanced Jupiter-C components were also removed for reliability reasons or because they were not necessary for Project Mercury.

The standard Redstone was fueled with a 75 percent [[ethyl alcohol]] 25 percent water solution, essentially the same propellants as the V-2, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used [[hydyne]] fuel, a blend of 60 percent [[unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine]] (UDMH) and 40 percent [[diethylenetriamine]] (DETA).&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 2-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, but it was also more toxic,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-2, 4-42.&lt;/ref&gt; which could be hazardous for an astronaut in a launch pad emergency.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 9-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, hydyne had never been used with the new A-7 engine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 4-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mercury-Redstone designers rejected hydyne and returned to the standard ethyl alcohol fuel. The lengthened propellant tanks were thus also necessary in lieu of using more powerful fuel.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 2-2, 3-2, 4-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of alcohol created a problem with the Mercury-Redstone in that the graphite thrust vector vanes could be eroded due to the significantly longer burn time, hence NASA put out a requirement that the launch vehicles needed high quality vanes.

Because Mercury-Redstone had larger propellant tanks than the Redstone missile, an additional nitrogen bottle was added for tank pressurization, and an extra [[hydrogen peroxide]] tank for powering the turbopump due to the longer burn time.

The most important change in making the Mercury-Redstone a suitable vehicle for an astronaut was the addition of an automatic in-flight abort sensing system.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-2, 9-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  In an emergency where the rocket was about to suffer a catastrophic failure, an abort would activate the [[launch escape system]] attached to the Mercury capsule, which would rapidly eject it from the booster.  Either the astronaut or the ground controllers could initiate an abort manually,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-10, 5-11, 9-4.&lt;/ref&gt; but some potential failures during flight might lead to disaster before an abort could be manually triggered.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-2, 9-4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Mercury-Redstone Exploded View.gif|thumb|left|300px|Exploded view]]

The Mercury-Redstone's automatic in-flight abort sensing system solved this problem by monitoring the rocket's performance during flight. If it detected an anomaly which might threaten the astronaut, such as loss of flight control, engine thrust, or electrical power, it would automatically abort, shutting down the engine and activating the capsule's escape system.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-1, 5-2, 9-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The abort system could not shut off the engine until at least 30 seconds after liftoff in order to prevent a malfunctioning launch vehicle from coming down on or near the pad; during the initial 30 seconds, only the Range Safety Officer could terminate the flight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-5, 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Review of flight data from the more than 60 Redstone and Jupiter C launches since 1953 was used to analyze the most likely failure modes of this launch vehicle family. In the interest of simplicity, the abort sensing system had to be kept as simple as possible and only monitor parameters that were vital to booster operation. An automatic abort could be triggered by any of the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction:

*Pitch, yaw, or roll angle deviating too far from the programmed flight profile,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-3, 5-6, 5-17, 5-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pitch or yaw angle changing too rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-3, 5-6, 5-17, 5-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pressure in the engine's combustion chamber falling below a critical level,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-3, 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Loss of electrical power for the flight control system,&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-3, 5-6, 5-17.&lt;/ref&gt; or
*Loss of general electrical power (including power for the abort sensing system itself), which could indicate a catastrophic failure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 5-3, 5-6, 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instant abort capability was important because certain failure modes such as loss of thrust upon liftoff (for example the third Redstone test flight in May 1954) could result in an immediate catastrophic situation. Other failure modes such as deviation from the proper flight path or a drop in engine chamber pressure during ascent did not necessarily present an immediate risk to the astronaut's safety and he could either initial a manual abort by pulling a lever in the capsule to activate the Launch Escape System or ground control could send a command to activate it.

The range safety system was modified slightly in that a three-second delay would take place between engine cutoff and missile destruct so as to give the escape tower enough time to pull the capsule away.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 4-39, 4-43, 9-7.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Mercury-Redstone Booster Units.gif|thumb|left|180px|Schematic view]]

The most visible difference between the Jupiter-C first stage and the Mercury-Redstone was in the section just below the Mercury capsule and above the propellant tanks.  This section was known as the ''aft section'', a term which was inherited from the military Redstone.  (The actual rear end of the rocket was called the ''tail section''.)  The aft section held most of the Mercury-Redstone's electronics and instrumentation, including the guidance system, as well as the adapter for the Mercury capsule.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 4-5, 4-6, 9-6.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the military Redstone and the Jupiter-C first stage, when the rocket had burned out, its lower portion, containing the rocket engine and propellant tanks, would separate from the aft section and be discarded, and the aft section, with its guidance system, would direct the top half of the rocket during its unpowered ballistic flight.  However, in the Mercury-Redstone, the aft section was permanently attached to the lower portion of the rocket.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-2, 4-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the rocket had shut down, the Mercury capsule would separate from the aft section and would rely on its own guidance.

Other changes were made to improve the Mercury-Redstone's reliability.  The standard Redstone's ST-80 [[inertial guidance system]] was replaced in the Mercury-Redstone with the simpler LEV-3 autopilot.  The LEV-3, whose design dated back to the German [[V-2]] missile, was not as sophisticated or as precise as the ST-80, but it was accurate enough for the Mercury mission and its simplicity made it more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-2, 9-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  A special instrument compartment was built in the "aft section" to hold the most important instrumentation and electronics, including the guidance system, the abort and destruct systems, the [[telemetry]] instrumentation, and the electrical power supplies.  To reduce the chance of failure in this equipment, this compartment was cooled before launch and kept pressurized during flight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 4-5, 4-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuel prevalves were deleted from the Mercury-Redstone in the interest of improved reliability, since if they closed during a launch, an abort condition could be triggered. On the three unmanned flights, it was discovered that the Mercury-Redstone exhibited a roll transient of 8° per second versus 4° for the Redstone missile. Although this was below the 12° per second roll transient required to trigger an abort, the roll rate sensor was removed from the two manned flights to reduce the chances of an accidental abort (the booster still retained the roll attitude angle sensor which would be triggered at 10°).

Mercury-Redstone 1A and Mercury-Redstone 2 both experienced overacceleration in flight, the former due to a problem with an accelerometer, the latter due to a problem with the LOX regulator which oversupplied the engine with oxidizer and caused thrust termination to occur 1.2 seconds early. The ASIS system activated and the escape tower yanked the capsule away, subjecting its [[chimpanzee]] passenger to high G loads. The third flight, Mercury-Redstone BD, was designed as an engineering test to correct these problems before the booster could be considered man-rated.

The space between the pressurized instrument compartment and the capsule was originally intended to hold a parachute recovery system for the rocket, but it had been left empty after this system was abandoned. The three unmanned Mercury-Redstone flights exhibited high vibration levels and structural bending in the adapter area, so [[Alan Shepard]]'s flight included 340 pounds of lead-infused plastic in the adapter section along with additional bracing and stiffeners. After Shepard still reported noticeable vibration during launch, [[Gus Grissom]]'s booster included even more ballast. The Atlas booster used for orbital Mercury flights had also experienced this issue, but with more catastrophic results as [[Mercury-Atlas 1]] was destroyed in-flight due to structural failure caused by excessive flexing at the point where the booster mated with the capsule adapter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 3-2, 4-5, 4-21, 4-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, some 800 modifications were made to the Redstone design in the process of adapting it for the Mercury program. The process of man-rating Redstone was so extensive that NASA quickly found themselves not using an off-the-shelf rocket, but what was in effect a completely new one and thus negating all of the hardware and flight test data from previous Redstone and Jupiter-C launches. This created a series of disputes between Von Braun's team at ABMA and NASA, as the former preferred simply making the abort system as foolproof as possible so as to guarantee that the astronaut would be bailed out of a malfunctioning launch vehicle, while the latter favored maximum booster reliability to minimize the chance of aborts happening at all.

== Proposed parachute recovery system ==

The Mercury-Redstone designers originally planned for the rocket to be recovered by parachute after its separation from the Mercury capsule.  This was the first significant effort to develop a recoverable launch vehicle and the first to reach the testing phase.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 6-22, 6-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery system, at the top of the rocket, would have used two stages of parachutes.  In the first stage, a single parachute, {{convert|17|ft|m}} in diameter, would stabilize the rocket's fall and slow its descent.  This parachute would then draw out a set of three main parachutes, each {{convert|67|ft|m}} across.  The rocket would come down in the Atlantic Ocean, to be recovered by ship.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 6-29, 6-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine the feasibility of this system, several tests were performed on full-sized Redstones, including water impact and flotation tests, and an exercise at sea in which a floating Redstone was picked up by a Navy recovery ship. All these tests showed recovery of the rocket to be workable.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 6-33 to 6-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Further development was halted, however, due to lack of funding, so the parachute system was not tested.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 6-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flights ==

Mercury-Redstone flights were designated with the prefix "MR-".  Confusingly, the Mercury-Redstone boosters used for these flights were designated in the same way, usually with different numbers.  (In photographs, this designation can sometimes be seen on the rocket's tail end.)  Two rockets, MR-4 and MR-6, were never flown. Although there had been rumors that NASA in the very beginning of Project Mercury had intended to launch each astronaut on a suborbital mission before beginning orbital Atlas flights, they only purchased eight Mercury-Redstone boosters, one of which was damaged in the unsuccessful MR-1 launch and not reused, and another used for the MR-BD flight (the original schedule was for one unmanned Mercury-Redstone flight, one chimpanzee flight, and six manned flights). Since Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom's flights were successful and since the Soviet Union had flown two orbital manned space flights by the late summer of 1961, there was no need to continue with Redstone missions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mercury-Redstone Project'', p. 6-3, 8-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet''''' is a [[children's literature]] book by science writer June A. English and astronaut [[Thomas David Jones]] that was published in 1996 by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Jones was among the crew members of the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] during an [[STS-59|eleven-day mission in space]], which was launched in April 1994 to study the ecological well-being of Earth using specialized radar technology. The book, which is illustrated with radar images and picturesque photographs, chronicles the mission and Jones' experiences of it.

''Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet'' received a generally favorable reception in media coverage and book reviewers. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' said, "The authors convey the awe and wonderment of seeing Earth from space and the intricate delicacy of the Earth's ecology".&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt; ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' said, "The astronaut's descriptions are vivid".&lt;ref name="thurman" /&gt; A review in ''[[Booklist]]'' was more critical; it said, "The authors try to cover too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes simplified at times".&lt;ref name="steinhorn" /&gt; ''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote, "It provides a unique look at a new method of research and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor".&lt;ref name="elaine" /&gt; The book was selected for inclusion in books ''Best Books for Children'',&lt;ref name="best" /&gt; and ''Adventuring With Books'',&lt;ref name="adventuring" /&gt; or educating youths about history by using children's literature works.

In ''Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet'', astronaut Thomas David Jones recounts his experiences studying the Earth during his first mission with the United States space agency NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{oclc|32464949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' space mission lasted eleven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=170, 641, 663|first=Linda L.|last= Homa|last2=Schreck |first2=Ann L. |last3=Hoebener |first3=Maureen|title=Elementary School Library Collection: A Guide to Books and Other Media, Phases 1-2-3|publisher=Brodart Co|year=1998|isbn=0-87272-114-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was a member of the crew of the Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'', which left Earth in April 1994.&lt;ref name="wandajmiller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Wanda J.|pages=106, 222|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1998|isbn=978-1-56308-581-9|title=Teaching U.S. history through children's literature: post-World War II}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was intended to provide the [[STS-59|Space Radar Lab]] with a view of the planet.&lt;ref name="wandajmiller" /&gt; By using three separate radar echoes, scientists were able to analyze a full image of the planet.&lt;ref name="wandajmiller" /&gt; The radar technology could penetrate obstructions, including clouds and thick outgrowth of trees.&lt;ref name="wandajmiller" /&gt; Another purpose of the mission was to analyze the ecological state of the planet and to take measurements of pollution caused by [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref name="fenly" /&gt;

The book is based upon journal entries written by Jones during the mission.&lt;ref name="thurman" /&gt; He presents a typical NASA mission member's day-to-day experiences while living on the space shuttle.&lt;ref name="elaine" /&gt; Jones illustrates his account with photographs from his mission and pictures from the radar capture.&lt;ref name="wandajmiller" /&gt; He describes his observations while looking at the Earth from space, for example he says, "Maybe more than any other sight from space, lightning gives the decided impression that the Earth is alive, a living organism".&lt;ref name="fenly"&gt;{{cite news|title=Let shooting comet catch your child's fancy|date=February 16, 1997 |first=Leigh |last=Fenly|work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|page=5, Section: Books|publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] phenomena as, "shimmering fingers of green light reaching up from the dark ocean, an arc of light around the South Magnetic Pole".&lt;ref name="thurman" /&gt;  June English provides contextual information about Jones' mission.&lt;ref name="horn" /&gt;

==Reception==

''Mission: Earth, Voyage to the Home Planet'' received a positive review from journalist Rebecca O'Connell, who wrote in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', "The authors convey the awe and wonderment of seeing Earth from space and the intricate delicacy of the Earth's ecology".&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt; She said of the descriptive nature of the text, "Their descriptions of scientific phenomena read like revelations of mystic wonders. But this is not to say it is ponderous, not at all."&lt;ref name="oconnell" /&gt; O'Connell's review concluded, "The text is packed with fascinating information and humorous touches. Even children who are not ordinarily interested in space or ecology will be interested in this book, and aficionados will go ga-ga."&lt;ref name="oconnell"&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connell|first=Rebecca|date=November 10, 1996|issn=1068-624X|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|page=G–11|title=Reading that's fun and fundamental}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leigh Fenly of ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' recommended the book, and said, "Science writer June English tracked the launch and adds perspective on how the mission will help scientists understand Earth, including its atmosphere, geology, ecology{{mdash}}and future".&lt;ref name="fenly" /&gt; Nita Thurman wrote for ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', "''Mission: Earth, A Journey to the Home Planet'' has dozens of color photos taken inside the shuttle and through its windows. The astronaut's descriptions are vivid."&lt;ref name="thurman" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote favorably of the book, saying, "Astronaut Jones's enthusiasm for his work is contagious; it shines through the text, making for a roundly enjoyable and informative read".&lt;ref name="publishers"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]]|year=1996|title=Mission: Earth|publisher=Reed Business Information, Inc|location=United States|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' recommended the book and said it is, "[w]ell-conceived and thoughtfully executed, this book deserves a wide audience."&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

A review of the book by Ilana Steinhorn in ''[[Booklist]]'' was more critical. Steinhorn said, "The authors try to cover too much in so few pages, and the narrative, with several focal points, becomes simplified at times&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Still, the account is interesting, and the many high-quality, often breathtaking color photographs and radar images complement the text nicely".&lt;ref name="steinhorn"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ilana|last=Steinhorn|journal=[[Booklist]]|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|title=Mission: Earth|date=October 15, 1996|volume=93|page=415|location=United States|issn=0006-7385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaine Fort Weischedel reviewed the book for ''[[School Library Journal]]'', and recommended it for teaching specific subject matter. She wrote, "Pollution patterns, shifting ocean currents, destruction of rain forests, and other environmental changes were the heart of Jones's project, and this book might be used more successfully to supplement the curriculum in those areas than in units on space flight per se".&lt;ref name="elaine"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Elaine Fort |last=Weischedel |journal=[[School Library Journal]]|publisher=Library Journals LLC; [[Media Source, Inc.]]|title=Mission: Earth|volume=42|date=October 1996|page=130|location=United States|issn=0362-8930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weischedel said the book "provides a unique look at a new method of research and an opportunity for youngsters to read one scientist's account of what it's like to engage in this exciting field of endeavor".&lt;ref name="elaine" /&gt; ''[[Horn Book Review]]'' called the book "a uniquely personal account", and said it "features a crowded design, but the many color photographs throughout the text are fascinating".&lt;ref name="horn"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Horn Book Review]]|title=Mission: Earth|year=1996|publisher=The Horn Book, Inc; [[Media Source, Inc.]]|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Tetens''' (26 September 1865, [[Rendsburg]], Germany – 15 February 1945, [[Teplitz-Schönau]]) was a German [[natural scientist]] with an [[astronomer]] background.

== Life ==
Tetens was the son of a high ranked police officer in [[Schleswig]], Northern Germany. He went to several universities for different [[natural science]] topics in [[Tübingen]], [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Kiel]].
After this period, he worked at the private astronomy observatory of Miklos Konkly-Thege in Ogyalla in Hungary.
In 1891 he got his Doctor degree of Natural Science. He then worked at different institutes in astronomy such as the Deutsche Seewarte, [[Hamburg]], and the [[Observatory of Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: Family records now owned by C. Niggemann&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1902 to 1905 Otto Tetens worked for the Royal Society of Science of Göttingen on a climate project in [[Samoa]], then a German colony. He founded the Apia Observatory in June 1902 at Mulinuu near the main town of [[Apia]]. After his time in Samoa, he went back to Germany and [[Göttingen]] to work on his reports for the previous three years and then took an occupation at the Royal Astronomy Observatory in [[Kiel]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ergebnisse Der Arbeiten Des Samoa-Observatoriums ... II. Die Meteorologischen Registrierungen Der Jahre 1902-1906 ... Mit 3 Tafeln und 25 in Den Text Gedruckten FigurenReport Otto Tetens und Franz Linke&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 to 1931 Tetens worked at the meteorological observatory in {{ill|Lindenberg (Tauche)|de|lt=Lindenberg}}, Germany (south-east of [[Berlin]]) as chief-observer. After retirement he moved to [[Bad Saarow]], some 10&amp;nbsp;km away from Lindenberg and lived at his house in [http://see27.d] Seestrasse] at the Lake Scharmützelsee.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Steinhagen: Lindenberger Himmelsjäger, published in Arkana-Verlag Göttingen&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1945 while staying at a sanatorium in Teplitz-Schönau. His wife Dorothee Heimrod, daughter of the Council of the United States in Samoa and later Switzerland, moved back to the USA in 1947 and died 1962 in [[New York City]].

== Photography by Otto Tetens ==
During his time in Samoa, Otto Tetens took a great number of valuable and interesting photos of his time and the people of Samoa. These photos were exhibited in Germany and Samoa in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Samoa 1904, published by Christiane Niggemann 2004, Arkana-Verlag Göttingen&lt;/ref&gt;

The photo with the paramount chief Josefo Mataafa shows the way Otto Tetens was living in Samoa: as a partner on the same level, with strong adoption of Samoan culture and habits. His houses for work and living at the Mulinuu observatory were built as Samoan fales, not as German wood houses. The photo was taken in 1904 by Otto Tetens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">A '''physical test''' is a [[qualitative property|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] procedure  that consists of determination of one or more characteristics of a given product, process or service according to a specified procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] E 1301, Standard Guide for Proficiency Testing by Interlaboratory Comparisons&lt;/ref&gt; Often this is part of an [[experiment]].

'''Physical testing''' is common in [[physics]], [[engineering]], and [[quality assurance]].

==Purposes==
Physical testing might have a variety of purposes, such as:
* if, or verify that, the requirements of a [[specification]], [[regulation]], or [[contract]] are met
* Decide if a [[new product development]] program is on track: Demonstrate [[proof of concept]]
* Demonstrate the utility of a proposed [[patent]]
* Provide [[Technical standard|standard]] [[data]] for other scientific, engineering, and [[quality assurance]] functions
* Validate suitability for end-use
* Provide a basis for  [[Technical communication]]
* Provide a technical means of comparison of several options
* Provide [[evidence]] in legal proceedings

==Performance testing==
Some physical testing is ''performance testing'' which covers a wide range of engineering or functional evaluations where a material, product, or system is not specified by detailed material or component specifications. Rather, emphasis is on the final measurable performance characteristics. Testing can be a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] or [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] procedure.
Many [[Acceptance testing]] protocols employ performance testing e.g. In the stress testing of a new design of chair.

===Examples of performance testing===
* Building and [[Construction]] Performance Testing
* [[Fire protection]] ([[ASTM]] D176)
* [[Packaging]] Performance ([[hazardous materials]], [[dangerous goods]], [[ASTM]] D4169) 
* Performance Index for [[Tire]]s ([[ASTM]] F538)
* Performance Test Code on Compressors and Exhausters ([[ASME]] PTC 10 - 1997)
* [[Personal protective equipment]] performance
* Several [[Defense Standard]]s
* Wear of Textiles ([[ASTM]] D123)

The '''Puerto Rican hutia''' (''Isolobodon portoricensis'') is an [[extinction|extinct]] species of [[rodent]] in the family [[Capromyidae]]. It was found in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], and [[Puerto Rico]].

The Puerto Rican hutia was a vital food source for the [[Amerindians]] for many years. With being hunted by [[Arawak]] Indians, they continued to survive until the arrival of early European explorers. [[Christopher Columbus]] and his crew are believed to have eaten the species upon their arrival. The species declined following European colonization of the West Indies. It is unclear whether it survived after facing threats from the early introduction of [[black rat]]s (''Rattus rattus'') by the first European settlers around 1500, although it may have been finally wiped out by introduced mongooses in the nineteenth or early 20th century. Although commonly regarded as extinct, some researchers hold out hopes that the species still survives in undisturbed refuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=32|title= Puerto Rican Hutia (Isolobodon portoricensis)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10429">In the theory of [[quantum communication]], the '''quantum capacity''' is the highest rate at which [[quantum information]] can be communicated over many independent uses of a noisy [[quantum channel]] from a sender to a receiver. It is also equal to the highest rate at which [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] can be generated over the channel, and forward classical communication cannot improve it. The quantum capacity theorem is important for the theory of [[quantum error correction]], and more broadly for the theory of [[quantum computation]]. The theorem giving a lower bound on the quantum capacity of any channel is colloquially known as the LSD theorem, after the authors [[Seth Lloyd|Lloyd]],&lt;ref name="Lloyd1997"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Physical Review A | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 1613–1622 | year = 1997 | author = Seth Lloyd |title = Capacity of the noisy quantum channel | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.55.1613 | arxiv = quant-ph/9604015|bibcode = 1997PhRvA..55.1613L }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Shor|Shor]],&lt;ref name="Shor2002"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Lecture Notes, MSRI Workshop on Quantum Computation | year = 2002 | author = Peter Shor | title = The quantum channel capacity and coherent information | url = http://www.msri.org/publications/ln/msri/2002/quantumcrypto/shor/1/meta/aux/shor.pdf | format = pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Devetak&lt;ref name="Devetak2005"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = IEEE Transactions on Information Theory | volume = 51 | pages = 44–55 | year = 2005 | author = Igor Devetak | title = The private classical capacity and quantum capacity of a quantum channel | doi = 10.1109/TIT.2004.839515 | arxiv = quant-ph/0304127}}&lt;/ref&gt; who proved it with increasing standards of rigor.

== Hashing bound for Pauli channels ==

The LSD theorem states that the [[coherent information]] of a [[quantum channel]] is an achievable rate for reliable quantum communication. For a [[Pauli channel]], the [[coherent information]] has a simple form{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} and the proof that it is achievable is particularly simple as well. We{{Who|date=October 2017}} prove the theorem for this special case by exploiting random [[stabilizer code]]s and correcting only the likely errors that the channel produces.

'''Theorem''' (hashing bound). There exists a stabilizer [[quantum error-correcting code]] that achieves the hashing limit &lt;math&gt;R=1-H\left(\mathbf{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for a Pauli channel of the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \rho \mapsto p_{I}\rho+p_{X}X\rho X+p_{Y}Y\rho Y+p_{Z}Z\rho Z,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}=\left(p_{I},p_{X},p_{Y},p_{Z}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H\left(\mathbf{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of this probability vector.

'''Proof'''. Consider correcting only the typical errors. That is, consider defining the
[[typical set]] of errors as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\equiv\left\{  a^{n}:\left\vert -\frac{1}{n}
\log_{2}\left(  \Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  \right)  -H\left(
\mathbf{p}\right)  \right\vert \leq\delta\right\} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is some sequence consisting of the letters &lt;math&gt;\left\{I,X,Y,Z\right\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability
that an IID Pauli channel issues some tensor-product error &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}\equiv
E_{a_{1}}\otimes\cdots\otimes E_{a_{n}}&lt;/math&gt;. This typical set consists of the likely errors in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\} \geq 1-\epsilon,
&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The error-correcting
conditions&lt;ref name="NC"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = Michael A. | author1-link = Michael Nielsen | last2 = Chuang | first2 = Isaac L. | author2-link = Isaac Chuang | title = Quantum Computation and Quantum Information | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 9780521635035}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a stabilizer code &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; in this case are that &lt;math&gt;\{E_{a^{n}}:a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\}&lt;/math&gt; is a correctable set of errors if
:&lt;math&gt;
  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\notin N\left(\mathcal{S}\right) \backslash \mathcal{S},
&lt;/math&gt;
for all error pairs &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{b^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a^{n},b^{n}\in
T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;N(\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[normalizer]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. Also, we consider the expectation of the error probability under a random choice of a stabilizer code.

Proceed as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{p_{e}\right\}
  &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \sum_{a^{n}} \Pr \left\{ E_{a^{n}}\right\}
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} \\
  &amp;\leq \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
       \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} + \epsilon \\
  &amp;= \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
     \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\} \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{S}}
     \left\{
       \mathcal{I}\left(E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right)
     \right\} + \epsilon \\
  &amp;= \sum_{a^{n} \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}
     \Pr\left\{E_{a^{n}}\right\}
     \Pr_{\mathcal{S}} \left\{E_{a^{n}}\text{ is uncorrectable under }\mathcal{S}\right\} + \epsilon.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The first equality follows by definition—&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator function equal to one if &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrectable under &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; and equal to zero otherwise. The first inequality follows, since we correct only the typical errors because the atypical error set has negligible probability mass. The second equality follows by exchanging the expectation and the sum. The third equality follows because the expectation of an indicator function is the probability that the event it selects occurs. Continuing, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  =\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}
^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n},\ E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \backslash\mathcal{S}\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{A^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}
^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n},\ E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =\sum_{a^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}}\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  \bigcup\limits_{b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}
},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)
\right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n},b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}
\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  \Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger
}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  \right\}  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq\sum_{a^{n},b^{n}\in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}},\ b^{n}\neq a^{n}}
\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}}\right\}  2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  \leq2^{2n\left[  H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }2^{-n\left[
H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;  =2^{-n\left[  1-H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  -k/n-3\delta\right]  }.
&lt;/math&gt;
The first equality follows from the error-correcting conditions for a quantum stabilizer code, where &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt; is the normalizer of
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;. The first inequality follows by ignoring any potential degeneracy in the code—we consider an error uncorrectable if it lies in the normalizer &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt; and the probability can only be larger because &lt;math&gt;N\left(  \mathcal{S}\right)  \backslash\mathcal{S}\in N\left(
\mathcal{S}\right)  &lt;/math&gt;. The second equality follows by realizing that the probabilities for the existence criterion and the union of events are equivalent. The second inequality follows by applying the union bound. The third inequality follows from the fact that the probability for a fixed operator &lt;math&gt;E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}&lt;/math&gt; not equal to the identity commuting with
the stabilizer operators of a random stabilizer can be upper bounded as follows:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\Pr_{\mathcal{S}}\left\{  E_{a^{n}}^{\dagger}E_{b^{n}}\in N\left(  \mathcal{S}
\right)  \right\}  =\frac{2^{n+k}-1}{2^{2n}-1}\leq2^{-\left(  n-k\right)  }.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
The reasoning here is that the random choice of a stabilizer code is equivalent to
fixing operators &lt;math&gt;Z_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;Z_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; and performing a uniformly random
Clifford unitary. The probability that a fixed operator commutes with
&lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}_{1}&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}_{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; is then just the number of
non-identity operators in the normalizer (&lt;math&gt;2^{n+k}-1&lt;/math&gt;) divided by the total number of non-identity operators (&lt;math&gt;2^{2n}-1&lt;/math&gt;). After applying the above bound, we then exploit the following typicality bounds:
:&lt;math&gt;
\forall a^{n}   \in T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}:\Pr\left\{  E_{a^{n}
}\right\}  \leq2^{-n\left[  H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  },&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert T_{\delta}^{\mathbf{p}^{n}}\right\vert   \leq2^{n\left[  H\left(
\mathbf{p}\right)  +\delta\right]  }.
&lt;/math&gt;
We conclude that as long as the rate &lt;math&gt;k/n=1-H\left(  \mathbf{p}\right)
-4\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the expectation of the error probability becomes arbitrarily small, so that there exists at least one choice of a stabilizer code with the same bound on the error probability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''SAT Subject Test in Physics''', '''Physics SAT II''', or simply the '''Physics SAT''', is a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] on [[physics]] administered by [[The College Board]] in the United States. A high school student generally chooses to take the test to fulfill [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools at which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''; they are still well known by this name.

The material tested on the Physics SAT is supposed to be equivalent to that taught in a junior- or senior-level high school physics class. It requires critical thinking and test-taking strategies, at which high school freshmen or sophomores may be inexperienced. The Physics SAT tests more than what normal state requirements are; therefore, many students prepare for the Physics SAT using a [[prep book|preparatory book]] or by taking an [[AP course]] in [[Physics]].

==Format==

The SAT Subject Test in Physics has 75 questions and consists of two parts: Part A and Part B.

'''Part A:''' 
*  First 12 or 13 questions
*  4 groups of two to four questions each
*  The questions within any one group all relate to a single situation.
*  Five possible answer choices are given before the question.
*  An answer choice can be used once, more than once, or not at all in each group.

'''Part B:'''
*  Last 62 or 63 questions
*  Each question has five possible answer choice with one correct answer.
*  Some questions may be in groups of two or three.

==Scoring==

The test has 75 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This score is then converted to a scaled score of 200–800. The mean score for the 2006–07 test administrations was 643 with a [[standard deviation]] of 107. Sample percentile ranks for the 2008&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat_subject_tests_percentile_ranks_2008.pdf SAT Subject Tests Percentile Ranks]&lt;/ref&gt; administrations are available from the College Board.

==Preparation==
The College Board's recommended preparation is a one-year college preparatory course in physics, a one-year course in [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]], and experience in the laboratory.

==Resources==
Students taking the SAT Subject Test in Physics are prohibited from using any resources during the test, including textbooks, notes, or formula sheets. Although there are mathematics questions including trigonometry, the use of a calculator is not allowed. All scratch work must be done directly in the test booklet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">'''Series''' are subdivisions of [[stratum|rock layers]] based on the age of the rock  and formally defined by international conventions of the [[geological timescale]]. A series is therefore a sequence of strata defining a [[chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] unit. Series are subdivisions of [[system (stratigraphy)|systems]] and are themselves divided into [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]].

Series is a term defining a unit of rock layers formed during a certain interval of time (a chronostratigraphic unit); it is equivalent (but not synonymous) to the term ''geological epoch'' (see [[epoch criteria]]) which defines the interval of time itself, although the two words are sometimes confused in informal literature.

==Series in the geological timescale==
{{Geology to Paleobiology}}
The geological timescale has all [[system (stratigraphy)|system]]s in the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eonothem]] subdivided into series. Some of these have their own names, in other cases a system is simply divided into a Lower, Middle and Upper series. The [[Cretaceous]] system is for example divided into the Upper Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous series; while the [[Carboniferous]] system is divided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] and [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] series. In 2008, the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] had not yet named all four series of the [[Cambrian]]. Currently series are limited to the Phanerozoic, but the ICS has stated its intention of subdividing the three systems of the [[Neoproterozoic]] ([[Ediacaran]], [[Cryogenian]] and [[Tonian]]) into stages too.

==Systems and lithostratigraphy==
Systems can include many lithostratigraphic units (for example [[formation (geology)|formations]], [[bed (geology)|beds]], [[member (geology)|members]], etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time. In the same way, a lithostratigraphic unit can include a number of systems or parts of them.

The '''Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory''' (SAIL) was a facility at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]].

It was the only facility in the Space Shuttle Program where actual orbiter hardware and flight software can be integrated and tested in a simulated flight environment. It supported the entire [[Space Shuttle]] program to perform integrated verification tests. It also contained Firing Room Launch Equipment identical to that used at KSC. Thus complete ground verifications as well as countdown and abort operations could be tested and simulated.

The testing process is extensive and rigorous; the software on the Shuttle is often considered to be among the most bug-free of operational systems.

The laboratory contains a complete avionics mock-up of a Shuttle, [[Orbiter Vehicle Designation|designated]] OV-095. While only a skeleton of an orbiter, the electronics are identical in position and type to those used on the Shuttle; it is a sufficiently faithful replica that crews sometimes prefer to use it to train on, rather than the training simulators.

NASA personnel who have been assigned to SAIL testing include [[Charlie Bolden]] (former [[NASA Administrator]]), [[Michael Coats]] (former Director at JSC NASA), [[Brewster Shaw]] (Boeing Vice President of Space Exploration Division) and [[Albert H. Crews|Al Crews]] (selected as an astronaut for the [[X-20 Dyna-Soar]]).

The first SAIL commander was James E. Westom of Rockwell International, retired Major USAF.  He flew the Approach and Landing phase in SAIL before Space Shuttle Enterprise was launched off the top of the NASA C-747 airplane to prove it could fly on its own in the atmosphere.

The SAIL facility will be renovated and recreated as a stop on the [[Space Center Houston]] Level 9 Tour, a separate add-on to the visitor's center admission in which tourists are given entrance to buildings normally off limits to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/jscfeatures/articles/000001117.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar weather''' is branch of [[meteorology]], which studies the behavior of the sun and how those behaviors can be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hanslmeier (2007). ''The Sun and Space Weather'' (2nd Edition).  Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 2nd ed. 2007 edition. {{ISBN|978-9048174065}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Solar weather research involves developing and running simulations of solar behavior, as well as observing the sun using observation equipment.

Due to the enormous size and mass of the sun, solar weather predictions aren’t as precise as earth-weather predictions. 

Solar weather is closely related to  [[space weather]] and often included in same category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22477">An '''antiviral stockpile''' is a reserve supply of essential [[antiviral medication]]s in case of shortage.  Many countries have chosen to stockpile antiviral medications against [[pandemic influenza]].&lt;ref name="pmid17182341"&gt;{{cite journal

There are no [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based guidelines]] to guide the use of these stockpiled drugs,&lt;ref name="pmid17182341" /&gt; and plans are based on assumed similarities to seasonal influenza.  The most common antivirals are [[neuraminidase inhibitors]], which, if begun during the first 48 hours after symptoms appear, will reduce the duration of seasonal influenza by about one day.  Taken before symptoms appear, it may prevent disease in about three-quarters of people treated prophylactically.&lt;ref name="pmid17115954"&gt;{{cite journal
|vauthors=Harrod ME, Emery S, Dwyer DE |title=Antivirals in the management of an influenza pandemic

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, this is recommended in institutionalized elderly people and other high-risk groups as a form of [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] during seasonal influenza outbreaks.&lt;ref name="pmid14753128" /&gt;  However, since pandemic influenza differs somewhat from normal seasonal influenza, it is not clear that these drugs will prove either safe or effective for their intended purpose.&lt;ref name="pmid17115954" /&gt;

For a person that has very recently been exposed to seasonal influenza, effective post-exposure prophylaxis generally requires taking a drug like [[oseltamivir]] for seven to ten days, at half the daily dose needed for treatment.  A person that is repeatedly exposed, such as hospital staff members, may require continuous treatment throughout the duration of the outbreak in a community.  Based on experience with seasonal influenza in [[nursing homes]], control of influenza requires full treatment of any ill persons and prophylactic treatment of all their contacts.  In a pandemic situation, before a vaccine becomes available, this level of treatment and medical prevention may require providing drugs to 80% of the people in an affected community.&lt;ref name="pmid15709056" /&gt;  Consequently, very large supplies of the drugs must be made available — much larger supplies than could be produced on demand.  Stockpiles are generally arranged in advance by government health authorities, due to fear of shortages and an awareness of manufacturing limitations during an outbreak.&lt;ref name="pmid15709056" /&gt;

'''Storm chasing''' is broadly defined as the pursuit of any [[severe weather]] condition, regardless of motive, which can be curiosity, adventure, scientific investigation, or for news or media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Glickman |first = Todd S. (ed.) |authorlink=Todd Glickman |title = Glossary of Meteorology |publisher = American Meteorological Society |edition = 2nd |year = 2000 |location = |pages =  |url = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=storm+chaser |doi = |isbn = 978-1-878220-34-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who chases storms is known as a '''storm chaser''', or simply a '''chaser'''. While witnessing a [[tornado]] is the single biggest objective for most chasers, many chase [[thunderstorm]]s and delight in viewing [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] and related [[cloud]] structures, watching a barrage of [[hail]] and [[lightning]], and seeing what skyscapes unfold. There are also a smaller number of storm chasers who intercept [[tropical cyclones]] and [[waterspout]]s.&lt;ref name="ST FAQ"/&gt;

==Nature of and motivations for chasing==
Storm chasing is chiefly a recreational endeavor, with motives usually given toward photographing or videoing the storm and for multivariate personal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Blass |first = Eileen |title = The thrill of the chase, the fury of the storm |newspaper = USA Today |pages = |year = 2008 |url = https://www.usatoday.com/weather/tornado/chase2001/2001-06-18-chase-paper.htm |accessdate = 2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include the beauty of views afforded by the sky and land, the mystery of not knowing precisely what will unfold and the quest to undetermined destination on the open road, intangible experiences such as feeling one with a much larger and powerful natural world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hoadley |first= David |authorlink= David K. Hoadley |title= Commentary: Why Chase Tornadoes? |journal= Storm Track |volume= 5 |issue= 3 |pages= 1 |date= Mar 1982 |url= http://www.stormtrack.org/library/chasing/whychas.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; the challenge of correctly [[weather forecasting|forecasting]] and intercepting storms with the optimal vantage points,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Marshall |first= Tim |authorlink= Timothy P. Marshall |title= A Passion for Prediction: There's more to chasing than intercepting a tornado |journal= Weatherwise |volume= 46 |issue= 2 |pages= 22–6 |date= Apr–May 1993 |url= http://www.stormtrack.org/library/chasing/passion.htm |doi= 10.1080/00431672.1993.9930229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and pure [[thrill seeking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Clary |first= Mike |title= The Thrill of Confrontation… Chasing Tornadoes |journal= Weatherwise |volume= 39 |issue= 3 |pages= 136–45 |year= 1983 |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00431672.1986.9927045 |doi= 10.1080/00431672.1986.9927045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pecuniary interests and competition may also be components; in contrast, camaraderie is common.

Although scientific work is sometimes cited as a goal, direct participation in such work is almost always impractical except for those collaborating in an organized university or government project.&lt;ref name="recreational chasing"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=David |title=Beyond Twister: A Geography of Recreational Storm Chasing on the Southern Plains |journal=[[Geographical Review]] |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=533–53 |date=Oct 1999 |doi=10.2307/216101 |jstor=216101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many chasers also are [[Storm spotting|storm spotter]]s, reporting their observations of hazardous weather to relevant authorities. These reports greatly benefit real-time warnings with [[ground truth]] information as well as science by increasing the reliability of severe storm databases used in [[Tornado climatology|climatology]] and other research (which ultimately boosts forecast and warning skill).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Edwards |first= Roger |authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist) |title= What You See Really Does Matter |journal= Storm Track |volume= 17 |issue= 3 |pages= 10–11 |date= Mar–Apr 1994 |url= http://www.stormtrack.org/library/chasing/stroger.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many recreational chasers submit photos and videos to researchers as well as to the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) for spotter training.&lt;ref name="spotting history"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Doswell III |first= Charles A. |authorlink= Charles A. Doswell III |author2=A.R. Moller |author3=H.E.

Storm chasers are not generally paid to chase, with the exception of television media crews in certain television market areas, video [[Stringer (journalism)|stringers]] and photographers ([[freelancer]]s mostly, but some staff), and researchers such as [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] [[meteorologists]] and professors. An increasing number sell storm videos and pictures and manage to make a profit. A few operate "chase tour" services, making storm chasing a recently developed [[List of adjectival tourisms|niche tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first = Heather |last = Cantillon |author2=R.S.

No degree or certification is required to be a storm chaser. Local National Weather Service offices do hold storm spotter training classes, usually early in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NWS Skywarn |publisher = National Weather Service |date = 2011-05-10 |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/ |accessdate = 2012-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some offices collaborate to produce [[severe weather]] workshops oriented toward operational meteorologists.

Storm chasers come from a wide variety of occupational and socioeconomic backgrounds. A fair number are meteorologists, however, most storm chasers may be from any number of occupational fields that have little or nothing to do with meteorology. A large majority of chasers are male and white but a minority are female or of Asian or other descents. The average age is probably around 35 but chasers could theoretically be of any age. A relatively high proportion possess college degrees and a large number live in the central and southern U.S. Many are lovers of [[nature]] with interests that also include [[flora]], [[fauna]], [[volcano]]es, [[aurora]], [[meteor]]s, [[eclipse]]s, and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name="ST FAQ"/&gt;

==History==
The first recognized storm chaser is [[David K. Hoadley|David Hoadley]] (1938&amp;ndash; ), who began chasing [[North Dakota]] storms in 1956, systematically using data from area weather offices and airports. He is widely considered the pioneer storm chaser&lt;ref name="ST FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |last = Edwards |first = Roger |authorlink= Roger Edwards (meteorologist) |author2=Tim Vasquez  |title = The Online Storm Chasing FAQ |publisher = Storm Track |date = 13 Aug 2002 |url = http://www.stormtrack.org/library/faq/ |accessdate = 2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the founder of ''[[Storm Track (magazine)|Storm Track]]'' magazine.

Bringing research chasing to the forefront was [[Neil B. Ward]] (1914–1972) who in the 1950s and 1960s enlisted the help of [[Oklahoma Highway Patrol]] to study storms. His work pioneered modern storm spotting and made institutional chasing a reality.

The first coordinated storm chasing activity sponsored by institutions was undertaken as part of the [[Alberta Hail Project|Alberta Hail Studies]] project beginning in 1969&lt;ref name="ALHAS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Barge |first=B. L. | last2=Isaac| first2= G. A.| title=The Shape of Alberta Hailstones |journal=Journal de Recherches Atmosphériques |volume=7 |pages=11-20 |date=1973| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300117070_The_shape_of_Alberta_hailstones}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [http://cmosarchives.ca/Metphotos/T10/ALHAS1_1969.jpg Vehicles] were outfitted with various meteorological instrumentation and hail catching apparatus. They were directed into suspected thunderstorm hail regions by a controller at a [http://cmosarchives.ca/Metphotos/T10/ALHAS4_1969.jpg radar site]. The controller communicated with the vehicles by radio. 

In 1972 the [[University of Oklahoma]] (OU) in cooperation with the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) began the Tornado Intercept Project, with the first outing taking place on 19 April of that year.&lt;ref name="Grazulis Tornado"&gt;{{cite book |last = Grazulis |first = Thomas P. |authorlink = Thomas P. Grazulis |title = The Tornado: Nature's Ultimate Windstorm |publisher = University of Oklahoma Press |year = 2001 |location = Norman, OK |pages = &lt;!-- 241-2 --&gt; |isbn = 0-8061-3258-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first large-scale tornado chasing activity sponsored by an institution. It culminated in a brilliant success in 1973 with the [[Union City, Oklahoma]] tornado providing a foundation for tornado and supercell morphology that proved the efficacy of storm chasing field research.&lt;ref name="field programs history"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bluestein |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard B. Bluestein |title=A History of Severe-Storm-Intercept Field Programs |journal=Weather Forecast. |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=558–77 |date=August 1999 |url=http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=1520-0434&amp;volume=014&amp;issue=04&amp;page=0558 |doi=10.1175/1520-0434(1999)014&lt;0558:AHOSSI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1999WtFor..14..558B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project produced the first legion of veteran storm chasers, with Hoadley's ''Storm Track'' magazine bringing the community together in 1977.

Storm chasing then reached popular culture in three major spurts: in 1978 with the broadcast of an episode of the television program ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]''; in 1985 with a documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]''; and in May 1996 with the theatrical release of ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' which provided an action-packed but distorted glimpse at the hobby. Further early exposure to storm chasing encouraging some in the weather community resulted from several articles beginning in the late 1970s in ''[[Weatherwise]]'' magazine.

Various television programs and increased coverage of severe weather by the media, especially since the initial video revolution in which VHS ownership became widespread by the early 1990s, substantially elevated awareness of and interest in storms and storm chasing. The advent of the Internet, in particular, contributed to a significant growth in number of storm chasers since the mid-late 1990s. A sharp increase in the general public impulsively wandering in their local area searching for tornadoes similarly is largely attributable to these factors. The 2007-2011 Discovery Channel reality series ''[[Storm Chasers (TV series)|Storm Chasers]]'' produced another surge in activity. Over the years the nature of chasing and the characteristics of chasers shifted.

From their advent in the 1970s until the mid-1990s, scientific [[Field experiment|field projects]] were occasionally conducted during spring in the Great Plains.&lt;ref name="field programs history"/&gt; Then, the first of the seminal [[VORTEX projects]] occurred in 1994-95&lt;ref name="VORTEX"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Rasmussen |first = Erik N. |authorlink = Erik N. Rasmussen |author2=J. M. Straka |author3=R. Davies-Jones |author4=C. A. Doswell |author5=F. H. Carr |author6=M. D. Eilts |author7=D. R.

==Typical storm chase==
Chasing often involves driving thousands of miles in order to witness the relatively short window of time of active severe thunderstorms. It is not uncommon for a chaser to end up empty handed on any particular day. Storm chasers' degrees of involvement, competencies, philosophies, and techniques vary widely, but many chasers spend a significant amount of time forecasting, both before going on the road as well as during the chase, utilizing various sources for weather data. Most storm chasers are not meteorologists, and many chasers expend significant time and effort in learning meteorology and the intricacies of severe convective storm prediction through both study and experience.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Besides the copious driving to, from, and during chases, storm chasing is punctuated with contrasting periods of long waiting and ceaseless action. Downtime can consist of sitting under sun-baked skies for hours, playing pickup sports, evaluating data, or visiting landmarks whilst awaiting convective initiation. During an inactive pattern, this down time can persist for days. When storms are going there is often little or no time to eat or relieve oneself and finding fuel can cause frustrating delays and detours. Navigating obstacles such as rivers and areas with inadequate road networks is a paramount concern. Only a handful of chasers decide to chase [[Dixie Alley]], an area of the Southern United States in which trees and road networks heavily obscure the often large tornadoes. The combination of driving and waiting has been likened to "extreme sitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Svenold |first = Mark |title = Big Weather: Chasing Tornadoes in the Heart of America |publisher = Holt |year = 2005 |location = New York |isbn = 978-0805076462 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "bust" occurs when storms do not fire, sometimes referred to as "severe clear", when storms fire but are missed, when storms fire but are meager, or when storms fire after dusk.

Most chasing is accomplished by driving, however, a few individuals occasionally fly planes and television stations in some markets use helicopters. Research projects sometimes employ aircraft, as well.

==Geographical, seasonal, and diurnal activity==
Storm chasers are most active in the spring and early summer, particularly May and June, across the [[Great Plains]] of the [[United States]] (extending into [[Canada]]) in an area colloquially known as [[Tornado Alley]], with many hundred individuals active on some days during this period. This coincides with the most consistent tornado days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Brooks |first = Harold |authorlink = Harold E. Brooks |author2=P.R. Concannon |author3=C.A. Doswell |title = Severe Thunderstorm Climatology |publisher = National Severe Storms Laboratory |date = 2003-08-29 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/ |accessdate = 2012-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the most desirable topography of the Great Plains. Not only are the most intense [[supercell]]s common here, but due to the moisture profile of the atmosphere the storms tend to be more visible than locations farther east where there are also frequent severe thunderstorms. There is a tendency for chases earlier in the year to be farther south, shifting farther north with the [[jet stream]] as the season progresses. Storms occurring later in the year tend to be more isolated and slower moving, both of which are also desirable to chasers.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

Chasers may operate whenever significant thunderstorm activity is occurring, whatever the date. This most commonly includes more sporadic activity occurring in warmer months of the year bounding the spring maximum, such as the active month of April and to a lesser extent March. The focus in the summer months is the Central or Northern Plains states and the Prairie Provinces, the Upper Midwest, or on to just east of the [[Colorado Front Range]]. An annually inconsistent and substantially smaller peak of severe thunderstorm and tornado activity also arises in the transitional months of autumn, particularly October and November. This follows a pattern somewhat the reverse of the spring pattern with the focus beginning in the north then dropping south and with an overall eastward shift. In the area with the most consistent [[Glossary of tornado terms#S|significant]] tornado activity, the Southern Plains, the tornado season is intense but is relatively brief whereas central to northern and eastern areas experience less intense and consistent activity that is diffused over a longer span of the year.&lt;ref name="ST FAQ"/&gt;

Advancing technology since the mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) that were previously eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly in-vehicle weather data such as radar, also led to an increase in chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but on some days occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early spring. Morning or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger [[wind shear]] and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.

Some organized chasing efforts have also begun in the [[Top End]] of the [[Northern Territory]] and in southeastern [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = McLaughlin |first = Murray  |title = Storm chasers hit Top End |work = Australian Broadcasting Corporation |publisher = 7.30 Report |date = 2003-12-17 |url = http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1012266.htm |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Krien |first = Anna |title = Weather from hell is heaven on earth for storm troops |work = Fairfax Digital |publisher = The Age |date = 2004-07-04 |url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/03/1088488200242.html |accessdate = 2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the biggest successes in November and December. A handful of individuals are also known to be chasing in other countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Estonia]], [[Argentina]], [[South Africa]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[New Zealand]]; although many people trek to the Great Plains of [[North America]] from these and other countries around the world (especially from the UK). The number of chasers and number countries where chasers are active expanded at an accelerating pace in Europe from the 1990s-2010s.

==Dangers==
There are inherent dangers involved in pursuing hazardous weather. These range from lightning, tornadoes, large hail, flooding, hazardous road conditions (rain or hail-covered roadways), animals on the roadway, downed power lines (and occasionally other debris), reduced visibility from heavy rain (often wind blown), blowing [[Dust storm|dust]], and [[hail fog]]. Most directly weather-related hazards such as from a tornado are minimized if the storm chaser is knowledgeable and cautious. In some situations severe [[downburst]] winds may push automobiles around, especially high-profile vehicles. Tornadoes affect a relatively small area and are predictable enough to be avoided if sustaining [[situational awareness]] and following strategies including always having an open escape route, maintaining a safe distance, and avoiding placement in the direction of travel of a tornado (in most cases in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] this is to the north and to the east of a tornado). Lightning, however, is an unavoidable hazard. "Core punching", storm chaser slang for driving through a heavy precipitation core to intercept the area of interest within a storm, is recognized as hazardous due to reduced visibility and because many tornadoes are rain-wrapped. The "bear's cage" refers to the area under a rotating [[wall cloud]] (and any attendant tornadoes), which is the "bear", and to the blinding precipitation (which can include window-shatteringly large hail) surrounding some or all sides of a tornado, which is the "cage". Similarly, chasing at night heightens risk due to darkness.&lt;ref name="Storm Talk"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Tim |authorlink=Timothy P. Marshall |others=David Hoadley (illust.) |title=Storm Talk |date=May 1995 |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, the most significant hazard is [[driving]],&lt;ref name="Storm Talk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doswell ethics"/&gt; which is made more dangerous by the severe weather. Adding still more to this hazard are the multiple [[Distracted driving|distractions]] which can compete for a chaser's attention, such as driving, communicating with chase partners and others with a phone and/or radio, navigating, watching the sky, checking weather data, and shooting photos or video. Again here, [[Defensive driving|prudence]] is key to [[Road traffic safety|minimizing]] the risk. Chasers ideally work to prevent the driver from [[Human multitasking|multitasking]] either by chase partners covering the other aspects or by the driver pulling over to do these other things if he or she is chasing alone. Falling [[Sleep-deprived driving|asleep]] while driving is a chase hazard, especially on long trips back. This also is exacerbated by nocturnal darkness and by the [[Fatigue (safety)|defatigating demands]] of driving through precipitation and on slick roads.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Vasquez |first= Tim |authorlink= |title= Storm Chasing Handbook |publisher= Weather Graphics Technologies |edition= 2nd |year= 2008 |location= Garland, TX |url= http://weathergraphics.com/chasing/ |isbn= 0-9706840-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book |last= Marshall |first= Tim |authorlink= Timothy P.

===Incidents===
For nearly 60 years, the only known chaser deaths were driving-related. The first was Christopher Phillips, a University of Oklahoma undergraduate student, killed in a [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]] accident when swerving to miss a rabbit in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 'It Sounded Like a Freight Train': The Dangers of Storm Chasing |publisher = AccuWeather |date = 24 May 2010 |url = http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/it-sounded-like-a-freight-trai/26588 |accessdate = 2013-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three other incidents occurred when [http://www.theperksofchasing.com/ Jeff Wear] was driving home from a [[Hurricane Dennis|hurricane]] chase in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?5199-**JEFF-WEAR** Jeff Wear]&lt;/ref&gt; when Fabian Guerra swerved to miss a deer while driving to a chase in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?20997-Fabian-Guerra-ST-Member Fabian Guerra] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193136/http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?20997-Fabian-Guerra-ST-Member |date=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and when a wrong-way driver resulted in a head-on collision that killed Andy Gabrielson returning from a chase in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?28628-Andy-Gabrielson-killed-in-traffic-accident Andy Gabrielson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408224201/http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?28628-Andy-Gabrielson-killed-in-traffic-accident |date=8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2013, an extreme event led to the first known chaser deaths inflicted directly by weather when the [[2013 El Reno tornado|widest tornado]] ever recorded struck near El Reno, Oklahoma.

==Equipment==
Storm chasers vary with regards to the amount of equipment used, some prefer a minimalist approach; for example, where only basic photographic equipment is taken on a chase, while others use everything from satellite-based tracking systems and live data feeds to vehicle-mounted [[weather station]]s and hail guards.

===Historic===
[[File:Top of NSSL chase vehicle.jpg|thumb|Top of a [[National Severe Storms Laboratory|NSSL]] chase vehicle showing air conditioning unit, compass, and [[Global Positioning System]].]]

Historically, storm chasing relied on either in-field analysis or in some cases nowcasts from trained observers and forecasters. The first in-field technology consisted of radio gear for communication. Much of this equipment could also be adapted to receive [[radiofax]] data which was useful for receiving basic observational and analysis data. The primary users of such technology were university or government research groups who often had larger budgets than individual chasers.

Radio scanners were also heavily used to listen in on [[emergency service]]s and storm spotters so as to determine where the most active or dangerous weather was located. A number of chasers were also [[Amateur radio operator|radio amateurs]], and used mobile (or portable) [[amateur radio]] to communicate directly with spotters and other chasers, allowing them to keep abreast of what they could not themselves see.

It was not until the mid- to late 1980s that the evolution of the [[laptop]] computer would begin to revolutionize storm chasing. Early on, some chasers carried [[acoustic coupler]]s to download batches of raw surface and upper air data from payphones. The technology was too slow for graphical imagery such as [[Weather radar|radar]] and [[Weather satellite|satellite]] data; and during the first years this wasn't available on any connection over telephone lines, anyway. Some raw data could be downloaded and plotted by software, such as [[surface weather observation]]s using ''[http://www.weathergraphics.com/dl/ WeatherGraphix]'' (predecessor to ''[http://www.weathergraphics.com/da/ Digital Atmosphere]'') and similar software or for upper air soundings using ''[http://www.weathergraphics.com/dl/ SHARP]'', ''[http://raob.com/ RAOB]''&lt;!-- http://www.weathergraphics.com/raob/ --&gt;, and similar software.

Most meteorological data was acquired all at once early in the morning, and the rest of day's chasing was based on analysis and forecast gleaned from this; as well as on visual clues that presented themselves in the field throughout the day. Plotted [[weather map]]s were often analyzed by hand for manual diagnosis of meteorological patterns. Occasionally chasers would make stops at rural airstrips or NWS offices for an update on weather conditions. [[NOAA Weather Radio]] (NWR) could provide information in the vehicle, without stopping, such as [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|weather watches and warning]]s, surface weather conditions, [[Storm Prediction Center#Convective outlooks|convective outlook]]s, and NWS radar summaries. Nowadays, storm chasers may use high-speed Internet access available in any library, even in small towns in the US. This data is available throughout the day, but one must find and stop at a location offering Internet access.

With the development of the mobile computers, the first computer mapping software became feasible, at about the same time as the popular adoption of the [[VHS]] [[camcorder]] began a rapid growth phase. Prior to the mid to late 1980s most motion picture equipment consisted of [[8 mm film]] cameras. While the quality of the first VHS consumer cameras was quite poor (and the size somewhat cumbersome) when compared to traditional film formats, the amount of [[Videotape|video]] which could be shot with a minimal amount of resources was much greater than any [[Film stock|film format]] at the time.

In the 1980s and 1990s [[The Weather Channel]] (TWC) and ''[[A.M. Weather]]'' were popular with chasers, in the morning preceding a chase for the latter and both before and during a chase for the former. Commercial radio sometimes also provides weather and damage information. The 1990s brought technological leaps and bounds. With the swift development of [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] technology, television sets for example could be installed with ease in most vehicles allowing storm chasers to actively view local TV stations. Mobile phones became popular making group coordination easier when traditional radio communications methods were not ideal or for those possessing radios. The development of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW) in 1993 hastened adoption of the Internet and led to [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] access to some of the first university weather sites.

The mid-1990s marked the development of smaller more efficient marine radars. While such marine radars are illegal if used in land-mobile situations, a number of chasers were quick to adopt them in an effort to have mobile radar. These radars have been found to interfere with research radars, such as the [[Doppler on Wheels]] (DOW) utilized in field projects. The first personal [[lightning detection]] and mapping devices also became available&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boltek.com Boltek.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the first online radar data was offered by private corporations or, at first with delays, with free services. A popular data vendor by the end of the 1990s was [[WeatherTAP]].

===Current===

Chasers used paper [[Road map|maps]] for navigation and some of those now using GPS still use these as a backup or for strategizing with other chasers. Foldable state maps can be used but are cumbersome due to the multitude of states needed and only show major roads. National atlases allow more detail and all states are contained in a single book, with [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] favored and [[Rand McNally]] followed by [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] also used. The preferred atlases due to great detail in rural areas are the "''Roads of...''" series originally by Shearer Publishing, which first included Texas but expanded to other states such as Oklahoma and Colorado. Covering every state of the union are the [[DeLorme]] "Atlas and Gazetteer" series. DeLorme also produced early GPS receivers that connected to laptops and for years was one of two major mapping software creators. ''DeLorme Street Atlas USA'' or ''[[Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips]]'' were used by most chasers until their discontinuations in 2013. Chasers now use [[Google Maps]] or other [[web mapping]] as no suitable alternative mapping software emerged. GPS receivers may still be used with other software, such as for displaying radar data.

A major turning point was the advent of civilian [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in 1996. At first, GPS units were very costly and only offered basic functions, but that would soon change. Towards the late 1990s the Internet was awash in weather data and free weather software, the first true cellular Internet modems for consumer use also emerged providing chasers access to data in the field without having to rely on a nowcaster. The NWS also released the first free, up-to-date [[NEXRAD]] Level 3 radar data. In conjunction with all of this, GPS units now had the ability to connect with computers, granting greater ease when navigating.

2001 marked the next great technological leap for storm chasers as the first [[Wi-Fi]] units began to emerge offering wireless broadband service in many cases for free. Some places (restaurants, motels, libraries, etc.) were known to reliably offer wireless access and [[wardriving]] located other availabilities. In 2002 the first [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based package to combine GPS positioning and Doppler radar appeared called SWIFT WX.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swiftwx.com/ Swiftwx.com]&lt;/ref&gt; SWIFT WX allowed storm chasers to seamlessly position themselves accurately relative to tornadic storms.

In 2004 two more storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, was a new [[XM Satellite Radio]] based system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wxworx.com/ WxWorx.com]&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing a special receiver and [[Baron Services]] weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant that even in the most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grlevelx.com/ GRLevelX.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[GRLevelX|GRLevel3]] utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true [[Vector graphics|vector]] format with [[Geographic information system|GIS]] layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using [[Spotter Network]] (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.

The most common chaser communications device is the [[Mobile phone|cellular phone]]. These are used for both voice and data connections. External antennas and amplifiers may be used to boost signal transception. It is not uncommon that chasers travel in small groups of cars, and they may use [[Citizens Band radio|CB radio]] (declining in use) or inexpensive [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]] / [[Family Radio Service|FRS]] hand-held [[transceiver]]s for inter-vehicle communication. More commonly, many chasers are also ham radio operators and use the [[2-meter band|2 meters]] [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and, less often, [[70-centimeter band|70 cm]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands to communicate between vehicles or with [[Skywarn]] / [[Canwarn]] spotter networks. [[Scanner (radio)|Scanners]] are often used to monitor spotter, sometimes public safety communications, and can double as [[weather radio]]s. Since the mid-2000s [[social networking services]] may also be used, with [[Twitter]] most used for ongoing events, [[Facebook]] for sharing images and discussing chase reports, and [[Instagram]] trailing in adoption. Social networking services largely (but not completely) replace forums and email lists, which complemented and eventually supplanted ''Stormtrack'' magazine, for conversing about storms.

In-field environmental data is still popular among some storm chasers, especially [[temperature]], moisture, and [[wind speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]] data. Many have chosen to mount weather stations atop their vehicles. Others use handheld [[anemometer]]s. Rulers or baseballs may be brought along for measuring hail and for showing as a comparison object. Vehicle mounted cameras, such as on the roof or more commonly on the dash, provide continuous visual recording capability.

Chasers heavily utilize still [[photography]] since the beginning. [[Videography]] gained prominence by the 1990s into the early 2000s but a resurgence of photography occurred with the advent of affordable and versatile [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR]] (DSLR) [[Still camera|cameras]]. Prior to this, [[35 mm film|35 mm]] [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] [[Photographic film|print]] and [[Reversal film|slide]] [[film format]]s were mostly used, along with some [[Medium format (film)|medium format]] cameras. In the late 2000s, mobile phone [[3G]] data networks became fast enough to allow [[live streaming]] video from chasers using webcams. This live imagery is frequently used by the media, as well as NWS meteorologists, emergency managers, and the general public for direct ground truth information, and it promotes video sales opportunities for chasers. Also by this time, camcorders using [[memory card]]s to record video began to be adopted. [[DV|Digital video]] had been around for years but was recorded on [[Magnetic tape|tape]], whereas [[Solid-state storage|solid-state]] is [[random access]] rather than [[sequential access]] (linear) and has no moving parts. Late in the 2000s [[High-definition video|HD video]] began to overtake [[Standard-definition television|SD]] (which had been [[NTSC]] in North America) in usage as prices came down and performance increased (initially there were low-light and sporadic aliasing problems due to chip and sensor limitations). By the mid-2010s [[4K resolution|4K]] cameras were increasingly in use. [[Tripod (photography)|Tripods]] are used by those seeking crisp professional photo and video imagery and also enable chasers to tend to other activities. Other accessories include cable/remote shutter releases, lightning triggers, and lens filters. Windshield mounted cameras or dome enclosed cameras atop vehicle roofs may also be used, and a few chasers use [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] ("drones").

Late in the 2000s [[smartphone]]s increased in usage, with radar viewing applications frequently used. Particularly, ''[http://www.basevelocity.com/ RadarScope]'' on the [[iOS]] and  [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms is favored. ''[http://www.pykl3radar.com/ Pkyl3]'' was a dominant early choice on Android devices which discontinued development in August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pykl3radar.com/ Aug 31, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Other apps may be used as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|WiFi hotspots]] and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to [[tethering]] or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as [[mobile broadband]] [[Mobile virtual network operator|MNVO]] devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile data range beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of [[tablet computer]]s expanded by the early 2010s. [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]]s (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s. Usage of DSLR for video capture, called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).

Chasers also carry common travel articles and vehicle maintenance items, and sometimes [[first aid kit]]s. Full sized [[spare tire]]s are strongly preferable to "donut" emergency replacement tires. [[Power inverter]]s (often with [[Surge protector|surged protected]] [[power strips]]) power devices that require [[Alternating current|AC]] (indoor/wall outlet) power, although some devices may be powered directly with [[Direct current|DC]] (battery power) from the vehicle electric system. Water repellent products, such as [[Rain-X]] or [[Aquapel (glass treatment)|Aquapel]], are frequently applied to windshields to dispel water when driving as well as mud and small detritus, which boosts visibility and image clarity on photographs and videos shot through glass (which is particularly problematic if [[autofocus]] is on). [[Binoculars]] and sunglasses are commonly employed.

==Ethics==
A growing number of experienced storm chasers advocate the adoption of a code of [[ethics]] in storm chasing featuring safety, courtesy, and objectivity as the backbone.&lt;ref name="Doswell ethics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Doswell III|first=Charles A.|title=Storm Chasing with Safety, Courtesy, and Responsibility|url=http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html|publisher=Michael Graff|accessdate=21 April 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121113806/http://www.flame.org/~cdoswell/chasesums/Chase_safety.html|archivedate=21 January 2009|date=4 April 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moller |first= Alan |authorlink= Alan Moller |title= Storm Chase Ethics |journal= Storm Track |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |pages= 8–9 |date = Mar 1992 |url= http://www.cimms.ou.edu/~stumpf/cethics.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm chasing is a highly visible recreational activity (which is also associated with [[science]]) that is vulnerable to sensationalist media promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormtrack.org/library/faq/#Ethics The Online Storm Chasing FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran storm chasers [[Charles A.

There is occasional discussion among chasers that at some point government regulation may be imposed due to increasing numbers of chasers and because of poor behavior by some individuals; however, many chasers do not expect this eventuality and almost all oppose regulations -—as do some formal studies of dangerous leisure activities which advocate deliberative [[Industry self-regulation|self-policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Olivier |first = Steve |title = Moral Dilemmas of Participation in Dangerous Leisure Activities |journal = Leisure Studies |volume = 25 |issue = 1 |pages = 95–109 |year = 2006 |url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02614360500284692 |jstor = |doi = 10.1080/02614360500284692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is for storm chaser conduct, there is concern about chaser responsibility. Since some chasers are trained in [[first aid]] and even [[Certified first responder|first responder]] procedures, it is not uncommon for tornado chasers to be first on a scene and tending to storm victims or treating injuries at the site of a disaster in advance of emergency personnel and other outside aid.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Cindy. "[[The Weather Network]]". 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from questions concerning their ethical values and conduct, many have been accredited for giving back to the community in several ways. Just before the Joplin tornado a storm chaser provided advanced warning to local law enforcement, prompting them to activate the emergency sirens. Though lives were lost, many who survived accredited their survival to the siren.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/06/01/the-night-that-should-change-tornado-actions-and-storm-chasing-forever|title=The day that should change tornado actions and storm chasing forever|last=Samenow|first=Jason|date=1 June 2013|website=Washington Post|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a storm has passed storm chasers are often the first to arrive on the scene to help assist in the aftermath. An unexpected and yet increasingly more common result of storm chasers is the data they provide to storm research from their videos, social video posts and documentation of storms they encounter. After the El Reno tornado in 2013 portals were created for chasers to submit their information to help in the research of the deadly storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A477459479/SCIC?u=inspire&amp;xid=664ab2f5|title=Crowdsourcing the El Reno 2013 tornado: a new approach for collation and display of storm chaser imagery for scientific applications.|last=Seimon|first=Anton|date=Nov 2016|website=Science in Context|access-date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Urban studies'''  is based on the study of the [[Urban Development|urban development]] of cities. This includes studying the history of city development from an [[Architecture|architectural]] point of view, to the impact of [[urban design]] on [[community development]] efforts. Urban studies helps with the understanding of human values, development, and the interactions they have with their physical environment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rural-Communities-Cornelia-Butler-Flora/dp/0813349710/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=KE2J30BWZH4HECY3Y5BN|title=Rural Communities: Legacy + Change|last=Flora|first=Cornelia Butler|last2=Flora|first2=Jan L.|last3=Gasteyer|first3=Stephen P.|date=2015-08-04|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813349718|edition=5|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field originated primarily from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], and has spread to research how international cities apply this research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/701015428|title=The ghetto : contemporary global issues and controversies|last=Ray.|first=Hutchison,|last2=1960-|first2=Haynes, Bruce D.,|date=2012|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813345031|oclc=701015428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Urban Studies is a large and diverse area of academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw0538k5r9c |title=Ronan Paddison, Editor-in-Chief of Urban Studies |website=YouTube |access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of this, organizations like the [[Urban Studies Foundation]] (in connection with the [[Urban Studies (journal)|Urban Studies Journal]]), provide grant funding for research explicitly aimed at better understanding the complex reality of cities and urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://urbanstudiesfoundation.org |title=Urban Studies Foundation - Grant funding for innovative research projects that advance the frontiers of urban knowledge |website=Urban Studies Foundation |access-date=March 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The study of cities has changed dramatically from the 1800s over time, with new frames of analysis being applied to the development of urban areas.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"&gt;Robinson, J., 2016. Thinking cities through elsewhere: Comparative tactics for a more global urban studies. Progress in Human Geography, 40(1), pp.3-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The first college programs were created to observe how cities were developed based off anthropological research of ghetto communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2Y5DQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=anthropological+urban+studies+1800's+Europe&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Encyclopedia of Anthropology|last=Birx|first=H. James|date=2005-12-08|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761930297|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1900s, urban study programs expanded beyond just looking at the current and historical impacts of city design and began studying how those designs impacted the future interactions of people and how to improve city development through architecture, open spaces, the interactions of people, and different types of capital that forms a community.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Urban history]] plays an important role in this field of study because it reveals how cities have developed previously.&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Harris|first1= Richard|last2= Smith|first2= Michael E.|date= 2011|title= THE HISTORY IN URBAN STUDIES: A COMMENT|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x/abstract|journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9906.2010.00547.x|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; History plays a large role in determining how cities will change in the future. Such areas change continuously as part of larger processes and create new histories that researchers study on both large-scale and individual levels.&lt;ref name="The New Urban History"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hersberg|first1= Theodore|date= 1978|title= The New Urban History: Toward an Interdisciplinary History of the City|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/009614427800500101|journal= Journal of Urban History|volume= 5|issue= 1|pages= 3–40|doi= 10.1177/009614427800500101|access-date= May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, three different themes&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paddison |first=Ronan |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Studying Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} have influenced how researchers have and will continue to study urban areas:
# Spatial structures: Reflect how the city is physically organized
# Processes that support spatial structure: Question how the city's structure operates
# Normative Analysis: Construct opinions supported by facts to promote better urban planning methods

Scholars have also researched how cities outside of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] have developed, but only to a limited degree. Urban history previously focused mostly on how European and American cities developed over time, instead of focusing on how non-European cities developed.&lt;ref name="A decade of Urban History: Ashgate's Historical Urban Studies series"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Doyle|first1= Barry M.|date= 2009|title= A decade of urban history: Ashgate’s Historical Urban Studies series|url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/urban-history/article/a-decade-of-urban-history-ashgates-historical-urban-studies-series/F9AC32550D106168CCDAF52861F9E1BB|journal= Urban History|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 498–512|doi= 10.1017/S0963926809990149|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional geographic areas researched in this field include [[South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Parnell|first1= Susan|date= 1997|title= South African Cities: Perspectives from the Ivory Tower of Urban Studies|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0042098975871?journalCode=usja|journal= Urban Studies|volume= 34|issue= 5-6|pages= 891–906|doi= 10.1080/0042098975871|access-date= April 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Huxley|first1= Margo|last2= Loughlin|first2= J.

Racial history in the United States

The [[racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] of urban residents in the United States has played an important role in developing this field. One program founded to research African-American urban residents, the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]], was founded in 1959 to study [[Racial segregation in the United States#Residential Segregation|residential segregation]] and to support affected communities.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geary |first=Daniel |date=2015 |chapter= Chapter 4: The Death of White Sociology |title=The Moynihan Report and its Legacy |location= Philadelphia, PA|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |pages=110–138 | isbn= 9780812247312}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, studies related to race and urban life started to focus on [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]] to study how individuals lived in relation to the city and their respective systems as a whole.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Studying Cities" /&gt;

[[Israel Zangwill]] wrote one of the first books on the Ghetto's of Europe and how they impacted the Jewish children that were descendants of the original residents, ''Children of the Ghetto''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''(1892),'' he also wrote two other books about the European Ghettos. [[Louis Wirth]] was the next scholar to write about the Ghettos, he wrote about them from a sociological perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Louis Wirth and [[Robert Ezra Park|Roberts Ezra Park]] also became the first sociologists to publish about the immigrant neighborhoods in America with suggestions on their future design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Roberts Ezra Park was the student of George Zimmel who studied the "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]" in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other famous scholars that studied segregation, American Ghettos, and impoverished neighborhoods include [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] (1903),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Haynes (1913),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Johnson (1943),&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Horace R. Cayton Jr.|Horace Cayton]] (1944),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925426390|title=Ghetto : the invention of a place, the history of an idea|last=Mitchell,|first=Duneier,|isbn=9780374161804|oclc=925426390}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth Clark (1965),&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; [[William Julius Wilson]] (1987).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Areas of research==

This field is [[transdisciplinary]] because it uses theories from a variety of academic fields and places them within an urban context.&lt;ref name="Transdisciplinarity and its challenges"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ramadier|first1= Thierry|date= 2004|title= Transdisciplinarity and its challenges: the case of urban studies|url= |journal= Journal of Urban Affairs|volume= 33|issue= 1|pages= 99–105|doi= 10.1016/j.futures.2003.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide variety of academic fields refers to the urban environment as a location studied, such as [[Environmental Studies]], [[Economics]], [[Geography]],&lt;ref name="doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson, J. 2016. pp.3-29"/&gt; [[Public Health]], and [[Sociology]].&lt;ref name="The History in Urban Studies: A Comment"/&gt; However, scholars in this field research how specific elements contribute to how the city operates, such as how [[housing]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Housing"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forrest |first1= Ray |last2= Williams|first2= Peter|date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Housing in the Twentieth Century |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=88–101 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[transportation]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Transportation"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hart |first=Tom |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Transport and the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=102–123 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; will change. In addition, researchers also study how residents interact within the city, such as how [[Racism in the United States|race]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Race Relations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Darden |first=Joe T. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Race Relations in the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=177–193 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociology of gender|gender]]&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Gender"&gt;{{cite book |last=McDowell |first=Linda M. |date= 2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter= Women, Men, Cities |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |pages=206–219 |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; differences lead to [[Social inequality|social inequalities]], or concentrated disadvantage in urban areas.

==Criticism==

In the [[United States]], [[race (human categorization)|race]] has heavily impacted where African-Americans live. [[Black power movement|Black Power movements]], particularly the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], have criticized how the [[Joint Center for Housing Studies|Harvard-MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]] researched the African-American urban population but did not understand the community's needs.&lt;ref name="Beyond Civil Rights"/&gt;

Researchers also struggle with how terms are created and used both inside and outside the field. Researchers even struggle how to define basic terms precisely, such as how a [[city]] is defined, due to how the roles of cities change.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Urban Studies - Defining City"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frey |first=William H. |last2=Zimmer| first2=Zachary |date=2001 |editor-last=Paddison |editor-first=Ronan |chapter=Defining the City |title=Handbook of Urban Studies |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London; Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 9780803976955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers must be careful in how they describe urban areas, as their work can be manipulated as positive elements for [[boosterism|city boosters]] wanting to promote a specific city.&lt;ref name="Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brenner|first1= Neil  |date= 2003|title= Stereotypes, Archetypes, and Prototypes: Three Uses of Superlatives in Contemporary Urban Studies|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-6040.00051/abstract|journal= City &amp; Community|volume= 2|issue= 3|pages= 205–216|doi= 10.1111/1540-6040.00051|access-date= April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
