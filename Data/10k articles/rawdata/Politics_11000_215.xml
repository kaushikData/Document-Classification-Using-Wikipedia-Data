The '''Agrarian Party''' ({{lang-it|Partito Agrario}}) was a [[list of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]]. It was the principal party of reference of the land owners and it was characterized by an economist vision and a conservative and reactionary tendency. Its principal exponents were the prince [[Pietro Lanza di Scalea]] (minister of the war in the first Government Facta and Minister of the colonies in the Government Mussolini from June 3, 1924 to November 6, 1926), [[Francesco Saverio d'Ayala]] and [[Giovanni Lo Monte]].

In 1924 the principal exponents of the Agrarian Party merged the [[National List (Italy)|National List]].

Beginning with the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]], an armed leftist resistance movement against [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)]] developed until 1990 when [[Chilean transition to democracy|democracy was restored]]. The main armed resistance groups of the period were the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] (MIR) and [[Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front|Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez]] (FPMR), the armed wing of the [[Communist Party of Chile]]. These groups had a long-standing rivalry.

Key events during the armed resistance were the attempt to set up  guerrilla camps in [[Neltume]] in 1970-73&lt;ref&gt;''"In September 1973 and again in September 1981, the forest complex of Panguipulli (especially Neltume), only 115 kilometres east of Valdivia, became the focal point of alleged subversive attacks and shoot-outs and a site of massive military operations leading to executions. Panguipulli  indeed served as a zone of political organizing, land invasion, and agrarian reform during 1970-73, and as a camping zone for MIRistas reentering Chile under Operacion Retorno in 1980-81."'' Battling for Hearts and Minds, Steve J. Stern, p. 288, Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980-81, the February 1986 sabotaging of the Limache train tracks, the [[Carrizal Bajo]] arms smuggling operation in August 1986 and the attempted killing of Pinochet in September that same year. After the return to democracy was initiated in 1990 the bulk of the armed groups demobilized. However, splinter groups that reportedly switched targets after the dictatorship fell, continued to carry out assassinations, bombings, kidnappings and armed robberies until 2010.

==Pre-dictatorship violence==
The first major action by the MIR took place in September 1967 during violent clashes between MIR-led students from the University of Concepción and riot police. ''Carabineros'' were seeking to arrest those responsible for destroying a police vehicle, but students reorganized and kidnapped carabinier Héctor Gutiérrez Orellana. Chilean president [[Eduardo Nicanor Frei Montalva]] sought to defuse the situation through intermediaries and obtained the release of the policeman in exchange for dropping charges against students earlier arrested in the confrontations.&lt;ref name="Brazil, Uruguay 1990, p. 423"&gt;Determinants of Gross Human Rights Violations by State and State Sponsored Actors in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and Argentina: 1960 - 1990, Wolfgang S. Heinz, Hugo Frühling, p. 423, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; During 1968, the MIR presence continued to be felt in various universities with armed actions increasing in 1969 through multiple acts of vandalism, intimidation and physical assaults on conservative/right wing students and faculty members.&lt;ref name="Brazil, Uruguay 1990, p. 423"/&gt; On 1 May 1969, fifteen MIR activists armed with knives took over the Bio Bio radio station in Concepción and transmitted a special broadcast calling for the locals to take up arms and overthrow the government of Frei. On 2 May 1969, MIR activists operating in Concepción attacked the branches of ''National City Bank'', the building of the ''La Patria'' newspaper and the offices of the ''Weigner Stein'' business. In June, the MIR kidnapped journalist Hernán Osses Santa María, Director of the ''Noticias de la Tarde'' in nearby Talcahuano (15.6 kilometres), in an effort to silence the in depth reporting on the leftist violence in Concepción. Police Investigations and ''Carabineros'' soon surrounded the University of Concepción and forced the students to release the newspaper director unharmed. A specially appointed judge was soon named and a criminal suit was filed with the Courts of Appeals of Concepción against the MIR and over 20 of its identified leaders for breaking the Law of Interior Security of the State. Consequently, the MIR had no option but to go largely underground and into hiding. In the ensuing police and military operations against the MIR, a guerrilla training camp is discovered in San José de Maipo (Guayacán) and another at Corral (Chaihuín).&lt;ref&gt;''"En 1969 se descubre una escuela de guerrilleros en San José de Maipo (Guayacán) y en 1970 otra en Corral (Chaihuín)."'' Régimen de Gobierno y Partidos Políticos en Chile 1924-1973, Bernardino Bravo Lira, p. 301, Editorial Jurídica de Chile, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, MIR guerrillas continue to operate, and in Santiago alone carry out 12 armed robberies of banks and businesses between August 1969 and September 1970 to finance their operations.&lt;ref&gt;''"Entre agosto de ese año y septiembre siguiente realiza en Santiago no menos de 12 asaltos a mano armada contra Bancos y locales comerciales."'' Régimen de Gobierno y Partidos Políticos en Chile 1924-1973, Bernardino Bravo Lira, p. 301, Editorial Jurídica de Chile, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revolutionary Left Movement [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|(MIR)]] were absolved of criminal charges under an amnesty under the Popular Unity (''Unidad Popular'' or UP) government of [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] and was allowed to operate again openly, encouraging and carrying out illegal [[Chilean land reform|expropriations of farms]] and businesses, and assaulting outspoken conservatives/rightist members of the public and security forces. According to police figures submitted to the Chilean senate, 1,458 farms were illegally occupied between November 1970 and December 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''The Overthrow of Allende and the Politics of Chile, 1964–1976'', Paul E. Sigmund, p. 139, University of Pittsburgh, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the southern provinces of Cautin and Malleco the MIR organized a series of armed takeovers or ''tomas'' working slowly northwards up into the provinces of Nuble and Linares and eventually Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;"Starting in the southern provinces of Cautin and Malleco the MIR organised a series of violent tomas working slowly northwards up into the provinces of Nuble and Linares and the province of Santiago itself." The Santiago Model-2: Polarisation of Politics, Volume 2, Robert Moss, p. 4, Institute for the Study of Conflict, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1970, Antonia Maechel, owner of the La Tregua estate in the [[Panguipulli]] area, took her own life after being raped by leftist militants that had seized her property. On 6 February 1970, [[Carabineros de Chile|carabineer]] Luis Merino Ferreira was killed in a clash with guerrillas. On 11 August 1970, MIR guerrillas killed carabineer corporal Luis Fuentes Pineda. On 21 September 1970, guerrillas shot and killed a carabineer corporal, Armando Cofré López, during a [[bank robbery]] in the suburb of Irarrázabal in Santiago. On 3 November 1970, another carabinier (Corporal Luis Armando Cofré) is killed in a shoot-out with MIR guerrillas robbing a ''Banco Panamericano'' branch.

In April 1971, Juan Millalonco, a member of Christian Democratic Youth, was shot dead in [[Aysén Region|Aysén]] by socialist militants, and VOP guerrillas in Santiago killed 33-year-old Raúl Méndez Espinosa at his sweet shop for not paying protection money to the guerrillas targeting small businesses.&lt;ref name="Chile 1987"&gt;La Violencia Política Popular en las "Grandes Alamedas": La Violencia en Chile, 1947-1987, Gabriel Salazar Vergara, p, 259, Lom Ediciones, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; That same month in the expropriation of land on the part of leftist militants and guerrillas, Rolando Matus is shot dead resisting the takeover of the Carén farm in [[Pucón]], and Jorge Baraona and Domitila Palma died resisting the takeover of their farms in southern Chile. On 24 May 1971, VOP guerrillas in an armed robbery of a bank money transfer van shoot and mortally wound a carabinier (Corporal José Arnaldo Gutiérrez Urrutia) and wound two other accompanying ''Miramar'' supermarket employees.&lt;ref&gt;''La Verdad Olvidada Del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968–1996'', Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p. 67, Editorial Maye Ltda., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chile 1987"/&gt; In June 1971, VOP guerrillas killed [[Edmundo Perez Zujovic]], a Christian Democrat and former interior minister. That same month, another marxist guerrilla (46-year-old Heriberto Salazar) of the VOP walked into police headquarters in Santiago with a sub-machinegun and kills three detectives (Gerardo Romero Infante, Heriberto Mario Marín and Carlos Pérz Bretti) before blowing himself up with dynamite,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N0UaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cCkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5023,3675116&amp;dq= Chilean kills 2 Officers, Himself], ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Jun 17, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Violencia Política Popular en las "Grandes Alamedas": La Violencia en Chile, 1947-1987, Gabriel Salazar Vergara, p, 260, Lom Ediciones, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and a  carabineer corporal (Jorge Cartes) is killed by MIR guerrillas in the MIR stronghold of Concepción. On 1 December 1971, 50,000-200,000&lt;ref&gt;"Opposition newspapers in Chile reported anywhere from 50,000 and 200, 000 demonstrators. Well-dressed upper-class women arrived in cars, while working-class women and members of the pobladora and peasant organizations came in buses." Why Women Protest: Women's Movements in Chile, Lisa Baldez, p. 78, Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; women took to the streets of Santiago to protest against Salvador Allende’s UP government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsausa.org/women_and_pots_and_pans Women and Pots and Pans: Chile Then and Venezuela Today]&lt;/ref&gt; Their peaceful march turned ugly when UP radicals attacked the women with rocks.&lt;ref&gt;''"The peaceful march turned violent when young UP supporters pelted the demonstrators with rocks."'' International Journal of Group Tensions, Volume 24, Sage Publications, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, their ''March of the Empty Pots and Pans'' signaled the beginning of a massive coordinated anti-Allende movement. To keep the memory afresh of the march, women in the middle-class and affluent suburbs of Santiago banged on pots every night for two hours for several months.&lt;ref&gt;"To keep the memory of the debacle fresh, women banged on pots every night between 8 and 10 PM for several months after the march." Women and Revolution in Africa, Asia and the New World, Mary Ann Tétreault, p. 404, University of South Carolina Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 1972, carabineer corporal Exequiel Aroca Cuevas was killed in the city of Concepción, when socialist militants open fire on the bus he was travelling. On 27 February 1973, MIR guerrillas attacked the Llanquihue police station, shooting and wounding 10 carabineers.&lt;ref&gt;Breve Historia de la Unidad Popular, Teresa Donoso Loero, p. 300, El Mercurio, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1973, 16-year-old Germán Enrique González and 17-year-old Sergio Oscar Vergara, both members of the Christian Democrat Party were killed while resisting the takeover of the La Reina estate.&lt;ref&gt;La Verdad Olvidada del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968-1996, Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p.77, Editorial Maye Ltda, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 1973, MIR guerrillas operating in Santiago shoot and kill a police detective, Gabriel Rodríguez Alcaíno.&lt;ref&gt;Los Hechos de Violencia en Chile, María de los Angeles Aylwin Ramírez, Soledad Reyes del Villar, p.421, Fundación Libertad y Desarrollo, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1973, Mario Aguilar, a member of the ''Movimiento Patria y Libertad'' is gunned down by leftists in downtown Santiago. On 27 July 1973, a farmer and member of the Christian Democrat Party, Jorge Mena, is surrounded by leftists and clubbed to death in Osorno.&lt;ref name="Chile 1996, p.80"&gt;La Verdad Olvidada del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968-1996, Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p.80, Editorial Maye Ltda, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, another farmer, Juan Luis Urrutia, dies resisting the takeover of his land in Bulnes. On 30 July, MIR guerrillas kill Manuel Garrido, an employee of ''Paños Continental'' in a confrontation that also involved Brazilian militants.&lt;ref name="Chile 1996, p.80"/&gt; On 27 August 1973, Sergio Aliaga, while driving through a confrontation between anti-Allende striking truckers and leftist militants, was killed after being caught in the crossfire and shot in the throat.&lt;ref&gt;La Verdad Olvidada del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968-1996, Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p.82, Editorial Maye Ltda, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 August 1973, a Mexican militant (Jorge Albino Sosa Gil) working in Chile, shoots and kills Second Lieutenant Héctor Lacrampette Calderón as the young army officer was waiting for a bus in the suburb of Providencia in Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;''La Verdad Olvidada Del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968–1996'', Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p. 82, Editorial Maye Ltda., 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, two farm workers (José Toribio Núñez and Celsa Fuentes) died of horrific burns after being caught in the bomb blast targeting the pipeline between Santiago and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]].&lt;ref&gt;La Verdad Olvidada del Terrorismo en Chile, 1968-1996, Arturo Castillo Vicencio, p. 81, Editorial Maye Ltda, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==September–December 1973==
After the coup, left-wing guerrilla organizations tried to recruit resistance fighters against the Pinochet regime. Some of them had commando-training, having belonged to the GAP (''Grupo de Amigos Personales''), they had previously served as bodyguards of President Allende. Many activists created resistance groups from refugees abroad. The [[Movimiento Juvenil Lautaro]] or Lautaro Youth Movement (MJL) was formed in December 1982 and the [[Communist Party of Chile]] set up an armed wing, which became in 1983 the [[FPMR]] (''Frente Patriótico Manuel Rodríguez'').

On February 19, 1975, four captured MIR commanders went on national television to urge their guerrillas to lay down their arms.

==Neltume Guerrilla Front==
In order to reinforce urban guerrilla warfare waged in the main cities, the MIR commanders in 1978 had set in motion [[Operación Retorno]] (Operation ''Return''), ordering exiled militants back into Chile.

In 1980, a platoon of thirty well-equipped MIR combatants of the ''Toqui Lautaro'' Battalion infiltrated into the mountains of Neltume in southern Chile and reestablished a guerrilla front. The MIR spearhead was commanded by 30-year-old Miguel Cabrera Fernández (nome de guerre ''Paine''), who along with 120-150 Chileans had completed their training for this operation in Czechoslovakia, Cuba and North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;''Neltume 81'' (Chilean TV documentary), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean Army moved against the guerrillas in Neltume in June 1981, in a massive operation spearheaded by the Chilean Para-Commandos (elite Black Berets) all under the command of Colonel Orlando Basauri, with support from 10 Puma and Lama helicopters. Flora Jaramillo had fed and attended three MIR guerrillas that had sought refuge in her house, and not wanting to be later accused of collaborating with the enemy had sent her 15-year-old son Juan Carlos Henríquez Jaramillo to warn the local police station. Carabineros soon surrounded her house and opened fire, killing all the guerrillas and destroying the house, but not before warning Mrs Jaramillo to get out. The Special Forces involved discovered the first guerrilla arms cache on 25 June killing Raúl Rodrigo Obregón Torres (nome de guerre ''Pablo'') in the process, and four more store dumps were uncovered by the end of the first week in July. Another gun-battle took place on 28 June, but it took some time before Basauri's men could corner the guerrilla force.&lt;ref&gt;Chile Under Pinochet, Mark Ensalaco, p. 146, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, seven MIR guerrillas were reported killed in an ambush in the third week of September, just after the 8th-anniversary of the 1973 military coup, but the survivors were able to escape and blend in with the local population. On 19 September 1981, Army Private Victor Manuel Nahuelpan Silva is killed during operations in Neltume. On 16 October 1981, Juan Angel Ojeda Aguayo (nom de guerre ''Pequeco'') who had escaped the mountain fighting was caught and executed while resting at his parent's home. Miguel Cabrera Fernández was himself killed on 15 October 1981, in a clash with policemen at Choshuenco.

The Pinochet regime launched another counterinsurgency operation in August 1984 to wipe out the remaining guerrillas, concentrating in the areas around Concepción, Valdivia and Los Angeles, killing seven more MIR fighters and forcing the remainder to go into permanent hiding.

Some forty MIR fighters lost their lives between 1978 (when Operation ''Return'' was set in motion) and 1984 when the MIR insurgency was finally defeated in southern Chile. Another 41 supporting [[Mapuche]] Indians that had earlier on taken part in the land and business takeovers under Salvador Allende were killed with 80 only spared after having been rounded up in and around Neltume and held for long periods in secret detention camps.&lt;ref&gt;''"En los informes sobre derechos humanos se establece que en este período hubo 41 ejecutados políticos y más de 80 detenidos desaparecidos de origen mapuche."'' Los Comunistas y la Democracia, Luis Corvalán, p. 74, Lom Ediciones, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Guillermina Reinante, had three brothers rounded up and forcibly disappeared up by soldiers from the 8th ''Tucapel'' Infantry Regiment in late 1973. When she enquired about their whereabouts a female military official informed her that they had been executed. In the 2012 Chilean TV documentary ''Neltume 81'' Reinante claimed that the military had executed her brothers in revenge for taking part in the land expropriations.

==Post-dictatorship violence==
The election of a civilian government in Chile did not end guerrilla activities. Within a few months after President [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s accession to power, leftist militants showed that they remained committed to armed struggle and were responsible for a number of terrorist incidents.&lt;ref name="Chile Terrorism"/&gt; On May 10, 1990, two guerrillas wearing school uniforms killed ''carabineros'' Colonel Luis Fontaine, a former head of the antiterrorist unit of the carabiniers, Chile's national police force. Two policemen were killed on August 10, 1990, in a working-class Santiago suburb and two more were injured in an attack on a bus.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune', August 12, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1990, leftist militants detonate 53 bombs that kill or wound 83 Chileans.&lt;ref&gt;''"Así llega a cuadruplicarse a fines del mismo año, cuando en el mes de septiembre detonaron 53 bombas, resultando de ello 83 víctimas entre muertos y heridos."''

MJL guerrillas fought their way into the Sótero del Río Hospital but were forced to withdraw, after having killed four gendarmes and one ''carabinero''. In retaliation, Chile's Investigations Police execute Antonioletti with a shot in the forehead. On January 24, 1991, MJL guerrillas ambushed and killed two carabineros. On February 28, 1991, a carabinero policeman died in a shoot-out in Santiago with leftist guerrillas of the Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front.&lt;ref&gt;''Miami Herald'', March 5, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, FPMR guerrillas assassinated right-wing senator Jaime Guzman, killing him as he left a university campus in Santiago. On September 9 three guerrillas kidnapped Cristian Edwards, whose family run El Mercurio newspaper. After his family paid $1 million in ransom, the [[FPMR]] freed him. On 22 January 1992, two FPMR guerrillas (Fabián López Luque and Alex Muñoz Hoffman) were killed trying to rob a ''Prosegur'' cash delivery armoured van at the Pontifical Catholic University in Santiago. On September 11, 1998, three police stations—La Pincoya, La Granja and La Victoria—were attacked with firearms, incendiary bombs and rocks and 36 were carabineros were wounded in violence related to the 25th anniversary commemorations of the military coup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121127131656/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1998/334/20295 Chile: coup anniversary brings heavy repression, 23 September 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, on the 33rd anniversary of the September 11, 1973, military coup, 79 carabineros were wounded in clashes with rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2006/09/13/shooting-looting-and-arson-on-chile-september-11-anniversary|title=Shooting, looting and arson on Chile September 11 anniversary|work=MercoPress}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2007, a carabinero policeman was killed after being shot in the face and around 40 were wounded during clashes with leftists marking the 34th anniversary of the military coup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,22410450-23109,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, MJL guerrillas killed carabineer Luis Moyano Farías during the robbery of Banco Security in Santiago.

The '''Beacham Theatre''' is a [[Cinema (building)|cinema]] built in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr. in the city of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]].  The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street.  The building's current lack of impressive [[architecture]] is offset by its significant [[cultural history]].&lt;ref name=Dezern1988&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-02-28/news/0020190106_1_tampa-theatre-beacham-theater-in-atlanta |title=Conflict Now Playing At Beacham Owner: Destroy It -- Activists: Save It |last1= Dezern |first1=Craig |date=February 28, 1988 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 11, 2016 |quote=But when preservationists look, they see a landmark.

The debate between progress and preservation has played in old theaters throughout the South, and sometimes preservation has won. But for every theater saved, two more meet the wrecking ball. The Beacham soon may join the fallen theaters. Juarez, a developer and political consultant, has applied for permission to tear down the building at 46 N.

The Beacham was once part of the [[vaudeville]] circuit and hosted celebrity acts such as [[John Phillip Sousa]], the [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and [[W.C. Fields]], whose signature was once visible inside a dressing room.  In the eras of [[silent film]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema#Classical Hollywood cinema In the Sound Era (late 1920s – 1960)|Classical Hollywood cinema]], the Beacham was operated as a [[movie theater]] that utilized then-current [[state-of-the-art]] [[Film|motion picture]] technology.

'''The Beacham''', as it is currently named, has since been used as a series of [[concert venue]]s and [[nightclub]]s thus saving it from [[demolition]].  The Beacham Theatre was once home to the late-night [[Underground culture|underground]] [[discotheque]] '''Aahz''' that is recognized internationally as a birthplace and critical component of the [[electronic dance music]] [[Clubbing (subculture)|movement]].

==History==

===Construction===

[[file:Orange_County_Florida_Jail_(gaol)_photo.jpg|thumb|165px|left|The former Orange County Jail on the site of the Beacham Theatre]]

The Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by [[Braxton Beacham]] Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=With "News" Correspondents (Florida) |url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew23moti_7#page/3198/mode/2up |magazine=Motion Picture News|location=New York|publisher=Motion Picture News, Inc. |date=May–June 1921 |access-date=February 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had served as [[Mayor of Orlando]] during 1907.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;  In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500–$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the [[cemetery]] instead of purchasing the old jail.&lt;ref name=ActTwo /&gt;  The property he purchased had formerly served as the [[gaol|jail]] for [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] since about 1873.&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie Gaub Antequino|author2=Tana Mosier Porter|author3=Historical Society of Central Florida|title=Lost Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xWDRXbzXsMC|year=2012|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-9173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street).  The new building was then known as "Beacham's Block" and is now known the Beacham Building.  The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several [[Capital punishment|condemned]] prisoners were executed by [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="AntequinoPorter2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Schaal Hinson|first=Sandra|date=February 1983|title=A mover behind shakers|url=|magazine=Orlando Magazine|location=Orlando|publisher=Orlando Magazine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Beacham Has Come Long Way: Lillian Gish to Queen Esther|last=Ives|first=Sidney|date=December 23, 1953|work=The Orlando Evening Star|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981&gt;{{cite news |url= |title= Curtain rises on new act for Beacham|last1=Sweers |first1=Katheryn |date=July 12, 1981 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|last1=Andrews|first1=Mark|date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Means1982&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Requiem for the Beacham Theatre|last=Means|first=Howard|date=October 17, 1982|work=The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rajtar2006 /&gt;  According to local [[folklore]], the Beacham Building is reportedly [[ghost|haunted]].&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2001-02-16/entertainment/0102150519_1_gavin-tour-downtown-orlando |title=A Jaunt Into Haunts |last1=  Wallace Dickinson  |first1= Joy |date=February 16, 2001 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date= August 14, 2016|quote=Gavin's tour includes tales of a sensational murder across the street from the Angebilt in the vanished San Juan Hotel and of a secret tunnel connecting the Angebilt to the old Beacham Theater (now the Tabu night spot at 46 N.

[[Tunnels]] from the theater stage trap ran into the basements of two nearby hotels.  The tunnels had low ceilings and were sealed during new construction in the early 1980s.  The tunnels extended south into the [[San Juan Hotel]], where Mr. Beacham happened to have had an office,&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt; and then east under Orange Avenue into the [[Angebilt Hotel]].  Historians reason that the purpose of the tunnels may have been either for vaudeville performers to enter the theater from their hotels without being mobbed by crowds, or the tunnels could have been used for the storage and transportation of alcoholic beverages during prohibition as has been discovered at some of the other theaters in the Central Florida area.&lt;ref name="Rajtar2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Rajtar|title=A Guide to Historic Orlando|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3cZfqYU1B4cC&amp;pg=PA58|year=2006|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-198-0|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2007-02-10/news/HISTORYTRAILS_1_historic-trails-boy-scout-florida|title=Take a walk into Florida's past  |last1=Shrieves |first1=Linda |date=February 10, 2007|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= ''The Orlando Sentinel''|access-date= August 5, 2016|quote=Behind the theater's backstage is a trap door to a tunnel that runs underneath Orange Avenue to the 11-story brick building that was once the grand Angebilt Hotel.

===Vaudeville and Silent film era===

On December 9, 1921, Orlando's premier vaudeville and movie house opened by showing [[Norma Talmadge filmography|''The Wonderful Thing'']], starring [[Norma Talmadge]], a [[Pathé News]] [[newsreel]], and [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[The Boat (film)|The Boat]]''.&lt;ref name="ActTwo"&gt;Act Two: A Beacham History.  1985.

The senior Braxton Beacham died in 1924 after a long illness, and Roberta Holland Beacham died soon after in 1926.  Their [[Estate (law)|estate]] and [[real property]] were left to their [[child]]ren, Norma K. Hughes, Roberta Augusta Rogers, Braxton Beacham Jr., and his wife Roberta Branch Beacham.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

[[Florida]] and [[Orlando]] were on what was referred to by [[List of vaudeville performers: A–K|vaudeville performers]] as "[[Straw hat|The Straw Hat]] [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad|Circuit]]."  The Beacham Theatre was included on the [[Alexander Pantages]], [[Orpheum Circuit#Late circuit (1919–1928)|Orpheum]], and [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith-Albee]] vaudeville performance circuits (later combined as the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] circuit).&lt;ref name=Wilkening /&gt;&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;

Manager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included [[Raffle|Bank Night]], [[Talent show|Amateur Night]], and  [[General store|Country Store Night]], which was supported by dozens of local [[merchant]]s.  An [[magazine|advertisement]] for the Beacham in 1925 says,  "Don't talk about the hot weather.  Beat the heat in a Beacham seat.  'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort."&lt;ref name=LMS&gt;What's What, Here and There as Recorded by "Bobby" (1925) magazine.

Frank Bell served as manager of the theater with [[organist]] Herman Siewart and Ken Guernsey leading the community [[sing-along]] at [[Forum (legal)|open forum]] meetings that were held for several months during the winter on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The Beacham's "[[Film promotion|exploitation]] director" Frank H. Burns often designed and created large elaborate [[standee|standing displays]] that decorated the facade and lobby of the theater in order to [[Out-of-home advertising|advertise]] new film features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew00moti_7/motionpicturenew00moti_7_djvu.txt|title=Motion Picture News (May-Jun 1925)"|last=|first=|date=May 2, 1925|website=mediahistoryproject.org|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art Library coordinated by the Media History Digital Library|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/motionpicturenew00moti_7|archive-date=July 3, 2015|access-date=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The iconic displays that Burns created for the Beacham Theatre were sometimes complete with [[Costume coordination|coordinated costumes]] for the employees.

In 1928 [[Vitaphone]] and [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] [[Sound film|"talkie"]] equipment debuted during the city's first "Progress Week" during the last week of August.   "The queen of the [[Femme fatale|vamps]]," [[actress]] [[Theda Bara]], was in appearance at the Beacham as [[secondary education in the United States|students]] from [[Orange County Public Schools#High schools|Orlando High School]] sneaked into the balcony via the [[fire escape]].&lt;ref name="ActTwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Sound was provided by two [[gramophone records|gramophone discs]] that accompanied each film.  Both [[phonograph]]s were played simultaneously in case the needle skipped during a film.  Output could be easily switched so that the film's sound could remain in [[synchronicity]] with the picture.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982/&gt;   William Booth succeeded Frank Bell as manager of the Beacham after Bell was transferred in 1928.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

The city's "[[Blue law|Sunday closing law]]" was repealed by [[Voting|voters]] in 1929 by a majority of only 59 votes.  Movie theaters and other businesses in Orlando were then permitted to operate seven days a week.  All of Orlando's theaters, including the Beacham, celebrated by showing free films until late into the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1996|title=Retroactively Speaking|url=|journal=Downtown Orlando Monthly|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Theatre Historical Society of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== End of the vaudeville and silent film era ====

Interest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into [[obsolescence]].  On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was [[raffle]]d with prizes of $50.  On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 [[Austin 7#Austin Seven Swallow|Austin 7 Sport Roadster]] was given away.
Vaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933.  Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville.

In 1933 following a bitter [[lawsuit]] against Orlando Enterprises over nonpayment of the lease for the building that had been originally negotiated with the senior Braxton Beacham in 1924, the theater was closed for almost three weeks.  $8000 in back taxes on Beacham's building was due.  Beacham Jr. claimed the closure was deliberate and malicious and sued for $100,000.  Two separate judgments were entered against Orlando Enterprises Inc. for $2291.67 each and a payment agreement was reached.  Litigation was then withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Bacon1977" /&gt;

As a result of the suit the lease was not renewed and Beacham's theater again became Orlando's only independent cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[https://orlandoretro.com/2013/04/18/beacham-movie-line-up-in-september-1933/ Beacham Movie Line Up in September 1933] (April 18, 2013), retrieved February 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same year, the theater was soon leased Florida State Theaters.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  Harry Vincent was named manager of the reopened theater in 1933; however, soon after, Vernon D.

===First-Run Movie era===

In August 1937 the [[Orlando Police Department]] raided the Beacham Theatre.   All of the equipment for the Bank Night [[Promotion (marketing)|marketing promotion]] was [[Search and seizure|seized]] after authorities declared it to be a [[lottery]].&lt;ref name= OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name= ActTwo /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacon1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eve Bacon|title=Orlando: A Centennial History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4svzPQAACAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Mickler House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Orlando Story]]'', filmed by Don Parrisher Motion Picture Productions of New York, contained images of daily life in Orlando.  The movie was heavily promoted locally and was shown at the Beacham over three days in August 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dc.ocls.info/memory/document/orlando-story |title=The Orlando Story |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 7, 2012  |website=Orlando Memory  |publisher=Orange County Library System|access-date=August 5, 2016 |quote=...promoting a movie created about daily life in Orlando called ''The Orlando Story''. ...

In December 1949 ''The [[Tom Thumb]] [[Follies]]'' staged [[Radio in the United States#Local radio in the Golden Age|radio broadcast]] performances at the Beacham.  When a  [[Santa Claus]] from the [[Elks Lodge]] lifted one young elf into the audience for the last verse, the smell of [[bourbon whiskey]] caused her to ponder, "I wasn't just sure where the night's polka would land us.

In 1964 the theater was temporarily closed down while [[Cinerama]] equipment was installed.  A super-wide [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic movie screen]] was added to the auditorium and the stereophonic sound system was upgraded.  Two [[Philips DP70|Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projector]]s and a small restroom for the projectionist were installed in a newly built downstairs projection booth under the balcony that required the removal of two aisles and several seats.

====End of the first-run movie era====
[[File:Old Beacham Theatre logo sticker.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1990's logo depicting the Beacham Theatre's mid-century marquee.]]
During the 1970s Orlando, like many U.S. cites, was experiencing symptoms of [[urban decay]].  The rush from the city to the suburbs affected nearly all of the city's businesses.  As an effect of the exodus, each of Downtown Orlando's movie theaters closed.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name= ActTwo /&gt;   Dick Gabel and John Prine were serving as projectionists at several of the theaters.&lt;ref name=Treasures /&gt;  Following a decline in attendance, by 1974 the Beacham Theatre and Florida State Theaters in general were primarily showing [[exploitation films]] and [[B movie#1970s|B-movie]] [[action films]].&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  The next year, H. A. Tedder, who was the Orlando executive manager at long-time [[lessee]] Florida State Theaters, made the decision that The Beacham Theatre would cease operating as a first-run movie cinema.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  After showing a Sunday double-feature of ''[[Return of the Street Fighter]]'', and [[The Scavengers (1969 film)|''The Scavengers'']], the Beacham Theatre's manager, McKinley Howard, closed the theater's doors as a first-run film cinema for the last time on September 28, 1975.&lt;ref name=lastday&gt;Last picture Show: Beacham. September 28, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Florida State Theaters remained responsible for paying the monthly lease of $2700 until the theater was sold.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

===Live Entertainment era===

In 1975 Larry and Sherry Carpenter purchased the Beacham Building from then-owners, Betty Rubles Bray, and Burkett H. Bray Jr.  A [[great-granddaughter]] of Braxton Beacham,  Mrs. Bray, refused to sell the theater by itself without also selling the rest of the building as a package.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  An extensive $250,000 remodeling and restoration followed that included stunning multi-colored Art Deco revival style graphics painted over the facade and a large multi-story [[mural]] of a saxophone and its open case painted on the rear of the theater that faced west and was clearly visible from nearby [[Interstate 4]].  Following the restoration the Carpenters opened Orlando's [[Franchising|franchise]] location of '''The Great Southern Music Hall''' at the Beacham in 1976.&lt;ref name=Means1982 /&gt;   The 700-seat Great Southern Music Hall was a [[concert venue]] that hosted approximately 180 prominent national and regional acts at the Beacham.  The Great Southern Music Hall was occasionally still used as a movie theater that presented [[world cinema]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic Hollywood]] films by [[film director]]s such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Federico Fellini]], and [[Mel Brooks]] during the week.  John Lawson was the acting projectionist and served as stage director for concerts.  As The Great Southern Music Hall, only about seven music shows were unprofitable.  Nevertheless,  Orlando's Great Southern Music Hall closed in 1981 due to the rising costs of hosting concerts for [[Notability|notable]] musical acts and competition from larger venues.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

Roberta Branch Beacham died in 1980.

[[File:Beacham Theatre mural 1.jpg|thumb|220px|Mural on Beacham Theater in 1983]]

In 1981 Sherry Carpenter, then sole owner, leased the theater to Jeff Roberts.  Roberts opened '''Laser World''', a [[futuristic]] one- and one-half hour [[laser light show]] that featured [[lasers]], [[sound]], [[ballet]], costumed [[modern dance]] routines and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] [[illusion]], as well as [[outer space]] [[photographs]] that were projected onto a large viewing screen from behind.&lt;ref name="Sweers1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews1996" /&gt;  Laser World closed in 1982.&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

Other short-lasting entities followed such as a [[Tourism|tourist-oriented]] [[laser tag]] business.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  ''[[Orlando Sentinel|The Orlando Sentinel]]'' critic Howard Means, reminded readers, that the 1965 installation of "then-new [[Cinerama]] equipment at the Beacham was the latest testimony to the faith in the future of Downtown Orlando" and that, "The Beacham had long been seen as a bellwether of the health of the center city."  Upon further reflection, he lamented, "that the Beacham is simply a microcosm of modern downtown realities."  Means editorialized, by 1982 "The present state of the Beacham was the latest testament to decay," and, "In the way of dying enterprises, the Beacham's reincarnations became increasingly more short-lived."&lt;ref name="Means1982" /&gt;

In February 1983 Oscar F. Juarez, an Orlando [[Real estate development|property developer]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[strategist]], purchased the building for $1.5 million.&lt;ref name="Benedick1988"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1988-04-07/news/0030160194_1_beacham-juarez-board-members |title=Goodbye Voted For Beacham Board Says Owner May Tear Old Theater Down|last1=Benedick  |first1=Robin  |date=April 7, 1988 |website= |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 24, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the purchase, a plan was announced to lease it in order to open a [[bar]] and French restaurant "with a [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] flair" that later became Valentyne's Restaurant as well as a new nightclub inside the theater.&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;

A vision for the theater announced in 1983 was for a New York-style nightclub dubbed '''Studio 46''' that emulated the spirit of the legendary "[[Studio 54]]."&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  Studio 46 did not come to fruition but the primordial description of Orlando's very own "Studio 54" at the Beacham Theater was soon realized just a few years later.&lt;ref name="Abbott2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-06-27/entertainment/os-jim-abbott-aahz-reunion-orlando-20130627_1_legacy-third-wave-dj-kimball-collins |title= Make a return to AAHZ once more|last1=Abbott |first1= Jim |date=June 27, 2013|website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |access-date=August 5, 2016 |quote= Gazing upward at the high ceiling inside The Beacham, DJ Kimball Collins reflects on the role that the building itself had on the mystique of AAHZ, the progressive house-music parties that put Orlando on the international map as a hotbed of electronic music in the early 1990s..."We always wanted people to come experience it here," Collins says of the Beacham. "This is like our Studio 54; there's just something about this room."  Between roughly 1989 and 1992, AAHZ blossomed into a weekly all-night Saturday dance party that attracted devoted fans who would travel from across the state to dance until daylight. "There's a scene in the movie '54,' when one of the characters walks into the club for the first time and everything just slows down and it's sensory overload,"... That philosophy yielded AAHZ, a concept eternally beloved by its fans and those who created it..."It still has some sort of energy in here for them," Collins says, looking around the room. "We feel it." }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was next leased by Ellen Hunt, of Orlando, and Roger Lopez, of [[France]] in August 1983.

Despite the new recognition for the theater by the City of Orlando, Mr. Juarez saw the building as a liability with many pleasant memories surrounding it, but with little economic potential.  Citing maintaining the building and rehabilitation of the area, he first announced plans to raze the building for an unspecified mix-use purpose and later to redevelop the former Beacham Block with a new [[skyscraper]] that would be used as a combination office building and hotel.&lt;ref name=Snyder1987&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-07-13/business/0180230093_1_juarez-magnolia-avenue-orange-avenue |title=Juarez Building Finally Fills Up Developer Considers Building Second Office Project|last1=Snyder |first1= Jack|date=July 13, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=September 4, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrizio 1987"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-08-23/news/0140190075_1_historic-preservation-landmark-beacham |title=Historic Label No Guarantee Beacham Theater's Owner May Raze Old Downtown Building For New One |last1=Patrizio |first1= Ron |date=August 23, 1987 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016|quote=The Beacham Theater has served as a city hall, vaudeville playhouse and movie theater.

In 1987 Brad Belletto and then-wife Lisa moved to Orlando from [[Louisiana]]. Brad Belletto, then owned a theatrical equipment manufacturing company and had formerly owned  Moon Sound, a [[New Orleans]] sound and lighting company. The Bellettos, intent on overhauling the music scene in Orlando, were looking for a new venue following operation of a successful club in [[Baton Rouge]].  They found the Beacham Theatre and immediately fell in love with it. At that time, the Beacham was being subleased to Clark J, a local record producer, and a brief partnership was formed.

Late in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mathers1991&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathers |first=Sandra |date=December 22, 1991 |title=Theater Plans Holiday Treat For Homeless|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-22/news/9112200744_1_dinner-hammersmith-belletto|newspaper=''the Orlando Sentinel'' |location=Orlando |access-date= October 13, 2016|quote=The sit-down dinner is the brainchild of Brad and Lisa Belletto, whose Entertainment Investments company operates the theater and jazz club...Belletto said he patterned the dinner after a similar theater event he was involved with in New Orleans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease.  The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses.&lt;ref name=Mathers1991 /&gt;

The Bellettos planned to use the Beacham Theatre for [[Theatre|theatrical]] performances and concerts during the week and as a [[nightclub]] on the weekends.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;  Frank Carroll, served as the managing artistic director for theatre productions and starred in a [[Las Vegas]]-style musical [[revue]] tribute to [[Liberace]], ''Viva Liberace, Viva''.

Concerts were coordinated by Mary Ann D'Arpino of Mary Ann Productions, who had an office at the Beacham;  Island Productions; Harry Tiyler of Fat Harry Productions, and Cellar Door Productions.

=== Night Club era ===

Since 1988 the theater has been used as a series of combination [[nightclub]] and [[concert venue]] [[Business|enterprises]].

In May 1989 the Beacham Theatre was sold by Oscar Juarez for $1.8 million to a [[property management]] firm owned by [[Longwood, Florida|Longwood]] businesswoman Missy Casscells and her husband Frank Hamby.&lt;ref name="Jackson1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-10-31/business/9210310587_1_blues-club-beacham-alcoholic-beverage |title=State Files To Revoke Club's Liquor License|last1= Jackson|first1=Jerry |date=October 31, 1992 |website= orlandosentinel.com|publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 20, 2016 |quote=A Longwood businesswoman who owns the historic Beacham Theatre building in which the nightclub was located said she hopes to see some kind of similar club operation continue.

==== Late Night era: (1988–1994) Aahz  ====

Brad and Lisa Belletto scoured sources across the U.S. and Europe and traveled frequently for new and rare records. During the [[Second Summer of Love]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that began in 1988, on Friday and Saturday nights the Beacham Theater housed a [[discothèque|discotheque]] that had a progressive dance music format with Lisa Belletto as resident DJ and lighting control operator and Brad Belletto as operating director. Initially the club was to be called "[[Special effect|'''F/X''' (or '''Effects''')]]"&lt;ref name=Belletto1989&gt;Beacham Theatre Returns! 1988. Brad Belletto.&lt;/ref&gt;  but it opened as [[Hi-NRG|'''Pure Energy''']].

The late nights at the Beacham featured [[disc jockeys|DJs]], [[Beatmatching|beat matching]], [[Rare groove|rare and obscure]] [[dance music]] on [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]], [[intelligent lighting]], and themed decor that at times included original [[painting]]s by local artist Rollo. The popularity of dancing throughout the night at the Beacham Theatre initially caught on slowly and many free passes were given out.   Soon, the entry queue for "Late Night" snaked around the block.

The conceptual themes for "Late Night" were frequently alternated (sometimes weekly) and occasionally repeated.  The various themes subsequently included '''[[World War III]]''', [[Land of Oz|'''Aahz''']], [[Last Train to Trancentral#Trancentral|'''Trancentral''']], '''[[Haunted house|The Haunted Theatre]]''', [[Egypt#Prehistory and Ancient Egypt|'''Egypt''']],  '''[[Alphabet City]]''', '''Psychedelic Babylon''',  '''[[Unity (mathematics)|Unity]]''', and '''[[family reunion|Reunion]]'''. The all-night [[Dance party|dance parties]] were eventually referred to using the [[umbrella term]] "'Late Night' at the Classic Beacham Theatre."

The Aahz nightclub concept was born after Lisa saw the name at a shop in [[Los Angeles]].  The Bellettos and Shayni Howen then created and developed the Aahz concept for the Beacham.  Shayni and her team created Aahz's iconic décor which included a painted yellow brick road and a giant [[paper mache]] [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]] head behind the stage.  At midnight each night, the stage's curtain was raised and the glowing eyes and smoking mouth of the Wizard were revealed, at which point DJ Lisa always played Rhythm Device's ''Acid Rock''.

Eventually the combined tasks of simultaneously playing all of the music and operating the lights became overwhelming for Lisa and as a result Shayni's sister, "Late night" veteran Stacey "StaceBass" Howen, was brought in to operate the computerized [[lighting control console]] and [[Promoter (entertainment)|promote]] the nightclub.  By the Summer of 1989, Lisa was expecting her first child and still resident DJ.  Only two months before the birth of her son she invited Kimball Collins, who was the DJ in the Beacham Buildings northern unit, to replace her and hired him as Aahz's resident Late Night DJ.  Joseph Jilbert (DJ Jo-Edd), Steve McClure (DJ Monk) and Paul Campbell (DJ Stylus) had brief stints as DJ at "Late Night" when they were hired to fill in for Lisa or Kimball Collins. Dave Cannalte was quickly brought in as "Late Night's" co-resident DJ.

At this point, [[Underground music]] such as [[Industrial dance music]] and [[Gothic rock]] was played during Orlando's normal [[bar]] operating hours from 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. until just after 2&amp;nbsp;a.m.
Upon an announcement at around 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. (or an opening at 3&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name=Montes /&gt;) that said simply, "Welcome to Late Night," mixed [[New Beat]], [[Progressive house|Progressive dance]], [[Balearic beat]], and [[Acid house]] electronic dance music began that frequently lasted until 8 a.m. and occasionally lasted until as late as 11 a.m.&lt;ref name=ThumpDJThree /&gt;

Local DJ's Jerry Johnson (''the Reverend''),  Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, Eddie Pappa ([[DJ Icey]]) and DJ Lisa Belletto were occasional guests for special events such as the "DJ Unity for the World" dance party in December 1991.&lt;ref name=Unity&gt;{{cite news |last=Abbott |first= Jim|date=December 6, 1991 |title=Public Enemy To Play Orlando |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1991-12-06/entertainment/9112050582_1_ron-brooks-downtown-orlando-concert|newspaper=''The Orlando Sentinel'' |location= Orlando|access-date=October 12, 2016|quote=Saturday, the Beacham Theatre will host DJ Unity for the World, a dance party featuring the talents of Central Florida club deejays Jerry ''the Reverend'' Johnson, Lisa Belletto, Andy Hughes, Jay Skinner, Robby Clark, Troy Davis, DJ Ice, the Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAHZ was a late night event that was held at The Beacham nightclub back in the late 80′s/early 90′s. It was so much more than just a night at a club though. It was more of a family reunion every time you walked through the doors. This was in the era where PLUR (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect) was still the main player at these sort of events. This was back in the day before distractions like cell phones and digital cameras were in everyone's hands and it was just you, the crowd, and the DJ.  The time when music connected people in a way that very few will ever understand.  People came from all over the state to attend the famed AAHZ events. This was a place where you could go and totally let loose without fear of judgment by others. People came to AAHZ for the music and the vibe. The way the DJ's were able to use their turntables to emotionally connect so many different people through their music could not be duplicated anywhere. They quite literally had the mood of the entire room in their hands behind the decks. People thrived off of this new underground culture that was being introduced to Orlando through these AAHZ events.  AAHZ was in a league of its own in the Orlando club scene, hosting international talents like Sasha and John Digweed, but, little did anyone know what AAHZ would do for its resident DJ's Kimball Collins and Dave Cannalate. Both have become international superstars and a slew of other AAHZ regular customers like Andy Hughes and DJ Icey were not too far behind them. There is no doubt that AAHZ and its DJ's helped put Orlando on the map and in the forefront of the entire Electronic Dance Music movement across the United States.  There really is no way to adequately convey the true meaning or raw emotion of what AAHZ was, or why so many people considered it to be "home." ... Unfortunately, AAHZ came to an end in 1992, and with that came the end of an era for the Orlando club scene and Orlando Electronic Dance Music as a whole. The days of AAHZ may never be able to be totally recreated as it once was, however, AAHZ holds their reunion in Downtown Orlando every year, where they make sure that old school vibe is still in full effect. People who were involved in it during its peak fly in from all around the country just to attend and reclaim their little piece of perfect that used to reside in the heart of Downtown Orlando.}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RPM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waxdj.com/djs/5215//info_16436.php |title=Aahz '89 Quintessential New Beat w/ DJ Joe Ed Info:|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 25, 2008 |website= waxdj.com|publisher=WaxDJ |access-date= September 1, 2016|quote=DJ Joe Ed was one of the founding fathers of Aahz (Orlando) with Stace-Bass and Steve McClure until he handed the reigns off to Dave Cannalte and Kimball Collins who made Aahz what we remember to this day! ...

====Cultural impact====

The early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own [[Summer of Love]] between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the [[Clubbing (subculture)|subculture]] surrounding [[electronic dance music]] in Florida and subsequently in the United States.  "Late Night" organized several [[music festival]]s that were held at the [[Orange County Convention Center]] such as the "[[Infinity (philosophy)|Infonet]]" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the "Infonet 2" dance party on December 31, 1992, and "Infonet 3," "The Underground Explosion," on July 3, 1993.  Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events.  Although, "[[rave]]s" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called [[Electronic dance music#Popularization in the United States|rave-oriented]] nightclubs that followed it.&lt;ref name=Guinto1993&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-08-01/news/9308010603_1_rave-downtown-orlando-spinoffs |title= All The Rave|last1=Guinto |first1= Liesl  |date=August 1, 1993 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 16, 2016 |quote=The Orlando rave scene can trace its roots back almost five years to the old Beacham Theatre in downtown Orlando, also known as Aahz.

====End of the Late Night and Live Entertainment eras====

Inside "Late Night" at the Beacham was always very dark and the auditorium was absolutely filthy.  In contrast, initially the scene's "[[Energy (esotericism)|vibe]]" was pure and drugs such as [[MDMA]] that were available  were relatively unadulterated.  As time went on, the beloved Beacham was [[Beautification|beautified]] and remodeled into Dekko's.  While the Beacham itself was cleaned up, the overall "vibe" of Orlando's scene seemed to darken somewhat just as the quality of [[club drugs]] that were still available during that time became tainted.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

During the summer of 1994, at a "Late Night" event featuring a [[guest appearance]] DJ Sasha, two female revelers who were attending a Reunion  event at the Beacham Theatre collapsed just before sunrise.&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt; The women were carried outside to Orange Avenue in front of Dekko's where [[CPR]] was administered by an [[Orlando Police Department]] officer and [[paramedics]] were dispatched.  Tragically, one of the young women [[death|expired]].  ''The Orlando Sentinel'' reported the May 1, 1994, passing of 20-year old Teresa Schwartz and that the other young woman was briefly in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-05-02/news/9405020286_1_lake-mary-downtown-nightclub-orlando |title=2 Women Fall Ill At Club In Orlando - 1 Is Dead |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 8, 2016 |quote=A 20-year-old Melbourne woman died and an 18-year-old Lake Mary woman is in critical condition after both collapsed from what Orlando police think were drug overdoses at a downtown nightclub Sunday morning.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-06-18/news/9506150696_1_mdma-ecstasy-downtown-orlando |title=Drugs: Facing Agony Of Ecstasy |last1=  Leithauser|first1=Tom |date=June 18, 1995 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1994-07-06/news/9407060231_1_drug-overdose-schwartz-apparent-drug |title=Woman Dies Of Apparent Drug Overdose, Police Say |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 6, 1994 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher= The Orlando Sentinel|access-date=July 29, 2016 |quote=In the earlier death, 20-year-old Teresa Schwartz of Melbourne collapsed May 1 outside of Dekko's Night Club on Orange Avenue downtown.

The incident along with those at other venues in Orlando, shocked the underground dance club scene in Central Florida and were followed by a dramatic decrease in attendance.  "Late Night's" organizers made the responsible decision to end Reunion at Dekko's after their pleas for young club-goers to practice [[moderation]] were ignored.  The Dekko's concept was sold to a competitor in the following months.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=clubscene2015 /&gt;

====Night Club exclusive use era====

By 1992 the future looked brighter for the Beacham Theatre when Mike Berry, staff writer, for ''The Orlando Sentinel'' wrote that, "The Beacham Theatre is the latest testament to [[reincarnation]]."  Concerts were no longer being held in the auditorium during this time period and the Beacham Theatre was used exclusively as night club through 2010.

It was 1992 when Orlando [[Lawyer|Attorney]] Mark NeJame leased the Beacham Theatre with the option to match the purchase price of any prospective buyers.&lt;ref name=Berry1992 /&gt;   The Beacham underwent restoration at a cost of in excess of $1,000,000.  NeJame then opened "'''Dekko's'''," a mainstream "high-energy dance club."   "Dekko's" is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of [[Art Deco|Deco]] and [[Gekko]].    The "Dekko's" concept featured a rose-beige exterior with a newly [[Building restoration|restored]] [[Art Deco]] inspired facade with red [[neon lighting]].  Dekko's interior included extensive use of the color [[purple]] and a [[sushi]] bar in the balcony.  The inclusion of a [[terrarium]] ([[vivarium]]) with live subtropical [[geckos]] was planned.&lt;ref name=Berry1992&gt;{{cite news |last= Berry |first=Mike |date=October 14, 1992  |title=Another facade may soon grace historic Beacham: Beacham may get a Face Lift |url= |newspaper= The Orlando Sentinel|location=Orlando, FL |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Dekko's" was open from late 1992 until the "high-energy dance club" [[concept]] was bought out in 1994 by Bill Harmening who operated The Edge, a competing nightclub.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelemen1998 /&gt;

"'''Zuma Beach Club'''" followed Dekko's and opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Early1996&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-01-28/news/9601250598_1_orlando-opera-opera-house-movie-houses |title= Early Entertainment Venues Evolved From Opera House To Movie Theaters|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 28, 1996 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date= August 21, 2016|quote=...the former site of the county jail where hangings once were conducted - and built the Beacham Theater...Air conditioning was installed in the '30s...It later was home to Laser World; then to Moulin Orange, a Las Vegas-style cabaret that lasted four months in 1983-84; and then to Valentyne's Celebrity Dinner Theatre, which opened in 1987.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recently remodeled auditorium was gutted for the change.  Redecoration was complete with [[fishing net]]s, galvanized [[watering trough]]s for beer, and [[warning signs]] for [[sharks]].  On February 22, 1995, NeJame entered a new [[partnership]] with George Maltezos, John SanFelippo and brother, Joseph SanFelippo.  Zuma Beach was often described by NeJame as "the cheesiest club in America."  ''Rolling Stone'' in 1997 described Zuma Beach as a "cheesy dive."&lt;ref name=Weir1997 /&gt;  Zuma Beach even hosted an [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] "hardcore" [[professional wrestling]] match on January 29, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/2000a.html#012900 |title=ECW hardcore wrestling |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January–March 2000 |website=prowrestlinghistory.com |publisher=Pro Wrestiling History |access-date=November 22, 2016 |quote=January 29, 2000 in Orlando, FL; Zuma Beach Club drawing 800}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercifully, "Zuma Beach" closed its doors in late 2000.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-06-09/entertainment/0006080412_1_beacham-nejame-zuma|title=Beacham Theatre May live Again |last1= Emmons|first1=M.

Finally, after yet another remodeling of the auditorium, "'''Tabu''' opened in 2001."  Initially, Tabu was more of an upscale nightclub.  [[Backstreet Boy]] [[Howie Dorough]], who performed his first musical at the Beacham as one of the [[Munchkins]] in the [[Lollipop Guild]] for a [[theatre production]] of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', was a design and talent acquisition advisor for Tabu.&lt;ref name =Emmons2000 /&gt;  However, Tabu later became more [[mainstream]].  Tabu had a weekly lineup presentation that with the exception of hosting live music, was similar to the theater's current nightclub iteration.&lt;ref name=Tabunow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-01-06/entertainment/os-bars-rail-010711-20110106_1_tabu-hip-hop-sanfelippo-and-george-maltezos |title=Tabu is now The Beacham |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 6, 2011 |website=orlandosentinel.com |publisher=The Orlando Sentinel |access-date=August 10, 2016 |quote= John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, co-owners of Tabu ... have partnered with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, co-owners of The Social, in opening the newly named venue at 46 N.

====Return of Live Entertainment====

[[File:Beacham logo 1.gif|thumb|115px|right|Beacham logo]]

In 2011 leases for the Beacham Theatre were renewed by John SanFelippo and George Maltezos, along with Gerard Mitchell and Michael McRaney, who leased the adjacent unit.  Their [[partnership]] is named 46/54 North Orange Ave, LLC, and both units are leased from building owners  Margaret Casscells and Frank Hamby, of Beacham Theater, LLC.

[[File:The Beacham logo.png|thumb|200px|left]]

Since 2011 "'''The Beacham'''" nightclub has operated in partnership with "The Social," a smaller venue next door at 54 North Orange Avenue.  The venues, are connected via a [[Passage (architecture)|passage]] and [[door]].  The Beacham features [[disc jockey]] entertainment and plays [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Top 40]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], and [[Reggaeton]]."&lt;ref name=Tabunow /&gt;

The Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social.  Prominent national and international musical acts perform with [[fidelity]] to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s.

==Description==

Beacham's Building is divided into seven rental units using wood frame, brick walls, different facades, and paint. The theater is the south-most unit. The two-story Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 in a simple 20th Century Commercial Style.  The structure is constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[brick]] with [[stucco]] out-surface.  Utilization of wood in the construction was minimized.&lt;ref name="newbeacham1921" /&gt;

===Historical===

The facade was decorated with multi-colored tile trim and impregnated with [[seashell]].  The first story originally contained two small storefronts, a [[boxoffice]], and lobby entrance to the theater as well the [[auditorium]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], dressing rooms, staff restrooms, and a [[green room]].  The second story of the theater contained [[Bathroom|restrooms]], windowed offices, a [[projection booth]], and [[balcony]] seating section as well as additional [[dressing room (theater)|dressing rooms]] accessible by a spiral staircase.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;  Above the stage was the [[fly system]] and [[Catwalk (theater)|catwalk]].

In 1936 [[Art Deco]] styling with Mediterranean-style tile was added to the facade and extensive neon lighting was installed the on the entrance [[Overhang (architecture)|overhang]].&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt; Inside, the theater was modernized to provide lighted stairs, air conditioning into the dressing rooms, an enlarged auditorium, and improved seating.  Capacity was reduced to 1,051.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;  To diminish [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es from the projectors and recorded sound equipment, the auditorium was carpeted with a floral pattern and the plaster walls were covered with an Ozite material.&lt;ref name=Robinson1982&gt;{{cite interview|last=Robinson|first=Wendall|subject-link=|interviewer=B.T. Sherwood|title=Interview of Wendall O. Robinson (projectionist)|url=|location=Orlando|date=February 5, 1982|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vernon Hunter oversaw the modernization.&lt;ref name=Ives1953 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in 1991.jpg|thumb|170px|Beacham Theatre upstairs offices in March 1991.]]

In 1954 the look of the theater was modernized once again with the removal of [[parapets]], [[cornices]], and windows.  The marquee was replaced with a new [[Vitreous enamel|porcelain]] one.  The lobby was enclosed with glass doors and the [[boxoffice]] was moved to the right side of the lobby exterior and rebuilt.  An entirely new stucco sheeting was installed over the facade, a wide screen was installed, and new decorations and push-back seats were added with additional alterations to the floor plan and seating areas.  Capacity was reduced to 650.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ives1953/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boxoffice1954 /&gt;

In 1964 the [[proscenium]] was modified to accommodate the installation of [[Cinerama]] widescreen.&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt; A new projection room was constructed under the balcony to accommodate 70-mm projectors.
      
By 1975 the theater was no longer being used as a feature cinema. For the 1976 opening of the Great Southern Music Hall, the theater's interior and stage were remodeled, the proscenium was rebuilt, balcony seating was added.   The facade was repainted with Art Deco graphics and a large mural was painted on the back of the theater.  Capacity was increased to 765.&lt;ref name="OrlandoHPB" /&gt;&lt;ref name= Sweers1981 /&gt;

[[File:Beacham Theatre balcony restoration in 1991.jpg|thumb|180px|The balcony was remodeled in March 1991 revealing the theater's original 35 mm film projection  port.]]

The balcony was extended in 1981.

In 1984 the theater cinema's 765 seats were removed and sold  and the sloped auditorium floor was [[Terrace (stadium)|terraced]].&lt;ref name="Hinson" /&gt;  Buffet dinner tables for 400 and balcony tables for 100 were added.  The [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|backstage]] area was remodeled, and the balcony was restored back to its original shape.  Exterior [[drainage]] was improved.

The degraded ceiling plasterwork was repaired and repainted, the roof was replaced and wiring were upgraded in 1988.&lt;ref name=Hodges1988 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maupin1988 /&gt;  External air conditioning was being pumped in.

By 1991 the balcony was renovated and re-extended and the [[70 mm film]] projection room under the balcony had been removed and the air conditioning repaired.  Opera boxes were installed on the second floor of either side of the stage and the DJ booth was relocated shortly thereafter.

[[File:Beacham Theatre restoration proposal.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Facade restoration proposal for the Beacham Theatre]]

As the Beacham was renovated to become Dekkos's in 1992, it was discovered that the stucco sheeting that was installed during a modernization in 1954 could not be economically removed without severely damaging the original facade underneath.  Restoration plans for the facade had to be modified.&lt;ref name=OrlandoHPB /&gt;
An arched molding was then added to the facade.  A [[sunburst]] and red neon lighting was subsequently added.

Following an effort to "bring back the [[aesthetics]] of the old Beacham Theatre," in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate [[plaster]] ceiling moldings, [[facade]], and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated.  The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting [[Building restoration|restoration]] and is being stored on the roof.&lt;ref name= Emmons2000 /&gt;

Around 2005, the facade was modified by removing a small semi-circular molding in front of the sunburst.  The points of the [[sunburst]] were also removed leaving a large semi-circular molding and larger arch above it decorating the facade.

[[File:Beacham Theatre facade in 2015.jpg|thumb|180px|Beacham Theatre's facade was in poor condition between 2014 and 2016.]]

====Recent Changes====

The balcony and upstairs areas were [[Renovation|remodeled]] in 2011 with a beautifully painted ceiling and the addition of two [[chandeliers]].  [[Public toilet|Restroom]]s were installed in place of the theater's original office area and [[35 mm film]] [[projection booth]].  The theater's ornate plaster ceilings are in a state of disrepair with the decorative ceiling concealed behind a black cloth barrier that can retain any pieces of plaster that might fall.

During the summer months of 2016 the crumbling arched molding was removed from the facade.  The facade was then repaired and repainted and new red and blue neon lighting was installed.  Further restoration in the near future is in a discussion and planning stage.

The '''CNIB Foundation'''&lt;ref name="cnib foundation" /&gt; ({{lang-fr|Fondation INCA}}) is a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] agency and charitable organization dedicated to assisting Canadians who are [[blindness|blind]] or living with vision loss, and to provide information about vision health for all Canadians. Founded in 1918 as the '''Canadian National Institute for the Blind''' ({{lang-fr|Institut national canadien pour les aveugles}}) to assist soldiers who had been blinded in the [[World War I|First World War]], CNIB originally offered sheltered care and specialized employment to people with vision loss. It has since expanded to include other programs and services, including research, public education, rehabilitation counselling and training, advocacy and an alternative-format library for people living with a [[print disability]]. It is a member of the [[Braille Authority of North America]].

==History==
[[File:CNIB_English_logo_with_motto.gif|thumb|150px|Former CNIB logo.]]
The Canadian National Institute for the Blind was incorporated on March 30, 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founders|url=http://www.cnib.ca/en/about/who/history/founders/Pages/default.aspx|website=About Us|publisher=CNIB|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide food, clothing and sheltered residences for blind veterans returning from World War I as well as the 850 people blind by the [[Halifax Explosion]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/about/history/Pages/Historical-Timeline.aspx "Historical Timeline", CNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest mass blinding in Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-explosion-canadian-national-institute-for-the-blind-imo-mont-blanc-1.3878921 Jon Tattrie, "How the largest mass-blinding in Canadian history birthed CNIB", CBC, Dec. 4, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;  It began with 27 employees serving 1,521 people who were blind, primarily in Toronto, with two "home teachers" providing rehabilitation training in other parts of Canada.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/about/who/history/ Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, CNIB operated a job placement program with limited success, also creating jobs through its own factories, broom shops and concession stands. The organization also appointed a special nurse responsible for vision health and sight preservation.

In 1923, a Dominion Charter was obtained to establish a Home Nursery Hospital and Kindergarten for the Blind under 6 years of age in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/45916299/ Canadian Blind Babies Home Association Ottawa Journal June 9, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mothers of blind babies from any Province in the Dominion, were encouraged to place their charges in the Canadian Blind Babies Home Association for proper care and education c. 1918 - 1939. It was to be similar to "Sunshine Home," at [[Chorley Wood]], England, which was then "the only home in the Empire for Blind babies." &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=883&amp;dat=19230309&amp;id=ZgEfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0WEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=970%2C5888592&amp;hl=en ]&lt;/ref&gt; After the founder, Mrs. Margaret Dean, died it went out of existence and the subscription funds were reallocated to the CNIB.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pHEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6342%2C4129951 Canadian Blind Babies Home Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, CNIB was serving more than 17,000 clients, with offices, vocational centres and residences in major Canadian cities. A formalized research program into prevention was also prioritized.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Steps were taken towards advocacy with the 1930 Blind Voters Act, allowing a person who is blind to vote with the assistance of a sighted person, and legislation around mandatory eye drops to prevent disease in newborns. In 1956, the organization helped sponsor a course for blind computer programmers.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 2010, the organisation officially changed its name to simply "CNIB" after a national consultation with its membership, branding support from [[Pilot PMR]] and creative by [[Cossette, Inc.]]&lt;ref name="namechange"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian National Institute for the Blind Changes Name to CNIB|url=http://www.cnib.ca/en/news/archive/pages/cnib.aspx|publisher=CNIB.ca|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the organisation rebranded again as the CNIB Foundation.&lt;ref name="cnib foundation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Introducing the CNIB Foundation |url=https://cnib.ca/en/node/1136 |website=News |publisher=CNIB Foundation |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |language=en |date=September 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
CNIB operates community-based services for Canadians who are blind or partially sighted. This includes assistance in returning to school, advice on travelling, and emotional support. These services are delivered either at a local CNIB office, within the community, over the phone, online, or in an individual's home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/services/vision-support/ CNIB Rehabilitation and Support Services]&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers advocacy support for resources focusing on social issues, such as concessions, housing, finances, and leisure pursuits. Self-help groups are facilitated by staff and volunteers who may be blind or partially sighted.&lt;ref name=support&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/services/vision-support/range/ Our Range of Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

CNIB provides functional assessments of visual abilities, instruction on how to maximize residual vision, and, as required, information and training in the use of low vision devices.&lt;ref name=support/&gt; Life-skills training emphasizes managing the essentials of daily living, including safe and effective methods of cooking, alternate communication methods such as braille and large print, and household tasks such as laundry, banking, writing, and personal care.&lt;ref name=support/&gt; Orientation and mobility instructors provide instruction on how to move safely around the house, and/or skills to travel safely within the community.&lt;ref name=support/&gt;

The organization operates a library that includes more than 80,000 accessible materials in formats such as [[Braille]], audio, [[DAISY]], and e-text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/services/library/ CNIB Library]&lt;/ref&gt; Assistive technology services include accessible audio book players, video magnifiers, computer screen readers, and other tools to make life with vision loss easier. Specialists provide instruction through demonstration, assessment, training, and technical support about the availability, selection, use, and purchase of devices for individual needs.&lt;ref name=support/&gt;

==Organization==
CNIB employs approximately 1,100 professionals, working in the fields of life-skills training, library services, research, advocacy, public education, accessible design consulting, fundraising and administration. CNIB also receives support from over 10,000 volunteers working in all regions of the country.

The organization consists of a national office at the CNIB Centre in Toronto and eight provincial and territorial divisions. They are governed by a volunteer board of directors, selected from across Canada, including representatives from the corporate, medical and government sectors, as well as individuals affected by vision loss. There are eight operating divisions, plus the Lake Joseph Centre and the CNIB Library, each with a volunteer board. The chair of each division board sits on a Council of Chairs in order to provide input and advice to CNIB's President and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnib.ca/en/about/who/structure/ How We're Structured]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discounts==
A number of businesses and government services offer discounted rates for those who are blind or visually impaired upon presentation of a CNIB identification card. The card is offered exclusively to Canadians who are legally blind and registered at CNIB, with 20/200 vision in the best eye with correction or a visual field of 20 degrees or less.

===Air travel===
The One Person, One Fare Policy has been in effect since January 10, 2009 and pertains only to domestic flights on Air Canada and WestJet. This policy provides an extra seat to people meeting certain requirements who need a personal attendant on their flight. Attendants are charged the taxes and fees applicable to their flight. A CNIB card does not automatically qualify you with these airlines as each airline has their own process to provide accommodations.

===Trains===
[[Via Rail]] offers free travel to one escort accompanying a person with vision loss. The escort or attendant travels free in the same class of service. Passengers wishing to travel with an escort must be eligible for a CNIB ID Card and have the card in hand when purchasing a train ticket.

===Buses===
[[Greyhound]] offers [[two-for-one]] fares, wherein a guide can travel free when accompanying a blind or visually impaired person. The discount also applies to travel with Société de transport de la Rive-Sud (STRSM), Corporation métropolitaine des transports de Sherbrooke (CMTS), RÉgie de transport en commum de Shawinigan (RTCS), Corporation inter-municipale de transport des Forges (CITF) and Société de transport du Saguenay (STS)People with vision loss should contact the bus carrier about discounted fares as it varies from province to province.

===Cultural events===
Discounts are available on the cost of admission for select cultural events upon presentation of a CNIB ID card. Most major movie theatres take part in a program run by [[Easter Seals (Canada)|Easter Seals]] in Canada called ''Access2Entertainment''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access2.ca/ Access2Entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt; The program requires CNIB members to pay an administration fee of $20, which goes to Easter Seals, in order to receive a card good for 5 years. Regardless of their participation in the program, some theaters will still accept the CNIB ID card.

'''Cancer screening''' aims to detect [[cancer]] before symptoms appear.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/overview/Patient |title= What Is Cancer Screening? |publisher= [[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve [[blood test]]s, [[urine test]]s, [[23andme|DNA tests]] other tests, or [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=NIH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm599560.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of screening in terms of [[cancer prevention]], early detection and subsequent treatment must be weighed against any harms.

[[Universal screening]], also known as mass screening or population screening, involves screening everyone, usually within a specific age group.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wilson |first1= JMG |last2= Jungner |first2= G |year= 1968 |url= http://whqlibdoc.who.int/php/WHO_PHP_34.pdf |title= Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease |location= Geneva |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |series= Public Health Papers |volume= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective screening identifies people who are known to be at higher risk of developing cancer, such as people with a family history of cancer.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

Screening can lead to false positive results and subsequent invasive procedures.&lt;ref name= "Croswell2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Croswell |first1= JM |last2= Kramer |first2= BS |last3= Kreimer |first3= AR |last4= Prorok |first4= PC |last5= Xu |first5= JL |last6= Baker |first6= SG |last7= Fagerstrom |first7= R |last8= Riley |first8= TL |last9= Clapp |first9= JD |last10= Berg |first10= CD |last11= Gohagan |first11= JK |last12= Andriole |first12= GL |last13= Chia |first13= D |last14= Church |first14= TR |last15= Crawford |first15= ED |last16= Fouad |first16= MN |last17= Gelmann |first17= EP |last18= Lamerato |first18= L |last19= Reding |first19= DJ |last20= Schoen |first20= RE |title= Cumulative incidence of false-positive results in repeated, multimodal cancer screening |journal= [[Annals of Family Medicine]] |volume= 7 |issue= 3 |pages= 212–22 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19433838 |pmc= 2682972 |doi= 10.1370/afm.942 |display-authors= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening can also lead to false negative results, where an existing cancer is missed. Controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of the screening procedure itself, and any follow-up diagnostic tests and treatments.

Screening tests must be effective, safe, well-tolerated with acceptably low rates of [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] and [[Type I and type II errors|false negative results]]. If signs of cancer are detected, more definitive and invasive follow-up tests are performed to reach a diagnosis. Screening for cancer can lead to cancer prevention and earlier diagnosis. Early diagnosis may lead to higher rates of successful treatment and extended life. However, it may also falsely appear to increase the time to death through [[lead time bias]] or [[length time bias]].

==Medical uses==
The goal of cancer screening is to provide useful health information which can guide medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cancer Tests You Need and Don't|journal=Consumer Reports|date=March 2013|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2013/03/the-cancer-tests-you-need-and-those-you-don-t/index.htm|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}} A good cancer screening is one which would detect when a person has cancer so that the person could seek treatment to protect their health.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; Good cancer screening would not be more likely to cause harm than to provide useful information.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; In general, cancer screening has risks and should not be done except with a [[Indication (medicine)|medical indication]].&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt;

Different kinds of cancer screening procedures have different risks, but good tests share some characteristics.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; If a test detects cancer, then that test result should also lead to options for treatment.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; Good tests come with a patient explanation of why that person has high enough risk of cancer to justify the test.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; Part of the testing experience is for the health care provider to explain how common [[false positive]] results are so that the patient can understand the context of their results.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt; If multiple tests are available, then any test should be presented along with other options.&lt;ref name="Consumer Reports March 2013"/&gt;

==Risks==
Screening for cancer is controversial in cases when it is not yet known if the test actually saves lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osório|first1=Flávia|last2=Lima|first2=Manuela Polidoro|last3=Chagas|first3=Marcos Hortes|title=Assessment And Screening Of Panic Disorder In Cancer Patients: Performance Of The PHQ-PD|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=January 2015|volume=78|issue=1|pages=91–94|pmid=25242741|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening can lead to substantial false positive result and subsequent invasive procedures.&lt;ref name= "Croswell2009"/&gt; The controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of screening outweigh the risks of follow-up diagnostic tests and cancer treatments. Cancer screening is not indicated unless [[life expectancy]] is greater than five years and the benefit is uncertain over the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Spalding |first1= MC |last2= Sebesta |first2= SC |title= Geriatric screening and preventive care |journal= [[American Family Physician]] |volume= 78 |issue= 2 |pages= 206–15 |date= July 15, 2008 |pmid= 18697503 |doi= |url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2008/0715/p206.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several factors are considered to determine whether the benefits of screening outweigh the risks and the costs of screening.&lt;ref name=NIH/&gt; These factors include:
*Possible harms from the screening test: Some types of screening tests, such as [[X-ray images]], expose the body to potentially harmful [[ionizing radiation]]. There is a small chance that the radiation in the test could cause a new cancer in a healthy person. [[Screening mammography]], used to detect breast cancer, is not recommended to men or to young women because they are more likely to be harmed by the test than to benefit from it. Other tests, such as a skin check for skin cancer, have no significant risk of harm to the patient. A test that has high potential harms is only recommended when the benefits are also high.
*The likelihood of the test correctly identifying cancer: If the test is not ''[[sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]'', then it may miss cancers. If the test is not ''[[sensitivity and specificity|specific]]'', then it may wrongly indicate cancer in a healthy person. All cancer screening tests produce both [[false positive]]s and [[false negative]]s, and most produce more false positives. Experts consider the rate of errors when making recommendations about which test, if any, to use. A test may work better in some populations than others. The [[positive predictive value]] is a calculation of the likelihood that a positive test result actually represents cancer in a given individual, based on the results of people with similar risk factors.
*The likelihood of cancer being present: Screening is not normally useful for rare cancers. It is rarely done for young people, since cancer is largely a disease found in people over the age of 50. Countries often focus their screening recommendations on the major forms of treatable cancer found in their population. For example, the United States recommends universal screening for [[colon cancer]], which is common in the US, but not for [[stomach cancer]], which is less common; by contrast, Japan recommends screening for stomach cancer, but not colon cancer, which is rarer in Japan. Screening recommendations depend on the individual's risk, with high-risk people receiving earlier and more frequent screening than low-risk people.
*Possible harms from follow-up procedures: If the screening test is positive, further diagnostic testing is normally done, such as a [[biopsy]] of the tissue. If the test produces many false positives, then many people will undergo needless medical procedures, some of which may be dangerous.
*Whether suitable treatment is available and appropriate: Screening is discouraged if no effective treatment is available.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; When effective and suitable treatment is not available, then diagnosis of a fatal disease produces significant mental and emotional harms. For example, routine screening for cancer is typically not appropriate in a very [[frailty syndrome|frail elderly]] person, because the treatment for any cancer that is detected might kill the patient.
*Whether early detection improves treatment outcomes: Even when treatment is available, sometimes early detection does not improve the outcome. If the treatment result is the same as if the screening had not been done, then the only screening program does is increase the length of time the person lived with the knowledge that he had cancer. This phenomenon is called [[lead-time bias]]. A useful screening program reduces the number of [[years of potential life lost]] (longer lives) and [[disability-adjusted life year]]s lost (longer healthy lives).
*Whether the cancer will ever need treatment: Diagnosis of a cancer in a person who will never be harmed by the cancer is called [[overdiagnosis]]. Overdiagnosis is most common among older people with slow-growing cancers. Concerns about overdiagnosis are common for breast and prostate cancer.
*Whether the test is acceptable to the patients:If a screening test is too burdensome, such as requiring too much time, too much pain, or culturally unacceptable behaviors, then people will refuse to participate.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;
*Cost of the test: Some expert bodies, such as the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]], completely ignore the question of money. Most, however, include a [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] that, all else being equal, favors less expensive tests over more expensive tests, and attempt to balance the cost of the screening program against the [[opportunity cost|benefits of using those funds for other health programs]]. These analyses usually include the total cost of the screening program to the healthcare system, such as ordering the test, performing the test, reporting the results, and biopsies for suspicious results, but not usually the costs to the individual, such as for time taken away from employment.
*The extent to which a cancer is treatable: if a person has a low life expectancy or otherwise is in the end stages of a chronic condition, then such a patient may have a better life by ignoring the cancer even if one were found. If the diagnosis of cancer would not result in a change in care then cancer screening would not likely result in a positive outcome. Overdiagnosis in this case occurs, for example, in patients with [[end-stage renal disease]] and organizations recommend against cancer screening for such patients.&lt;ref name="ASNfive"&gt;{{Cite web |author = American Society of Nephrology |author-link = American Society of Nephrology |date = |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = [[ABIM Foundation]] |work = Choosing Wisely |url= http://www.choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/5things_12_factsheet_Amer_Soc_Neph1.pdf |accessdate = August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESRDcancerfinancal"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Chertow |first1= GM |last2= Paltiel |first2= AD |last3= Owen |first3= WF |last4= Lazarus |first4= JM |title= Cost-effectiveness of cancer screening in end-stage renal disease |doi= 10.1001/archinte.1996.00440110117016 |journal= [[JAMA Internal Medicine|Archives of Internal Medicine]] |volume= 156 |issue= 12 |pages= 1345–50 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8651845 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By type==
===Breast cancer===
{{Main article|Breast cancer screening}}
Breast cancer screening is the [[medical screening]] of [[asymptomatic]], apparently healthy women for [[breast cancer]] in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes.  A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. The use of [[mammography]] in [[universal screening]] for breast cancer is controversial as it may not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures. Many national organizations recommend it for most older women.

===Cervical cancer===
[[File:Ca in situ, cervix.jpg|thumb|Microscope image of the cervical gland showing an area of high grade [[epithelial dysplasia]].]]

{{Main article|Cervical screening}}

Cervical screening by the [[Pap test]] or other methods is highly effective at detecting and preventing [[cervical cancer]], although there is a serious risk of [[overtreatment]] in young women up to the age of 20 or beyond, who are prone to have many abnormal cells which clear up naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lixin|first1=Tao|last2=Lili|first2=Han|last3=Xia|first3=Li|last4=Qi|first4=Gao|last5=Lei|first5=Pan|last6=Lijuan|first6=Wu|last7=Yanxia|first7=Luo|last8=Wei|first8=Wang|last9=Zihe|first9=Zheng|last10=Xiuhua|first10=Guo|title=Prevalence And Risk Factors For Cervical Neoplasia: A Cervical Cancer Screening Program In Beijing|journal=BMC Public Health|date=2014|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-1185|pmid=25410572|pmc=4256817}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a considerable range in the recommended age at which to begin screening around the world. According to the 2010 European guidelines for cervical cancer screening, the age at which to commence screening ranges between 20–30 years of age, "but preferentially not before age 25 or 30 years", depending on the burden of the disease in the population and the available resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arbyn|first=M|author2=Anttila, A |author3=Jordan, J |author4=Ronco, G |author5=Schenck, U |author6=Segnan, N |author7=Wiener, H |author8=Herbert, A |author9= von Karsa, L |title=European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening.

In the United States the rate of cervical cancer is 0.1% among women under 20 years of age, so the American Cancer Society as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommend that screening begin at age 21, regardless of age at sexual initiation or other risk-related behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Cervix Uteri Cancer|url=http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/cervix.html|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kar2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karjane|first=N|author2=Chelmow, D|title=New cervical cancer screening guidelines, again|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America|date=June 2013|volume=40|issue=2|pages=211–23|pmid=23732026|doi=10.1016/j.ogc.2013.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Disease Control |title=Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines for Average-Risk Women |url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/pdf/guidelines.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For healthy women aged 21–29 who have never had an abnormal Pap smear, cervical cancer screening with cervical cytology (Pap smear) should occur every 3 years, regardless of HPV vaccination status.&lt;ref name="Committee on Practice 1222–38"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Committee on Practice|first=Bulletins—Gynecology|title=ACOG Practice Bulletin Number 131: Screening for cervical cancer|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=Nov 2012|volume=120|issue=5|pages=1222–38|pmid=23090560|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318277c92a|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred screening for women aged 30–65 is "co-testing", which includes a combination of cervical cytology screening and HPV testing, every 5 years.&lt;ref name="Committee on Practice 1222–38"/&gt; However, it is acceptable to screen this age group with a Pap smear alone every 3 years.&lt;ref name="Committee on Practice 1222–38"/&gt; In women over the age of 65, screening for cervical cancer may be discontinued in the absence of abnormal screening results within the prior 10 years and no history of CIN 2 or higher.&lt;ref name="Committee on Practice 1222–38"/&gt;

===Bowel cancer===
[[File:SB polyp.jpg|thumb|A [[bowel polyp]] that can be identified by [[sigmoidoscopy]]. Some polyps will develop into cancers if not removed.]]

The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for [[colorectal cancer]] using [[fecal occult blood]] testing, [[sigmoidoscopy]], or [[colonoscopy]], in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years.&lt;ref name=USP2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Screening for Colorectal Cancer|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf08/colocancer/colors.htm|publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]|accessdate=29 June 2014|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10&amp;nbsp;years screening is not recommended.

In England, adults are screened biennially via faecal occult blood testing between the ages of 60 and 74 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/bowel/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostate cancer===

{{Main article|Prostate cancer screening}}
When screening for [[prostate cancer]], the [[Prostate specific antigen|PSA]] test may detect small cancers that would never become life-threatening, but once detected will lead to treatment. This situation, called [[overdiagnosis]], puts men at risk for complications from unnecessary treatment such as surgery or radiation. Follow up procedures used to diagnose prostate cancer ([[prostate biopsy]]) may cause side effects, including bleeding and infection. Prostate cancer treatment may cause [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]] (inability to control urine flow) and [[erectile dysfunction]] (erections inadequate for intercourse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Screening for Prostate Cancer |date= May 2012 |url= http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening/prostatecancerfact.pdf |series= Understanding Task Force Recommendations |publisher= [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]] |type= consumer brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends against [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA) based screening for [[prostate cancer]] finding, "there is a very small potential benefit and significant potential harms" and concluding, "while everyone wants to help prevent deaths from prostate cancer, current methods of PSA screening and treatment of screen-detected cancer are not the answer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Screening for Prostate Cancer |url= http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/prostatecancerscreening.htm |date= May 2012 |publisher= [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/trends-cancer-screening |title=Trends in Cancer Screening: A Conversation With Two Cancer Researchers |date=2013-04-17 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most North American medical groups recommend individualized decisions about screening, taking into consideration the risks, benefits, and the patients' personal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Comparative Effectiveness of Alternative Prostate-Specific Antigen–Based Prostate Cancer Screening Strategies: Model Estimates of Potential Benefits and Harms|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=158|issue=3|pages=145–53|date= February 2013|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-158-3-201302050-00003|pmid=23381039|last1=Gulati|first1=Roman|last2=Gore|first2=John L.|last3=Etzioni|first3=Ruth|pmc=3738063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lung cancer===
{{Main article|Lung cancer screening}}
Screening studies for lung cancer have only been done in high risk populations, such as smokers and workers with occupational exposure to certain substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Brien|first1=Mary|title=Lung Cancer Screening: Is There A Future?|journal=Indian Journal of Medical &amp; Paediatric Oncology|date=2014|volume=35|issue=4|pages=249–252|doi=10.4103/0971-5851.144984|pmid=25538400|pmc=4264269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s recommendations by medical authorities are turning in favour of lung cancer screening, which is likely to become more widely available in the advanced economies.

In December 2013 the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) changed its long-standing recommendation that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for [[lung cancer]] to the following: "The USPSTF recommends annual screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography in adults ages 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspslung.htm |title=Lung Cancer Screening |year=2013 |publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pancreatic cancer===
It is generally agreed that general screening of large groups for [[pancreatic cancer]] is not at present likely to be effective, and outside clinical trials there are no programmes for this. The [[European Society for Medical Oncology]] recommends regular screening with [[endoscopic ultrasound]] and MRI/CT imaging for those at high risk from inherited genetics,&lt;ref name="ESMOPA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seufferlein|first1=T|last2=Bachet|first2=JB|last3=Van Cutsem|first3=E|last4=Rougier|first4=P|last5=ESMO Guidelines Working|first5=Group|title=Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: ESMO-ESDO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.|journal=Annals of Oncology|date=Oct 2012|volume=23 Suppl 7|pages=vii33–40|pmid=22997452|doi=10.1093/annonc/mds224}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with other recommendations,&lt;ref name="Stoita"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lancet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=A|last2=Herman|first2=J|last3=Schulick|first3=R|last4=Hruban|first4=RH|last5=Goggins|first5=M|title=Pancreatic cancer.|journal=Lancet|date=13 Aug 2011|volume=378|issue=9791|pages=607–20|pmid=21620466|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62307-0|pmc=3062508}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may also include CT.&lt;ref name="Stoita"/&gt;

=== Oral cancer===

The [[US Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) in 2013 found that evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for [[oral cancer]] in adults without symptoms by primary care providers.&lt;ref name=US2013Oral&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Oral Cancer: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/oral-cancer-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate=23 November 2017|language=en|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] comes to similar conclusions while the [[American Cancer Society]] recommends that adults over 20 years who have periodic health examinations should have the oral cavity examined for cancer.&lt;ref name=US2013Oral/&gt; The [[American Dental Association]] recommends that providers remain alert for signs of cancer during routine examinations.&lt;ref name=US2013Oral/&gt; Oral cancer screening is also recommended by some groups of dental hygienists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Cancer Screening|url=http://www.crdha.ca/the-profession/professional-resources/working-with-clients/oral-cancer-screening.aspx|website=www.crdha.ca|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cancers===
There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for [[skin cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsskca.htm |title=Screening for Skin Cancer |year=2009 |publisher= [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[bladder cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsblad.htm |title=Screening for Bladder Cancer |date= August 2011 |publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Routine screening is not recommended for [[testicular cancer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspstest.htm |title=Screening for Testicular Cancer |date= April 2011 |publisher= [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ovarian cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsovar.htm |title=Screening for Ovarian Cancer |date= September 2012 |publisher= [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Whole body imaging===
Full body [[CT scans]] are available for cancer screening, but this type of [[medical imaging]] to search for cancer in people without clear symptoms can create problems such as increased exposure to [[ionizing radiation]]. However, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans are not associated with a radiation risk, and MRI scans are being evaluated for their use in cancer screening.&lt;ref name=MRI&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lauenstein |first1= TC |last2= Semelka |first2= RC |date= September 2006 | title = Emerging techniques: Whole-body screening and staging with MRI. | journal = Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–98 | pmid = 16888774 | doi = 10.1002/jmri.20666}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant risk of detection of what has been called ''[[incidentaloma]]s'' - benign lesions that may be interpreted as a cancer and be subjected to potentially dangerous investigations.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Cinnamyl acetate''' (3-phenylprop-2-enyl acetate) is a chemical compound of the cinnamyl ester family, in which the variable R group is substituted by a [[methyl group]]. As a result of the non-aromatic carbon-carbon double bond, cinnamyl acetate can exist in a [[E-Z notation|''Z'' and an ''E'' configuration]]:&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegoodscentscompany.com/data/rw1003372.html|title=cinnamyl acetate, 103-54-8|last=Luebke|first=William|date=2018-01-31|website=www.thegoodscentscompany.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinnamyl acetate naturally occurs in fresh bark of [[cinnamon]] (''Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume'' and other Cinnamomum species), with concentrations of 2,800–51,000 ppm.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong H, Secundo F, Xue C, Mao X | title = Whole-Cell Biocatalytic Synthesis of Cinnamyl Acetate with a Novel Esterase from the DNA Library of Acinetobacter hemolyticus | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 65 | issue = 10 | pages = 2120–2128 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28220703 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Cinnamyl acetate is used as a flavour ester in for example bread and animal feed and has a sweet floral-fruity fragrance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health Hazard Evaluation Report|last=McConnell|first=Rob|publisher=INTERNATIONAL BAKERS SERVICES, INC.|year=1986|location=SOUTH BEND, INDIANA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geng|first=Bo | name-list-format = vanc |date=August 2012|title=Cinnamyl acetate synthesis by lipase-catalyzed transesterification in a solvent-free system| doi = 10.1002/bab.1023 |journal=Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry|volume=59|pages=270-275}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, it is used in several cosmetics, some toiletries but also in non-cosmetic products, for example detergents.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;
  

== Legislation and control ==
Cinnamyl acetate, used in fragrances and as flavour ingredient, has been discussed by several institutions. In 1965, the compound was annotated as 'Generally Recognized as Safe as a flavor ingredient’ by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers" Association ([[Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association|FEMA]]). The association determined the average maximum use levels in several products that were considered to be safe:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=III.

The [[European Parliament]] registered cinnamyl acetate as both a flavouring substance and a cosmetic compound in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;COMMISSION DECISION of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;COMMISSION DECISION of 8 May 1996 establishing an inventory and a common nomenclature of ingredients employed in cosmetic products&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]/[[World Health Organization|WHO]]) Expert Committee on Food Additives ([[Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives|JECFA]]) described in 2000 that “the substance does not present a safety concern at current levels of intake when used as a flavouring agent”.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In 2009, the [[European Food Safety Authority|EFSA]] Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzyme, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) concluded that cinnamyl acetate does not give rise to safety concerns when used as flavour ingredient in food.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rychen|first=Guido|date=2017|title=Safety and efficacy of aryl-substituted primary alcohol, aldehyde, acid, ester and acetal derivatives belonging to chemical group 22 when used as flavourings for all animal species|doi = 10.2903/j.efsa.2017.4672 |journal=EFSA Journal|volume=15|pages=4672-4692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cinnamyl acetate is also permitted by the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food &amp; Drug administration]] for use as flavouring agent in food if the minimum quantity needed for its effect is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=172.515|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production and intake ==
Estimates of the average annual production and daily intake of cinnamyl acetate as flavouring agent are reported by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]]. According to this report, the annual volume of production in Europe is 1498 kg, and in the USA 2255 kg. The daily intake per person in Europe is estimated to be 210 μg, and in the USA 300 μg. Per kg body weight the daily intake is estimated for Europeans to be 4 μg/kg and for Americans to be 5 μg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v46je07.htm|title=CINNAMYL ALCOHOL AND RELATED SUBSTANCES|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Since cinnamyl acetate is naturally occurring in plants, it can be extracted and purified to obtain the compound. However, this has a low yield and therefore the production costs are high. The use of chemical methods can offer more efficient strategies to produce cinnamyl acetate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are multiple ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate '''2'''. One way is the synthesis from [[cinnamyl alcohol]] '''1''' and [[vinyl acetate]]. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme [[Triacylglycerol_lipase|triacylglycerol ester hydrolase]], which is a [[lipase]] that is very specific towards the ester bond. The byproduct of this reaction is [[acetaldehyde]]. The reaction equation for this reaction is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cai|first=Xianghai|last2=Wang|first2=Wei|last3=Lin|first3=Lin|last4=He|first4=Dannong|last5=Shen|first5=Yaling|last6=Wei|first6=Wei|last7=Wei|first7=Dong-zhi | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017-04-01|title=Cinnamyl Esters Synthesis By Lipase-Catalyzed Transesterification in a Non-Aqueous System |journal=Catalysis Letters|volume=147|issue=4|pages=946–952|doi=10.1007/s10562-017-1994-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: [[File:(E)-Cinnamyl acetate Bio Synthesis C V1.svg|490x490px]]

Since acetaldehyde has an unfavourable deactivating effect on the lipase used in the synthesis, [[ethyl acetate]] can be used as reactant instead of vinyl acetate. In this [[transesterification]] reaction cinnamyl alcohol '''1''' reacts with ethyl acetate to form cinnamyl acetate '''2''' and [[ethanol]]. This synthesis requires the lipase Novozym 435, and is performed in a solvent-free system. The reaction is as follows:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

:: [[File:(E)-Cinnamyl acetate Bio Synthesis B V1.svg|490x490px]]

Cinnamyl acetate '''2''' can also be synthesized via a non-enzymatic reaction. An example of such a reaction is one with the use of cinnamyl bromide '''3''' and [[sodium acetate]] as reactants. Since these compounds are immiscible substrates, solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis (PTC) can be used, using quaternary ammonium bromide as a [[Phase-transfer catalyst|phase transfer catalyst]]. This is shown in the following reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-07-25|title=Synthesis of cinnamyl acetate by solid–liquid phase transfer catalysis: Kinetic study with a batch reactor |journal=Catalysis Communications|volume=10|issue=13|pages=1638–1642|doi=10.1016/j.catcom.2009.04.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:: [[File:(E)-Cinnamyl acetate PTC Synthesis V1.svg|490x490px]]

Besides these three examples, there are many more ways to synthesize cinnamyl acetate.

The [[addition reaction]] of [[dinitrogen trioxide]] to cinnamyl acetate produces an intermediate in the synthesis of [[chloramphenicol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurihara|first=Yoshie|last2=Yamagishi|first2=Kazuo | name-list-format = vanc |date=1965-08-01|title=The Addition Reaction of Dinitrogen Trioxide with Cinnamyl Acetate 7|journal=Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1327–1330|doi=10.1246/bcsj.38.1327 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metabolism ==
Cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl derivatives. In general, these cinnamyl derivatives are absorbed from the gut very quickly, after which they are metabolized and excreted as polar metabolites in the urine or feces within 24 hours.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickers D, Calow P, Greim H, Hanifin JM, Rogers AE, Saurat JH, Sipes IG, Smith RL, Tagami H | title = A toxicologic and dermatologic assessment of cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid when used as fragrance ingredients | journal = Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 799–836 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15811570 | doi = 10.1016/j.fct.2004.09.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the cinnamyl derivatives, cinnamyl acetate belongs to the group of cinnamyl esters. After absorption from the gut, this group of compounds is first [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to cinnamyl alcohol by [[Carboxylesterase|carboxylesterases]]. Carboxylesterases are a group of enzymes. The most important enzymes within this group are the A-esterases. These are present in most body tissues, but they are prevalent in the [[Hepatocyte|hepatocytes]]. Subsequently, the [[cinnamyl alcohol]] is [[oxidized]] which leads to the formation of [[cinnamaldehyde]]. This reaction is catalyzed by human [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-dependent [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. Now, there are two routes for the further [[biotransformation]] of cinnamaldehyde. The minor route of biotransformation is the [[S-Glutathionylation|S-glutathionylation]]. The major route, however, is the conversion of cinnamaldehyde into [[cinnamic acid]] by the enzyme [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]]. Next, the cinnamic acid is transformed into [[Cinnamoyl-CoA|cinnamoyl CoA]] which is again converted to either cinnamoylglycine by N-acyl transferase or to [[Benzoyl-CoA|benzoyl CoA]] through [[Beta oxidation|β-oxidation]], the latter being the major route. Intermediate metabolites in the β-oxidation pathway can be converted to 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionic acid and [[acetophenone]], which can be excreted via the urine. However, the conversions of these intermediate metabolites are minor routes. Finally, the benzoyl CoA is conjugated with [[glycine]] under formation of [[hippuric acid]] or it is hydrolyzed generating free [[benzoic acid]]. This can be excreted via the urine directly or after [[glucuronidation]]. Hippuric acid, which is the major metabolite, is also excreted via the urine.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

::[[File:Biotransformation cinnamyl esters.png|1000x1000px|center|The biotransformation of cinnamyl esters.|thumb]]

== Toxicity ==
Since cinnamyl acetate is used as both a fragrance material and a food flavouring ingredient, dermal and oral exposure are considered to be the major routes of absorption. The dermal systematic exposure of cinnamyl acetate via cosmetic products is estimated to be 0.0115 mg/kg body weight/day.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

Several experiments using animals were conducted in the past to assess the toxicity of cinnamyl acetate. In one experiment, the oral toxicity was tested in rats. The rats received oral doses of cinnamyl acetate and the [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] was found to be 3.3 g/kg. During the experiment, symptoms as slow respiration and coarse tremors were observed for high doses.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Other experiments showed LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 4.750 g/kg for oral administration in mice and guinea pigs. Also, the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value for [[intraperitoneal administration]] was investigated and found to be 1.200 g/kg.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccinfoweb2.ccohs.ca/rtecs/records/GE2275000.html|title=RTECS Number GE2275000|website=ccinfoweb2.ccohs.ca|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, studies on the dermal toxicity were performed. Experiments on rabbits resulted in an LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of more than 5.0 g/kg, but no clinical effects were observed. Moreover, the level of skin irritation in swines was tested via a [[Patch test|48-h patch test]]. In this study, 0.05 g of cinnamyl acetate was applied and no irritation was observed. Another two experiments examined the skin irritation caused by 0.1 mL cinnamyl acetate on guinea pigs and rabbits via a direct application on the skin (open application). Mild to moderate irritation was observed in these experiments.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

A [[No-observed-adverse-effect level|NOAEL]] for oral administration of 275 mg/kg body weight/day was determined from toxicological data by the [[European Food Safety Authority|EFSA]] Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Besides these experiments on animals, some human studies were executed. A 48-h closed patch test on five healthy, male volunteers was performed using 5% cinnamyl acetate in [[petrolatum]]. In this study, no irritation was observed. Mild irritation was observed in another 48-h patch test on fifty male volunteers using 32% cinnamyl acetate in [[acetone]]. Finally, a human study on skin sensitization was executed on 25 healthy, male volunteers. In this experiment a maximization test (48-h patch) was done using 5% cinnamyl acetate in petrolatum. Skin sensitization reactions were not observed.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

Moreover, [[Draize test|standard Draize tests]] were used to assess the dermal toxicity in humans, guinea pigs and rabbits. This resulted in mild skin irritation for doses of 16 mg per 48 hours for humans and for doses of 100 mg per 24 hours for guinea pigs. Moderate skin irritation was observed for rabbits exposed to doses of 100 mg per 24 hours.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Lastly, the potential of cinnamyl acetate to cause [[Sister chromatid exchange|sister chromatid exchanges]] was tested using [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells]]. This was done because it was found that another component of plant essence and cinnamyl derivative, [[cinnamaldehyde]], increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges induced by [[mitomycin C]]. However, the result of this test proved that cinnamyl acetate does not cause sister chromatid exchange due to the absence of an alpha-beta unsaturated [[carbonyl group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1989-06-01|title=Modifying effects of components of plant essence of the induction of sister-chromatid exchanges in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells |journal=Mutation Research Letters|volume=226|issue=2|pages=103–110|doi=10.1016/0165-7992(89)90051-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on animals ==
Cinnamyl acetate is found in the leaf oils of the ''[[Cinnamomum osmophloeum]]'' tree, which grows in central and northern Taiwan. It is found that these oils have antibacterial, antimildew, antitermite, antimite, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, the oils show mosquito larvicidal activity against ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' and ''[[Aedes albopictus]]'' larvae. However, cinnamyl acetate serves only a minor role in these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheng SS, Liu JY, Huang CG, Hsui YR, Chen WJ, Chang ST | title = Insecticidal activities of leaf essential oils from Cinnamomum osmophloeum against three mosquito species | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 457–64 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18396039 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2001-09-01|title=Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=77|issue=1|pages=123–127|doi=10.1016/S0378-8741(01)00273-2|issn=0378-8741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Shang-Tzen|last2=Cheng|first2=Sen-Sung | name-list-format = vanc |title=Antitermitic Activity of Leaf Essential Oils and Components from Cinnamomum osmophleum |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1389–1392|doi=10.1021/jf010944n}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yu-Tang|first=Tung | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|title=Anti-inflammatory activities of essential oils and their constituents from different provenances of indigenous cinnamon (Cinnamomum osmophloeum) leaves| doi = 10.3109/13880200903527728 |journal=Pharmaceutical Biology|volume=48|pages=1130-1136|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, cinnamyl acetate has a repellent effect on ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]'', and is therefore useful to protect against these insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deletre E, Chandre F, Williams L, Duménil C, Menut C, Martin T | title = Electrophysiological and behavioral characterization of bioactive compounds of the Thymus vulgaris, Cymbopogon winterianus, Cuminum cyminum and Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oils against Anopheles gambiae and prospects for their use as bednet treatments | journal = Parasites &amp; Vectors | volume = 8 | pages = 316 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26063119 | pmc = 4470088 | doi = 10.1186/s13071-015-0934-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Constitution Party''' (''Konstitutsioonierakond''), known until 11 February 2006 as the '''Estonian United People's Party''' (''Eestimaa Ühendatud Rahvapartei''), was a [[political party]] in [[Estonia]], mainly supported by the [[Russians|Russian]] minority.
The party held 6 seats in the [[Riigikogu]] from 1999 to 2003. At the [[legislative]] [[elections in Estonia|elections]] of 2 March 2003, it won 2.2% of the popular vote and got no seats. In [[Estonian parliamentary election, 2007|2007's election]], it fell further to 5,470 votes (1.0%) and again got no seats, despite an active promotion campaign by Russian
special services.&lt;ref name='epl-kapo-yb2008'&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] 20 June 2008: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/433236 Kaitsepolitsei aastaraamat: Vene luure tegi mullu Eestis usinalt tööd] by [[Kärt Anvelt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2008, it merged with the [[Estonian Left Party]] to form the [[Estonian United Left Party]].

== Controversy ==

According to the [[Estonian Internal Security Service]] the Constitution Party was a puppet-party supported and controlled by [[Russia]], created by the [[Russian Foreign Intelligence Service]] (SVR) as part of their campaign of "[[Russian influence operations in Estonia|political intelligence manipulations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Annual Review 2007 |publisher=[[Estonian Security Police]] |chapter=Counterintelligence |year=2008 |location=Tallinn |page=8 |url=http://www.kapo.ee/cms-data/_text/138/124/files/aastaraamat-2007-eng.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415031941/http://www.kapo.ee/cms-data/_text/138/124/files/aastaraamat-2007-eng.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also several members of the party have connections with groups such as [[Nochnoy Dozor (pressure group)|Nochnoy Dozor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapo.ee/yearbook_2007_ENG.swf KAPO Yearbook 2007]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Yearly report of KAPO&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It came into force in July 2015.

==Provisions==
{{empty section|date=August 2016}}

===Part 1 Temporary restrictions on travel===

===Part 2 Terrorism prevention and investigation measures===

===Part 3 Data retention===

===Part 4 Aviation, shipping and rail===

===Part 5 Risk of being drawn into terrorism===

===Part 6 Amendments of or relating to the Terrorism Act 2000===

===Part 7 Miscellaneous and general===

==Drafting==
The Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill was proposed by [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] in November 2014. The press reported it would require [[Internet service providers]] to retain data showing which IP address was allocated to a device at a given time.&lt;ref name="BBC-2014-11-23"&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet data plan back on political agenda|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30166477|accessdate=23 November 2014|publisher=BBC|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, companies providing internet services were not required to keep records of extra data that can show which individuals have used a particular IP address at a given time, even though this information exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theresa May announces new powers to tackle internet jihadists|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11248225/Theresa-May-announces-new-powers-to-tackle-internet-jihadists.html|accessdate=23 November 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Justification ===
The Home Secretary said the new bill would help security services "deal with the increased threat that we now see". She said "This is a step but it doesn't go all the way to ensuring that we can identify all the people we will need to". To "fully identify" everybody, she said police would need the power to access communication data, as previously proposed in the [[Draft Communications Data Bill]].&lt;ref name="BBC-2014-11-23" /&gt;

==Effects==
In December 2015, under a remit of the act which places local authorities, prisons, NHS trusts and schools under a statutory duty to prevent extremist radicalisation taking place within their walls, teachers reported a 10-year-old boy to the police after he had misspelled the word "[[Terraced house|terraced]]" and written "I live in a terrorist house". He was subsequently interviewed by police and social services and had his home searched.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Malkin, "I live in a 'terrorist house': police speak to Muslim boy, 10, over spelling error", The Guardian, 20 January 2016 [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/20/i-live-in-a-terrorist-house-police-speak-to-muslim-boy-10-over-spelling-error]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2016, [[Ken Macdonald]] warned that the "prevent" aspect of the law risked a "[[chilling effect]]" on academic debate and a "deadening impact" on research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Anti-terror laws risk 'chilling effect' on academic debate – Oxford college head|url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/07/anti-terror-laws-academic-debate-oxford-college-ken-macdonald-prevent-strategy-university|newspaper = theguardian.com|date = 7 February 2016|access-date = 8 February 2016|issn = |language = |first = Richard|last = Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''decentralized application''' ('''Dapp''', '''dApp''' or '''DApp''') is an [[application software|application]] run by many users on a [[distributed computing|decentralized network]] with trustless [[cryptographic protocols|protocols]]. They are designed to avoid any single point of failure.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} They typically have tokens to reward users for providing computing power.{{r|coinwhat}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=non-RS, two-person blog|certain=y|date=October 2018}}

==Definition==
The definition of a decentralized application is still in development and under debate.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The term originates from the Decentralized Application Corporation and [[decentralized autonomous organization]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/953971624|title=Decentralized applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain technology|last=Siraj|first=Raval|publisher=O'Reilly Media|year=2016|isbn=9781491924525|edition= First|location=Sebastopol, CA|pages=|oclc=953971624}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|sr|p1=1-8}}

Typical definitions include the following attributes:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{r|sr|p4=1-8}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/DavidJohnstonCEO/DecentralizedApplication|title=The General Theory of Decentralized Applications, Dapps|last=Johnston|first=David|last2=Yilmaz|first2=Sam Onat|date=2 February 2015|website=GitHub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 November 2018|last3=Kandah|first3=Jeremy|last4=Bentenitis|first4=Nikos|last5=Hashemi|first5=Farzad|last6=Gross|first6=Ron|last7=Wilkinson|first7=Shawn|last8=Mason|first8=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blockchainhub"&gt;{{cite web |title=Decentralized Applications – dApps |url=https://blockchainhub.net/decentralized-applications-dapps/ |website=Blockchain Hub |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruth |first1=Angela |title=Why Build Decentralized Applications: Understanding Dapp |url=https://due.com/blog/why-build-decentralized-applications-understanding-dapp/ |website=Due |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Demchenko |first1=Lidiia |title=Why People Choose Dapps over Apps? |url=https://www.dapp.com/article/why-people-choose-dapps-over-apps |website=Dapp |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The code is [[open-source]] and autonomously managed
* Records and data are stored using [[blockchain]], providing trustless interaction and avoiding any single point of failure
* Use [[cryptographic token]]s as a medium of exchange, to reward users validating transactions or providing services on the network, etc.
* Tokens generated through a [[cryptographic algorithm]]

There are three types of decentralized applications:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ruth"/&gt;
* Type I decentralized applications that have their own block chain, such as [[Bitcoin]].
* Type II decentralized applications that use the blockchain of a type I but are protocols and have tokens that are necessary for their function like the Bitcoin Omni Layer.
* Type III decentralized applications that use the protocol of a type II and are additionally protocols that have tokens necessary for their function, such as the SAFE Network that uses the Omni Protocol to issue safecoins.

==Deployment==
Decentralized applications may run on top of other cryptographic systems such as [[Ethereum]].{{r|coinwhat}} in December 2017, the popular game [[CryptoKitties]] slowed the Ethereum network and exposed the vulnerability of public blockchains to traffic slowdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/cryptokitties-quickly-becomes-most-widely-used-ethereum-app |title=CryptoKitties Mania Overwhelms Ethereum Network's Processing |last= Kharif |first=Olga  |date=2017-12-05 |work=Bloomberg |access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decentralized applications use [[Smart contract|Smart Contracts]] to connect to a blockchain, where the backend of the Dapp runs on a decentralized [[P2P network]].&lt;ref name="blockchainhub"/&gt;

== Examples ==
&lt;!-- Examples should be notable, ie. with a Wikipedia entry --&gt;
* [[Augur (software)|Augur]] - prediction market
* [[Basic Attention Token]] - digital advertising network
* [[Cryptokitties]] -  [[Blockchain game|blockchain based virtual game]]

==History==
The Department of Agriculture was created at one of the first meetings of [[First Dáil|Dáil Éireann]] in 1919 with [[Robert Barton]] as the first Minister for Agriculture, [[Horace Plunkett]] as the department's first Vice-President, and [[T. P. Gill]] as its first Secretary. In 1899, Plunkett had established the Department's forerunner, called the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction (DATI).

Since Britain is Ireland's main trading partner, [[Brexit]] will have a huge impact on Ireland's Agri-food sector. Britain was the market for 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef export. The tariff rates will "virtually wipe out" agri-food trade to BrRitain, according to the [[Irish Farmers' Association]] president Joe Healy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/brexit-could-have-frightening-impact-on-irish-agri-food-sector-1.3088174|title=Brexit could have 'frightening' impact on Irish agri-food sector|work=[[The Irish Times]]|author=Elaine Edwards|date=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DAWN Canada/Réseau d'action des femmes handicapées du Canada ''' is a Canadian national [[feminist]] network controlled by and composed of women who self-identify as women with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Doucette, Joanne 1991, p221"&gt;Doucette, Joanne. ''The DisAbled Women's Network: A Fragile Success'', in ''Women and Social Change: Feminist Activism in Canada'', eds: Wine &amp; Ristock, James Lorimer &amp; co. 1991, {{ISBN|1-55028-356-1}}, p221&lt;/ref&gt; The network also supports local and provincial chapters.&lt;ref name="Doucette, Joanne 1991, p221"/&gt; DAWN is a member organization of the [[National Action Committee on the Status of Women]], Canada's largest feminist organization.

==History==
The organization began on June 20–23, 1985, at a meeting between seventeen women from across Canada who came together to discuss issues of interest to women with various disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, Jacqueline. ''Report: Women with Disabilities'', in [http://www.dawncanada.net/ENG/ENGnational.htm DAWN Canada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723175655/http://www.dawncanada.net/ENG/ENGnational.htm |date=July 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of this initial meeting was to plan a larger national gathering of disabled women who would then develop the organization's strategies and goals.&lt;ref name="Doucette, Joanne 1991, p221"/&gt; Early groups formed in [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Toronto]], [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[British Columbia]], and [[Montreal]] and in [[Winnipeg]], that city's existing group for women with disabilities, the [[Consulting Committee on the Status of Women with Disabilities]] also joined the network.&lt;ref&gt;Doucette, Joanne.

==Mission==
DAWN Canada's mission is "to end the poverty, isolation, discrimination and violence experienced by women with disabilities, and to fight for women with disabilities to have freedom of choice in all aspects of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawncanada.net/ENG/ENGmission.htm DAWN Mission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629191457/http://www.dawncanada.net/ENG/ENGmission.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Land Information Service''' provides direct access to official land registers in Europe. '''EULIS''' is owned by a consortium of member countries with expertise in the area of [[land registration]], most of which are [[Public ownership|government organisations]]. EULIS was an initiative led by the official bodies for land registration in European countries.

== History ==
===The EULIS project 2001-2004===

Between 2001 and 2004 eight different European land information organisations and one university cooperated in developing a demonstrator e-platform for subscribed users of land registries with support and additional funding from the [[European Commission]].
In addition the team worked hard to produce online reference information from each participating country.

===The EULIS programme 2004-2007===

The long term aim was to help encourage cross-border lending on the Integration of EU Mortgage Credit Markets. The three-year programme developed the demonstrator into a live service that was officially launched as a live service on 22 November 2006.

===The EULIS portal 2007-2017===

The EULIS portal was in the air until May 2017. At that moment in time it was decided by the members to close the portal. Main reason for the closure was the fact that EU-Commission was building a replacing portal under the Land Registers Interconnection Programme. In 2018 the EULIS organization was abolished. 

=== European supporters ===
EULIS is a concept supported by various organisations in the European community. EULIS enjoys active discussion and cooperation with many of these organisations including the [[European Commission]], [[European Mortgage Federation]], [[European Land Registry Association]], [[Eurogeographics]], and the [[European Business Register]].

==EULIS tools==

The EULIS glossary and reference information assist better understanding of the local environment, not only literally but also the meaning of terminology.

In [[Anglo-Saxon law]], an '''exclusive right''', or '''exclusivity''', is a de facto, non-tangible [[prerogative]] existing in law (that is, the [[power (sociology)|power]] or, in a wider sense, [[right]]) to perform an action or acquire a benefit and to permit or deny others the right to perform the same action or to acquire the same benefit. A "prerogative" is in effect an exclusive right. The term is restricted for use for official state or sovereign (i.e., constitutional) powers. Exclusive rights are a form of [[monopoly]].

Exclusive rights can be established by law or by contractual obligation, but the scope of enforceability will depend upon the extent to which others are bound by the instrument establishing the exclusive right; thus in the case of contractual rights, only persons that are parties to a contract will be affected by the exclusivity.

Exclusive rights may be granted in [[property law]], [[copyright law]], [[patent law]],  in relation to [[public utility|public utilities]], or, in some jurisdictions, in other ''[[sui generis]]'' legislation. Many scholars argue that such rights form the basis for the concepts of [[property (ownership right)|property]] and [[ownership]].

Privately granted rights, created by [[contract]], may occasionally appear very similar to exclusive rights, but are only enforceable against the grantee, and not the world at large.

==Types of exclusive rights==

===Property===

In relation to [[property]], an exclusive right will, for the most part, arise when something tangible is acquired; as a result, others are prevented from exercising control of that thing. For example, a person may prohibit others from entering and using their [[real property|land]], or from taking their [[personal property|personal possessions]]. However, an exclusive right is not necessarily absolute, as an [[easement]] may allow a certain level of public access to [[private land]].

===Intellectual property===

Most [[government]]s recognize a [[Bundle of Rights|bundle of exclusive rights]] in relation to works of authorship, inventions, and identifications of origin. These rights are sometimes spoken of under the [[umbrella term]] "[[intellectual property]]."

==History and arguments==

In Anglo-Saxon property law, exclusive rights have often been the codification of pre-existing [[Norm (sociology)|social norm]]s with regard to land or [[Personal property|chattel]]s.

In [[continental Europe]] there is a view that copyrights, patents, and the like are the codification of some kind of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]], [[natural right]], or [[personamility rights|personalitlly right]]. However, such arguments can only be consistently justified through [[instrumentalism]] or [[consequentialism]], as exemplified by the reasoning inferred in [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] that copyrights and patents exist solely "To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts."

'''Franz Eher Nachfolger GmbH''' ("Franz Eher and Successors, LLC", usually referred to as the '''Eher-Verlag''' "Eher Publishing") was the central publishing house of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] and one of the largest book and periodical firms during the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Frei/Johannes Schmitz: ''Journalismus im Dritten Reich''. 3. Aufl., C.H. Beck: München 1999, {{ISBN|3-406-45516-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter de Mendelssohn: ''Zeitungsstadt Berlin: Menschen und Mächte in der Geschichte der deutschen Presse Berlin''. Ullstein, 1959, 2., überarb. u. erw. Aufl., Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Wien: Ullstein: 1982, {{ISBN|3-550-07496-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Tavernaro: ''Der Verlag Hitlers und der NSDAP. Die Franz Eher Nachfolger GmbH''. Edition Praesens: Wien 2004, {{ISBN|3-7069-0220-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by the party on 17 December 1920 for 115,000 [[German papiermark|Papiermark]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/index.php5?title=Franz_Eher_Nachf._Verlag_(Zentralverlag_der_NSDAP)&amp;oldid=58003 Paul Hoser. Franz Eher Nachf. Verlag (Zentralverlag der NSDAP) in Historisches Lexikon Bayerns (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the major papers, the'' [[Völkischer Beobachter]]'' and the ''[[Illustrierter Beobachter]]'', the publishers also printed novels, maps, song books, and calendars. [[Adolf Hitler]]'s ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was also published by the firm from 1925 through many editions and millions of copies.

==History==
The publishing house was registered by [[Franz Xaver Josef Eher]] (1851-1918) in the [[Munich]] [[German Trade Register|Handelsregister]] on 2 December 1901. However, the firm was actually founded with the name ''Münchener Beobachter'' on 2 January 1887. After Eher's death, [[Rudolf von Sebottendorf]] took over the firm in 1918 and on 30 September 1919 transformed it into a [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|limited liability company]] in order to avoid possible bankruptcy.

The headquarters were in [[Munich]] (Thierschstraße 11-17), and from 1933, the entire party literature was printed and published by Eher-Verlag. Later branches in Berlin, Vienna, and additional branches in Munich were established. Between 1933 and 1943, [[Rolf Rienhard]] was chief administrator. He was relieved by Wilhelm Baur, who remained until the end of the war.

The key figure leading the publishing house's expansion, however, was [[Max Amann]], who took over the firm in the 1930s.  He also doubled as Reich Press Leader and president of the Reich Press Chamber.  In addition to the Eher-Verlag, he controlled nearly the entire economic function of the press in Germany.  Often, Amann (in his government role) expropriated rival papers whose publishers were not willing to do the government's bidding.  He then had the Eher-Verlag buy them for a pittance, usually in auctions in which the Eher-Verlag was the sole bidder.  During the 1930s the Nazi Party purchased parts of the [[Alfred Hugenberg]] concerns and a number of other publishing houses.  By the 1940s, these tactics turned the Eher Verlag into one of the largest newspaper chains in the world.

In 1945, the publisher was banned and dismantled. The firm's buildings and intellectual property (including ''Mein Kampf'') were transferred to the state of [[Bavaria]].

==Notable books==
*Adolf Hitler. ''Mein Kampf'' (published 1925).
*[[Alfred-Ingemar Berndt]]. ''[[Tanks Break Through!]] A German Soldier's Account of War in the Low Countries and France'', 1940.
*[[Leo Leixner]]. ''[[From Lemberg to Bordeaux]] A German War Correspondent’s Account of Battle in Poland, the Low Countries and France, 1939-40'' (published 1941).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6885">The '''GI Rights Network''' is coalition of nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations that provide free and confidential information to [[United States military]] servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Most of the work of the Network is done through the GI Rights Hotline, but the Network also provides email counseling and live in-person counseling in some locales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girightshotline.org/about/index.shtml GIRightshotline.org, "About the Network"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Network also maintains a website with easy access to information about discharges, military regulations, GI rights, and other organizations; all information is available in both English and Spanish.

==GI Rights Hotline==

The Network provides non-directive [[counseling]] to callers, with a particular focus on discharges and filing grievances. Counselors do not provide legal advice, but can assist callers in finding lawyers in their area who can give them appropriate advice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girightshotline.org/about/index.shtml GIRightshotline.org, "About the Network"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls to the official national Hotline number 877-447-4487 are routed to different "nodes" of the network based on the area code of the caller.  Hotline counselors come from a variety of backgrounds and include [[veterans]], mental health workers and attorneys, but most counselors are not attorneys and do not provide legal advice.

==History==

The Network began in 1994 as a coalition of several organizations committed to peace and non-violence activism. The [[Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors]] served as the agent for the coalition for several years by managing the coalition's website, administering the national toll free phone number, and providing funding for a national coordinator for the Network.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In the fall of 2006, the Network members selected an "Advisory Council" to move the Network from an unincorporated association to a democratically operated corporation.  The Network was incorporated in California in 2008.  The Network member organizations adopted bylaws and elected a board of directors in 2009.

==In the news==

In Harper's Magazine March 2005 Kathy Dobie's cover story "AWOL in America" cites the GI Rights Network as "a national referral and counseling service for military personnel," and uses its counselors as sources for the story.  "On August 23, 2004, I interviewed Robert Dove, a burly, bearded Quaker, in the Boston offices of the American Friends Service Committee, one of the groups involved with the hot line. Dove told me of getting frantic calls from the parents of recruits, and of recruits who are so appalled by basic training that they "can't eat, they literally vomit every time they put a spoon to their mouths, they're having nightmares and wetting their beds."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In a Chicago Public Radio Interview "Going AWOL – A Hotline that Helps GIs Consider Their Options," (12-12-06) GI Rights counselor, Steve Woolford, explains the reasons why many servicemen and women go AWOL from military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbez.org/content.aspx?audioID=661]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her second place Hearst Journalism Award Winning features piece "Sincere Disapproval"&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearstfdn.org/hearst_journalism/competitions.php?type=Writing&amp;year=2007&amp;id=2]&lt;/ref&gt; author Leah Lohse references the GI Rights Network for its expertise in dealing with conscientious objection.  The story gives a view into the beliefs and struggles of one particular conscientious objector.

A USA Today story on 4/1/2009, "Army investigating unfit soldiers sent to war," cited The GI Rights Hotline for assisting servicemembers who were being deployed with disabilities and other medical problems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-03-31-army-inquiry_N.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Army Sgt. Jesse] Raymo said he and others had exhausted their efforts to complain to supervisors and felt their only recourse was working with the GI Rights Hotline to draft a petition outlining their claims of mistreatment to send to members of Congress. He said more than 200 signatures have been gathered, most of them from civilians, and another petition signing event is being planned.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Gas Exporting Countries Forum''' ('''GECF''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] of 11 of the world's leading [[natural gas]] producers made up of [[Algeria]], [[Bolivia]], [[Egypt]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Iran]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Qatar]], [[Russia]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Venezuela]]. GECF members together control over 70% of the world's natural gas reserves, 38% of the pipeline trade and 85% of the [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) production.&lt;ref name="forbes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/10/natural-gas-exporting-trade-opinions-contributors-marcel-dietsch.html?sp=true |title=The Next Global Energy Cartel |author=Marcel Dietsch |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three largest reserve-holders in the GECF{{spaced ndash}}[[Russia]], [[Iran]] and [[Qatar]]{{spaced ndash}}together hold about 57% of global gas reserves.&lt;ref name="forbes2"/&gt;

The GECF was established in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], in 2001. Until the seventh ministerial meeting in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], it operated without charter and fixed membership structure.

Holding the GECF's summit was decided at the 10th ministerial meeting in Oran in 2010. The first GECF's summit was held in Doha on 15 November 2011, under patronage of [[Emir]] [[Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]], following the thirteenth ministerial meeting held at the same place on 13 November 2011.&lt;ref name=gulf151111&gt;

== Gas OPEC ==

Since the establishment of the GECF in 2001 there has always been speculation that some of the world's largest producers of natural gas, in particular Russia and Iran, intend to create a gas cartel equivalent to [[OPEC]] which would set quotas and prices. The idea of a gas OPEC was first floated by then Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and backed by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbaev]] in 2002. In May 2006 [[Gazprom]] deputy chairman [[Alexander Medvedev]] threatened that Russia would create "an alliance of gas suppliers that will be more influential than OPEC" if Russia did not get its way in energy negotiations with Europe.&lt;ref name=rferl&gt;

==Initiatives==
[[File:Coachella-TRASHed.png|thumb|right|Coachella featured Global Inheritance's TRASHed :: Art of Recycling campaign in which artists from across the nation designed recycling bins for some friendly competition and a love of art.]]
Global Inheritance promotes environmental education, sustainability, and social action through a variety of projects, each catered to the specific audience. Below are some of the group's most well-known initiatives.
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:binwithdeer.png|right|One of the many redesigned recycling bins artists create in partnership with Global Inheritance]] --&gt;

===TRASHed :: Art of Recycling===
This program bridges art and environmental responsibility to bring new attention to the practice of recycling. Artists redesign empty recycling bins in order to inspire event goers to not only recycle, but to also take ownership in the larger concept of activism. The redesigned bins create eye-catching works that Global Inheritance brings to events across the country, such as Coachella, which has supported the program since 2004. The festival has showcased over a thousand recycling bins over the last eight years, each one an original piece created by artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coachella.com/updates/news |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213011312/http://www.coachella.com/updates/news |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past artists have included Hunter S. Thompson, Blink-182 and Fugazi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/74696088@N00/collections/72157624350635738/ Collection: TRASHed :: Art Of Recycling&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, Global Inheritance donates the decorated bins to local schools, enabling their message to reach an even wider audience and inspire the next generation of activists.

===TRASHed :: Recycling Store===
The TRASHed :: Recycling Store is another program that has been very successful in reducing the environmental footprints of major events, such as Warped Tour, X Games, Virgin Music Festival, Stagecoach Festival, Outside Lands Festival, Coachella (under the title, 10 for 1 Bottle Exchange), Ultra Festival, Treasure Island and more. Founded in 2003, the TRASHed :: Recycling Store has inspired other festivals around the globe including Bonnaroo  and Lollapalooza to create incentive based recycling programs. The store awards points for rogue bottles, cans and biodegradable cups that individuals collect in order to encourage people to keep the grounds clean. These points can be exchanged for prizes that range from Loomstate jeans and backstage passes to skateboard decks and autographed memorabilia, depending on the interests of the venue.

===Energy FACTory===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:djdjcoachella.png|right|Energy FACTory DJ Mixer Stage at Coachella]] --&gt;
Launched at the 2007 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Energy FACTory is an interactive, energy-making museum that uses different mediums to educate the public about renewable energy sources. Through installations, workshops and/or demonstrations, the Energy FACTory provides a unique platform to educate people about wind, solar, bio-diesel, ethanol, thermal, kinetic energy, as well as the truths about other types of non-renewable energy. The Energy FACTory has featured everything from re-engineered golf carts inspired by different Coachella artists, such as an Amy Winehouse ethanol golf cart and a Yeah Yeah Yeahs biodiesel golf cart, to wind powered clock towers, human powered DJ Stages, and educational workshops. The size of the installation can vary from a single stationary bike or listening station to an entire playground depending on the venue.
[[File:Energy-Playground-Coachella.jpg|thumb|right|The Energy Playground provides Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival attendees a great opportunity to recharge their phone and rethink the way they consume power]]

===Energy Playground===
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:bikesatcoachella2.png|right|Energy-generating bikes at Coachella]] --&gt;
A spin off of the Energy FACTory, first seen at Coachella 2010 under the name "Sweatshop Mixer" and also appearing as “Prius Playground”, “High Plains Mixer”, and “Energy FACTory DJ Mixer”, the Energy Playground consists of bikes, swings, human sized hamster wheels, seesaws, and hand cranks. All of the equipment is set up to harness the energy that is produced by using them. The energy is then converted into electricity to power anything from snow cone machines and cell phone chargers to entire DJ sets. The majority of electricity produced by the playground is stored in the Energy Well, a fully monitor-able and adaptable lithium-ion battery command center. As electricity flows from production devices into the Energy Well, software tracks all aspects of production and can share, in real time, the results of riders’ work. This incentive aims to further introduce people to alternative forms of energy while at the same time realizing the impact, big or small, that they can make as one person or as a group.

[[File:The-Bigger-Picture-Logo.png|thumb|right|The Bigger Picture Film Awards rewards the best cause-based films and documentaries as acclaimed by the public]]

===The Bigger Picture===
Launched in 2008, The Bigger Picture Film Awards rewards the best cause-based films and documentaries as acclaimed by the public. Participants vote online to support movies highlighting the most pressing issues of our time. Award categories are separated between feature films and documentaries. With the Bigger Picture Film Awards, each voter is encouraged to share their favorite nominees within personal network of friends, family and fellow peers. Every voter is automatically entered to win incredible prizes for their involvement and contribution to make the world see the bigger picture.

Once the votes are in, Global Inheritance hosts a ceremony in Los Angeles, CA where film producers, actors and movie industry executives gather to receive their awards and celebrate the causes they’re all defending. The 2017 Bigger Picture Film Awards was held at the Ace Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles on March 1.

===Tour Rider===
Global Inheritance partnered with Bill Silva Presents and Andy Hewitt in 2005 to bring Tour Rider to the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Concertgoers who utilize public transportation to arrive at the venue can stop by the Tour Rider booth to receive prizes in exchange for their environmentally friendly behavior. The Metro offers several options to get to the Hollywood Bowl, including a direct connection to the venue, making public transportation both a convenient and conscious option. Prizes range from museum and event passes to eco-friendly clothing and accessories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.metro.net/news/Simple_PR/metro-052307/ Go Metro to Special Hollywood Bowl Shows and Receive a Free Gift&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629123128/http://www.metro.net/news/Simple_PR/metro-052307/ |date=2011-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent concerts that have featured the Tour Rider program include Paul McCartney, Radiohead, Roger Waters, Kings of Leon, and many more.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Tour Rider rewards concertgoers for helping the environment and decreasing traffic congestion, which is especially valuable given the location of the Hollywood Bowl.

===Alternative Energy Fuel RC Racing===
Starting in 2006 at the ESPN X Games, Global Inheritance introduced a new program that allows participants to race miniature RC cars that run on alternative fuels/power sources. If attendees can’t afford a hybrid or don’t have a driver’s license, at least they can race an RC cart that is powered by ethanol, biodiesel or charged using solar. These races offer young people and adults alike the opportunity to explore the efficiency of these alternative options.

===Saving Nature Arcade===

Debuting at Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival in 2014, The Saving Nature Arcade is a solar-powered twist on 8 bit video games. Arcade classics have been re-skinned to spotlight key environmental challenges. The walls of the arcade are created using wood signage. Each wood panel is customized to cover a different issue (including waste and recycling, water, energy, carbon footprint, urbanization, and natural resources). Some of the featured titles included No ImPact Man, Urban Frogger, Waste Invaders, Water Patrol and The Dangerous Dig. Festival attendees received free tokens by participating in any of our Saving Nature efforts. Participants competed against other festival attendees for the chance to win backstage passes to see Arcade Fire perform. The Saving Nature Arcade encourages everyone to elevate their game in defending our environment.

===Environmentaland===
This theme park/environmental museum aimed to expose people of all ages to environmental issues and sustainable living through games, competitions, and exhibits. Located at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex, the home of the Academy Awards, Environmentaland was the first theme park of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/08/worlds-first-eco-theme-park.php World's First Eco Theme Park: Environmentaland : TreeHugger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to exploring the impact of global warming through desert miniature golf and touring the eco-planetarium, visitors could participate in the energy playground, which featured a seesaw and Tour de Energy bicycles that generated power. Environmentaland facilitated adventures in self-powered activities as well, such as milkshakes made on bike-powered blenders and a hand-crank Pearl Jam listening station.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-inheritance-with-fuel-tv-launch-environmentaland-the-worlds-first-interactive-environmental-theme-park-and-museum-63666827.html GLOBAL INHERITANCE With FUEL TV Launch ENVIRONMENTALAND: The World's First Interactive Environmental Theme... - LOS ANGELES, Oct. 7 /PRNewswire/&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentaland also featured numerous events while open, including the Bigger Picture, a series of documentaries that focused on environmental and social issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;
[[File:Oasis Water Bar Coachella GI.jpg|thumb|left|The Oasis Water Bar was a main attraction at Coachella 2013. Festival goers frock to the Oasis to enjoy some thirst-quenching education.]]

===Oasis Water Bar===
Global Inheritance worked with Coachella in 2013 to introduce a program dedicated to bringing awareness to the complexities, issues, and significance of drinking water. This Oasis Water Bar provides an opportunity for festival-goers to learn about the future of drinking water and the potential of fourteen different H2O sources. The Oasis presents its visitors with a refreshing perspective on the future of drinking water by offering shot glasses full of water from several varying sources. The Oasis has its very own bartenders/scientists that are experts in water conservation and ready to offer festival-goers a better understanding of their own water consumption. As shots are poured by the bartenders/scientists, patrons of the bar also hear the back-story of each water type such as where it originated from, how far it traveled to get to the festival grounds, the types of filtration methods used to purify it, and more. Festival-goers can learn what they might be drinking five years, twenty years or fifty years in the future and what needs to happen to preserve certain sources. Visitors to the Oasis taste waters like Purified Wastewater, Desalinated Pacific Ocean Water, Los Angeles Tap Water, Glacier Water, Oregon Rainwater, Hot Spring Water, and more.

===Global Warming Chess===
Global Warming Chess immerses participants and players into a life size game of chess where they are the chess pieces. The game is intended to demonstrate the volatile and unpredictable nature of the fight against global warming. Festival attendees were encouraged to watch as the two opposing sides maneuvered to eliminate each other and dominate the board. During each match, festivals goers competed against bands, a polar bear or Halliburton’s CEO. Donning costumes for each chess piece, participants are divided into sides representing the “causes” and “cures” of global warming. Costumes for the “causes” include, Hummers as pawns, factories as rooks, coal as knights, lobbyists as bishops, trash as queen, and oil derrick as king. “Cure” costumes include, bicycles as pawns, recycling bins as rooks, solar panels as knights, scientists as bishops, a tree as queen, and wind turbine as king. The Global Warming Chess program premiered in 2008 at the Virgin Music Festival in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalinheritance.org/programs/read/15/gobal-warming-chess Global Inheritance - Global Warming Chess&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728101002/http://www.globalinheritance.org/programs/read/15/gobal-warming-chess |date=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Displays of Affection===
Public Displays Of Affection (PDA) was launched in 2006 to recreate the way people in Los Angeles view public transportation. In another combination of environmental sustainability and the arts, Global Inheritance partnered with high-profile bands to reward public transportation riders. PDA took over major venues including Union Station in Los Angeles that are easily accessible by public transport. Anyone with an incoming Metro ticket or bus pass is admitted free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laist.com/2007/09/27/free_pda_with_l.php Free PDA with Ladytron and Great Northern : LAist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106084645/http://laist.com/2007/09/27/free_pda_with_l.php |date=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project aims to prove that public transportation is a viable alternative to LA's car culture. Past concerts have included Ladytron at Hollywood and Highland and the Secret Machines with Shepard Fairey at Union Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicwire.fuel.tv/bloodredshoes/photos/view/6198 Risky Sh!t | FUEL TV Official Site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:energybattleroyal.png|right|Energy Battle Royal Coloring Books]] --&gt;

===Energy Battle Royal===
Currently contained in a comic book, this epic battle seeks to illustrate the current energy sources competing to provide power to the world, including oil, wind, hydrogen and ethanol. Each energy source is represented in a comic-book style superhero that embodies the advantages and disadvantages of the source. Global Inheritance introduced the various characters at Coachella 2011 and hopes to bring the battle to life in summer of 2014, further educating the public about alternative energy options. Recently, Global Inheritance launched its newest comic book at the Air Quality Management District Conference in March 2012. Modern understanding of different Energy sources is constantly morphing, so keep an eye out for the evolution of different comic book characters.
[[File:Poltar-The-Great.png|thumb|Poltar The Great bestowing its wisdom at Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival 2015]]

===Poltar The Great===
Launched in 2015 at Coachella Arts + Music Festival, Poltar the Great is an interactive, all-knowing, all-telling Polar Bear who is driven to protect the environment. Poltar’s ultimate goal is to educate participants through a one-on-one experience with his keen fortune-telling abilities. A 10-ft tall magical box is the permanent residence of Poltar the Great, and is where his animated automat provides solutions to cope with today’s most pressing environmental issues. Bestowing his wisdom to participants, Poltar provides customized fortune cards depicting Mother Nature’s greatest gifts (the land, the air, the water, the animals, the food, the glaciers, and others). Every person who speaks to Poltar will leave with a mission they must accomplish to keep in good graces with the bear. Following Poltar the Great’s predictions guarantees a better future for all of us. 
[[File:Recyclosaurus Rex.png|thumb|left|Recyclosaurus Rex roams on the Polo Field to hunt for recyclables]]

===Recyclosaurus Rex===
Introduced at Coachella 2012, Recyclosaurus Rex is a 25-foot tall/40-foot long robotic dinosaur that consumes empty water bottles, cans, and other recyclables and compacts them into small cubes of recyclable waste. Recyclosaurus Rex is not only an environmentally conscious and resourceful aid to the recycling process but has been a large attraction and destination point for many festival-goers during the Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival. Coachella attendees sacrifice their recyclables to stay on good terms with Recyclosaurus Rex while litterers feel the wrath of Rex for refusing to be team players.

===Fire and Ice: Saving Nature World Tour===
One of Global Inheritance's newest initiatives, the Fire and Ice: Saving Nature World Tour follows the exploits of Super Chill and Smokin' Hot, a DJ duo consisting of a polar bear and a grizzly bear. The two furry friends find themselves in various endangered habitats as destinations of their virtual tour. Global Inheritance issues a monthly interactive update on Smokin' Hot and Super Chill and the global tour stops they DJ in. These updates are opportunities to bring attention to significant areas that represent environmental importance. Tour Destinations include Sichuan, China; Mount Everest; Borneo; Nauru; the Great Barrier Reef; Antarctica; the Amazon Rain Forest; the Galapagos Islands; the Pacific Trash Vortex; the Gulf of Mexico; the Arctic; Greenland; the Dead Sea; the Sahel; Congo; Madagascar; the Florida Everglades; Colorado River; and the Sky Islands.

[[File:Savin-Nature-Claw-Machine-2017.jpg|thumb|left| The Saving Nature Claw Machine at Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival 2017]]

===Saving Nature Claw Machine===
The Saving Nature Claw Machine experience raises awareness for endangered and at-risk animals through an innovative and arcade-like experience. The program combines a playful activity and an educative interaction with a powerful message to address the extinction of dozens of animal species. By letting participants choose their "spirit animal", the program generates a sense of kin between them, and leads to a broader sense of responsibility towards the animal kingdom. After researching and choosing an animal, participants take a short quiz to learn more about the endangered and at-risk species they selected. This is followed by a photo opportunity inside of a life-size claw machine which is shared afterward onsite with action items to save their species. The last step is for the participant to take command of the claw machine and to seek out and save their animal... After the event, Global Inheritance intends to keep participants updated on ways to protect endangered species through informative messages, educating them on how daily changes can have an impact with such a global issue, but also get involved with protection organizations in the field. The Saving Nature Claw Machine first appeared at the 2017 Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival.

===Rain Supreme===
Launched in the winter of 2016, Rain Supreme gathered some of California's best street artists to battle the worst drought in the state's history and redesign the way people save water. Participating artists included Jeff McMillian, Mearone, Bumblebeelovesyou, Teddy Kelly, Samir Evol, Drew Merritt, Christina Angelina, Levi Ponce, Vakseen, James Haunt, Clinton Bopp, Ashley Marcias, Brandon Sopinsky, Mark Ravelo, Jeremiah Garcia, Ben Swenson, Nisha Sembi, Jacob Livingood, 2Shae, Jorge Riverol, Vyal, Steve Marinez, and more. Through this program, Global Inheritance provides communities affected by water scarcity the opportunity to collect and store water to be reused for daily watering needs. Each Rain Supreme art and water conservation exhibit provide attendees the opportunity to view the Rain Supreme art collection as well as order their own rain barrels, find out about rain barrel rebate programs in their communities, and learn from water conservationists about best practices and installation tips for their homes.

==Notable events==
[[File:Coachella Energy Playground GI.jpg|thumb|right|The Global Inheritance Polar Bears made an appearance at Coachella 2013. Here, they are featured enjoying Global Inheritance's Energy Playground Swing Set.]]

===Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival 2004-2017===
Ever since their first collaboration in 2004, Coachella Music + Arts Festival has been a platform for Global Inheritance to highlight environmental issues. Innovative and interactive experiences like TRASHed: Art of Recycling and Carpoolchella were among the first programs designed to trigger a major reaction from the festival’s audience and raise awareness on sustainability issues inherent to major events. Thanks to their long-term commitment to each other, Global Inheritance and Coachella Music + Arts Festival have implemented new initiatives almost every year to continue to raise awareness among more and more festival attendees, reduce the festival’s carbon footprint, and offer entertaining and educational activities for everyone. Featured programs include Portal Potties (2016), Energy FACTory Museum (2007, 2008), 18 &amp; Up (2009) Energy FACTory DJ Mixer (2010, 2011), Recyclosaurus Rex (2012), Oasis Water Bar (2013), Saving Nature Solar Arcade (2014), Poltar the Great (2015), Polar Bear Dating Game (2016), and the Saving Nature Claw Machine (2017).

Through its diverse portfolio of programs, Global Inheritance has always focused on improving the experience of festival attendees and participating in Coachella Music + Arts Festival unique atmosphere: offering people solutions to charge their phones at no cost (Energy Playground); contributing to the artistic environment of the festival site (TRASHed :: Art of Recycling); keeping the festival grounds clean (10-4-1, Recycling Store, Recyclosaurus Rex); offering merchandise or experiences as rewards (Carpoolchella, Saving Nature Claw Machine), and more. Thanks to the partnership with the Goldenvoice team and a network of volunteers, Global Inheritance has been given the opportunity and the resources to pursue its mission as a nonprofit 501c3 at Coachella Music &amp; Arts Festival since 2004.

===South Coast Air Quality Management District: A World We Can Change Expo 2013===
At A World We Can Change Expo in March, Global Inheritance entertained and educated nearly 8,000 high school students and teachers with the Energy FACTory DJ Mixer, a DJ set powered by attendees of the conference using 18 bikes and two energy seesaws. Attendees also had the opportunity to run on Global Inheritance's Human Hamster Wheels for some healthy competition to power a light tower. Those that were able to light up all ten light bulbs on the tower received cool rewards. The event was a successful outreach to a younger demographic devoted to progressive change.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A World We Can Change Expo Energy FACTory GI.jpg|thumb|left|Hundreds of high school students took turns powering a DJ set at the South Coast Air Quality Management District: A World We Can Change Expo 2013.]] --&gt;

===Art Basel 2012===
Art Basel housed Global Inheritance's Think BIG exhibit, a collaborative project with Threadless. The program invited artists from around the world to redesign miniature recycling bins with a chance to win a spot to redesign a large recycling bin for Coachella as well as a VIP pass, airfare, and accommodation for the festival. Well known artists such as Gürkan Akkurt, Oana Botea, Jennifer Boxer, Jacob Livengood and many more participated. Global Inheritance will be working with Art Basel again in 2013, with plans to implement its largest TRASHed Miami campaign to date.

===Indianapolis 500 2011===
This May, Global Inheritance made its first appearance at the Indianapolis 500 with the Energy Playground. The project featured Tour de Energy bicycles as well as the Energy Seesaw that participants used to fuel snow cone machines. The bicycles could also be used to charge cell phones, iPods, and cameras. The re- engineered equipment showed participants the amount of energy that everyday appliances and electronics require in order to develop a heightened awareness of energy consumption among Indy 500 attendees. Similar to the group’s other initiatives, the playground equipment aimed to foster a responsible relationship to the environment.

==History and origins==
Founded as "FashionPeace" in 2002, Global Inheritance was envisioned by Eric Ritz as "an NGO advertising agency for mother earth and the improvement of mankind."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://issuu.com/racketmagazine/docs/racket_mag_spring_2010-issuu Racket Magazine Spring 2010&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ritz was frustrated with other environmental organizations that failed to connect with a broader audience, and wanted to create an organization that could connect with people from every walk of life.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
In addition, he wanted to employ the power of music and art to inspire people, rather than focusing strictly on money as he had seen others do in his experience. 
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Ritz wanted an organization that would bridge the gap between environmental causes and everyday people, hoping to use creativity to spark an interest in the issues and inspire action.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The early organization partnered with clothing companies and designers to re-purpose old clothing into designer outfits. Although that particular program is now only one of many, the spirit of using creativity to encourage and even glamorize sustainable living remains a foundation of the organization. Early partner companies included Diesel, Levis, Miss Sixty, and American Apparel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalinheritance.org/programs/read/4/fashion-peace Global Inheritance - Fashion Peace&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724165142/http://www.globalinheritance.org/programs/read/4/fashion-peace |date=2010-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, Ritz was traveling to events to install environmentally aware performance art like the Jiffy Pop tree at Coachella, and by the summer of 2009, Global Inheritance was able to hire two paid employees for the first time. Today the organization is run by a small staff and a cadre of interns and volunteers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Just short of ten years after its founding, Global Inheritance runs approximately 25-30 programs a year for a variety of festivals, events, and companies&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6346">The '''Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008''' ({{USBill|110|HR|2082}}) would have authorized funding levels for the 13 government intelligence agencies and increased oversight for the U.S. intelligence community. The bill would have also applied the standards in the U.S. Army Field Manual to the entire government, effectively barring the CIA and other agencies from using tactics like [[waterboarding]] in their interrogations.  The bill was sponsored by Rep. Silvestre Reyes (D, TX-16).

The bill was vetoed by President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] and did not receive enough votes for an override.

Two days after [[Barack Obama]] became president he issued an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] [[Barack Obama's first 100 days#Policy|ordering the CIA to apply the standards of the U.S. Army Field Manual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061153/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations/ |archivedate=2009-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill history==
===Initial debate and passage===
Introduced on May 1, 2007, the House passed a version of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 [http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2082/show (H.R. 2082)] less than two weeks later, by a vote of 225-197.  

The Senate soon followed suit after a modest amount of internal debate, approving a similar version of the intelligence bill in a voice vote on October 3, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;OpenCongress info page on [http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-h2082/show H.R.2082].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-torture provisions inserted during conference committee===

When the bill came out of conference committee on Dec. 6, 2007, it had a provision barring the CIA and the rest of the federal government from many interrogation tactics criticized as "torture" and "abusive" by civil liberties groups, including [[waterboarding]]. The provision was inserted by Sen. [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-Calif.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/33027prs20071206.html "ACLU Cheers House and Senate Intel Bill Conferees for Including Provision Prohibiting Torture and Abuse"] (press release), American Civil Liberties Union, Dec. 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inserted provision would limit the CIA to the 19 interrogation tactics in the U.S. Army Field manual, effectively banning waterboarding, exposure to extreme temperatures and other techniques used on [[War on Terror]] detainees after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. It bans a total of eight interrogation techniques: mock executions, beatings, electrical shocks, forced nakedness, sexual acts, causing hypothermia and heat injuries.&lt;ref name="Eggen Feb. 14"&gt;Dan Eggen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302888.html "Senate Passes Ban On Waterboarding, Other Techniques,"] ''The Washington Post,''February 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress had banned such attacks from being used by the military through the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]]. Sen. [[John McCain]] (R-Ariz.) had sponsored the Act, but opposed the conference committee ban because, he said, it applied military standards to intelligence agencies. McCain also said that waterboarding was forbidden under current law but asked the Bush administration to clarify the matter by declaring it illegal.&lt;ref name="Eggen Feb. 14"/&gt;

The House approved the bill, by a vote of 222-199.

Before the Senate voted In February, there were two weeks of debate over the CIA's use of waterboarding on three al-Qaeda prisoners in 2002 and 2003. The [[United States Department of Justice]] was also expected to tell the House that "there has been no determination by the Justice Department" was legal or illegal. The Bush administration had also just announced that it planned to put six War on Terror detainees from Guantanamo Bay - five of which had been subjected to the CIA tactics - on trial for involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name="Eggen Feb. 14"/&gt;

The Senate approved the conference report by a 51-45 vote on Feb. 13, 2008.

===Veto by President Bush and failed House override===

As he promised,&lt;ref name="Eggen Feb. 14"/&gt; President Bush vetoed the legislation on March 8. His veto applied to the authorization for the entire intelligence budget for the 2008 fiscal year, but he cited the waterboarding ban as the reason for the veto.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Eggen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030800304.html "Bush Announces Veto of Waterboarding Ban,"] ''Washington Post'', Mar. 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] (D-Calif.) attempted but failed to lead the House in a vote overriding the veto, 224-188.

'''Internavi''' is a vehicle [[telematics]] service offered by the [[Honda Motor Company]] to drivers in Japan. In the United States, the service is known as HondaLink, or sometimes MyLink. It provides mobile connectivity for on-demand traffic information services and internet provided maps displayed inside selected Honda vehicles. The service began August 1997 and was first offered in the 1998 [[Honda Accord#Sixth generation (1998–2002)|Honda Accord]] and the [[Honda Torneo]] sold only in Japan starting July 1998. The service received a revision to services offered October 2002, adding traffic information delivery capabilities for subscribers to the Internavi Premium Club, and was optional on most Honda vehicles sold in Japan. [[Vehicle Information and Communication System|VICS]] was integrated into the service starting September 2003. Membership in the service has steadily grown to exceed 5 million subscribers as of March 2007.

The subscription service replaces the need to periodically update in-car navigation systems that use CD, or DVD installed maps that must be updated with the latest information. The maps are sent by internet connections established through the drivers cellphone with a data download plan associated with the cellphone.

The service is available without having to purchase a Honda vehicle installed with the technology; The Internavi LINC is available at both the [[Apple App Store]] and [[Android Market]] and can be installed on compatible mobile devices.

One of the features offered is the ability to overlay weather information on the in-car map screen in 3D. Route guidance is provided in conjunction with VICS provided information so as to display a large weather disturbance approaching, such as a snow storm or typhoon, allowing drivers to take alternate routes.

==Internavi (with VICS) ==
The following is a description of the various elements that comprise Honda's "Internavi" information service, including integration of the Japanese governments nationally offered service [[Vehicle Information and Communication System|VICS]], or Vehicle Information and Communication System [http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/09/18/147637.html Press release for Internavi introduction]

=== On-demand VICS ===
The technology is dependent on the user's cell phone service, and uses the data download plan associated with the users account. Once connected, one of the services available is route calculations towards a specific destination. The navigation technology interface connects to the server automatically at the Internavi Information Center, calculations and route planning is then determined towards establishing the quickest route towards the selected destination. The identified route also takes into consideration all currently known traffic and local transportation issues that may affect the plotted course from the VICS center, which is updated every five minutes based on reports from various sources. As travel begins towards the destination, any updated conditions are 
instantly relayed to the vehicle in real time. If cellphone service connection is lost, information will be updated as the connection is reestablished. Under normal navigation conditions, FM-multiplex broadcast VICS will prompt when specific conditions become aware, such as traffic congestion. The plotted course is then modified based on new information received to adjust travel time information, to include inter-city motorway links. Information received to vehicles installed with Internavi technology are installed with an antenna externally installed. Information is also transmitted by transmitter towers located throughout Japan, identified with a "Beacon Light" located on main urban roads. In this manner vehicles with Internavi receive information from both the "beacon light" towers and by individual cellphones paired up' with vehicles, providing highly accurate information in real time.

=== Internavi "floating car" system ===
As the vehicle travels, either on a planned destination or unguided autonomous driving, the vehicle installed with Internavi records the vehicle's GPS position and speed onto the vehicle's hard disk drive, and periodically updates to the Internavi Center Information Server. This autonomous information is then retransmitted towards other users, notifying of road conditions. Vehicles installed with previous internal maps utilizing a DVD are not given updated traffic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honda.co.jp/news/2006/c060329.html 29 March 2006 Honda's press release date]&lt;/ref&gt; Speed conditions are then displayed in three colors—red, orange and blue—to signify traffic congestion conditions, overlaid with updated VICS known conditions. This feature can be deactivated by the driver if position and speed of the individual vehicle does not want to be transmitted, however by doing so, road conditions can not be shared unless the tracking system is activated. Reports will then be limited to VICS information only. Road conditions can be specifically defined towards individual lane conditions, as opposed to general road conditions, such as to identify a traffic incident in a particular lane. As the information is stored by various contributing vehicles, congestion prediction can also be provided. Road conditions are transmitted by the VICS system, however, Internavi provides additional and more specific road and traffic conditions based on individual lane conditions provided by vehicles recording Internavi "floating car" conditions, specifying which lane and the direction of the road itself. Internavi supporting traffic information is transmitted by individual driver's cell phones, and if cellphone conditions are disrupted, the information is recorded onto the vehicles HDD, so that when cellphone reception is restored, all recorded information is then transmitted and updates are sent towards participating vehicles.

===Parking selection function===
Internavi participating vehicles also benefit from available parking spaces, whether it be on the street or in parking structures, public or private parking, from Internavi-equipped vehicles having made available a parking space. The space is also defined by the size of the leaving vehicle so that vehicles looking for a parking space can be reasonably confident the vacant space will accommodate the arriving vehicle.

===Internavi Weather Features ===
As of October 2004, inclement weather conditions are overlaid onto the Internavi display map when the orientation of the map is displayed in 3D. This ability displays weather fronts as they approach the vehicles current position.&lt;ref&gt;2004 to display the information near the typhoon's path and destination weather "Honda Inter Navi System" was installed after the A new feature addition.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information and CDDB music downloads ===
When playing a CD, the Internavi operating system provides the ability to save a particular song or the entire contents of the CD onto the hard disk within the vehicle. Information about the CD is then provided by [[Gracenote]].

== Other Services ==

=== Map Update Service ===
The HDD map data is automatically updated for 24 months from registration, or up to 3 times map data on DVD sourced information before the first [[Motor-vehicle inspection (Japan)|Japanese Government mandated vehicle inspection]]. After the time period has lapsed, map data updating is a supplementary service.

If the vehicle has been sent to Honda dealers for repair, the HDD map data is completely upgraded to the most current data available. Any music files stored in the HDD will be safeguarded to prevent accidental deletion.

=== Personal Home Page===
The Member ID and password issued at the time of admission, which provides a personal home page in conjunction with the car navigation features. Key features, drive information, drive configuration spot, and notification of when maintenance is based on information sent from the car navigation system mileage. Users can plan ahead drive on a personal website, on a list that you have a destination, it is possible to easily perform the setting operation in the car destination. In addition, in June 2005 "Departure Time Traveller" is added a feature called, departure city, destination, and enter the desired arrival time, departure time and route recommendation, etc. To display the toll charges due.

=== QQ Calls ===
Internavi also offers a hands-free phone call service to call for assistance, such as an accident, or a road emergency. The service also provides a 24-hour roadside assistance service and vehicle towing service. The service is an additional ¥2,000 enrollment fee, plus an JAF enrollment with an annual fee ¥4,000 "Confederation of Japan Automobile". The service is three years complimentary for owners of the Honda Legend and the Honda Elysion with the V6 engine. This service also provides a live operator who can provide additional road assistance services in comparison to other points and to ensure alternative means of transportation and lodging expenses when it becomes impossible to continue driving.

=== Eco-Index ===
Honda's hybrid vehicles [[Honda Insight]], the [[Honda CR-Z]], and the [[Honda Fit#Fit Hybrid (2010)|Honda Fit Hybrid]] provide information such as Internet navigation information, and it records the accumulated mileage of the vehicle, which can be compared to other Hybrid owners vehicles and comparisons made towards other driver's habits.

==Membership System==
When a Honda product with an Internavi compatible navigation system installed is purchased, the new owner can have the system activated by visiting any Japanese Honda dealership. The new owner then completes an application form to register the vehicle and pertinent information about the owner of the vehicle. Once completed, a PIN and activation  instructions are sent to the owner.

==Compatible navigation systems==
[[File:Gathers VXH-072CV.jpg|thumb|left|Gathers model VXH-072CV navigation unit]]
Older vehicles that were not sold with Internavi installed, but were compatible with the technology can be retrofitted with the system by visiting any Honda dealer, or by visiting "Honda Access" accessories retailers and have Internavi installed. In Japan, an automobile parts retail chain called "[[Autobacs Seven|Autobacs]]" sells an in-dash navigation system built by Honda called "[[:ja:ギャザズ|Gathers]]" that is compatible with the Internavi technology, and can install the equipment into any vehicle. Previous navigation technology that uses either DVD loaded maps or use a Hard Disk Drive may be compatible with Internavi.  In addition, the DVD navigation system installed in the JDM [[Honda MDX]] can be upgraded and made compatible with Internavi. The JDM [[Honda Odyssey (international)|Honda Odyssey]], [[Honda Elysion|Elysion]], and the [[Honda Edix]] also have older versions of in-car navigation systems that can be upgraded. [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] "Carrozzeria" products are also found to be compatible.

==Compatible mobile phone==
When Internavi was introduced, [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s "mova" [http://www.nttdocomo.com/glossary/m/mova.html (Link to Docomo Glossary)] and "[[au (mobile phone)|au]]" phone, using [[CDMA 1X WIN]] technology was compatible. Phones that are identified with 3G technology can be paired with Internavi using a Bluetooth connection. In Japan, telecom company  [[WILLCOM]] offers flat-rate telecommunications services, depending on the type of third generation mobile navigation what can be connected directly to telephone or cable for in home use on personal computers.

'''James Charles Kopp''' (born August 2, 1954) is an [[United States|American]] citizen who was convicted in 2003 for the 1998 [[sniper]]-style [[murder]] of [[Barnett Slepian]], an American [[physician]] from [[Amherst, New York]] who performed [[abortion]]s. Prior to his capture, Kopp was on the [[FBI]]'s list of [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]]. On June 7, 1999 he had become [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1990s|the 455th fugitive placed on the list]] by the FBI. He was affiliated with the militant [[Roman Catholic]] [[anti-abortion]] group known as "[[The Lambs of Christ]]".

He has been referred to as a [[terrorist]] by the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/KeyLeader.jsp?memID=31 The Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041810/http://www.tkb.org/KeyLeader.jsp?memID=31# |date=2007-09-30 }} bio sketch of Kopp&lt;/ref&gt; and was "well-known in militant anti-abortion circles, where he was nicknamed Atomic Dog".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Vulliamy, McDonald &amp; Jeffries (2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/01/edvulliamy.henrymcdonald Abortion death hunt muzzles 'Atomic Dog': FBI Kept At Bay by Suspect Using A Secret Email System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202010908/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/01/edvulliamy.henrymcdonald# |date=2016-12-02 }}, ''The Guardian'', 1 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
James Charles Kopp was born in [[Pasadena, California]] and raised [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], but later converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. He graduated from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1976, with a bachelor's degree in Biology, going on to take a master's degree in Embryology from [[California State University Fullerton]]. Kopp started providing support to anti-abortion groups after his girlfriend underwent an abortion, and used his technical abilities to create special locks that protesters then used on the doors of abortion clinics.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

==Murder==
On October 23, 1998, at approximately 10 p.m., Barnett Slepian was standing in the kitchen of his home in [[Amherst, New York]]. Kopp fired a single shot from a [[rifle]] from a nearby wooded area, which entered the Slepian home through a rear window. Slepian was a well-known [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrician/gynecologist]] who performed abortions at a women's clinic in [[Buffalo, New York]]. He also maintained a private medical practice in an office in [[Amherst, New York]]. Within hours of the murder, anti-abortion militants posted Slepian's name crossed out on their internet website, which also served as "a virtual hit list of doctors who carry out abortions".&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Fugitive==
The FBI believed that Kopp received assistance in fleeing the US, although [[Ireland|Irish]] pro-life groups denied they assisted him.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Irish Times|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/anti-abortion-groups-say-they-did-not-meet-kopp-1.296587|title=Anti-abortion groups say they did not meet Kopp|date=31 March 2001|first1=Jim|last1=Cusack|first2=Joe|last2=Humphreys|page=7|quote=Irish anti-abortion groups have said they were unaware Mr James Kopp was hiding in Ireland. He spent 12 months in this State using false identities. ... A Pro-Life Campaign spokesman, Mr John Smyth, said "there was not a murmur going around in any circle that he was here," adding that Mr Kopp would have been "very foolish" to try to contact groups here. .. A Youth Defence spokesman, Mr Justin Barrett, was surprised to hear that Mr Kopp spent a year in Ireland.|access-date=2018-02-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063001/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/anti-abortion-groups-say-they-did-not-meet-kopp-1.296587#|archive-date=2018-02-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopp fled to [[Mexico]] under an assumed name and later to [[Ireland]]. He then fled Ireland one step ahead of police on a ferry to [[Brittany]], [[France]] on 12 March 2001, with two Irish passports besides his original U.S. document.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

On March 29, 2001, Kopp was arrested by French law enforcement in the town of [[Dinan]], [[Brittany]], just after picking up a package containing $300.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; The United States requested his [[extradition]]. [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] promised that the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] would not be sought, handed down or applied, a prerequisite according to the [[extradition treaty]] between France and the United States. Ashcroft's promise was made over the objections of [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Eliot Spitzer]] and [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] [[District Attorney]] Frank Clark, both of whom wanted the [[death penalty]], though such a sentence is not available in the New York State criminal justice system. Spitzer and Clark argued that the charge of murder was a [[State law|state charge]], not a [[Federal crime|federal charge]], and Ashcroft had no [[jurisdiction]] in the matter. The instruction chamber of the Rennes Court of Appeals ruled in favor of extradition. Kopp [[appeal]]ed the ruling. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Extradition===
In May 2002, Kopp waived all possible [[appeal]]s in France and returned to the U.S. in June 2002. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Trial and conviction==
On March 11, 2003, Kopp waived his right to a [[jury trial]]. Based upon an agreement between the defense and prosecution &amp;mdash; Erie County Assistant District Attorney Joseph Maruszak and [[defense attorney]] Bruce Barkett &amp;mdash; [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] Judge Michael D'Amico would be required to find Kopp guilty or not guilty based on a single document of facts. In addition, the judge could not consider lesser charges; he had to find Kopp guilty or not guilty of [[second-degree murder]]. Kopp had confessed his role in the shooting to police, claiming he only meant to wound Slepian. D'Amico found him guilty and sentenced him to the maximum penalty, 25 years to [[life imprisonment]], on May 9, 2003. D'Amico told Kopp "It's clear the act is premeditated; there is no doubt about it. You made an attempt to avoid responsibility for the act. What may appear righteous to you is immoral to someone else."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/trials/kopp/050903_sentence_ap.html Killer of New York abortion doctor gets maximum 25 years to life sentence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205085806/http://www.courttv.com/trials/kopp/050903_sentence_ap.html |date=2005-12-05 }} from [[CourtTV]] News&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellate Division, Fourth Department, upheld the conviction on July 7, 2006 (Shawn P. Hennessy, attorney for respondent and Timothy Murphy, attorney for appellant).

==Appeals==
Kopp filed an appeal with Federal court. &lt;!-- which court? --&gt; Judge [[Richard Joseph Arcara]] was selected to preside. Arcara limited what Kopp could say on the stand and prohibited the defense from showing pictures of aborted [[fetus]]es. There are also limitations to witness' accounts. If found guilty in Federal court, Kopp faces a mandatory life sentence. Kopp was charged with violating the Clinic Entrances Act and using a weapon in the murder of Slepian. Kopp [[pro se|chose to act as his own attorney]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On the second day of the federal trial, and during [[cross examination]], Kopp moved to have the court reporter from his previous state trial read back statements pertaining to abortion. Judge Arcara forbade this, holding that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Kopp was barred from stating anti-abortion, religious or moral reasoning for his actions, which effectively prevented Kopp from giving any rationale for his actions. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Kopp was also charged in the [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York]] on a count of violating the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]]. Kopp dismissed his court-assigned attorney, an assistant federal [[public defender]], and chose to represent himself. On June 20, 2007, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] plus 10 years for illegal use of a firearm.&lt;ref name="BuffaloNews_102613"&gt;{{ cite news | title = Kopp gets life without parole in Slepian killing | url = http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/102613.html | work = [[The Buffalo News]]| author = Michael Beebe | date = 20 June 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627045400/http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/102613.html | archivedate = 27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the court ordered his belongings auctioned off in order to pay $2.6 million to Slepian's family. Arcara told Kopp at the end of the trial:

{{quote|You served as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. You decided that you know better than any law.&lt;ref name="BuffaloNews_102613" /&gt;}}

In his opening statement to the jury, Kopp said that although Slepian's death was "a full-bore, 100 percent [[tragedy]]" it wasn't murder because it was not malicious or premeditated. He did acknowledge that he had planned the shooting for a year, and that he fired a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights, but that he had only meant to wound the doctor (to keep him from performing abortions). Kopp claimed that murder means "Shoot them in the head, blow up a car, riddle their body with bullets like they do in the movies. That's how you kill someone."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On April 6, 2009, The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the life sentence holding that all issues raised were without merit. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Other possible crimes==
It has been speculated that Kopp has committed other crimes besides killing Slepian. The FBI notes that "the shooting was similar to shootings in the [[Rochester, New York]] area, and three [[Canada|Canadian]] cities during the fall of 1997, in which abortion doctors were shot in their homes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/libref/factsfigure/civilrights.htm Facts and Figures 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084159/https://www2.fbi.gov/libref/factsfigure/civilrights.htm |date=2016-12-27 }} from the [[FBI]]&lt;/ref&gt; Kopp has been charged by [[Canada|Canadian]] authorities in the 1995 shooting of an [[Ontario, Canada]] doctor, Hugh Short, one of a string of [[Remembrance Day Shootings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/violence/james_kopp.html Anti-Abortion Extremists -James Kopp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116214857/http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/violence/james_kopp.html |date=2006-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doug Saunders, "Hidden Face of Murder Frustrates Pursuers".

His or her name has been withheld by Monroe County police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/15/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-york-possible-link-reported-in-shootings-of-doctors.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=2017-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917083348/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/15/nyregion/metro-news-briefs-new-york-possible-link-reported-in-shootings-of-doctors.html#|archive-date=2017-09-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-conspirators==
Kopp received help from a sympathetic [[pro-life]] activist couple, a Vietnam veteran and former stage and film actor Dennis Malvasi and his wife Loretta Marra of [[Brooklyn]], who pleaded guilty to one count each of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] in helping Kopp avoid capture. Marra and Malvasi had communicated extensively with Kopp, telling him also via electronic communications that "the coast is clear", referring to his proposed secretive return to US via Canada, and also to his use of their home as a safe house.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; On August 21, 2003, they were sentenced to time served, and released in October that same year. The fugitive assisters later changed their names to Joyce Maier and Ted Barnes.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Fictional portrayals and Media==
The murder of [[Barnett Slepian]] inspired an episode of ''[[Law and Order: Criminal Intent]]'', "The Third Horseman", in season 1, episode 11.

Singer/songwriter, Ani DiFranco wrote and performed the song, ''Hello, Birmingham'' about Kopp's shooting of Dr. Slepian.  It is the sixth track on her tenth studio album, ''To The Teeth.'' &lt;ref&gt;©️ Righteous Babe Records, Buffalo, NY 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28451">'''Jury sentencing''' is the practice, in some U.S. states, of having [[jury|juries]] decide what penalties to give those who have been convicted of criminal offenses. The practice of jury sentencing began in [[Virginia]] in the 18th century and spread westward to other states that were influenced by Virginia-trained lawyers.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; As of 2018, [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.173.1272&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=59 ARK.CODE ANN. § 5-4-103|date=2010|quote=If a defendant is charged with a felony and is found guilty of an offense by a jury, the jury shall fix punishment . . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2010|url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statutes/statute.aspx?id=39605|title=60 KY.REV.STAT.ANN. § 532.055|quote=Upon return of a verdict of guilty . . . the court shall conduct a sentencing hearing before the jury, if such case was tried before a jury.

CODE ANN. §§ 40-2704 to -2707 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Virginia]] had jury sentencing in times past, but then abandoned it.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Proponents of jury sentencing argue that since sentencing involves fact-finding (a task traditionally within the purview of juries), and since the [[original intent]] of the founders was to have juries check judges' power, it is the proper role of juries to participate in sentencing.&lt;ref name=booker/&gt; Opponents argue that judges' training and experience with the use of [[presentence report]]s and [[sentencing guidelines]], as well as the fact that [[jury control procedures]] typically deprive juries of the opportunity to hear information about the defendant's background during the trial, make it more practical to have judges sentence defendants.&lt;ref name=statutory/&gt;

==History==
===Rise of jury sentencing===
The impetus for introducing jury sentencing was that in the late 18th century, punishment options expanded beyond [[Public humiliation|shaming]] sanctions and the mandatory [[death penalty]] and came to include various ranges and modes of imprisonment, creating more room for case-by-case decisionmaking to which juries were thought to be well-suited.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Virginia was the first state to adopt jury sentencing. [[Constitution_of_Virginia#1776|The state's first constitution]] was enacted in 1776, and shortly thereafter, in 1779, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed to the [[Virginia General Assembly]] a revised criminal code that would have eliminated [[pardon]]s and [[benefit of clergy]], abolished capital punishment for most offenses, and allowed juries to decide punishments when the penalty was discretionary. This bill failed, however, both in 1779 and 1786, after [[James Madison]] had reintroduced it while [[Thomas_Jefferson#Minister_to_France|Jefferson was in France]].&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

Sentencing by jury was, however, successfully enacted in Virginia's 1796 penal code, which like the 1779 bill replaced capital punishment with terms of imprisonment for most felony offenses. Kentucky adopted a penal reform bill introduced by [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckenridge]] that implemented sentencing by jury in 1798. While in Virginia, magistrates continued to have misdemeanor sentencing power (possibly because of the political influence of magistrates who served in the General Assembly), in Kentucky, this power was given to juries. Kentucky juries tried and sentenced slaves and free blacks, and even decided cases involving [[prison discipline]], imposing punishments such as [[flagellation]] or [[solitary confinement]] for infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Any convict commencing a quarrel with another should "suffer such punishment (within the prison) as should be awarded by an impartial jury, but not over four lashes, or 10 hours of solitary confinement.|title=The development of American prisons and prison customs, 1776-1845|author=Lewis, O.F.|date=1922|publisher=Prison Association of New York|url=https://archive.org/details/developmentofame00lewirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and Tennessee adopted sentencing by jury in 1816 and 1829, respectively.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In contrast, northern states such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[New Jersey]], and [[New York (state)|New York]] allowed judges to determine penalties, with Pennsylvania also allowing judges to pardon prisoners who, in their view, had evidenced sincere reformation. One hypothesis is that Virginia opted for jury sentencing because [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]s like [[George Keith Taylor]] distrusted the Republican district court judges; while in Pennsylvania, the Constitutionalists sought (over the objections of Republicans) to put sentencing power in the hands of the judges because the bench was populated by Constitutionalists. [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]], which did not establish penitentiaries until after the [[American Civil War]], also left sentencing to judges' discretion.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

The adoption of jury sentencing happened at the same time that the movement for an elective judiciary gathered speed, with at least four states, Alabama, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota switching to [[judicial election]]s around the same time that they adopted jury sentencing. Both reforms may have been due to a mistrust of unelected judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

During the ten years of the [[Republic of Texas]], judges determined sentences. The 
change to jury determination of the penalty was brought about by one of the first laws passed by the first legislature of the State of Texas in 1846, which empowered the jury to sentence the defendant in all criminal cases except capital cases and cases for which punishment was fixed by law.&lt;ref name=grab/&gt;

Indiana, Illinois, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia adopted jury sentencing later in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

===Decline of jury sentencing===
The 1895 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Sparf v. United States]]'' reflected growing concern that letting juries decide whether or how the law should be applied in particular cases could be detrimental to the [[rule of law]]. By 1910, the role of juries in determining penalties was being eroded by the professionalization of sentencing, as many states passed laws that created [[parole]] and [[probation]] systems.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

These systems were based on a [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] philosophy that it would be more useful for society to focus on finding ways to prevent future crime than on fixing blame for crime that had occurred in the past. Criminal behavior was viewed as the result of such factors as [[heredity]], social circumstances, random breeding, and [[Darwinian struggle]], rather than an abuse of divinely-granted [[free will]]. [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]] would determine the causes of crime and what social reforms and treatment programs would correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probation officer]]s gathered and analyzed information about the defendant's character and prepared a presentence report that served as the basis for the ultimate sentence. Probation provided opportunities for treatment in the community for juveniles and adults. In the prison system, [[parole commission]]ers, trained in penology and insulated from political pressures, determined when prisoners had been rehabilitated and could be reintegrated into society.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

The process of preparing a presentence report, which takes weeks, only begins after the defendant is convicted, since if he/she were to be acquitted, the effort that went into preparing the report would be wasted. It would, therefore, not be possible for juries to sentence the defendant at the time of conviction, if the jury needed to rely on a presentence report in making its sentencing decision; rather, the jury would need to be broken up and reassembled later, which could be unworkable if the delay between verdict and sentencing is substantial.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

Furthermore, jury control procedures typically provide that during the trial, information about the defendant's background that is not relevant to the issue of guilt is not to be presented in the presence of the jury, lest it prejudice him. The assumptions that presentence reports would be more informative than presentence hearings, and that training and experience were required to intelligently consider the data and assess sanctions, militated in favor of having a judge rather than a jury do the sentencing.&lt;ref name=statutory&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statutory Structures for Sentencing Felons to Prison|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=1 December 1960|volume=60|number=8|pages=1134-1172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[McKeiver v Pennsylvania]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court held that alleged juvenile delinquents have no right to a jury trial, with [[Harry Blackmun]] and three other Justices opining that an adversarial system would put an end to the prospect of a intimate, informal protective proceeding focused on rehabilitation.

Georgia and Tennessee both had periods (from 1937-1939, and from 1913-1923, respectively) in which they briefly abandoned jury sentencing while experimenting with [[indeterminate sentencing]]. By 1919, fourteen states gave juries sentencing powers in non-capital cases, although by 1960, that number had dropped to thirteen.&lt;ref name=democratic&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing as Democratic Practice|author=Iontcheva, Jenia|journal=Virginia Law Review|volume=89|number=2|date=April 2003|pages=311-383|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3202435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, [[determinate sentencing]], a new intellectual current that repudiated the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitative]] model with its focus on using mathematical models and grids to determine sentences, had made inroads, making jury sentencing seem like more of an anachronism.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Georgia permanently abandoned jury sentencing in 1974 and Tennessee did the same in 1982.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Nancy J.|title=The Origins of Felony Jury Sentencing in the United States|volume=78|journal=Chi.-Kent L. Rev.|number=937|date=2003|url=https://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cklawreview/vol78/iss3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota had also abandoned jury sentencing, and Mississippi was using jury sentencing only in rape and statutory rape cases. Oklahoma abolished jury sentencing but reinstated it in 1999.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

===Possible revival of jury sentencing===
According to some commentators, the time is ripe for a revival of jury sentencing, because flaws in the determinate sentencing systems are becoming increasingly apparent. Lawmakers drafting legislation such as the [[Sentencing Reform Act]] have had difficulty mustering the political will to make clear choices among opposing moral and ideological viewpoints, instead delegating these decisions to agencies that lack the representativeness and democratic origin of legislatures. Prosecutors have routinely circumvented the sentencing guidelines through their charging and plea bargaining decisions, creating a new set of disparities, despite the intent of the guidelines to curtail disparities.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; Determinate sentencing has also failed to reduce racial disparity in sentencing.&lt;ref name=idea&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jury Sentencing in Noncapital Cases: An Idea Whose Time Has Come (Again)?|author=Lanni, Adriaan|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 May 1999|volume=108|number=7|pages=1775-1803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, some juries have been acquitting guilty defendants to save them from what they regard as overly harsh [[mandatory minimum sentence]]s, such as those imposed by the [[Rockefeller Drug Laws]] and California's [[three-strikes law]]. There have been movements to abolish sentencing commissions and guideline systems and inform jurors of their right to nullify. Decisions like ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find any facts that would increase a defendant's maximum sentence) and ''[[Ring v. Arizona]]'' (requiring a jury, rather than a judge, to find whether there are aggravating factors justifying capital punishment) have also signaled a willingness by the judiciary to expand the role of the jury in the legal process.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Jury sentencing has been seen as a way to in many cases render moot the questions raised by ''Apprendi'' and related cases such as ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'' and ''[[United States v. Booker]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibas, Stephanos and Klein, Susan R.|title=The Sixth Amendment and Criminal Sentencing|date=2008|journal=Faculty Scholarship|number=921|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship/921}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the differences between [[Element (criminal law)|elements of an offense]] and sentencing factors by letting the jury decide all the facts.&lt;ref name=applying&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying Apprendi to jury sentencing: why state felony jury sentencing threatens the right to a jury trial|author=Carrington, Melissa|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=2011|number=4|pages=1359-1385|url=http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Carrington.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases such as ''[[Miller v. Alabama]]'' and ''[[Graham v. Florida]]'' (banning mandatory life imprisonment without parole, and life imprisonment without parole in non-homicide cases, respectively, for juveniles, as contrary to the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]'s prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]]) also raise a question of whether the Supreme Court logically should allow only a jury, rather than a judge, to determine a juvenile should receive such a sentence, given the parallels between adult capital punishment case law and juvenile life imprisonment with parole case law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Russell, Sarah F.|title=Jury Sentencing and Juveniles: Eighth Amendment Limits and Sixth Amendment Rights|volume=56|journal=B.C.L. Rev.|number=553|date=2015|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/bclr/vol56/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plea bargains, judicial override, and juror access to information==
In Virginia, under the 1796 act, capital punishment remained mandatory for [[first-degree murder]], but the penalty for [[second-degree murder]] was any term between five and eighteen years in the penitentiary. The 1796 act gave the court in murder cases the authority to "determine the degree of the crime, and to give sentence accordingly" when a defendant was "convicted by confession." The judge's discretion to set sentences in cases of confession did not exist in Kentucky.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt;

In Missouri, informing juries of sentences of defendants in similar cases or the sentences of co-participants in the crime on trial is strictly prohibited under the rules of evidence." Similarly, the Kentucky [[truth in sentencing]] statute, which generally increases the information available to sentencing juries, does not provide for sentencing guidelines and statistics. Kentucky courts have also held parole eligibility statistics inadmissible. The military at one time provided [[United States military jury|jurors]] with sentencing statistics and guidelines was the military, but this practice ended in the late 1950s as the military's judicial philosophy shifted its emphasis away from sentencing uniformity and towards individualized judgments. The [[United States Court of Military Appeals]] held that jurors were not to consider sentences in similar cases or to consult the sentencing manual.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

Under Virginia's current system, jurors are controversially not allowed access to the Commonwealth's [[sentencing guidelines]] or to information about whether sentences will run consecutively or concurrently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20120401-2012-04-01-dp-nws-crime-notebook-0401-20120331-story.html|date=1 April 2012|title=Virginia judges rarely question juries' sentencing recommendations|publisher=Daily Press|author=Kelly, Ashley and Dujardin, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 2000 were also not informed that parole had been abolished in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/va_md_dc/virginia-eyes-new-sentences-after-juries-didn-t-get-key/article_1008cc74-de6f-5b77-bdd0-61c099dd9400.html|title=Virginia eyes new sentences after juries didn't get key fact|author=Durkin, Alana|publisher=Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star|date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge must justify any departure from the jury's recommendation in writing to the [[Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission]]. Less than one-quarter of jury-recommended sentences are modified by judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Caleb R.|title=Sentencing Roulette: How Virginia’s Criminal Sentencing System is Imposing an Unconstitutional Trial Penalty That Suppresses the Rights of Criminal Defendants to a Jury Trial|volume=23|journal=Wm.&amp; Mary Bill Rts. J.|number=559|date=2014|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol23/iss2/10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about juries' imposing higher sentences than what the sentencing guidelines would suggest, many defendants opt either for [[bench trial]]s or [[plea bargain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of juried trials slumps both in Va., nationwide |url=https://www.dailyprogress.com/newsvirginian/news/number-of-juried-trials-slumps-both-in-va-nationwide/article_d2dbfd5c-34cc-5d9c-b999-a9c6641783f9.html|author=Green, Frank|publisher=Daily Progress|date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with jury sentencing have often allowed judges to intervene in the sentencing process, e.g. by reducing the sentence imposed by the jury, imposing hard labor or solitary confinement in addition to the jury's assessment of fines, or determining the place of confinement imposed by the jury.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In Alabama, judges were allowed to override juries' recommendations of life imprisonment and impose capital punishment instead, until a 2017 law took that power away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/07/death_penalty_judicial_overrid.html|title=Did judicial override end in Alabama? Some say judges can still overrule jury over death penalty|date=21 July 2017|publisher=AL.com|author=Remkus, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; All jury sentencing states except Texas allow the judge to fix the punishment in case the jury fails to agree on a sentence,&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; making it impossible for there to be a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]] at sentencing.&lt;ref name=case/&gt;

==Arguments for and against jury sentencing==
Arguments that have been raised for sentencing by jury are that judges can be arbitrary (depending, e.g., on their mood at the time of sentencing) and partisan, and that putting the same person in charge of both deciding sentences and extending leniency (e.g. through pardons) centralizes too much power in one person. Also, different judges may be inconsistent in the judgments they render. Another argument in favor of jury sentencing is that the punishment equitably due is best determined by the particular circumstances of the case, rather than by legal technicalities; and that a jury is well-equipped for this purpose.&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; Also, if juries have power to give a lenient sentence, they may be less likely to engage in [[jury nullification]] by acquitting a guilty defendant whom they believe is undeserving of severe punishment.&lt;ref name=idea/&gt;

An argument based on the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendments to the United States Constitution]] is that criminal and civil juries have similar societal functions, including checking the abuse of governmental power, injecting community values into legal decisions, and aiding public acceptance of legal determinations; and therefore the criminal system should have juries decide sentences much as the civil system has juries decide judgments.&lt;ref name=booker&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kirgis, Paul F.|title=The Right to a Jury Decision on Sentencing Facts after Booker: What the Seventh Amendment Can Teach the Sixth|volume=39|journal=Ga. L. Rev.|number=897|date=2005|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/faculty_lawreviews/131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments that have been raised against sentencing by jury are that juries are not as accountable as judges; that putting them in charge of determining both guilt and the sentence concentrates too much power in one body; and that different juries may differ widely in the sentences they impose. Counterarguments are that the lack of accountability of jurors to a higher authority preserves their [[judicial independence]], and that judges are also capable of differing from other judges in the sentences they impose. Judges may even deviate from their own usual sentencing practices if the case is high-profile or a judicial election is coming up. Also, disparities are not always a sign of arbitrariness; sometimes they may reflect geographical differences in public attitudes toward a given crime, or a jury's taking proper account of the individual circumstances of each offender.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

It is sometimes argued that an unreasonable juror may force the rest of the jury into an undesirable compromise to find the defendant guilty but impose an overly light sentence. A counter-argument is that whether this is bad or good is a matter of perception since "one juror's principled holdout is another juror's irrational nullification. One jury's 'compromise' is another jury's perfectly appropriate give-and-take deliberations."&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=dlj|title=The Case for Jury Sentencing|author=Hoffman, Morris B.|journal=Duke Law Journal|volume=52|number=951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to University of Chicago Law School lecturer Jenia Iontcheva, sentencing decisions are well-suited to being made through a process of [[deliberative democracy]] rather than by experts such as judges, since they involve deeply contested moral and political issues rather than scientific or technical issues. She argues that since sentencing requires individualized, case-by-case assessments, sentences should be decided through small-scale deliberation by juries, as opposed to having lawmakers codify general policies for mechanical application by judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

An advantage Iontcheva cites of having juries come together to deliberate on sentences is that the jurors may alter their preferences in the light of new perspectives. She argues that the hearing and consideration of diverse opinions will give the sentencing decisions greater legitimacy, and that engaging ordinary citizens in government through this process of deliberative democracy will give these citizens confidence about their ability to influence political decisions and thus increase their willingness to participate in politics even after the end of their jury service. Racial and other minorities may also benefit from having greater representation among jurors than among judges.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt;

In jurisdictions that do not have any statutory provisions formally allowing jury sentencing, judges have sometimes consulted with the jury on sentencing anyway. At the federal level, the practice of polling the jury and using their input in sentencing was upheld on appeal by the [[6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/06/federal_appeals_court_upholds.html|title=Federal appeals court upholds judge's lowest possible sentence in child-porn case|author=Heisig, Eric|publisher=Cleveland.com|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing is said to be more time-consuming for jurors than the relatively easy task of ascertaining guilt or innocence,&lt;ref name=grab&gt;{{cite journal|author=Webster, Charles W.|title=Jury Sentencing - Grab-Bag Justice|volume=14|journal=Sw L.J.|number=221|date=1960|url=https://scholar.smu.edu/smulr/vol14/iss2/4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means an increase in jury fees and in the amount of productivity lost to jury duty.&lt;ref name=democratic/&gt; In [[New South Wales]], a 2007 proposal by Chief Justice [[Jim Spigelman]] to involve juries in sentencing was rejected after District Court Chief Judge [[Reg Blanch]] cited "an expected wide difference of views between jurors about questions relating to sentence". Concerns about [[jury tampering]] through intimidation by defendants were also raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/keep-juries-away-from-sentencing-say-judges-20070427-gdq067.html|title=Keep juries away from sentencing, say judges|author=Pearlman, Jonathan|date=27 April 2007|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and many other [[continental Europe]]an countries have a system in which professional judges and [[Judiciary_of_Germany#Lay_judges|lay judges]] deliberate together at both the trial and sentencing stages; such systems have been praised as a superior alternative because the mixed court dispenses with most of the time‐consuming practices of jury control that characterize Anglo‐American trial procedure, yet serves the purposes of a jury trial better than plea bargaining and bench trials, which have displaced the jury from routine American practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mixed Court and Jury Court: Could the Continental Alternative Fill the American Need?|author=Langbein, John H.|date=January 1981|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-4469.1981.tb00426.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable jury sentences==
Civil rights leader [[James Bevel]] was sentenced to 15 years in prison pursuant to the recommendation of a Virginia jury that found him guilty of having sex with his teenage daughter in the 1990s when they lived in Leesburg. The sentencing range had been 5 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=43768|title=Civil Rights Leader Convicted of Incest|author=Barakat, Matthew|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''legatus Augusti pro praetore''''' (literally: "envoy of the emperor - acting praetor") was the official title of the [[Roman governor|governor]] or general of some [[Imperial provinces|imperial]] [[Roman province|province]]s of the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Principate]] era, normally the larger ones or those where [[Roman legion|legions]] were based. Provinces were denoted imperial if their governor was selected by the emperor, in contrast to senatorial provinces, whose governors (called [[proconsul]]s) were elected by the [[Roman Senate]].

A ''legatus Augusti'' was always a senator of consular or praetorian rank (i.e. who had previously held the office of [[Roman consul|consul]] or [[praetor]]). However, the position of the governor of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] (''[[praefectus Aegypti]]'') was unparalleled, for though an ''[[Eques (ancient Rome)|eques]]'' (Roman knight) he had legions under his command. Some smaller imperial provinces where no legions were based (e.g. [[Mauretania]], [[Thrace (Roman province)|Thrace]], [[Rhaetia]], [[Noricum]], and [[Judaea (Roman province)|Judaea]]) were administered by equestrian ''praefecti'' (prefects) later designated ''procuratores'' ([[procurator (Roman)|procurator]]s) who commanded only [[auxilia]]ry forces. The ''legatus Augusti'' was both the head of the provincial administration, chief judicial officer and commander-in-chief of all military forces based in the province (legions and auxiliaries). The only function outside the remit of the ''legatus'' was finance (the collection of imperial taxes and revenues), which was handled by an independent ''procurator'', who reported direct to the emperor.

In the military hierarchy, the ''legatus'' ' direct subordinates were the ''[[legatus legionis|legati legionis]]'' (the commanders of the legions based in the province), who in turn commanded the ''[[tribunus militum|tribuni militum]]'' (the legion's senior staff officers) and the ''praefecti'' (commanders) of the auxiliary regiments attached to the legion.

In AD 68, 15 out of a total of 36 provinces were ruled by ''legati Augusti'': [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], [[Lusitania]], [[Gallia Aquitania]], [[Gallia Lugdunensis]], [[Gallia Belgica]], [[Britannia]], [[Germania Inferior]], [[Germania Superior]], [[Moesia]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]], [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], [[Lycia et Pamphylia]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Numidia]].&lt;ref&gt;CAH X 369 (Table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manitoba Grey Party''' was a political party in [[Manitoba]], Canada, focusing on senior's issues.  The party appears to have been founded in 2002, at the same time as the [[Grey Party of Canada]] and other provincial Grey Parties.

The national party was formed to address the health needs of seniors, and was particularly concerned with the high cost of prescription drugs.  It also promoted a "[[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]" ideology on other issues, claiming that Canada's legal profession held too much sway over government policy.  It is likely that the provincial party advocated similar positions.

The Grey Party may have attempted to register with [[Elections Manitoba]] before the 2003 provincial election; if so, it was unsuccessful.  The party does not appear to have sponsored any candidates in the election.

The [[Grey Party of Canada]] seems to have collapsed later in 2003, and it is not clear if the Manitoba organization still exists.

The Manitoba Grey Party's first (and perhaps only) leader was Lou Hemming.

Marcus Simon Cooper was born around 1967.&lt;ref name=ES/&gt;

==Career==
In 1991, he founded the Marcus Cooper Group,&lt;ref name=MCG_01&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcus Cooper – Who We Are|url=http://www.marcuscooper.com/about-us/|website=Marcus Cooper Group|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a property developing, trading and investment company.&lt;ref name=MCG_02&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcus Cooper – What We Do|url=http://www.marcuscooper.com/about-us/what.php|website=Marcus Cooper Group|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also runs West End Investments Limited, set up in 2013,&lt;ref name=CompaniesHouse_02&gt;{{cite web|title=West End Investments Limited|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08513614|website=Companies House|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from offices at 16 [[Finchley Road]], London NW8.

In 2007 Cooper bought [[Witanhurst]] in Highgate, London's second largest private residence after Buckingham Palace, for £30 million, and sold it 2008 for £50 million.&lt;ref name=ES&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bill|first1=Peter|title=Wapping plan shows Cooper is no mini|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/business/markets/wapping-plan-shows-cooper-is-no-mini-7312366.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=27 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

In 2012, the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' reported that Cooper's companies owned over 1000 rental properties and "are involved in 50 development projects with an end value of £1.5 billion."&lt;ref name=ES /&gt;

In 2013, Cooper bought the UK's "most expensive terraced house", 1 Cornwall Terrace, for £80 million.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brennan|first1=Morgan|title=U.K.'s Most Expensive Terraced House Fetches $120 Million From Property Mogul|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2013/03/12/u-k-s-most-expensive-terraced-house-fetches-120-million-from-property-mogul/|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Forbes|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Cooper obtained a 150-year lease on five properties at 6–10 Cambridge Terrace and 1–2 Chester Gate, close to Regent's Park, in order to have them combined to create a £200 million seven-storey "supermansion", with 15 bedrooms and 35 bathrooms.&lt;ref name=MT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haslett|first1=Emma|title=Why London's new 'supermansion' could be its last|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/1186419/why-londons-new-supermansion-its-last/|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=Management Today|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that fellow property developer [[Christian Candy]] had bought the "seven Grade I-listed John Nash townhouses" from Cooper for about £100 million, using a British Virgin Islands company.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neate|first1=Rupert|title=Candy brothers: ‘One day they were likely lads, then they were everywhere’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/20/candy-brothers-nick-christian-property-tycoons-brand-opulence|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=The Guardian|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Cooper's West End Investments bought [[The Star, St John’s Wood]] from the pub company [[Punch Taverns]] for £2.1 million, and attempted to get planning permission to turn it into a luxury house. This was unsuccessful and it is now an [[estate agent]].&lt;ref name=ES_20131210&gt;{{cite news|title=Unhappy hour: Backlash as two historic London inns are sold for £3.7million to become homes|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/unhappy-hour-backlash-as-two-historic-london-inns-are-sold-for-37million-to-become-homes-8994916.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ES_20150413&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blunden|first1=Mark|title=St John’s Wood pub The Star becomes estate agency despite protection order|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/st-john-s-wood-pub-the-star-becomes-estate-agency-despite-protection-order-10172440.html|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political donations==
In May 2013, Cooper donated £100,000 to the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], in addition to £65,000 previously donated by Cooper and his company.&lt;ref name=MorningStar&gt;{{cite news|title=New Homes, Yes – But Not For The Likes Of Us|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-beb4-New-homes,-yes-but-not-for-the-likes-of-us#.VdCaspe6J_E|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=The Morning Star|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">'''Multi-party authorization''' ('''MPA''') is a process to protect a [[telecommunications network]], [[data center]] or [[industrial control system]] from undesirable acts by a malicious insider or inexperienced technician acting alone. MPA requires that a second authorized user approve an action before it is allowed to take place. This pro-actively protects data or systems from an undesirable act.

==Architecture==

Existing methods to protect data and systems from the malicious insider include [[auditing]], [[job rotation]] and [[separation of duties]]. Auditing is a reactive method meant to discover who did what after the fact. Job rotation and separation of duties are limiting techniques meant to minimize prolonged access to sensitive data or systems in order to limit undesirable acts. In contrast, MPA is a pro-active solution.

An advantage MPA has over other methods to protect from undesirable acts by a malicious insider or inexperienced operator is that MPA is pro-active and prevents data or systems from compromise by a single entity acting alone. MPA prevents the initial undesirable act rather than dealing with a breach or compromise after the fact.

==Application==

Multi-party authorization technology can secure the most vulnerable and sensitive activities and data sources from attack by a compromised insider acting alone. It is somewhat analogous to weapons systems that require two individuals to turn two different keys in order to enable the system. One person cannot do it alone. Another example is to consider access to a lock box in a bank. That access requires multiple parties, one the lock box owner and another a bank official. Both individuals act together to access the lock box, while neither could do so alone. MPA, in like manner, ensures that a second set of eyes reviews and approves of activity involving critical or sensitive data or systems before the action takes place.

Multi-party authorization is suitable for a wide variety of applications. MPA can be implemented to protect any type of sensitive data in electronic form or any activity within a network infrastructure or computerized control system. An [[electronic health record]] is an example of a data record that could be protected by MPA. Multi-party authorization provides pro-active protection from undesirable acts by the inexperienced technician or malicious insider.

== Background ==
{{Trim|{{#section-h:Renaud Camus|The Great Replacement conspiracy theory}}}}

{{Trim|{{#section-h:The Great Replacement conspiracy theory|Origins}}}}

== History ==
In a public address in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]—the village where [[Charles de Gaulle]] is buried—Renaud Camus announced the foundation of the National Council of European Resistance and asked for a collective European commitment.&lt;ref name=zuquete group=b /&gt;

{{Quote|text=All the European nations are invited to lead by our side the fight for the salvation of our common civilization, Celtic, Slavic, Greco-Latin, Judeo-Christian, and free-thinking.|author=Renaud Camus|source=}}

=== Etymology ===
The name ''Conseil national de la résistance européenne'' is a reference to the coordinating body of the [[French Resistance]] during the [[Military history of France during World War II|German occupation of France]]—the [[National Council of the Resistance]].

When asked how the CNRE could be both national and European, [[Renaud Camus]] replied:
{{Quote|text=The Council is national in that each and every nation is responsible for defending its independence and protecting its culture. It is European because our civilisational struggle must be fought in concert with and by all Europeans.|author=Renaud Camus}}

== Membership ==
=== Council ===
As of June 2018, members of the CNRE include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Noocracy''' ({{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|ˈ|ɒ|k|r|ə|s|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|ə|k|r|ə|s|i}}), or "[[aristocracy]] of the wise", as defined by [[Plato]], is a social and political system that is "based on the priority of human mind", according to [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}} It was also further developed in the writings of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word itself is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] '''[[nous]]''', Gen. '''noos''' (νους) meaning "[[mind]]" or "[[intellect]]", and "kratos" (κράτος), "[[authority]]" or "[[Power (sociology)|power]]".

== Development ==
One of the first attempts to implement such a political system was perhaps [[Pythagoras]]' "city of the wise" that he planned to build in Italy together with his followers, the order of "[[Pythagoreanism|mathematikoi]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In modern history, similar concepts were introduced by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who did not use this term, but the term "[[noosphere]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

As defined by [[Plato]], noocracy is considered to be the future political system for the entire human race, replacing [[democracy]] ("the authority of the crowd") and other forms of government.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[Mikhail Epstein]] defined noocracy as "the thinking matter increases its mass in nature and geo- and biosphere grow into noosphere, the future of the humanity can be envisioned as noocracy—that is the power of the collective brain rather than separate individuals representing certain social groups or society as whole".{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Publications ==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=July 2013}}

In the [[European Commission]] Community Research publication, ''Art &amp; Scientific Research are Free: Towards a Culture of Life'', it states several commentaries by [[Hans Jonas]] and especially Ladislav Kovác about Noocracy.&lt;ref&gt;''Art &amp; Scientific Research Are Free'', European Commission, European Commission Community research, Semar Publishers Srl, 2005, {{ISBN|88-7778-102-5}}, {{ISBN|978-88-7778-102-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Plato called his conception of governments a "sophocracy," then a political system characterized by social experimentation with a scientific institutionalized base could be called a "noocracy." Noocracy would not be the reign of the philosopher-king as seen in Plato. Nor would it be governed by science or the scientists. Power, a power acquired and maintained according to the laws of competition, would remain in the hands of the political elites but with these elites being professionally trained, making the most of the analysis, the forecasts and the propositions emanating from a vast array of advisory groups made up of experts from all areas of science, and setting up fieldwork experiments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Take for example the current controversy about [[genetically modified food]] or [[genetically modified organism|organisms]] (GMO), a textbook case about setting up such a policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Within a noocracy in its own right, GMO would be tested in one or several areas or nations and scientifically monitored by all, under the aegis of a main administration body. With, at the end of the day, the costs and profits equitably shared by all. The principle of precaution, highly controversial at the present time, would then be applied, without slowing-down nor impeding the implementation of scientific inventions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Rationales for noocracy ==

=== Irrationality of voters ===
Supporters of the noocratic theory mainly depart from the empirical evidence that most voters in modern democracies are largely ignorant, misinformed and irrational.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Therefore, ''one person one vote'' mechanism proposed by democracy cannot be used to produce efficient policy outcomes, for which the transfer of power to a smaller, informed and rational group would be more appropriate. The irrationality of voters inherent in democracies can be explained by two major behavioral and cognitive patterns. Firstly, most of the voters think that the marginal contribution of their vote will not make a difference on election outcomes; therefore, they do not find it useful to inform themselves on political matters.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This psychological phenomenon causes voters to strongly identify themselves with a certain political group, specifically find evidence to support arguments aligning with their preferred ideological inclinations, and eventually vote with a high level of bias.

=== Democracy's susceptibility for bad policies ===
Irrational political behaviors of voters prevent them from making calculated choices and opting for the right policy proposals. On the other hand, many political experiments have shown that as voters get more informed, they tend to support better policies, demonstrating that acquisition of information has a direct impact on rational voting. For example, Martin Gilens notes in his research that low-income democrats tend to have more intolerant thoughts pertinent to LGBT rights, whereas high-income democrats have the opposite preferences.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Moreover, supporters of noocracy see a greater danger in the fact that politicians will actually prefer to implement the policy decisions of citizens to win elections and stabilize their power, without paying particular attention to the content and further outcomes of these policies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Jason|date=2018-02-01|title=Does the Demographic Objection to Epistocracy Succeed?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11158-017-9385-y|journal=Res Publica|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=53–71|doi=10.1007/s11158-017-9385-y|issn=1356-4765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In democracies, the problem is thus not only that voters are prone to make bad policy decisions, but also that politicians are incentivized to implement these policies due to personal benefits. Therefore, noocrats argue that it makes sense to limit the voting power of citizens in order to prevent bad policy outcomes.

=== Use of expertise for efficient outcomes ===
According to noocrats, given the complex nature of political decisions, it is not reasonable to assume that a citizen would have the necessary knowledge to decide on means to achieve their political aims. In general, political actions require a lot of social scientific knowledge from various fields, such as economics, sociology, international relations, and public policy; however, an ordinary voter is hardly specialized enough in any of those fields to make the optimal decision. To address this issue, Christiano proposes a ruling system based on division of political labor, in which citizens set the agenda for political discussions and determine the aims of the society, whereas legislators are in charge of deciding on the means to achieve these aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rule of the Many|last=Christiano|first=Thomas|publisher=CO: Westview|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For noocrats, transferring the decision-making mechanism to a body of specifically trained, specialized and experienced body is expected to result in superior and more efficient policy outcomes. Recent economic success of some countries that have a sort of noocratic ruling element provides basis for this particular argument in favor of noocracy.

For instance, Singapore has a political system that favors meritocracy; the path to government in Singapore is structured in such a way that only those with above-average skills are identified with strict university-entrance exams, recruiting processes, etc., and then rigorously trained to be able to devise best the solutions that benefit the entire society. In the words of country’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The China Model: Political Meritocracy and the Limits of Democracy|last=Bell|first=D.A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system primarily works due to citizens’ belief that political leaders tend to have a better understanding of country’s long-term plans than themselves; therefore, as they see positive policy outcomes, they tend to go along with the system, rather than complain about the meritocratic dimensions. For example, most citizens praise their government in Singapore, stating that it managed to transform Singapore from a third world country to a developed economy, and that it successfully fostered loyalty in its citizens towards the country and gave birth to a unique concept of Singaporean citizenship despite a great level of ethnic diversity. In order to develop further Singapore’s technocratic system, some thinkers, like Parag Khanna, have proposed for the country to adapt a model of direct technocracy, demanding citizen input in essential matters through online polls, referenda, etc., and asking for a committee of experts to analyze this data to determine the best course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khanna|first=Parag|date=2017-07-01|title=Swiss Direct Democracy + Singapore's Smart Rulers = Direct Technocracy|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/npqu.12093|journal=New Perspectives Quarterly|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=40–42|doi=10.1111/npqu.12093|issn=1540-5842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rejection of demographic unjustness of noocracy ===
Proponents of democracy attempt to show that noocracy is intrinsically unjust on two dimensions, using the ''unfairness'' and ''bad results'' arguments. The former states that since people with different income levels and education backgrounds have unequal access to information, the epistocratic legislative body will be naturally composed of citizens with higher economic status, and thus fail to equally represent different demographics of the society. The latter argument is about the policy outcomes; since there will be a demographic overrepresentation and underrepresentation in the noocratic body, the system will produce unjust outcomes, favoring the demographically advantaged group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brennan defends noocracy against these two criticisms, presenting a rationale for the system.

As a rejection of the unfairness argument put forward by democrats, Brennan argues that the voting electorate in modern democracies is also demographically disproportionate; based on empirical studies, it has been demonstrated that voters coming from privileged background, such as white, middle aged, higher-income men, tend to vote at a higher rate than other demographic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although de jure every group has same right to vote under ''one person one vote'' assumption, de facto practices show that privileged people have more influence on election results. As a result, the representatives will not match the demographics of the society either, for which democracy seems to be unjust in practice. With the right of type of noocracy, the unfairness effect can actually be minimized; for instance, enfranchisement lottery, in which a legislative electorate is selected at random by lottery, and then incentivized to become competent to address political issues, illustrates a fair representation methodology thanks to its randomness.

To refute the latter claim, Brennan states that voters do not vote selfishly; in other terms, the advantaged group does not attempt to undermine the interests of the minority group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, the worry that noocratic bodies that are demographically more skewed towards the advantaged group make decisions in favor of the advantaged one fails. According to Brennan, noocracy can serve in a way that improves the welfare of the overall community, rather than certain individuals.

==Criticisms==

Noocracies, like [[technocracies]], have been criticized for [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] failings, such as upholding of a non-egalitarian aristocratic ruling class. Others have upheld more democratic ideals as better [[Epistemic democracy|epistemic]] models of law and policy. Noocracy criticisms come in multiple forms, two of which are those focused on the efficacy of noocracies and the political viability of them.

Criticisms of noocracy in all its forms - including [[technocracy]], [[meritocracy]], and epistocracy (the focus of [[Jason Brennan]]'s oft-cited book) - range from support of direct democracy instead to proposed alterations to our consideration of representation in democracy. Professor Hélène Landemore, while arguing for representatives to effectively enact legislation important to the polity, criticizes conceptions of representation that aim especially to remove the people from the process of making decisions, and thereby nullify their political power.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landemore|first=Hélène|date=2017|title=Deliberative Democracy as Open, Not (Just) Representative Democracy|url=|journal=Daedalus, the Journal of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noocracy, especially as it is conceived in Jason Brennan's ''Against Democracy'', aims specifically to separate the people from the decision on the basis of the immensely superior knowledge of officials who will presumably make superior decisions to laypeople.

=== Noocracy as anti-democratic ===
Jason Brennan's epistocracy, specifically, is at odds what is commonly considered the supreme form of government - democracy - and with certain criteria for democracies that theorists have proposed. [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]]'s ''Polyarchy'' sets out certain rules for democracies that govern many people and the rights that the citizens must be granted. His demand that the government not discriminatorily heed the preferences of full members of the polity is abridged by Brennan's "restricted suffrage" and "plural voting" schemes of epistocracy.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49414698|title=Polyarchy : participation and opposition|last=1915-2014.|first=Dahl, Robert A.,|date=1971|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300015652|location=New Haven|oclc=49414698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In the eighth chapter of his book, Brennan posits a system of graduated voting power that gives people more votes based on established levels of education achieved, with the amount of additional votes granted to a hypothetical citizen increasing at each level, from turning sixteen to completing high school, a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, and so forth.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Dahl wrote, however, that any democracy that rules over a large group of people must accept and validate "alternative sources of information."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Granting the full powers of citizenship based on a system like formal education attainment does not account for the other ways that people can consume information, is the commonly cited argument, and still eschews consideration for the uneducated within a group.

=== Inefficiency of experts ===
Noocracy also receives criticism for its claims to efficiency. Brennan writes that one of the many reasons that common people cannot be trusted to make decisions for the state is because reasoning is commonly motivated, and, therefore, people decide what policies to support based on their connection to those proposing and supporting the measures, not based on what's most effective. He contrasts real people with the ultra-reasonable vulcan that he mentions throughout the book.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/942707357|title=Against democracy|last=1979-|first=Brennan, Jason,|isbn=9780691162607|location=Princeton|oclc=942707357}}&lt;/ref&gt; That vulcan reflects Plato's [[philosopher king]] and, in a more realistic sense, the academic elites whom Michael Yong satirized in his essay ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} The Republic by Plato|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28420501|title=The rise of the meritocracy|last=1915-2002,|first=Young, Michael Dunlop,|isbn=9781560007043|location=New Brunswick (U.S.A)|oclc=28420501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern political theorists don't necessarily denounce a biased viewpoint in politics, however, though those biases are not written about as they are commonly considered. Professor Landemore utilizes the existence of cognitive diversity to argue that any group of people that represents great diversity in their approaches to problem-solving (cognition) is more likely to succeed than groups that do not.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landemore|first=Hélène|date=2013-05-01|title=Deliberation, cognitive diversity, and democratic inclusiveness: an epistemic argument for the random selection of representatives|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-012-0062-6|journal=Synthese|language=en|volume=190|issue=7|pages=1209–1231|doi=10.1007/s11229-012-0062-6|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further illustrates her point by employing the example of a New Haven task force made up of private citizens of many careers, politicians, and police who needed to reduce crime on a bridge without lighting, and they all used different aspects of their experiences to discover the solution that was to install solar lamps on the bridge. That solution has proven effective, with not a single mugging reported there since the lamp installation as of November 2010.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Her argument lies mainly in the refutation of noocratic principles, for they do not utilize the increased problem solving skill of a diverse pool, when the political system because as debate between elites alone, and not a debate between the whole polity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

To some theorists, noocracy is built on a fantasy that will uphold current structures of elite power, while maintaining its inefficacy. Writing for the ''New Yorker'', Caleb Crain notes that there's little to say that the vulcans that Brennan exalt actually exist.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy|title=The Case Against Democracy|last=Crain|first=Caleb|date=2016-10-31|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crain mentions a study that appears in Brennan's book that shows that even those who have proven that they have superb skills in mathematics do not employ those skills if their use threatens their already-held political belief. While Brennan utilized that study to demonstrate how deeply rooted political tribalism is in all people, Crain drew on this study to question the very nature of an epistocratic body that can make policy with a greater regard to knowledge and truth than the ordinary citizen can.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The only way to correct for that seems, to many, to be to widen the circle of deliberation (as discussed above) because policy decisions that were made with more input and approval from the people last longer and even garner the agreement of the experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maboudi|first=Tofigh|date=2016|title=Crowdsourcing the Egyptian  Constitution: Social Media, Elites,  and the Populace|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69 |issue=4|pages=716–731|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; To further illustrate that experts, too, are flawed, Cairn enumerates some of the expert-endorsed political decisions that he has deemed failures in recent years: "invading Iraq, having a single European currency, grinding subprime mortgages into the sausage known as collateralized debt obligations."&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

With the contention around the reasoning for those political decisions, political theorist David Estlund posited what he considered to be one of the prime arguments against epistocracy - bias in choosing voters.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/647843193|title=Democratic authority : a philosophical framework|last=M.|first=Estlund, David|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831548|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=647843193}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fear was that the method by which voters, and voters' quantity of votes, was chosen might be biased in a way that people had not been able to identify and could not, therefore, rectify.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Even the aspects of the modes of selecting voters that are known cause many theorists concern, as both Brennan and Cairn note that the majority of poor black women would be excluded from the enfranchised polity and risk seeing their needs represented even less than they currently are.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The '''Official Irish Republican Army''' or '''Official IRA''' ('''OIRA''') was an [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] paramilitary group whose goal was to remove [[Northern Ireland]] from the [[United Kingdom]] and create a "[[socialist state|workers' republic]]" encompassing [[United Ireland|all of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Statement from Cathal Goulding, C/S of the Official IRA, in early 1972, quoted in ''On Our Knees'' by Rosita Sweetman, Pan Books, London. 1972. {{ISBN|0-330-23320-3}}. p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged in December 1969, shortly after the beginning of [[the Troubles]], when the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] split into two factions. The other was the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]]. Each continued to call itself simply "the IRA" and rejected the other's legitimacy. Unlike the "Provisionals", the "Officials" were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist]] and worked to form a [[united front]] with other Irish [[communist]] groups, named the '''Irish National Liberation Front''' ('''NLF''').&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Tim Pat.

It waged a limited campaign against the British Army, mainly involving shooting and bombing attacks on troops in urban working-class neighbourhoods. Most notably, it was involved in the 1970 [[Falls Curfew]] and carried out the [[1972 Aldershot bombing]]. In May 1972, it declared a ceasefire and vowed to limit its actions to defence and retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first= Jack |year=1994|title=INLA: Deadly Divisions|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Dublin|publisher= Torc|isbn= 1-898142-05-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the Provisional IRA had become the larger and more active faction. Following the ceasefire, the OIRA began to be referred to as "Group B" within the Official movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Andrew. ''Inside the IRA: Dissident Republicans and the War for Legitimacy''.

It has also been involved in [[organized crime]] and [[vigilante|vigilantism]].

The Official IRA was linked to the political party Official Sinn Féin, later renamed Sinn Féin the Workers Party and then the [[Workers' Party of Ireland]].

== The split in the Republican movement, 1969–1970 ==

===The shift to the left===
The split in the [[Irish Republican Army]], soon followed by a parallel split in [[Sinn Féin]], was the result of the dissatisfaction of more traditional and militant [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] at the political direction taken by the leadership. The particular object of their discontent was Sinn Féin's ending of its policy of [[abstentionism]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. This issue is a key one in republican ideology, as traditional republicans regarded the Irish state as illegitimate and maintained that their loyalty was due only to the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 and in their view, represented by the IRA Army Council.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, {{ISBN|1-84488-120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the republican movement under the leadership of [[Cathal Goulding]] radically re-assessed their ideology and tactics after the dismal failure of the IRA's [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] in the years 1956–62. They were heavily influenced by [[popular front]] ideology and drew close to [[communist]] thinking. A key intermediary body was the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]'s organisation for Irish exiles, the [[Connolly Association]]. The [[Marxist analysis]] was that the conflict in Northern Ireland was a "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] nationalist" one between the [[Ulster Protestant]] and [[Irish Catholic]] [[working class]]es, fomented and continued by the [[ruling class]]. Its effect was to depress wages, since worker could be set against worker. They concluded that the first step on the road to a [[Counties of Ireland|32-county]] [[socialist republic]] in [[Ireland]] was the "democratisation" of [[Northern Ireland]] (i.e., the removal of discrimination against Catholics) and radicalisation of the southern working class. This would allow "class politics" to develop, eventually resulting in a challenge to the hegemony of both what they termed "[[British imperialism]]" and the respective [[Irish unionism|unionist]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] establishments north and south of the Irish border.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, pp. 22–70, {{ISBN|1-84488-120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goulding and those close to him argued that, in the context of sectarian division in Northern Ireland, a military campaign against the British presence would be counter-productive, since it would delay the day when the workers would unite around social and economic issues.

The sense that the IRA seemed to be drifting away from its conventional republican roots into [[Marxism]] angered more traditional republicans. The radicals viewed Ulster Protestants with unionist views as "fellow Irishmen deluded by bourgeois loyalties, who needed to be engaged in dialectical debate"{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. As a result, they were reluctant to use force to defend Catholic areas of [[Belfast]] when they came under attack from [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalists]]—a role the IRA had performed since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first= Jack |year=1994|title=INLA:Divisions|pages=8–10|location=Dublin|publisher= Torc|isbn= 1-898142-05-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] marches began in 1968, there had been many cases of street violence. The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) had been shown on television in undisciplined baton charges, and had already killed five non-combatant civilians, three were children. The [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]]'s "marching season" during the summer of 1969 had been characterised by violence on both sides, which culminated in the three-day "[[Battle of the Bogside]]" in [[Derry]].

===August 1969 riots===

The critical moment came in August 1969 when there was a major outbreak of intercommunal violence in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]], with eight deaths, six of them Catholics, and whole streets ablaze. On 14–15 August loyalists burned out several Catholic streets in Belfast in the [[Northern Ireland riots of August 1969]]. IRA units offered resistance, however very few weapons were available for the defence of Catholic areas. Many local IRA figures, and ex-IRA members such as [[Joe Cahill]] and [[Billy McKee]], were incensed by what they saw as the leadership's decision not to take sides and in September, they announced that they would no longer be taking orders from the Goulding leadership.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party'', Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontent was not confined to the northern IRA units. In the south also, such figures as [[Ruairí Ó Brádaigh]] and [[Sean MacStiofain]] opposed both the leadership's proposed recognition of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This increasing political divergence led to a formal split at the 1969 IRA Convention, held in December. when a group led by Ó Brádaigh and MacStiofán walked out. The split resulted from a vote at the first IRA Convention where a two-thirds majority voted that republicans should take their seats if elected to the British, Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland Parliaments. At a second convention, a group consisting of Mac Stiofáin, [[Dáithí Ó Conaill]], Ó Brádaigh, Joe Cahill, Paddy Mulcahy, Leo Martin, and Sean Tracey, were elected as the "Provisional" Army Council. Their supporters included [[Seamus Twomey]].

Accounts at that time suggest that the IRA members split roughly in half, with those loyal to the Goulding-led "Official" IRA prominent in some areas while the Provisional IRA were prominent in others.&lt;ref&gt;See "The numerous faces of the I.R.A." This Week, 29 May 1970; J. Bowyer Bell, The Secret Army, pp. 367, 377&lt;/ref&gt; IRA historian J. Bowyer Bell stated, with respect to the Provisional IRA: "There was some support in Belfast, although less than claimed" (p.&amp;nbsp;367).{{citation needed|reason=Page 367 of what?|date=January 2017}} A strong area for the Official IRA in Belfast was the Lower Falls and Markets district, which were under the command of [[Billy McMillen]]. Other OIRA units were located in Derry, [[Newry]], [[Strabane]], Dublin, and [[Wicklow]] and other parts of Belfast. However, the Provisionals would rapidly become the dominant faction, both as a result of intensive recruitment in response to the sectarian violence and because some Official IRA units (such as the [[Strabane]] company) later defected to them.&lt;ref&gt;Eamon Mallie, Patrick Bishop, Provisional IRA, p144&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a similar ideological split in [[Sinn Féin]] after a contentious 1970 Sinn Féin [[Ard Fheis]]. The leadership of Sinn Féin passed a motion to recognise the Parliaments in London, Dublin and Stormont but failed to attain the prerequisite two-thirds majority necessary to change Sinn Féin's constitutional opposition to 'partitionist' assemblies. Those defeated in the motion walked out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-LZtivJYJwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Self,+Identity,+and+Social+Movements&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eFfqUaXsK6uN4gTswYGICg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Self%2C%20Identity%2C%20and%20Social%20Movements&amp;f=false Self, Identity, and Social Movements], [[Sheldon Stryker]], Timothy Joseph Owens, Robert William White, (2000), p333&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a split into two groups with the Sinn Féin name. Those supportive of [[Seán Mac Stiofáin]]'s "Provisional Army Council", were referred to in the media as Provisional Sinn Féin&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mtazQUWbUmsC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=provisional+sinn+fein&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AlTqUYnqH6el4gTI0YDQBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=provisional%20sinn%20fein&amp;f=false ''Assassin''], John Bowyer Bell, (1979), p118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinn Féin, 1905–2005:
in the shadow of gunmen, Kevin Rafter, (2005), p76&lt;/ref&gt; or 'Sinn Féin Kevin St' and contested elections as Sinn Féin. The other group, under the leadership of [[Tomás Mac Giolla]], was to contest elections first as 'Official Sinn Féín', then [[Sinn Féin The Workers' Party]] and aligned itself with the Official IRA, as the Marxist faction had come to be known. The party retained the historic Sinn Féin headquarters of Gardiner Street, thus giving legitimacy to its claim, in the eyes of some, to be the legitimate successor of that party. It was briefly known popularly as 'Sinn Féin Gardiner Place'.

The Officials were known as the "Stickies" because they sold stick-on [[Easter Lily (badge)|lilies]] to commemorate the [[Easter Rising]]; the Provisionals, by contrast, were known as "Pinnies" (pejoratively "Pinheads") because they produced pinned-on lilies. The term Stickies stuck, although Pinnies (and Pinheads) disappeared, in favour of the nickname "Provos" and for a time, "Provies".
(The paper-and-pin Easter Lily of the IRA was the traditional commemorative badge of the Easter Rising,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/18577 The Easter Lily] An Phoblacht, 5 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the self-adhesive Easter Lily of the Officials was a novel invention, symbolic of the divergence of opinion between them).

== Impact of the split ==
Initially there was much confusion among republicans on the ground; [[Martin McGuinness]] for example, joined the Official IRA in 1970, unaware that there had been a split and only later joined the Provisionals. The Provisionals eventually extended their [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|armed campaign]] from defence of Catholic areas. Despite the reluctance of Cathal Goulding and the OIRA leadership, their volunteers on the ground were inevitably drawn into the violence. The Official IRA's first major confrontation with the British Army came in the [[Falls Curfew]] of July 1970, when over 3,000 British soldiers raided the Lower Falls area for arms, leading to three days of gun battles. The Official IRA lost a large amount of weaponry, and their members on the ground blamed the Provisionals for starting the firing and then leaving them alone to face the British. The bad feeling left by this and other incidents led to a feud between the two IRAs in 1970, with several shootings carried out by either side. The two IRA factions arranged a truce between them after the OIRA killing of Provisional activist, and Belfast brigade D-Company commander, Charlie Hughes (a cousin of the well-known Provisional [[Brendan Hughes]]).

Soviet defector [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] alleged in the 1990s that the Goulding leadership sought, in 1969, a small quantity of arms (roughly 70 rifles, along with some hand guns and explosives) from the [[KGB]]. The request was approved and the weapons reportedly arrived in Ireland in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Mitrokhin Archive pp492 - 503&lt;/ref&gt; although this has not been independently verified. On the whole, the OIRA had a more restricted level of activity than the Provisionals. Unlike the Provisionals, it did not establish ''[[de facto]]'' control over large Catholic areas of Belfast and Derry and its use of force was more defensive. However it retained a strong presence in certain localities, notably the Lower [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]], [[Andersonstown]], [[Turf Lodge]] and the Markets areas of Belfast, along with a strong presence in Derry (particularly [[Free Derry]] in the [[Bogside]] area) as well as [[Newry]] and South [[County Down]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cedarlounge.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/orm205.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramilitary campaign==

While the OIRA occasionally fought the British Army and the RUC throughout 1970 (as well as the Provisional IRA during a 1970 feud), they did not have a strong paramilitary presence until early 1971. In August 1971, after the introduction of [[Operation Demetrius|internment without trial]], OIRA units fought numerous gun battles with British troops who were deployed to arrest suspected republicans.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The Official IRA company in the Markets area of Belfast, led by [[Joe McCann]], held off an incursion into the area by over 600 British troops.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Holland, Henry McDonald, Deadly Divisions, p10&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1971, the Official IRA killed [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) Senator [[John Barnhill (politician)|John Barnhill]] at his home in [[Strabane]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This was the first murder of a politician in [[Northern Ireland]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]] since the assassination of [[Irish Free State|Free State]] Minister for Justice [[Kevin O'Higgins]] in 1927. In February 1972, the organisation also made an attempt on the life of UUP  politician [[John Taylor, Baron Kilclooney|John Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=John Taylor: Profile |first= |last= |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=30 January 2001 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1144830.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], an OIRA man in [[Derry]] is believed by the [[Saville Inquiry]] to have fired a shot with a revolver at British troops, after they had shot dead 13 civil rights demonstrators {{ndash}} the only republican shots fired on the day and contrary to his orders.&lt;ref&gt;"Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume I – Chapter 3". Saville Bloody Sunday Inquiry. 15 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The anger caused by Bloody Sunday among Irish people was such that the Official IRA announced that it would launch an "offensive" against British forces.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

However, the OIRA declared a [[ceasefire]] later in the same year.&lt;ref name="bbc2973759"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/30/newsid_2973000/2973759.stm|title=30 May 1972: Official IRA declares ceasefire|work=On this day|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceasefire, on 30 May,&lt;ref name="bbc2973759"/&gt; followed a number of armed actions which had been politically damaging. The organisation [[1972 Aldershot Bombing|bombed]] the [[Aldershot]] headquarters of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] (the main perpetrators of Bloody Sunday), but killed only six civilians and a Roman Catholic army chaplain.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} After the killing of William Best, a Catholic British soldier home on leave in Derry, the OIRA declared a ceasefire. In addition, the death of several militant OIRA figures such as Joe McCann in confrontations with British soldiers, enabled the Goulding leadership to call off their armed campaign, which it had never supported wholeheartedly.

== After 1972 ==

Although formally on ceasefire (except for "defensive actions") since 1972, the Official IRA continued some attacks on British forces up until mid-1973, killing seven British soldiers in what it termed "retaliatory attacks". In addition, the OIRA's weapons were used intermittently in the ongoing feud with the Provisionals. This flared up into violence on several occasions, notably in October 1975. 11 republicans on either side were killed in the feud and a nine-year-old girl was shot dead by the Provisionals when they tried to shoot her father.

In 1974, radical elements within the organisation who objected to the ceasefire, led by [[Seamus Costello]], established the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA). Another feud ensued in the first half of 1975, during which three INLA and five OIRA members were killed. The dead included prominent members of both organisations including Costello and the OIRA O/C, [[Billy McMillen]]. However, from the mid-1970s onwards, the Official republican movement became increasingly focused on achieving its aims through left-wing constitutional politics. This did not stop sporadic paramilitary activity from the OIRA, who on 8 September 1979 killed Hugh O'Halloran in a [[punishment beating]] in the Ballymurphy area of Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1979.html Sutton Index of Deaths – 1979] Conflict Archive on the INternet&lt;/ref&gt; O' Halloran was beaten to death with [[Hurley (stick)|hurley sticks]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''1169 and Counting''. Retrieved 23-01-11&lt;/ref&gt; The two OIRA men who carried out the killing turned themselves in to the RUC; both were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment in the [[Maze Prison|Maze]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The army lost a number of members who gradually drifted away from the ceasefire up to shortly after the [[1981 Hunger Strike]], many either joining the Provisional IRA or the INLA or some simply dropping out.

From 1981 on, Sinn Féin the Workers Party, renamed the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] the following year, had some success in the Republic of Ireland, but little in the North.

Throughout the 1980s, allegations that the Official IRA remained in existence and was engaged in criminal activity appeared in the Irish press. In June 1982 the feud with the INLA flared again after OIRA member [[James Flynn (Official IRA member)|James Flynn]], the alleged assassin of Seamus Costello,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch82.htm A Chronology of the Conflict – 1982] Conflict Archive on the INternet&lt;/ref&gt; was shot dead by the INLA in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1982.html Sutton Index of Deaths – 1982] Conflict Archive on the Internet&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1985 five men, including Anthony McDonagh, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to defraud the Inland Revenue in Northern Ireland—McDonagh was described in court as an Official IRA commander.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Dunne: In Dublin Magazine, October 1987&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1992 a British ''Spotlight'' programme alleged that the Official IRA was still active and involved in widespread [[racketeering]] and armed robberies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = De Baroid | first = Ciaran | title = Ballymurphy and the Irish War | publisher = [[Pluto Press]] |year=1989 | pages = | doi = | isbn = 0-7453-1514-3 | nopp = true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These eventually proved a considerable political embarrassment to the Workers' Party, and in 1992 the leadership proposed amendments to the party constitution which would, inter alia, effectively allow it to purge members suspected of involvement in the Official IRA. This proposal failed to obtain the required two-thirds support at the party conference that year, and as a result the leadership, including six of the party's seven members of [[Dáil Éireann]], left to establish a new party, later named [[Democratic Left (Ireland)|Democratic Left]].

In 1995, some former Official IRA members in the [[Newry]] area launched a "re-founded" Official Republican Movement (ORM). This group was believed to have engaged in attacks on drug dealers in the Newry area in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=Jack|last2=Markey|first2=Patrick|title=North’s major drug baron shot dead in Newry|url=http://irishecho.com/2011/02/norths-major-drug-baron-shot-dead-in-newry-3/|accessdate=4 March 2016|work=Irish Echo|date=21–27 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 violence erupted between the ORM and the IRA; two ORM members and two Sinn Féin supporters were injured in separate gun attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moriarty|first1=Gerry|title=Four injured as republicans feud|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/four-injured-as-republicans-feud-1.89395|accessdate=4 March 2016|work=Irish Times|date=17 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been allegations of criminality against former senior Official IRA figure [[Seán Garland]], who was accused in 2005 by the United States of helping to produce and circulate counterfeit [[United States dollar|US dollars]] allegedly printed in [[North Korea]].

==Decommissioning==
In October 2009, after a long period of inactivity, the Official IRA began talks with a view to decommissioning its stockpile of weapons,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstin.com/rel/us/en-010-019069630 Newstin – News and Metadata Technology Innovations] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in February 2010 the Newry-based Official Republican Movement announced that the process was complete.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.u.tv/News/Official-IRA-INLA-weapons-beyond-use/c400d480-0ecc-46a4-a0ae-f32861f2e4ee Official IRA, INLA weapons beyond use]", ''[[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] News'', 8 February 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725010021/http://www.u.tv/News/Official-IRA-INLA-weapons-beyond-use/c400d480-0ecc-46a4-a0ae-f32861f2e4ee |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was confirmed to be completed by the [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning]] on 8 February 2010, coming in the last 24 hours of the commission's existence.&lt;ref name=Timesdecom&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7019958.ece Three more Northern Ireland terrorist groups lay down their arms] ''The Times'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604190543/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article7019958.ece |date=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decommissioning was completed at the same time as that of the republican INLA and the loyalist [[UDA South East Antrim Brigade]].&lt;ref name=Timesdecom/&gt; The step was described by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] as a "central part of moving Northern Ireland from violence to peace".&lt;ref name=Timesdecom/&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that up to 5,000 Official IRA weapons may still be hidden in secret bunkers. The weapons were allegedly supplied to the OIRA in the 1980s by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[KGB]] and by [[North Korea]]. The report said that the weapons were to be used to defend Catholic areas if there was an outbreak of major sectarian conflict, and that the plan was known only to a few high-ranking members of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/official-ira-doomsday-bunkers-may-still-contain-thousands-of-weapons-31267631.html "Official IRA "doomsday" bunkers may still contain thousands of weapons"]. ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''. 31 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths as a result of activity==
According to Malcolm Sutton's ''Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland'', part of the [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN), the OIRA was responsible for at least 50 killings during the Troubles.&lt;!--excluding the 3 OIRA members killed by their own bombs--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/tables/Organisation_Responsible.html |title=Sutton Index of Deaths: Organisation responsible for the death |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN) |accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the book ''Lost Lives'' (2006 edition), it was responsible for 57 killings.&lt;ref name=lostlives-stats&gt;[[David McKittrick]] et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7318">The '''Omaha Platform''' was the party program adopted at the formative convention of the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist (or People's) Party]] held in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on July 4, 1892.

== Origin ==

The platform preamble was written by [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]]. The Omaha platform was seen as "The Second Declaration of Independence," as it called for reestablishing American liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gildedage.lib.niu.edu/populismpolitics|title=Populist Politics: The Business of Government|last=Postel|first=Charles|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planks themselves represent the merger of the [[agrarianism|agrarian]] concerns of the [[Farmers' Alliance]] with the free-currency monetarism of the [[Greenback Party]] while explicitly endorsing the goals of the largely [[urban area|urban]] [[Knights of Labor]].  In the words of Donnelly's preamble, the convention was "[a]ssembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chieftain who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of the ''plain people'', with which class it originated." The Omaha Platform called for a wide range of social reforms, including a reduction in the working day, a "safe, sound, and flexible" national currency, assistance to farmers with the financing of their labours, "fair and liberal pensions to ex-Union soldiers and sailors," the direct election of Senators, single-terms for Presidents and Vice-Presidents, "the legislative system known as the initiative and referendum," "the unperverted Australian of secret ballot system," the nationalization of the railroads, the telegraph, and the telephone systems, a postal savings, "a graduated income tax," and "the free and unlimited coinage of silver." In referencing the Omaha Platform, Senator George Norris of Nebraska suggested the wealth of the "super rich" had to begin flowing "to all the people, from whom it was originally taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Populist Persuasion|last=Kazin|first=Michael|publisher=BasicBooks|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8014-8558-9|location=New York|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Populist, or People's, Party went on to capture 11 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]], several governors and the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]]s of [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]] and [[North Carolina]].  1892 [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nominee and former Greenbacker [[James B. Weaver]] received over a million popular votes, and won four states ([[Colorado]], Kansas, [[Idaho]], and [[Nevada]]) and 22 electoral votes.  The Party's legislative majorities were thereafter able to elect several [[United States Senate|United States Senators]]. Taken as a whole, the electoral accomplishments of the Populist Party represent the high water mark for a United States [[third party (United States)|third party]] after the Civil War.
In 1896, the Populists abandoned the Omaha Platform and endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[William Jennings Bryan]] on the basis of a single-plank [[free silver]] platform.

== Goals ==
The first goal of the Omaha Platform was to increase the coinage of silver to gold at a 16:1 ratio. The Omaha Platform suggested a federal loans system so that farmers could get the money they needed. The platform also called for the elimination of private banks. 
The platform required a system of federal storage facilities for the farmers' crops. The objective was to allow the farmers to control the pricing of their products. The Omaha Platform made a special taxing system for them so that they would have to pay taxes depending on how much money they made. They also asked for an eight-hour workday and the direct election of senators, as opposed to them being elected by state legislatures. Those were the main goals of the Omaha Platform, all focused on helping rural and working-class Americans. They also made it so that farmers would only work 8 hours instead of 10 or more. After 1894, Populists emphasized the demand for free coinage of silver rather than other goals, such as state-run railroads.

==Dissolution==
The platform did not appeal to the more urban areas of the country where wage earners were working industrial jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/united-states-and-canada/us-history/populist-party|title=Populist Party|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform's only clear attempt to appeal to northerners in the east was the clause mentioning pensions to ex-Union soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/populism-and-the-omaha-platform-of-1892.php|title=Populism and the Omaha Platform of 1892|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Populist Party dissolved before World War II as members were unable to meet in Omaha for the party's semi-centennial celebration, and for the reason that many of the party's values have been accepted by other, more dominant political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/populist-convention-reunion.htm|title=Populist Convention Reunion|last=|first=|date=February 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Pendatang asing'''" or "'''orang pendatang'''" is a common [[Malay language|Malay]] phrase used to refer to foreigners or immigrants; "pendatang asing" literally means "foreign comer" or "foreign immigrant". Although most frequently used to refer to foreign immigrants, especially [[illegal immigrants in Malaysia|illegal immigrants]], ''pendatang asing'' has been used by some politicians in [[Malaysia]] as pejorative way of addressing non-[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] [[Malaysia]]ns.

==Offensive usage==
In a Malaysian political context, it is commonly used as a pejorative way of addressing the ethnic [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indians|Indians]], who are not [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] of [[Malaysia]].

===Pre-independence===
[[Image:Penang State Map.jpg|thumb|During the early 1950s, there was an active [[Straits Chinese]] secessionist movement in [[Penang]] agitating against ''ketuanan Melayu''.]]

During the pre-Independence period, some [[Straits Chinese]] began taking an active interest in local politics, especially in [[Penang]], where there was an active Chinese [[secessionist]] movement. They identified themselves more with the British than the Malays and were especially angered by references to them as ''pendatang asing'' ("aliens"). They avoided both the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) and the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA), believing that while [[UMNO]] and the Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights, the MCA was too "selfish", and could not be relied on to protect their interests.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, Mohamed Noordin (1976). ''From Malayan Union to Singapore Separation: Political Unification in the Malaysia Region 1945 – 65'', pp. 77 – 78. Penerbit Universiti Malaya. No ISBN available.&lt;/ref&gt;

They had already raised their ire in the late 1940s, when the government proposed to amend the Banishment Ordinance — which allowed for the exile of Malayans "implicated in acts of violence"&lt;ref&gt;Drohan, Brian (2006). [http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:141534080&amp;ctrlInfo=Round19%3AMode19b%3ADocG%3AResult&amp;ao= "An integrated approach: British political-military strategy in the Malayan emergency"]. Retrieved 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; — to permit those born in the [[Straits Settlements]] to be banished to their ancestral homeland. This was a revolting idea for most of the Straits Chinese.

They were also uncomfortable about the merger of the Straits Settlements with Malaya, as they did not feel a sense of belonging to what they considered a "Malaya for the Malays", where they were not considered ''[[bumiputra]]'' ("sons of the soil"). One Straits Chinese leader indignantly declared, "I can claim to be more ''anak Pulau Pinang'' [a son of Penang] than 99 per cent of the Malays living here today."&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, pp. 61 – 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The secessionist movement eventually petered out, however, because of the government's stout refusal to entertain the idea of Penang seceding from the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Sopiee, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post Independence===
The phrase '''pendatang asing''' has strong connotations, and is often used in heated political situations. One such example was the [[May 13 Incident]], where racial rioting in 1969 was triggered by a trading of political insults.

Another example is the prelude to the  [[Ops Lallang]] in 1987 and the [[1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis]].  In November 1986, MCA Selangor of which MCA's deputy president [[Lee Kim Sai]] was its head, passed a resolution in its annual convention to make it an offence to call any of the three major races immigrants or ''pendatang''.  The resolution, which stated that Malaysia's three major races originated from other countries and that none of them should brand the others as immigrants and claim themselves to be natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://web.usm.my/km/KM%2021,2003/21-14.pdf |journal=Kajian Malaysia |volume= XXI |issue= l&amp;2 |year=2003|title=The Bumiputera Policy: Chinese Views and Perspective |author=Lee Kam Hing }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was interpreted as challenging the bumiputra status of the Malays, and led to calls for Lee's sacking by members of [[UMNO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=aOM0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h5ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4972,3741345&amp;dq=lee-kim-sai&amp;hl=en|title=Sack Kim Sai, UMNO Youth tells govt|date=18 October 1987|publisher=[[New Straits Times]]|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise was eventually worked out whereby the term ''pendatang'' would not be used to describe any community and the bumiputera status of the Malays was not to be questioned.  During this period, UMNO and pro-Chinese organisations frequently traded insults, with current [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], who was then [[UMNO]] Youth Chief [[Najib Razak]]. At a rally in 1987 in Kampung Baru in Kuala Lumpur, banners were hoisted carrying phrases such as "revoke the citizenship of those who oppose the Malay rulers", "May 13 has begun" (referring to the 13 May racial riots in 1969), and "soak it (the ''keris'') with Chinese blood". &lt;ref&gt;Lim, Kit Siang (2000). [http://www.limkitsiang.com/archive/2000/dec00/lks0596.htm "GPMS' extremist demands - a prelude to escalation of ethnic tensions to justify another Operation Lalang mass crackdown to shore up Mahathir and UMNO’s tottering position?"]. Retrieved 21 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The tensions eased after Ops Lallang, when several political dissidents — most of them Chinese — were detained without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]].

Tensions flared in 2004 when it was proposed to open the currently [[Bumiputra]]-only [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] to all Malaysians. Malay media made comments about the ''pendatang'' making a "daring challenge to Malay rights". &lt;ref&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2004). [http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2004/09/uitm_and_malay.php "UiTM and 'Malay Agenda'"]. Retrieved 29 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over its appropriateness===
Non-Malay members of the opposition media have contended that the common use of phrases like "pendatang asing" validates their belief that non-Malay Malaysians are treated as second-class citizens. It has also been argued that the derogatory use of "pendatang asing" is inappropriate, as almost all of Malaysia's [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Ministers]] have had foreign blood. &lt;ref&gt;Pillai, M.G.G. (2005). [http://www.mggpillai.com/article.php3?sid=2116 "The Japanese won us our Merdeka"]. Retrieved 8 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Pillai, M.G.G. (2005).

==Illegal immigrants==
{{main|Illegal immigrants in Malaysia}}
Since the 1980s when Malaysia first experienced [[economic boom]], the country has seen massive influx of immigrants and foreigners from many neighbouring countries such as [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Myanmar]]. Recently, Malaysia has been the destination for many [[Bangladeshis]], [[Republic of India|Indians]] and [[Pakistanis]] that are looking for employment. While many entered Malaysia legally, labour shortage in Malaysia has encouraged many employers to employ illegal immigrants. Of late, the Malaysian government has tried to repatriate many of these illegal immigrants back to their countries of origin. Such effort however has annoyed several governments such as Indonesia and India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28452">Entertainer and activist [[Paul Robeson]]'s political philosophies and outspoken views about domestic and international Communist countries and movements were the subject of great concern to the western mass media and the United States Government, during the [[Cold War]]. His views also caused controversy within the ranks of black organizations and the entertainment industry.

Robeson was never officially identified as a member of the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA), domestically or internationally. Robeson's beliefs in socialism, his ties to the CPUSA and leftist trade unions, and his experiences in the USSR continue to cause controversy among historians and scholars as well as fans and journalists.

==First visit to the Soviet Union (1934)==
Robeson journeyed to the Soviet Union in December 1934, via Germany, having been given an official invitation. While there, Robeson was welcomed by [[playwright]]s, artists and filmmakers, among them [[Sergei Eisenstein]] who became a close friend.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 189.&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson also met with [[African American]]s who had migrated to the USSR including his two brothers-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson was accompanied by his wife, [[Eslanda Goode Robeson]] and his biographer and friend, [[Marie Seton]]. He and his wife Eslanda were nearly attacked by [[Nazi]] [[Sturmabteilung]] at the stopover in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet constitution and anti-racist climate===
Robeson recounted how Russian children and strangers approached him in the streets and offered to shake his hand. Robeson quickly became captivated with the Soviet experiment and its leadership, also declaring that African-American [[spiritual music]] resonated to [[Russians|Russian]] folk traditions. He told the press:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, I am not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life ... I walk in full human dignity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robeson also took great interest in Article 123 of the [[Soviet Constitution]] which unlike the laws of the US at the time, effectively barred racial discrimination.

During this time Robeson also commented about the recent execution after [[court-martial]] trial of people described by ''The [[Daily Worker]]'' as "counter-revolutionary terrorists":

&lt;blockquote&gt;From what I have already seen of the workings of the Soviet government, I can only say that anybody who lifts his hand against it ought to be shot!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Vern Smith |title="I Am at Home," Says Robeson at Reception in Soviet Union |journal=[[Daily Worker]] |date=January 15, 1935| url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv4n2/ussrpr.htm |accessdate=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Robeson's early views on the USSR and communism==
Through his writings and speeches during the mid-to-late 1930s, Robeson would go on to champion the cultural and political revolutions of the Soviet Union especially, as Robeson put it, "its national minority policy as it operates among the peoples of Central Asia."&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Robeson also advocated the similarities he found between blacks all over the world and the Russian peoples, urging African Americans to look towards the Soviet Union for inspiration in gaining full citizenship within the United States. Robeson also hoped that African countries would follow the example of the USSR and embrace socialism. Robeson studied Russian language and Russian history intensely during the inter-war period .&lt;ref&gt;name= "David Levering Lewis, ''Artist and Citizen: Paul Robeson the USSR'', Rutgers University Press, New Jersey, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Robeson's laudatory remarks for the socialist revolutions and [[decolonization of Africa]] and [[decolonisation of Asia|Asia]] were not considered controversial during this pre-[[Cold War]] era partially because Robeson himself publicly stated that his interest in the Soviet Union was "non-political" and because the USSR was not yet considered an enemy of the US. Robeson would eventually have his son educated in [[Moscow]], widely announcing to the press that he did not want his son to face the "same discrimination that he had faced growing up in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 1207.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact===
When Robeson was given the news of Stalin's 1939 non aggression pact with Hitler, also known as the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], he saw the agreement as having been forced on the Soviets by the unwillingness of the military forces of Great Britain and France "to collaborate with the Soviet Union in a real policy of collective security", personally writing in his journal that an Anglo-Russian pact "would have stopped Nazi aggression" and thus leaving the USSR with no alternative choices in shoring up its borders.&lt;ref name=Duberman232&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenney Committee statement===
In 1946, Robeson was questioned by the Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in California, informally known as the [[Tenney Committee]]. When he was asked whether he was a member of the Communist Party, Robeson replied that he might as well have been asked whether he was a registered Democrat or Republican—in the United States the Communist Party was equally legal. But, he added, he was not a Communist.&lt;ref name=Duberman241&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, pp. 307&amp;ndash;308&lt;/ref&gt; There is no clear evidence that Robeson ever was a member of the Communist Party. According to records released under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], the FBI believed that Robeson might have joined the Party under the name "John Thomas" but "his Communist Party membership book number is not known". Robeson's biographer, Martin Duberman, concludes that "he was never a member of CPUSA, never a functionary, never a participant in its daily bureaucratic operations".&lt;ref name=dubermanpages/&gt; Paul Robeson, Jr. has also stated on numerous times that his father was never a member of the CPUSA.

===Mundt-Nixon Bill and Smith Act===
Robeson opposed [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] legislation. In 1948, he opposed a [[Mundt-Nixon bill|bill calling for registration of Communist Party members]] and appeared before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]]. Questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am going to join them, if necessary."&lt;ref name="Chronology5"&gt;Bay Area Paul Robeson Centennial Committee, ''[http://bayarearobeson.org/Chronology_5.htm Paul Robeson Chronology (Part 5)]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (The bill was ultimately defeated in the Senate.) In 1949, he spoke in favor of the liberty of twelve [[Communist Party USA|Communists]] (including his long-time friend [[Benjamin J. Davis, Jr.|Benjamin Davis, Jr.]]) convicted under the [[Smith Act]], which criminalized various left- and right-wing activities as seditious.&lt;ref name="Chronology6"&gt;Bay Area Paul Robeson Centennial Committee, ''[http://bayarearobeson.org/Chronology_6.htm Paul Robeson Chronology (Part 6)]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Itzik Feffer meeting and concert in Tchaikovsky Hall (June 1949)==

In June 1949, during the 150th anniversary celebration of the birth of [[Alexander Pushkin]], Robeson visited the Soviet Union on a major tour including a concert at Tchaikovsky Hall. Concerned about the welfare of Jewish artists, Robeson insisted to Soviet officials that he meet with [[Itzik Feffer]] a few days earlier.&lt;ref name="stewart"&gt;Stewart, pg. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;
Robeson had first met Feffer on July 8, 1943, at the largest pro-Soviet rally ever held in the United States, an event organized by the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] and chaired by [[Albert Einstein]]. Robeson then also got to know [[Solomon Mikhoels]], the popular actor and director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Mikhoels also headed the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the Soviet Union with Feffer as his second. After the rally, Robeson and his wife Essie had entertained Feffer and Mikhoels.

According to an account by [[Paul Robeson Jr]] told to Robeson biographer [[Martin Duberman]],&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 352-354 and notes 690&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1980s, Robeson was disturbed as to why he could not find his many Jewish friends when he returned to the U.S.S.R. in June 1949. After several inquires, Feffer was brought to Robeson's hotel room by the State Police. He and Feffer were forced to communicate through hand gestures and notes because the room was bugged. Feffer indicated that Mikhoels had been murdered in 1948 by the secret police&lt;ref name="Duberman, Martin 1989, pg 352-354"&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 352-354.&lt;/ref&gt; and intimated that he also was going to be killed. Feffer in fact was executed along with 14 other Jewish intellectuals three years later.&lt;ref name=finger&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barry Finger |title=Paul Robeson: A Flawed Martyr |journal=New Politics |volume=7 |number=1|date= 1998 |url=http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue25/finger25.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516225923/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue25/finger25.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the talk with Feffer Robeson would ask his friend Pete Blackman to "stick around" him during their stay in Moscow, he would also caution Blackman to "watch what he said" around party officials.&lt;ref name="Duberman, Martin 1989, pg 352-354"/&gt;

===Accounts of the meeting===
There were no eyewitnesses who went on record, so the meeting of Paul Robeson and Itzik Feffer in Moscow has been given several varying interpretations. In recent years, Paul Robeson, Jr. has been quoted as saying that his father "tried to contact Soviet officials to see if anything could be done to release Feffer and other Jewish intellectuals." This conflicts somewhat with his first account to Martin Duberman, which stated that his father did not act to speak out on Feffer's behalf to Soviet officials. [[Solomon Mikhoels]]' daughter published an account that is nearly identical to that of Paul Robeson Jr., with Robeson specifically requesting to see Feffer except that places the meeting in 1951 which would not have been possible, given that Robeson was without his passport.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhoels-Vovsi, Natalya. ''Vremya i mwi'', Tel-Aviv 1976, pg 190&lt;/ref&gt; A second and more angry account by composer [[Dimitri Shostakovich]] denounces Robeson for "staying silent", claiming the meeting was in a restaurant with Feffer accompanied by police agents.&lt;ref&gt;Shostakovich, Dimitri. ''Testimony'', Harper Row 1979 pgs 188-189&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Long Journey'' by Slavic anthropologist Esther Markish, the author writes that Feffer, following orders from the Soviet secret police, carefully said nothing to Robeson about the purges.&lt;ref&gt;Markish, Esther. ''The Living Journey'', 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robeson's speaks publicly of Feffer ===
Robeson spoke during his concert in Tchaikovsky Hall&lt;ref name="Duberman, Martin 1989, pg 352-354"/&gt; on June 14, about his close friendship with Feffer and the recently deceased actor Solomon Mikhoels prior to singing the [[Fareinigte Partizaner Organizacje|Vilna Partisan]] song "[[Zog Nit Keynmol]]" in both Russian and Yiddish. The concert was being broadcast across the entire Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Robeson, Paul Robeson 2008, pg 152"&gt;Robeson, Paul Robeson, Jr. 2008, ''The undiscovered Paul Robeson: quest for freedom, 1939-1976'' pg 152, into The Eye of the Storm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David Levering 1998, ''Paul Robeson:Artist and Citizen'' pg 226, Paul Robeson and The U.S.S.R&lt;/ref&gt; Historian and Robeson biographer [[Martin Duberman]] writes:

{{quote|Asking the audience for silence he announced that there would be only one encore for that evening. He then spoke of his deep cultural ties between the Jewish peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, and of how that tradition was being continued by the present generation of Russian-Jewish writers and actors. He then referred to his own friendship with Mikhoels and Feffer, and spoke of his great joy in having just come from meeting with Fefffer again. Robeson then sang in Yiddish, to a hushed hall, "Zog Nit Keynmol," the Warsaw Ghetto resistance song, first reciting the words in Russian:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Never say that you have reached the very end
When leaden skies a bitter future may portend;
For sure the hour for which we yearn will yet arrive
And our marching steps will thunder: 'we survive'.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a moment's silence, the stunned audience, Great Russians and Jews alike responded with a burst of emotion, people with tears in their eyes coming up to the stage, calling out "Pavel Vaslyevich," reaching out to touch him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panartist.com/paulrobeson.htm |archive-date=2007-10-20 |title=paul robeson Russian Concert in 1949 exclusively at panartist.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020025755/http://www.panartist.com/paulrobeson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://claudet.club.fr/GhettosCamps/Disques/Mitsui.html Paul Robeson Live Concert in Moscow at Tchaikovsky Hall&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013042251/http://claudet.club.fr/GhettosCamps/Disques/Mitsui.html |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Kurjer Codzienny''', June 10, 1949 (Polish Newspaper)[Translation:"...he was given an unusually cordial reception after his commenting...the song of the Warsaw ghetto was enthusiastically received by the audience."]&lt;/ref&gt; Having made that public gesture in behalf of Feffer and other victims of Stalin's policies-all that could have been done without directly threatening Feffers's life-Robeson clammed up on returning to the United States."&lt;ref&gt;="Duberman, Martin 1989, pg 353"&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Robeson's spontaneous translation of the Yiddish text of the ''song of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising'' into Russian and his personal tribute to Mikhoels and Feffer were censored from the tapes of the 1949 broadcast.

==Silence on Stalin==
Upon returning to the United States, he denied any persecution of Jews or other political prisoners, stating: "I met Jewish people all over the place... I heard no word about it."&lt;ref name=finger/&gt;

According to Joshua Rubenstein's book, ''Stalin's Secret Pogrom,'' Robeson also justified his silence on the grounds that any public criticism of the USSR would reinforce the authority of anti-Soviet elements in the United States which, he believed, wanted a [[preemptive war]] against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Duberman354&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pgs 354''&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of Robeson biographers, including [[Martin Duberman]], Philip S Foner, Marie Seton, [[Paul Robeson Jr.]], and [[Lloyd L .Brown|Lloyd Brown]], also concur with Robeson's own words, that he felt that criticism of the Soviet Union by someone of his immense international popularity would only serve to shore up reactionary elements in the U.S., the same elements that had lifted his passport, blocked anti-lynching legislation, and maintained a racial climate in the United States that also allowed Jim Crow, impoverished living conditions for all races and a [[white supremacist]] domination of the US government to continue.&lt;ref name=Duberman354 /&gt; Robeson is on record many times as stating that he felt the existence of a major socialist power like the USSR was a bulwark against Western European capitalist domination of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.

==Jackie Robinson's testimony to HUAC (April 1949)==

{{Main|Paul Robeson Congressional Hearings}}
At an international student peace conference held in Paris on April 20, 1949, Robeson made the widely publicized controversial comments that American blacks would not support the [[United States]] in a post-World War II [[Cold War]] with the Soviet Union. The subsequent controversy caused the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) to investigate Robeson. HUAC sought the testimony of the African American baseball star [[Jackie Robinson]] on the subject.  In July 1949, Robinson eventually agreed to testify before HUAC, fearing that declining to do so might negatively and permanently damage his career.  His testimony was a major media event, with Robinson's carefully worded statement appearing on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' the following day.

==Views on Stalin==
Robeson is often criticized for continuing to support the Soviet Union after he became aware (according to his son Paul Robeson, Jr.) of state sponsored intimidation and murder of Jews.&lt;ref name=Duberman354 /&gt; Robeson would state continually in speeches and essays that having experienced firsthand for himself during the 1930s a climate in Russia that he perceived as free from racial prejudice, he saw no western country or superpower actively attempt any comparable commitment. Robeson thus refused any pressure to publicly censure the Soviet experiment.&lt;ref name=Duberman354 /&gt; He also stated that, the existence of the USSR was the guarantee of political balance in the world. During a 1949 address to the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, he said:&lt;ref&gt;Foner,Phillip.''Paul Robeson Speaks:The Negro and The Soviet Union'', 1978,pgs 237''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, all Africa remembers that it was Litvinov who stood alone beside Haile Selassie in Geneva, when Mussolini's sons flew with the blessings of the Pope to drop bombs on Ethiopian women and children. Africa remembers that it was the Soviet Union which fought the attempts of the Smuts to annex Southwest Africa to the slave reservation of the Union of South Africa... if the peoples of the Congo refuse to mine the uranium for the atom bombs made in Jim Crow factories in the United States; if all these peoples demand an end to floggings, an end to the farce of 'trusteeship' in the former Italian colonies.... The Soviet Union is the friend of the African and the West Indian peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Foner,Phillip.''Paul Robeson Speaks:The Negro and The Soviet Union'', 1978,pgs 238''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Stalin Peace Prize and Stalin eulogy (1952–1953)===
In 1952, Robeson was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize|Stalin Peace Prize]]. In April 1953, shortly after Joseph Stalin's death he wrote a eulogy entitled ''To You Beloved Comrade'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc9804/robeson.htm ''To You Beloved Comrade"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''New World Review'', in which he praised Stalin's "deep humanity," "wise understanding," and dedication to peaceful co-existence with all peoples of the world calling him "wise and good." He also praised Stalin as a man that the world was fortunate to have for daily guidance: "Through his [Stalin's] deep humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental heritage."&lt;ref&gt;''New World Review'', April, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Robeson's comments of praise were made prior to [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 "[[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Secret Speech]]" at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] regarding Stalin's purges. Though Robeson would continue to praise the USSR throughout his life, he would neither publicly denounce nor praise Stalin personally following Khrushchev's 1956 revelations.&lt;ref name=dubermanpages&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pgs 301, 318, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians, Robeson scholars and advocates feel that his statements about Stalin and the Peace Prize itself are routinely used out of historical context to defame or disparage his legacy by his critics.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Duberman [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/297.html ''Writing Robeson"]&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, many critics and historians feel the eulogy and prize are solid proof of his being a "hard line Stalinist."

==Robeson and House Un-American Activities Committee (1956)==
Robeson's very vocal support of Communist countries and his outspoken political views, became a concern of the US government. Eventually he would have his passport lifted and spend eight years trying to win it back while being unwilling to sign an oath stating he was not a Communist. Robeson viewed signing such a statement and the existence of HUAC as a gross violation of every American's civil liberties.

In 1956, Robeson was called before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming that he was not a Communist. In response to questions concerning his alleged Communist Party membership, Robeson reminded the Committee that the Communist Party was a legal party and invited its members to join him in the voting booth before he invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and refused to respond. Robeson lambasted Committee members on [[civil rights]] issues concerning African Americans. When one senator asked him why he hadn't remained in the Soviet Union, he replied: "Because my father was a slave, and my people died to build this country, and I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you. And no fascist-minded people will drive me from it. Is that clear? I am for peace with the Soviet Union, and I am for peace with China, and I am not for peace or friendship with the Fascist Franco, and I am not for peace with Fascist Nazi Germans. I am for peace with decent people."{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Shortly thereafter he stated: "I am here because I am opposing the neo-fascist cause, which I see arising in these committees." (Audio recording of Paul Robeson's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, June 12, 1956) At one point he remarked, "you are the nonpatriots, and you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, pp. 439&amp;ndash;442&lt;/ref&gt; In making these statements, he was the only major figure to testify before HUAC who directly attacked the committee and subsequently cited for contempt of congress.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} The charges were later dismissed.

Robeson was also cross-examined over his opinions on Stalin and if he was no longer supporting Stalin's regime or the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Duberman354 /&gt; In his testimony to HUAC he stated that: "I have told you, mister, that I would not discuss anything with the people who have murdered sixty million of my people, and I will not discuss Stalin with you." He later remarked that "I will discuss Stalin when I may be among the Russian people some day, singing for them, I will discuss it there. It is their problem." Asked if he had praised Stalin during his previous trip to the Soviet Union, Robeson replied, "I do not know." When asked outright if he had changed his mind about Stalin, he implored:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever has happened to Stalin, gentlemen, is a question for the Soviet Union, and I would not argue with a representative of the people who, in building America, wasted sixty to a hundred million lives of my people, black people drawn from Africa on the plantations. You are responsible, and your forebears, for sixty million to one hundred million black people dying in the slave ships and on the plantations, and don't ask me about anybody, please.&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6440/''"You Are the Un-Americans, and You Ought to be Ashamed of Yourselves": Paul Robeson Appears Before HUAC''retrieved March 2nd 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Possible challenge to Soviet policies==
[[Robert Robinson (engineer)|Robert Robinson]], an African American toolmaker who had lived in the USSR since 1930 and who had met Robeson in the 1940s, wrote in his autobiography ''Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union'', as well as stated in a 1980s interview with [[Martin Duberman]], that he recalled rumors during the early 1960s that Robeson had an "unpleasant confrontation" with Khrushchev about antisemitism. Historian Duberman found inconsistencies with Robinson's dates but posits that it involves an issue of "crucial if clouded importance" that may shed light on Robeson's subsequent suicide attempt in Moscow, March 1961 as well as his panic attack while passing the Soviet Embassy in London, September 1961 prior to his lengthy hospitalization at the Priory for mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin 1989, notes for pg 735-736"&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson had long since decided that Robeson was oblivious to the harsh Soviet realities, as he had refused Robinson's multiple appeals for assistance at getting out of the U.S.S.R. Robinson still recorded his astonishment when during the ball bearing factory concert (Robinson gives the date as 1961, but photographic evidence given by Duberman points to 1960), Robeson included "a mournful song out of the Jewish tradition, that decried their persecution through the centuries."&lt;ref name="Robinson pp.318-319"&gt;Robinson, Robert  "Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union [Acropolis 1988]pp.318-319&lt;/ref&gt; Singing in Yiddish, with such a "cry in his voice", such a seeming "pleas to end the beating, berating and killing of Jews", that he concluded that Robeson had made a decisive choice to protest [[Soviet antisemitism]]. Robinson also recalls conversing with Robeson's interpreter and learning that he had been singing the Jewish songs at other appearances including major concert venues.

Robinson maintained having heard a rumor from five different people, none of whom knew each other and all of whom were "officials within the party structure". Robeson purportedly asked Khrushchev if stories in the Western press about the purges of Jews and widespread institutionalized antisemitism were true.&lt;ref&gt;name="Duberman, Martin 1989, notes for pg 735-736"&lt;/ref&gt; And Khrushchev had purportedly blown up at him, accusing Robeson of trying to meddle in party affairs. Robinson also claimed to "have never heard his records again broadcast regularly" on radio Moscow and "never read another word about him in the press."&lt;ref name="Robinson pp.318-319"/&gt; Robeson would never return to the Soviet Union after his aforementioned five month hospitalization.

==Later views of communism (1960s)==
During the early days of his retirement and even after his death, rumors about his health and its connections to his supposed disillusionment with the USSR continued to persist. There were even false claims that he was living in "self-imposed exile in the Soviet Union" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' who called him "the disillusioned native son".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, Attempted Renewal.&lt;/ref&gt;

At no time during his retirement (or his life) is Paul Robeson on record of mentioning any unhappiness or regrets about his beliefs in socialism or the Soviet Union nor did he ever express any disappointment in its leaders including [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. Moreover, only a few sources out of hundreds interviewed and researched by two of his biographers Martin Duberman and Lloyd Brown agreed with the claims made in the mainstream media of Robeson's supposed embitterment over the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, chapters "Broken Health" and "Attempted Renewal".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Louise Strong]], the radical travel journalist, remarked in 1965 that she had always felt that "Paul's trouble had a deep psychosomatic cause in the shock and trauma he suffered from the Sino-Soviet split [...] Paul had a very deep love and devotion to both the USSR and for China's revolution and [...] consequently the split must have been especially hard for him, since his devotions have always been through passionate allegiance rather than through theory".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin. ''Paul Robeson'', 1989, pg 541.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Landes''' (October 8, 1908, [[New York City]] – February 11, 1991, [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada) was an American [[cultural anthropologist]] best known for studies on [[Brazil]]ian [[candomblé]] cults and her published study on the topic, ''City of Women'' (1947). Landes is recognized by some as a pioneer in the study of race and gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nebraskapress.unl.edu/(S(hg4sgh552t3w3ty0xmeoi2nk))/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=671187&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 Ruth Landes - University of Nebraska Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Ruth Schlossberg was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants. Her father was [[Joseph Schlossberg]], a co-founder and long-term secretary-general &lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/landes-ruth-schlossberg  Shifra Epstein: ''Ruth Schlossberg Landes,'' ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia,'' 1 March 2009 Jewish Women's Archive (2005). Accessed 11.1.2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DE103AF937A15751C0A967958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=ruth+landes&amp;st=nyt Ruth Landes Is Dead; Anthropologist Was 82 - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Landes received her B.A. in [[Sociology]] from [[New York University]] in 1928, and a master's degree from The New York School of Social Work (now part of [[Columbia University]]) in 1929, before studying for her doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University. She earned her Ph.D. in 1935 under the mentorship of [[Ruth Benedict]], a pioneer in the field of anthropology and student of [[Franz Boas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/guide/_l1.htm#jrg568 Guide to the Collections of the National Anthropological Archives (#L1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206212947/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/guide/_l1.htm |date=2012-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict had a profound influence on Landes.&lt;ref name="Cole, Sally 2002"&gt;Cole, Sally. "Mrs Landes Meet Mrs. Benedict." American Anthropologist 104.2 (2002): 533-543. Web. 12 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She was enthralled by the way in which Benedict taught her classes, and with the way she forced the students to think in an unconventional way. Landes also stated that she was never as happy studying anthropology as when she was studying with Benedict and Boas. Landes has recorded that the friendship between herself and Benedict was one of the most meaningful friendships of her life; it was a friendship that encouraged her to expand her thoughts about anthropology and question the social norms of society.&lt;ref name="Cole, Sally 2002"/&gt;

==Field studies==
[[File:Claude Lévi-Strauss no Museu Nacional.jpg|thumb|Ruth Landes with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and other researchers at the [[Museu Nacional]] in Rio de Janeiro, 1930s]]
Landes began researching the social organization and religious practices of marginalized subjects with her masters thesis on Black Jews in [[Harlem]]. Seeking to enhance her analysis of this group, she contacted Professor Boas, who suggested she move into the field of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Sally (2002) Ruth Landes: A Life in Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Under Benedict's tutelage, Landes shifted her focus toward [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] - the more traditional anthropological subjects. Between 1932 and 1936, she undertook field work with the [[Ojibwa]] of [[Ontario]] and [[Minnesota]], the [[Santee Dakota]] in Minnesota, and the [[Potawatomi]] in [[Kansas]]. Using her notes from these trips, Landes produced a large body of written research, including the landmark texts ''Ojibwa Sociology'' (1937), ''Ojibwa Woman'' (1938), and, much later, ''Ojibwa Religion and the Midewiwin'' (1968) and ''The Mystic Lake Sioux'' (1968). In ''Ojibwa Sociology'' and ''Ojibwa Woman'', Landes provides notes on [[kinship]], religious rites and social organization, and in the latter, through the tales of chief informant Maggie Wilson, reported how women navigated within gender roles to assert their economic and social autonomy. In ''Ojibwa Religion'' and ''The Mystic Lake Sioux'', Landes discussed her subjects' strategies to maintain religious and cultural beliefs and practices, while also responding to rapid changes in their cultural and political environment.

In 1938-1939, Ruth Landes worked in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]], to study [[Religious Syncretism|religious syncretism]] and identity construction among [[Afro-Brazilian]] [[candomblé]] practictioners. She wrote that the women-centered sphere of candomblé was a source of power for certain disenfranchised blacks and a creative outlet for what she called "[[passive homosexuals]]".&lt;ref&gt;Landes, Ruth (1947) City of Women&lt;/ref&gt; In her published work on these findings, ''City of Women'' (1947), Landes discussed how racial politics in Brazil shape many candomblé practices. She returned to Brazil in 1966 to study the effects of urban development in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glenn|first1=James R.|title=Register to the Papers of  Ruth Landes|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/landes.pdf|website=National Anthropological Archives|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}
For much of her professional career, Ruth Landes held a number of contract research positions. In 1939, she became a researcher for [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s study of African Americans. In 1941, she became research director for the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]]. In 1941-1945, she was the representative for African-American and Mexican-American Affairs on President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Committee on Fair Employment Practices. At the same time, she began to study the [[Acadians]] of [[Louisiana]]. In 1948-1951, she was study director of the [[American Jewish Commission]] in New York. She was a consultant on Jewish families of New York for Ruth Benedict's Research in Contemporary Cultures during 1949-1951. In 1950-1952, Landes studied problems of immigrants of Asian and African descent in the United Kingdom. During 1946-1947 and again in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Landes lived in [[California]] and, through several consultantships, became involved with the study of [[Hispanic]]/[[Latino]] culture. At the same time, she began [[cross-cultural studies]] on minority education and the processes and effects of aging. In 1968, she began an investigation of [[bilingualism]] and bi-culturalism that developed from her interest in [[Quebec]] nationalism in Canada. The project took her to Spain and [[Nevada]] to study the [[Basques]], to Switzerland to examine the four language groups there, and to [[South Africa]] to study the interaction of [[Africans]], English-speakers, and [[Afrikaans]]-speakers. She resumed interest in the Acadians of Louisiana in 1963.

Until 1965, Landes's institutional affiliations consisted of fairly short-term appointments. Besides those already named, she was an instructor at [[Brooklyn College]] in 1937 and at [[Fisk University]] in 1937-1938. She was a lecturer at the William Alanson White Psychiatric Institution in New York in 1953-1954 and at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York in 1953-1955. She was a visiting professor at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1957 and at the [[University of Southern California]] in 1957-1965. In 1959-1962, she was [[visiting professor]] and director of the anthropology and education program at the [[Claremont Graduate School]]. She was an [[extension lecturer]] at Columbia University and at [[Los Angeles State College]] in 1963, a visiting professor at [[Tulane University]] during the early months of 1964, and a visiting professor at the University of Kansas in the summer of 1964. Her association with [[McMaster University]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], began in 1965 and continued after 1977 with her appointment as [[Professor emeritus|professor emerita]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">'''Slavic-Eurasian Research Center''' (Japanese: ユーラシア研究センター ''Surabu yūrashia kenkyū sentā'') is a scholarly institute at [[Hokkaido University]], [[Sapporo]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="hokudai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/research-and-education/discover-our-research-institutes-and-centers/slavic-research-center/|title=Slavic-Eurasian Research Center &amp;#124; Hokkaido University|website=global.hokudai.ac.jp|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Center specializes in research on the post-Soviet and postcommunist states and their inhabitants across [[Eurasia]].

==History==
The origins of the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center’s go back to the [[Cold War]]. A year after the end of the [[Occupation of Japan|US occupation of Japan]] (28 April 1952), a decision was taken at [[Hokkaido University]] on 24 June 1953 to coordinate research and activities of scholars who did research within the broad remit of [[communist studies|Soviet and Communist studies]] or [[Area studies]]. Two years later, on 1 June 1955, the group was formalized as a Slavic Institute, incorporated in the University’s Faculty of Law. On 1 April 1978 this Institute gained organizational independence and was renamed as the Slavic Research Center (SRC).&lt;ref name="hokudai2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/center/center-e.html|website=src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|title=What is the Slavic Research Center ?|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the geopolitical changes that followed the end of communism in Europe and the breakup of the Soviet Union (thus obviating the validity of Communist studies), on 1 April 2014, the Center was renamed as the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center (SRC).&lt;ref name="hokudai3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/rename-e.html|website=src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|title=The SRC to be Renamed the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research divisions==
At present research in the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center is conducted in the following divisions:
*Russian Studies
*Siberian and Far Eastern Studies
*Central Eurasian Studies
*East European Studies
*Comparative Studies
*Eurasian Unit for Border Research&lt;ref&gt;src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/center/indexe1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaboration with foreign partners==

In 2018 the SRC collaborated with 27 universities and research institutes from across Eurasia.&lt;ref name="hokudai4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/center/indexe6.html|website=src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|title=International Collaboration|accessdate=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the framework of the SRC's Foreign Visitors Fellowship Program, since 1978 tens of foreign scholars have been invited to do research at the Slavic-Eurasian Research Center, for instance, [[Norman Davies]], [[Tsuyoshi Hasegawa]], [[Tomasz Kamusella]], [[Dariusz Kołodziejczyk]], [[Stephen Kotkin]], [[Vladislav Krasnov]], [[Taras Kuzio]], [[David Marples]], [[Vojtech Mastny]], [[Alexander Nekrich]], [[Sabrina Ramet]], [[Jadwiga Staniszkis]], [[Jerzy Tomaszewski (historian)|Jerzy Tomaszewski]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Visitors Fellowship Program&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social imperialism''' (also called '''imperial socialism''' and '''socio-imperialism''') can mean either of two types of left-wing phrases. The term has political and academic meanings that are quite different.

==Political use==
As a political term, social imperialism is the political ideology of people, parties, or nations that are, according to [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], "socialist in words, imperialist in deeds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lenin, VI., (1917), Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Part IX. Critique of Imperialism | url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch09.htm |}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "social imperialism" is a [[Marxist]] expression, typically used in a derogatory fashion. The phrase was first used in Marxist circles during the early 20th century discussions on the position of the [[Second International|international workers' movement]] towards the [[World War I|impending European war]] and particularly in regard to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Luxemburg, R., (1915), "Rebuilding the International"|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1915/xx/rebuild-int.htm|accessdate = January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lenin, VI., (1915), "Draft resolution of the leftwing delegates at the International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald" | url=http://www.workers.org/marcy/cd/sambol/bolwar/bolwar12.htm | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context it is very similar to, but not interchangeable with, the terms [[social chauvinism]] and [[social patriotism]].

In the later decades the most significant use of the phrase has been in the [[Maoism|Maoist]] critique of the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Mao Zedong]] argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an [[imperialism|imperialist]] power while maintaining a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist]] façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mao, (1964), "On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World" | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] leader [[Enver Hoxha]] agreed with Mao in this analysis, before later using the expression to also condemn Mao's [[Three Worlds Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hoxha, E., (1979), "Imperialism and the Revolution: The Theory of 'Three Worlds': A Counterrevolutionary Chauvinist Theory" | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm  | accessdate=January 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic use==
The term has also been used as a conceptual device by left-wing academics, especially in regard to modern German history. The academic use of the phrase is usually to describe governments that engage in imperialism meant to preserve the domestic social peace. The [[left-wing]] German historian [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] has defined social imperialism as "the diversions outwards of internal tensions and forces of change in order to preserve  the social and political status quo", and as a "defensive ideology" to counter the "disruptive effects of industrialization on the social and economic structure of Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoff Eley|Eley, Geoff]] "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 925.&lt;/ref&gt; In Wehler's opinion, social imperialism was a device that allowed the German government to distract public attention from domestic problems and preserve the existing social and political order.&lt;ref name="Eley pages 925-926"&gt;Eley, Geoff "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 925.&lt;/ref&gt; Wehler argued that the dominant elites used social imperialism as the glue to hold together a fractured society and to maintain popular support for the social ''status quo''.&lt;ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/&gt; Wehler argued German colonial policy in the 1880s was the first example of social imperialism in action, and was followed up by the [[Tirpitz Plan]] for expanding the German Navy starting in 1897.&lt;ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/&gt; In this point of view, groups such as the Colonial Society and the [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] are seen as instruments for the government to mobilize public support.&lt;ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/&gt; The demands for annexing most of Europe and Africa in World War I are seen by Wehler as the pinnacle of social imperialism.&lt;ref name="Eley pages 925-926"/&gt;

The British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[Geoff Eley]] contends that there are three flaws to Wehler's theory of social imperialism. The first is that Wehler credits leaders such as Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and Prince [[Bernhard von Bülow]] with a greater degree of vision than what they in fact possessed.&lt;ref&gt;Eley, Geoff "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 pages 925-926.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is that many of the pressure groups on the right who advocated an imperialist policy for Germany were not the creations of the government, and in fact often demanded far more aggressive policies than what the government was willing to undertake.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eley, Geoff "Social Imperialism" pages 925-926 from ''Modern Germany'' Volume 2, New York, Garland Publishing, 1998 page 926.&lt;/ref&gt; The third was that many of these imperialist lobbying groups demanded a policy of political and social reform at home, in addition to imperialism abroad.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Eley argued that what is required in thinking about social imperialism is a broader picture with an interaction from above and below, and a wider view of the relationship between imperialism abroad and domestic politics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

One of the more notable uses of the social imperialism concept was by the British Marxist historian [[Timothy Mason]] who argued that [[World War II]] was caused by social imperialism. In Mason's opinion, German foreign policy was driven by domestic political considerations, and the launch of World War II in 1939 was best understood as a "barbaric variant of social imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Mason argued that "Nazi Germany was always bent ''at some time'' upon a major war of expansion".&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mason states that the timing of such a war was determined by domestic political pressures, especially as relating to a failing economy.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 165&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mason, by 1939, the "overheating" of the German economy caused by rearmament, the failure of various rearmament plans caused by the shortages of skilled workers, industrial unrest caused by the breakdown of German social policies, and a sharp drop in living standards for the German working class forced Hitler into going to war at a time and place not of his choosing.&lt;ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle pages 165-166"&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  pages 165-166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason contended that, when faced with the deep socio-economic crisis, the Nazi leadership had decided to embark upon a ruthless "smash and grab" foreign policy of seizing territory in Eastern Europe which could be pitilessly plundered to support living standards in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000  page 166&lt;/ref&gt; Mason described German foreign policy as driven by an opportunistic "next victim" syndrome after the ''[[Anschluss]],'' in which the "promiscuity of aggressive intentions" was nurtured by every successful foreign policy move.&lt;ref&gt;Kaillis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 page 151&lt;/ref&gt; In Mason's opinion, the decision to sign the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and to attack Poland, and with it risking a war with Britain and France, was an abandonment by Hitler of his foreign-policy programme, outlined in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and ''[[Zweites Buch]]'', and was forced on him by the need to seize and plunder territory abroad in order to prevent the collapse of the German economy.&lt;ref name="Kaillis, Aristotle pages 165-166"/&gt; Mason's theory of World War II as an act of social imperialism and as a sudden "flight into war" into 1939 was to involve him in the 1980s in a debate with the British historian [[Richard Overy]].

[[Haiti]] is impacted by [[structural violence]], a form of dysfunction where social structures prevent certain groups of people from having access to basic [[human rights]], like [[education]] and [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt; This has resulted from its colonial history, and from decades of [[political risk|political instability]] and social unrest. Additionally, Haitians are financially impoverished and within Haiti, there exist [[social inequalities]]. In 2012, 58.5% of its population was below its [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name=worldbankhaiti /&gt; Educational standards within the nation are low, where its [[literacy rate]] is about 60.7%, below the 84.1% global average.&lt;ref name=countryprofilehaiti /&gt;&lt;ref name=UNESCOgloballiteracylevel&gt;{{cite web|author1=United Nations Educational |author2=Scientific &amp; Cultural Organization |title=UIS FACT SHEET: ADULT AND YOUTH LITERACY|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/literacy/Documents/fs20-literacy-day-2012-en-v3.pdf|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haiti is also globally ranked lower than most other nations in various measurements of health outcomes.&lt;ref name=healthlifeexpectancybillmelindagates /&gt; Such health outcomes include [[life expectancy]], [[mortality rates]], and disease levels.  While there has been some international assistance, there are insufficient supportive infrastructures in place within the country to provide resources and opportunities for Haitians who are trying to attain a higher [[quality of life]]. Causes that have resulted in higher levels of [[structural violence]] within Haiti include political instability and [[corruption]], as well as the impact of [[post-colonialism]], which has established a [[caste]]-based class system within [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name=countryprofilehaiti /&gt;&lt;ref name=classstructurehaiti /&gt;&lt;ref name=casteinhaiti /&gt;

As defined by Medical Anthropologist [[Paul Farmer|Dr. Paul Farmer]], [[structural violence]] is the way by which social arrangements are constructed to put specific members of a population in harm's way.&lt;ref name=StructuralViolenceandClinicalMedicine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Paul E.|author2=Nizeye, Bruce |author3=Stulac, Sara |author4= Keshavjee, Salmaan |title=Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine|journal=PLoS Medicine|year=2006|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e449|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Farmer|Dr. Farmer]], [[social inequalities]] are at the heart of structural violence, where the prevailing societal framework imposes invisible barriers that perpetuate the suffering of certain groups of people.&lt;ref name=anthropologyofstructuralv /&gt; The term [[structural violence]] was first coined by [[Johan Galtung]], the founder of peace and conflict studies, in 1969. The term further gained exposure when it was used by Latin American liberation theologians.&lt;ref name=anthropologyofstructuralv&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Paul|title=An Anthropology of Structural Violence|journal=Current Anthropology|date=June 2004|volume=45|issue=3|pages=305–325|doi=10.1086/382250}}&lt;/ref&gt; These social arrangements are termed structural as they are embedded into the cultural, political and economic realms of society. The term [[violence]] highlights the fact that these structures cause injury or [[social inequality|inequality]] to certain groups of peoples and constrain individual agency in the society in which they operate.&lt;ref name=StructuralViolenceandClinicalMedicine /&gt;  While structural violence exists in other parts of the world, its effects are more readily identified within [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt;

==Compounding factors==
While the negative effects of [[structural violence]] affects almost everyone in the nation of [[Haiti]], there are a number of social factors that render certain [[demographics]] of the population to experience a more severe form of human suffering. These include [[gender]], [[ethnicity]] and [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower&gt;{{cite book|last=Sen|first=Paul Farmer ; foreword by Amartya|title=Pathologies of power: health, human rights, and the new war on the poor: with a new preface by the author|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-24326-2|pages=42|edition=2° édition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
[[File:Haitian girls.jpg|thumb|Haitian girls]]
While [[structural violence]] impacts [[Haiti]] as a whole, due to the presence of [[gender inequality]], women within Haiti tend to be more heavily impacted by structural violence than men.&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt; In the 2004 United Nations Development Fund for Women report, Haitian women were found to remain as the target of oppression, independent of any political change within the nation. Among the 43% of households which are headed by women, more than 80% are reported to be living in [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=UNIFEM2004&gt;{{Cite report |author=UNIFEM |date=July 2004|title=UNIFEM in Haiti: Supporting Gender Justice, Development and Peace |url=http://www.ijdh.org/pdf/UNIFEMinHaiti.pdf |publisher=UNIFEM Caribbean Office |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to the 2000 UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, a report on Haiti noted that structural gender disparities have made Haitian women disproportionately susceptible to physical violence, but also excluded from various forms of protection.&lt;ref name=UNspecial2000&gt;{{Cite report |author=Radhika Coomaraswamy |date=27 January 2000|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Its Causes and Consequences, Radhika Coomaraswamy, submitted in accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/44.

===Race / ethnicity===
Racial or ethnic differentiation has been well acknowledged as a means of depriving certain racial or ethnic groups of basic [[human rights]], or from receiving the same quality of resources as others.&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt;&lt;ref name=farmer2001infectionsandinequalities /&gt;&lt;ref name=sencapabilities&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=Human Rights and Capabilities|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=July 2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=151–166|doi=10.1080/14649880500120491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=senpovertyinequality&gt;{{cite book|author1=Grusky, David B.|author2=Sen, Amartya|title=Poverty and inequality|year=2006|publisher=Stanford Univ.

===Socioeconomic status===
The Human Suffering Index (HSI), which examines measures of [[welfare|human welfare]] ranging from [[life expectancy]] to [[political freedom]], listed Haiti to be one of the 27 of 141 countries characterized by "extreme human suffering".&lt;ref name=viewfrombelow /&gt;&lt;ref name=humansuffering&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Ronald E.|title=Human suffering and quality of life : conceptualizing stories and statistics|year=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400776685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts of structural violence==

===Poverty===
[[File:Bas-Ravine.jpg|thumb|Slums in the area of Bas-Ravine, in the northern part of Cap-Haïtien]]
The impacts of structural violence are far reaching. They affect individuals, and overall social outcomes.&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt; [[Poverty]] is one of the biggest by-products of [[structural violence]], as structural violence inhibits individuals and communities from achieving basic [[human rights]]. These basic rights include [[Healthcare|access to healthcare]] and [[education]]. As identified by the 2012 World Development Report, [[health]] and [[education]] are two key human capital endowments that can influence an individual's ability to reach his or her full potential in society.&lt;ref name=WDR2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Revenga|first=[this report was prepared by a team led by Ana|title=Gender equality and development: world development report 2012|year=2011|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8213-8825-9|author2=Shetty], Sudhir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the inability to receive proper education and maintain good health, individuals impacted by structural violence often are less well-positioned to attain better socio-economic opportunities or to be upwardly mobile. In 2012, Haiti was the poorest nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]], with approximately 58.5% of its population lived below the nation's [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name=worldbankhaiti&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Bank|title=World Development Indicators: Haiti|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/haiti#cp_wdi|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gini coefficient]] for Haiti was 59.2 in 2001, making it the 7th highest nation in terms of its degree of inequality in the distribution of family income.&lt;ref name=ginicoefficient&gt;{{cite web|last=Central Intelligence Agency|title=Country Comparison :: Distribution of Family Income - Gini Index|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2172rank.html|publisher=CIA|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Haitian school children.jpg|thumb|Haitian school children attending class]] --&gt;
Structural violence impacts one's ability to receive [[education]].&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt; Haiti's [[literacy rate]] is about 60.7%, below the 90% average literacy rate for [[Latin America]]n and other [[Caribbean]] countries.&lt;ref name=countryprofilehaiti&gt;{{Cite report |author=Library of Congress - Federal Research Division|date=May 2015 |title=Country Profile: Haiti |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Haiti.pdf |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=19 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the oppressive political and economic structures that are plaguing the nation, the educational sector in Haiti has limited financial support. The quality of education is low due to the lack of organization, expertise, and resources. There is a shortage of school supplies and qualified [[teachers]]. This problem is more prevalent in [[rural areas]]. Schools may use either outdated curricula or a partially implemented framework from the 1997 National Plan of Education and Training (NPET) curriculum.&lt;ref name=educationandconflictinhaiti /&gt; Due to the state's lack of institutional strength and capacity to provide basic education to the general Haitian population, the education sector is now predominantly privatized.&lt;ref name="equityhighereducationhaiti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salmi|first=J.|title=Equity and Quality in Private Education: The Haitian paradox|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|date=June 2000|volume=30|issue=2|pages=163–178|doi=10.1080/03057920050034101}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 World Bank Study on the private education in Haiti found that 92% of all Haitian schools are privately owned, tuition-based institutions.&lt;ref name=worldbank2006education&gt;{{Cite report |author=World Bank: Caribbean Country Management Unit|date=27 Apr 2006 |title=Social Resilience and State Fragility in Haiti: A Country Social Analysis |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/07/000160016_20060607092849/Rendered/PDF/360690HT.pdf |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=16 Mar 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Haiti's widespread economic hardship, the majority of the nation's population is unable to meet the cost of [[education]]. 88% of children aged 6 to 12 are enrolled in [[school]], and less than one-third of those enrolled reach fifth grade.&lt;ref name=educationandconflictinhaiti&gt;{{Cite report |author=Ketty Luzincourt |author2=Jennifer Gulbrandson |date=August 2010 |title=Education and Conflict in Haiti: Rebuilding the Education Sector after the 2010 Earthquake |url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/sr245.pdf |publisher=United States Institute of Peace (USIP)|accessdate=16 Mar 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close to 60% of children drop out of school before receiving their primary education certificate.&lt;ref name=makingleapforward /&gt; The 2006 World Bank report notes that "the high [[High school dropouts|dropout]] rate is generally not reflective of a Haitian disregard for or disinterest in education; rather, it is an unfortunate consequence of limited family resources".&lt;ref name=worldbank2006&gt;{{Cite report |author=World Bank: Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Unit|date=1 Jun 2006 |title=Haiti - Options and opportunities for inclusive growth : country economic memorandum. |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHAITI/Resources/HAITIFinalCEMJune1.pdf |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=16 Mar 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the poorest 20% of households in [[Haiti]], school fees can represent up to 25% of a family's annual household income per child.&lt;ref name=worldbank2006education/&gt; Of those who were able to progress to [[secondary education]], 75% go to [[private schools]].&lt;ref name=educationinhaitiERIKO&gt;{{cite report|last=Suzuta|first=Eriko|title=Education in Haiti: An Overview of Trends, Issues,  and Plans|date=28 Sep 2011|publisher=WISE|location=Port-au-Prince|url=http://www.wise-qatar.org/sites/default/files/files/4851/eduoverview0921_draft_with_cover.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914022654/http://www.wise-qatar.org/sites/default/files/files/4851/eduoverview0921_draft_with_cover.pdf|archivedate=14 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who complete secondary schooling were not automatically eligible to enroll in a [[university]].{{clarify|editor needs to describe what happens to college grads---&gt; emigrate to America.

===Access to healthcare===

This lack of medical infrastructure was further exacerbated by the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref name=earthquakehaiti /&gt; In 2007, 47% of the population lacked access to basic health care, with a majority of the population turning to traditional healers for various forms of treatment.&lt;ref name=earthquakehaiti /&gt;&lt;ref name=folkhealinghaiti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coreil|first=Jeannine|title=Parallel structures in professional and folk health care: A model applied to rural Hati|journal=Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry|date=June 1983|volume=7|issue=2|pages=131–151|doi=10.1007/BF00051846}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study on Haiti's prosthetic situation also revealed that less than 25% of all [[amputees]] obtain a [[prosthetic limb]].&lt;ref name=prostheticlimb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bigelow|first=J|author2=Korth, M |author3=Jacobs, J |author4=Anger, N |author5=Riddle, M |author6= Gifford, J |title=A picture of amputees and the prosthetic situation in Haiti.|journal=Disability and rehabilitation|date=Feb 18, 2004|volume=26|issue=4|pages=246–52|pmid=15164958 |doi=10.1080/09638280310001644915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health outcomes===
Structural violence impacts health outcomes at both an individual and communal level. Individually, structural violence creates barriers that prevent one from properly receiving and utilizing health care systems. Some of these barriers include high user fees, which lower health facility utilization levels, as well as [[social stigma]] around certain [[diseases]] that reduce utilization and thus negatively impact health outcomes for certain individuals.&lt;ref name=nocashnocare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponsar|first=Frederique|author2=Tayler-Smith, Katie; Philips, Mit; Gerard, Seco; Van Herp, Michel; Reid, Tony; Zachariah, Rony|title=No cash, no care: how user fees endanger health—lessons learnt regarding financial barriers to healthcare services in Burundi, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Haiti and Mali|journal=International Health|date=June 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/j.inhe.2011.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how the pre-existing healthcare system reinforces [[social stigma]] is the way that facility-based health care is delivered to women. In most of Haiti's public health facilities, waiting lines for [[family planning]] services and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] testing are designed to be separate from those of routine care. This public separation thus makes visible the [[social stigma]] of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], which can deter women from utilizing certain sex-related health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mukherjee|first=Joia S. | author2=Barry, Donna J. |author3=Satti, Hind |author4=Raymonville, Maxi |author5=Marsh, Sarah |author6= Smith-Fawzi, Mary Kay |title= Structural Violence: A Barrier to Achieving the Millennium Development Goals for Women |journal= [[Journal of Women's Health]] |volume=20 | issue=4 |pages= 593–597 | publisher = [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] | doi = 10.1089/jwh.2010.2375 | date = April 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2010.2375 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from individual impact, structural violence also impacts the society as a whole as it facilitates [[Equity (economics)|inequity]] in terms of the distribution of a society's resources and hence the overall [[quality of life]] of a [[society]].

According to the 2011 [[World Health Organization]] data on health indicators, the average [[life expectancy]] in [[Haiti]] at birth is 61 years for males and 64 years for females, lower than the global average of 70 years.&lt;ref name=WHOhaitihealth&gt;{{Cite report |author=World Health Organization |date=2011 |title=Haiti: Health Profile |url=http://www.who.int/gho/countries/hti.pdf?ua=1 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=16 Mar 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MapGloballifeexpectacny&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Life Expectancy at Birth|url=http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/mbd/life_expectancy/atlas.html|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Haiti was ranked 186 out of the 223 countries studied for life expectancy at birth.&lt;ref name=CIAlifeexpectancy&gt;{{cite web|last=Central Intelligence Agency|title=The World Factbook: Life Expectancy at Birth|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of healthy life expectancy, a 2013 study funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], found Haiti's health life expectancy for males and females to be 27.8 and 37.1 years respectively, both of which are ranked as the lowest out of the 187 countries studied.&lt;ref name=healthlifeexpectancybillmelindagates&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Joshua A|author2=Wang, Haidong |author3=Freeman, Michael K |author4=Vos, Theo |author5=Flaxman, Abraham D |author6=Lopez, Alan D |author7= Murray, Christopher JL |title=Healthy life expectancy for 187 countries, 1990–2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden Disease Study 2010|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2144–2162|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti's overall low ranking for life expectancy stems from a multitude of factors that includes high [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevalence, lack of access to basic healthcare services, [[malnutrition]], and poor [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=haitilowHIV&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMichael|first=Anthony J|author2=McKee, Martin |author3=Shkolnikov, Vladimir |author4= Valkonen, Tapani |title=Mortality trends and setbacks: global convergence or divergence?|journal=The Lancet|date=April 2004|volume=363|issue=9415|pages=1155–1159|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)15902-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mortality rates====
[[File:Haitian Cemetery (7810880050).jpg|thumb|Haitian Cemetery]]
[[Mortality rates]] in [[Haiti]] are higher than world averages across all demographics. Today, Haiti has the highest rates of [[infant mortality|infant]], under-five, and [[maternal mortality]] in the [[Western hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=UNICEFhaiti&gt;{{cite web|last=UNICEF|title=At a glance: Haiti|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/haiti_2014.html|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; High infection rates for diseases such as respiratory infections, [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], as well as sexually transmitted diseases like [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] are the leading causes of death for Haitians.&lt;ref name=UNICEFhaiti /&gt; This largely comes from persisting inequalities in access to health services, especially between the rich and the rural poor. It is estimated that some 60% of [[Haitians]], primarily those living in [[rural areas]], lack access to basic health-care services.&lt;ref name=UNICEFhaiti /&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOmaternalmortality&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Maternal mortality|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[infant mortality]], the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation and [[World Health Organization]] report that 57 [[infants]] per every 1,000 live births die each year before reaching one year of age. The probability of [[infants]] dying under the age of five is 76 per 1,000 live births.&lt;ref name=WorldBankinfantmortality&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Bank|title=Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOhaiti&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Haiti|url=http://www.who.int/countries/hti/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to [[maternal mortality]], a [[maternal mortality]] study of 181 countries in 2008 found that Haiti’s maternal mortality rate was approximately 582 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in both the [[Caribbean]] and around the world.&lt;ref name="threeedelaysframework"/&gt;&lt;ref name=maternalmortality181countries&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Margaret C|author2=Foreman, Kyle J |author3=Naghavi, Mohsen |author4=Ahn, Stephanie Y |author5=Wang, Mengru |author6=Makela, Susanna M |author7=Lopez, Alan D |author8=Lozano, Rafael |author9= Murray, Christopher JL  |title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980–2008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5|journal=The Lancet|date=May 2010|volume=375|issue=9726|pages=1609–1623|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60518-1 |pmid=20382417}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the high maternal mortality rate in Haiti can be attributed to the fact that women in developing countries tend to have on average more pregnancies than those in developed countries, factors that play a much larger role include poverty, distance, and inadequate services, all of which are negative impacts of [[structural violence]].&lt;ref name=WHOmaternalmortality /&gt;  As a result,  women often experience long delays in seeking medical help for [[obstetric]] emergency, difficulty reaching an obstetric facility, or not receiving adequate care at the [[obstetric]]  facility, all of which can be life-threatening for [[pregnancy|pregnant women]] living in resource-poor settings.&lt;ref name=threeedelaysframework /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berggren|first=Warren L.|author2=Ewbank, Douglas C. |author3=Berggren, Gretchen G. |title=Reduction of Mortality in Rural Haiti through a Primary-Health-Care Program|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=28 May 1981|volume=304|issue=22|pages=1324–1330|doi=10.1056/NEJM198105283042203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the overall population, the [[mortality rates]] for Haitians between 15 and 60 years old is 258 and 223 per 1000 individuals for [[males]] and [[females]] respectively.&lt;ref name=WHOhaiti /&gt;

====Burden of disease====
The lack of development and spending on healthcare resources and services makes [[Haitians]], particularly those living in [[rural areas]], susceptible to diseases that are otherwise manageable.&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt;&lt;ref name=farmer2001infectionsandinequalities /&gt;  For example, the WHO confirmed that a [[typhoid fever]] outbreak that occurred in 2003 was due to a lack of access to [[Physician|doctors]] and clean water infrastructure.&lt;ref name=countryprofilehaiti /&gt; Across the nation, it is estimated that there are about 25 [[physicians]] and 11 [[nurses]] for every 100,000 Haitians.&lt;ref name=unicefhaiti /&gt; WHO also estimates that 43% of the population receives all the recommended immunizations. For communicable diseases, this means loss of [[herd immunity]]&lt;ref name=countryprofilehaiti /&gt; This lack of healthcare resources and a disease-friendly environment puts [[Haiti]]’s burden of disease to be much higher than that of most nations. In the 2010 World Malaria Report, confirmed cases of [[malaria]] in Haiti tripled from 16,897 to 49,535 between 2000 and 2009.&lt;ref name=malariareport&gt;{{cite book|last=Programme|first=WHO Global Malaria|title=World malaria report 2010.|year=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9789241564106|url=http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/worldmalariareport2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, less than 20% of all households in Haiti have [[mosquito nets|Insecticide-treated bed nets]] to protect themselves against [[mosquitoes]].&lt;ref name=unicefhaiti /&gt; In 2010, Haiti also experienced a [[cholera]] outbreak that spread quickly throughout the nation due to difficulties in healthcare access and the lack of experience of the healthcare system.

==Causes==
[[File:Duvalier (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|40th President of Haiti, [[François Duvalier]]]]

===Political issues===
One cause that has resulted in significant levels of [[structural violence]] within Haiti is [[political instability]] and [[political corruption|corruption]].&lt;ref name=Pathologiesofpower /&gt;&lt;ref name=anthropologyofstructuralv /&gt; Over the past 200 years, [[Politics of Haiti|Haitian politics]] have gone through periods of social unrest and turmoil. The nation has experienced more than 30 [[Coup d'états]]. There has been a long{{clarify|how long?|date=April 2014}} history of oppression by [[dictators]].&lt;ref name=malariahaiti /&gt;  Political instability and [[corruption]] have left the country with a number of social problems, such as a lack of access to [[basic human rights]], including [[education]] and [[healthcare]]; and an economy with a lower than average domestic product.&lt;ref name=medicalpeacework&gt;{{cite book|last=Medical Peace Work|title=Course e-book 4: Structural violence and the underlying causes of violent conflict|year=2012|publisher=Medact|location=London|isbn=978-0-9571478-7-4|url=http://www.medicalpeacework.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ebooks/mpw_course4_2012.pdf|edition=2nd|veditors=Salvage J, Rowson M, Melf K, Sandøy I |accessdate=24 April 2014|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, Haiti ranks 162 out of 183 economies in the world and 31 out of 32 economies within [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref name=WorldEconomicForum&gt;{{cite report|last=World Economic Forum|title=Private Sector Development in Haiti:  Opportunities for Investment, Job  Creation and Growth|date=2011|publisher=World Economic Forum|location=Geneva|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Haiti_PrivateSectorDevelopment_Report_2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low economic ranking limits the level of job creation and availability. This lack of job creation contributes to Haiti’s  unemployment rate of 40.6%, with more than two-thirds of the labor force not holding formal jobs.&lt;ref name=CIAfactbookhaiti&gt;{{cite web|last=Central Intelligence Agency|title=The World Factbook: Haiti - Economy: Overview|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impacts of post-colonialism===
Another cause of structural violence is the impact of [[post-colonialism]]. During the 19th century, [[colonialism|European expansion]] into the [[New World]] created social arrangements such as [[slavery]] and [[institutionalized racism]]. The remnants of these social structures  exist today in the form of [[caste]]-based [[racial discrimination]], which contributes to the social inequality and economic disparities present within Haiti.&lt;ref name=classstructurehaiti&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wingfield|first=R.|author2=Parenton, V.

:Kate Zernike, a national correspondent for ''[[The New York Times]],'' wrote: "It could be hard to define a Tea Party agenda; to some extent it depended on where you were. In the Northeast, groups mobilized against high taxes; in the Southwest, illegal immigration. Some Tea Partiers were clearer about what they didn't want than what they did. But the shared ideology—whether for young libertarians who came to the movement through Ron Paul or older 9/12ers who came to it through Glenn Beck—was the belief that a strict interpretation of the Constitution was the solution to government grown wild. [...] By getting back to what the founders intended, they believed they could right what was wrong with the country. Where in the Constitution, they asked, does it say that the federal government was supposed to run banks? Or car companies? Where does it say that people have to purchase health insurance? Was it so much to ask that officials honor the document they swear an oath to uphold?"&lt;/ref&gt; Tea Party groups have also voiced support for [[right to work]] legislation as well as tighter border security, and opposed amnesty for illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Tea Party groups ramp up fight against immigration bill, as August recess looms | url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/07/05/tea-party-groups-ramp-up-fight-against-immigration-bill-as-august-recess-looms/?intcmp=trending | work = [[Fox News]] | date = July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Woodruff | first = Betsy | title = Tea Party – vs – Immigration Reform | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/351649/tea-party-vs-immigration-reform-betsy-woodruff | work = [[National Review]] | date = June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the federal health care reform law, they began to work at the state level to nullify the law, after the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] lost seats in congress and the Presidency in the [[United States elections, 2012|2012 elections]].&lt;ref name="Fringe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rauch2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rauch | first = Jonathan | title = The Tea Party's Next Move | url = http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-tea-party-s-next-move-a-health-care-compact-20110210?mrefid=site_search&amp;page=1 | work = [[National Journal]] | date = March 2, 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928090416/http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/the-tea-party-s-next-move-a-health-care-compact-20110210?mrefid=site_search&amp;page=1 | archivedate = September 28, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also mobilized locally against the [[United Nations]] [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Fringe"&gt;{{cite news | last = Gabriel | first = Trip | title = Clout Diminished, Tea Party Turns to Narrower Issues | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/us/politics/tea-party-its-clout-diminished-turns-to-fringe-issues.html?pagewanted=all | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Carey | first = Nick | title = Tea Party versus Agenda 21: Saving the U.S. or just irking it? | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/15/us-usa-campaign-teaparty-agenda-idUSBRE89E04J20121015 | work = [[Reuters]] | date = October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have protested the IRS for [[2013 IRS scandal|controversial treatment]] of groups with "tea party" in their names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ballhaus | first = Rebecca | title = Tea Party Protesters Rally Against IRS, Government | url =https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/06/19/tea-party-protesters-rally-against-irs-government/ | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have formed [[Super PACs]] to support candidates sympathetic to their goals and have opposed what they call the "Republican establishment" candidates.

The Tea Party does not have a single uniform agenda. The decentralized character of the Tea Party, with its lack of formal structure or hierarchy, allows each autonomous group to set its own priorities and goals. Goals may conflict, and priorities will often differ between groups. Many Tea Party organizers see this as a strength rather than a weakness, as decentralization has helped to immunize the Tea Party against co-opting by outside entities and corruption from within.&lt;ref name="Rauch1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Rauch | first = Jonathan | title = Group Think: Inside the Tea Party's Collective Brain | url = http://www.jonathanrauch.com/jrauch_articles/2010/09/group-think-inside-the-tea-partys-collective-brain.html | work = [[National Journal]] | date = March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One attempt at forming a list of what Tea Partiers wanted Congress to do resulted in the ''[[Contract from America]]''. It was a legislative agenda created by conservative activist Ryan Hecker with the assistance of [[Dick Armey]] of FreedomWorks. Armey had co-written with [[Newt Gingrich]] the previous [[Contract with America]] released by the Republican Party during the 1994 midterm elections. One thousand agenda ideas that had been submitted were narrowed down to twenty-one non-social issues. Participants then voted in an online campaign in which they were asked to select their favorite policy planks. The results were released as a ten-point Tea Party platform.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tea-party-activists-craft-contract-america/story?id=9740705|title=Tea Party Activists Craft 'Contract from America'|last=Davis|first=Teddy|date=February 9, 2010|work=[[ABC News]]|publisher=American Broadcasting Company|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis |first=Teddy |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tea-party-activists-unveil-contract-america/story?id=10376437&amp;page=2 |title=Tea Party Activists Unveil 'Contract from America' |work=[[ABC News]] |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Contract from America was met with some support within the Republican Party, but it was not broadly embraced by GOP leadership, which released its own '[[Pledge to America]]'.&lt;ref name="Davis2"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[United States elections, 2012|2012 American elections]], some Tea Party activists have taken up more traditionally populist ideological viewpoints on issues that are distinct from general conservative views. Examples are various Tea Party demonstrators sometimes coming out in favor of [[Immigration reform|U.S. immigration reform]] as well as for raising the [[Minimum wage in the United States|U.S. minimum wage]].&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

===Foreign policy===
{{see also|Foreign policy of the United States}}

Historian and writer [[Walter Russell Mead]] analyzes the foreign policy views of the Tea Party movement in a 2011 essay published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''. Mead says that [[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] populists, such as the Tea Party, combine a belief in [[American exceptionalism]] and its role in the world with skepticism of American's "ability to create a liberal world order". When necessary, they favor '[[total war]]' and unconditional surrender over "limited wars for limited goals". Mead identifies two main trends, one personified by former Texas Congressman [[Ron Paul]] and the other by former Governor of Alaska [[Sarah Palin]]. "Paulites" have a Jeffersonian approach that seeks to avoid foreign military involvement. "Palinites", while seeking to avoid being drawn into unnecessary conflicts, favor a more aggressive response to maintaining America's primacy in international relations. Mead says that both groups share a distaste for "liberal internationalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Tea Party and American Foreign Policy: What Populism Means for Globalism |first =Walter Russell |last=Mead |authorlink=Walter Russell Mead |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67455/walter-russell-mead/the-tea-party-and-american-foreign-policy |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=March–April 2011 |pages=28–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Tea Party" is a reference to the [[Boston Tea Party]], a protest in 1773 by colonists who objected to British taxation without representation, and demonstrated by dumping British tea taken from docked ships into the harbor. The event was one of the first in a series that led to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[American Revolution]] that gave birth to American independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jill |last=Lepore |title=The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle over American History |year=2010 |pages=77–79 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0691150277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have referred to the ''Tea'' in "Tea Party" as the [[backronym]] "Taxed Enough Already", though this did not appear until months after the first nationwide protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder |first=Anne |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/anneschroeder/0409/TEA__Taxed_Enough_Already.html |title= T.E.A. = Taxed Enough Already |publisher=Politico.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCnjT8ORAM This World: Tea Party America, BBC 2, November 1, 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727004839/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKCnjT8ORAM |date=July 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|375px|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance. On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair throw crates of tea overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, stands on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|This iconic 1846 lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] was entitled "The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor"; the phrase "Boston Tea Party" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''Shoemaker'', pp. 183–85.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Commentaries on origin====
[[Fox News Channel]] commentator [[Juan Williams]] has said that the Tea Party movement emerged from the "ashes" of [[Ron Paul]]'s 2008 presidential primary campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/05/10/juan-williams-surprising-rise-rep-ron-paul/ |work=[[Fox News]] | title= The Surprising Rise of Rep. Ron Paul|first=Juan|last=Williams| date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ron Paul has stated that its origin was on December 16, 2007, when supporters held a 24-hour record breaking, "[[moneybomb]]" fundraising event on the [[Boston Tea Party]]'s 234th anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vogel | first = Kenneth | author-link = Kenneth Vogel | title = Money bomb': Ron Paul raises $6 million in 24-hour period | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-12-17-ronpaul-fundraising_N.htm | work = [[USA Today]] | date = December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that others, including Republicans, took over and changed some of the movement's core beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Questions Ron Paul Answered During an Online Q&amp;A|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2013/08/no_author/more-than-10000-asked-ron-paul-anything/|website=[[LewRockwell.com]]|date=August 24, 2013|accessdate=June 12, 2014|quote=The Tea Party was actually started during the Ron Paul presidential campaign in 2007 when there was a spontaneous moneybomb that was done on the anniversary of the original tea party.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levenson|first=Michael |title=Ron Paul raises millions in today's Boston Tea Party event |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/12/16/ron_paul_raises_millions_in_todays_boston_tea_party_event/ |date=December 16, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2014 |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Slate.com]], [[Dave Weigel]] has argued in concurrence that, in his view, the "first modern Tea Party events occurred in December 2007, long before [[Barack Obama]] took office, and they were organized by supporters of Rep. Ron Paul," with the movement expanding and gaining prominence in 2009.&lt;ref name=myths/&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ron Paul College Supporters.jpg]] --&gt; [[Barack Obama]], the first [[African American]] [[President of the United States]], took office in January 2009.

Journalist [[Jane Mayer]] has said that the [[Koch brothers]] were essential in funding and strengthening the movement, through groups such as [[Americans for Prosperity]].&lt;ref name="Mayer"/&gt; In 2013, a study published in the journal ''Tobacco Control'' concluded that organizations within the movement were connected with non-profit organizations that the tobacco industry and other corporate interests worked with and provided funding for,&lt;ref name=qb&gt;{{cite journal |title='To quarterback behind the scenes, third-party efforts': the tobacco industry and the Tea Party |first1=Amanda |last1=Fallin |first2=Rachel |last2=Grana |first3=Stanton A. |last3=Glantz |url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/02/07/tobaccocontrol-2012-050815.full |journal=[[Tobacco Control (journal)|Tobacco Control]] |date=February 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Fernandez | first = Elizabeth | title = Study: Tea Party Organizations Have Ties To Tobacco Industry Dating Back To 1980s | url = http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2013/02/13507/study-tea-party-organizations-have-ties-tobacco-industry-dating-back-1980s | publisher = [[University of California San Francisco]] | date = February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the group [[Citizens for a Sound Economy]].&lt;ref name="Brendan DeMelle 2013"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brendan-demelle/study-confirms-tea-party-_b_2663125.html |title=Study Confirms Tea Party Was Created by Big Tobacco and Billionaire Koch Brothers |first=Brendan |last=DeMelle |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=February 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rawstory.com"&gt;{{cite news | last = Webster | first = Stephen C. | title = Documents reveal tobacco companies funded their own 'tea party' first | url = http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/02/11/documents-reveal-tobacco-companies-funded-their-own-tea-party-first/ | work = [[The Raw Story]] | date = February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Gore]] cited the study and said that the connections between "market fundamentalists", the tobacco industry and the Tea Party could be traced to a 1971 memo from tobacco lawyer [[Lewis F.

Former governor of [[Alaska]] and vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]], keynoting a Tea Party Tax Day protest at the state capital in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] on April 15, 2011, reflected on the origins of the Tea Party movement and credited President Barack Obama, saying "And speaking of President Obama, I think we ought to pay tribute to him today at this Tax Day Tea Party because really he's the inspiration for why we're here today. That's right. The Tea Party Movement wouldn't exist without Barack Obama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |title=[[Citizen Koch]] |people=Lessin, Tia and Deal, Carl |date=2013 |medium=Motion picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |publisher=[[Fox News]] |url=http://nation.foxnews.com/politics/2011/04/16/palin-gop-fight-girl |title= Palin to GOP: 'Fight Like a Girl' |accessdate=April 17, 2015 |date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First national protests and birth of national movement===

On February 18, 2009, the one-month old Obama administration announced the [[Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan]], an economic recovery plan to help home owners avoid foreclosure by refinance mortgages in the wake of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]]. The next day, [[CNBC]] business news editor [[Rick Santelli]] criticized the Plan in a live broadcast from the floor of the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].

According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' writer Ben McGrath and ''New York Times'' reporter Kate Zernike, this is where the movement was first inspired to coalesce under the collective banner of "Tea Party."&lt;ref name="Zernike"/&gt;&lt;ref name = McGrath/&gt; Santelli's remarks "set the fuse to the modern anti-Obama Tea Party movement," according to journalist [[Lee Fang]].&lt;ref name="themachine"/&gt; About 10 hours after Santelli's remarks, reTeaParty.com was bought to coordinate Tea Parties scheduled for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and, as of March 4, was reported to be receiving 11,000 visitors a day.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt; Within hours, the conservative [[political advocacy group]] [[Americans for Prosperity]] registered the [[domain name]] "TaxDayTeaParty.com," and launched a website calling for protests against Obama.&lt;ref name="themachine"/&gt; Overnight, websites such as "ChicagoTeaParty.com" (registered in August 2008 by Chicagoan Zack Christenson, radio producer for conservative talk show host [[Milt Rosenberg]]) were live within 12 hours.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/04/opinion/main4843055.shtml |title=Opposition To The Foreclosure Bailout Rises |first= Jonathan V. |last=Last |publisher=[[Weekly Standard]] (reprinted by CBS News.com) |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next day, guests on Fox News had already begun to mention this new "Tea Party."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/search-results/m/21911279/worst-case-scenario-no-3.htm |title=Worst Case Scenario No. 3 |date=February 20, 2009 |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', a [[Facebook]] page was developed on February 20 calling for Tea Party protests across the country.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-hamsher/a-teabagger-timeline-koch_b_187312.html |title=A Teabagger Timeline: Koch, Coors, Newt, Dick Armey There From The Start |last=Hamsher |first=Jane |work=Huffington Post |date=April 15, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care bill===
{{see also|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act}}
Opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) has been consistent within the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref name = tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/&gt; The scheme has often been referred to as 'Obamacare' by critics, but was soon adopted as well by many of its advocates, including President Obama. This has been an aspect of an overall [[Political dissent|anti-government]] message throughout Tea Party [[rhetoric]] that includes opposition to [[Gun control in the United States|gun control]] measures and to federal spending increases.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Activism by Tea Party people against the major health-care reform law from 2009 to 2014 has, according to the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'', focused on pushing for Congressional victories so that a repeal measure would pass both houses and that President Obama's [[U.S. Presidential veto|veto]] could be overridden. Some conservative public officials and commentators such as columnist [[Ramesh Ponnuru]] have criticized these views as completely unrealistic with the chances of overriding a [[List of United States presidential vetoes|Presidential veto]] being slim, with Ponnuru stating that "If you have in 2017 a Republican government... and it doesn't get rid of Obamacare, then I think that is a huge political disaster".&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/2014/05/17/5030315/tea-party-is-losing-battles-but.html|publisher=''[[Kansas City Star]]''|accessdate=May 18, 2014|title=Tea party says it is winning the message war despite losing election battles|first=Dave|last=Helling|date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from rallies, some groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement began to focus on getting out the vote and ground game efforts on behalf of candidates supportive of their agenda starting in the 2010 elections.

Various Tea Party groups have endorsed candidates in the elections. In the 2010 midterm elections, ''The New York Times'' identified 138 candidates for Congress with significant Tea Party support, and reported that all of them were running as Republicans—of whom 129 were running for the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and 9 for the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Zernike | first = Kate | title = Tea Party Set to Win Enough Races for Wide Influence | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/us/politics/15teaparty.html?_r=1&amp;hp | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[NBC News]] in mid October showed 35% of likely voters were Tea-party supporters, and they favored the Republicans by 84% to 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Weisman | first = Jonathan | title = GOP in Lead in Final Lap | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303550904575562493014465942 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] | date = October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Tea Party affiliated candidate to be elected into office is believed to be Dean Murray, a [[Long Island]] businessman, who won a special election for a New York State Assembly seat in February 2010.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{Cite news | last = Andrew | first = Malcolm |title =Dean Murray, first elected Tea Party activist, joins N.Y.

According to statistics on an NBC blog, overall, 32% of the candidates that were backed by the Tea Party or identified themselves as a Tea Party member won election. Tea Party supported candidates won 5 of 10 Senate races (50%) contested, and 40 of 130 House races (31%) contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Moe | first = Alexandra |title=Just 32% of Tea Party candidates win |url= http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2010/11/03/5403120-just-32-of-tea-party-candidates-win |work = [[NBC News]] (first read) |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primaries for [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010|Colorado]], [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|Nevada]] and [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2010|Delaware]] the Tea-party backed Senate Republican nominees defeated "establishment" Republicans that had been expected to win their respective Senate races, but went on to lose in the general election to their Democratic opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jacobson | first = Gary C. | title = Barack Obama, the Tea Party, and the 2010 Midterm Elections | url = https://ay12-14.moodle.wisc.edu/prod/pluginfile.php/252087/mod_resource/content/1/Jacobson%202010%20Midterms.pdf | publisher = University of California | location = San Diego | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tea Party is generally associated with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Newport | first = Frank | title = Tea Party Supporters Overlap Republican Base| url = http://www.gallup.com/poll/141098/tea-party-supporters-overlap-republican-base.aspx | work = [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] | date = July 2, 2010 | access-date = June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most politicians with the "Tea Party brand" have run as Republicans. In recent elections in the 2010s, Republican primaries have been the site of competitions between the more conservative, Tea Party wing of the party and the more moderate, establishment wing of the party. The Tea Party has incorporated various conservative internal factions of the Republican Party to become a major force within the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Abramowitz | first =Alan I. | author-link = Alan Abramowitz | title = The Republican establishment versus The Tea Party | url = http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/not-their-cup-of-tea-the-republican-establishment-versus-the-tea-party | publisher = [[University of Virginia Center for Politics]] | date = November 14, 2013 | access-date = June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tam Cho | first1 = Wendy K. | last2 = Gimpel | first2 = James G. | last3 = Shaw | first3 = Daron R. | title = The Tea Party Movement and the geography of collective action | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Political Science]] | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–33 | doi = 10.1561/100.00011051 | date = April 2012 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.471.251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea Party candidates were less successful in the 2012 election, winning four of 16 Senate races contested, and losing approximately 20% of the seats in the House that had been gained in 2010. Tea Party Caucus founder Michele Bachmann was re-elected to the House by a narrow margin.&lt;ref&gt;See:

A May 2014 ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' article remarked about the Tea Party movement post-2012, "Tea party candidates are often inexperienced and sometimes underfunded. More traditional Republicans—hungry for a win—are emphasizing electability over philosophy, particularly after high-profile losses in 2012. Some in the GOP have made that strategy explicit."&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

In June 2014, Tea Party favorite [[Dave Brat]] unseated the sitting GOP [[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]]. Brat had previously been known as an [[economist]] and a professor at [[Randolph–Macon College]], running a grassroots conservative campaign that espoused greater fiscal restraint and his [[Milton Friedman]]-based viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-david-brat-look-economics-professor-who-toppled-eric-cantor-1598240|title=Who Is David Brat?

In November 2014, [[Tim Scott]] became the first African-American member of the U.S. Senate from the South since the [[Reconstruction Era|reconstruction era]], winning the [[South Carolina]] seat formerly held by [[Jim DeMint]] in a [[United States Senate special election in South Carolina, 2014|special election]]. Scott remarked to political commentator [[Glenn Beck]] that the Tea Party is neither [[Racism|racist]] nor [[Sexism|sexist]], and he also stated that he hoped to see more good-faith efforts to work together between the tea party and political factions in the future. The Senator had been endorsed by several figures within the Tea Party movement prior to his election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ritz | first = Erica |title=Tim Scott Urges Media and Politicians to Stop 'Race-Baiting' and Appealing to the 'Lowest Common Denominator of Fear' |url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/11/05/tim-scott-urges-media-and-politicians-to-stop-race-baiting-and-appealing-to-the-lowest-common-denominator-of-fear/|work=[[TheBlaze]] | date = November 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lois Lerner testifying before US House Oversight Cmte in 2014.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Lois Lerner testifies before the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] in 2014.]]

In May 2013, the [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) flagged Tea Party groups and other conservative groups for review of their applications for tax-exempt status during the 2012 election. This led to both political and public condemnation of the agency, and triggered multiple investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman |first=Alex |url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/05/14/the-real-irs-scandal |title=The Real IRS Scandal  |periodical=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups were asked for donor lists, which is usually a violation of IRS policy. Groups were also asked for details about family members and about their postings on social networking sites. [[Lois Lerner]], head of the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt groups, apologized on behalf of the IRS and stated, "That was wrong. That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate."&lt;ref name="IRS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTIRS" /&gt; Testifying before Congress in March 2012, IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman denied that the groups were being targeted based on their political views.&lt;ref name="IRS"&gt;Ohlemacher, Stephen.

Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, rejected the apology as insufficient, demanding "ironclad guarantees from the I.R.S. that it will adopt significant protocols to ensure this kind of harassment of groups that have a constitutional right to express their own views never happens again."&lt;ref name="NYTIRS"&gt;Weisman, Jonathan.

United States]]; the IRS consented to express "its sincere apology" for singling out the plaintiff for aggressive scrutiny, stating, "The IRS admits that its treatment of Plaintiffs during the tax-exempt determinations process, including screening their applications based on their names or policy positions, subjecting those applications to heightened scrutiny and inordinate delays, and demanding of some Plaintiffs' information that TIGTA determined was unnecessary to the agency's determination of their tax-exempt status, was wrong.  For such treatment, the IRS expresses its sincere apology."  That same month, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s inspector general reported that the I.R.S. had also targeted liberal groups, flagging organization names with terms that included "Progressive" and "Occupy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/irs-tea-party-lawsuit-settlement.html Justice Department Settles With Tea Party Groups After I.R.S.

Martin stated after the election that "with the victory of Donald Trump, the values and principles that gave rise to the tea party movement in 2009 are finally gaining the top seat of power in the White House."&lt;ref name="Alive&amp;Well"/&gt;

On the other hand, other commentators, including Paul H. Jossey,&lt;ref name="Jossey"&gt;Paul H. Jossey, [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/08/tea-party-pacs-ideas-death-214164  How We Killed the Tea Party], ''Politico Magazine'' (August 14, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; a conservative campaign finance attorney, and [[Jim Geraghty]] of the conservative ''[[National Review]]'',&lt;ref name="Geraghty"&gt;[[Jim Geraghty]], [http://www.nationalreview.com/article/430028/tea-partys-end The Death of the Tea Party], ''National Review'' (January 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; believed that the Tea Party to be dead or in decline. Jossey, for example,  argued that the Tea Party "began as an organic, policy-driven grass-roots movement" but was ultimately "drained of its vitality and resources by national [[political action committee]]s that dunned the movement's true believers endlessly for money to support its candidates and causes."&lt;ref name="Jossey"/&gt;

Mostly, Tea Party organizations are said to have shifted away from national demonstrations to local issues.&lt;ref name="HuffPostDec"/&gt; A shift in the operational approach used by the Tea Party has also affected the movement's visibility, with chapters placing more emphasis on the mechanics of policy and getting candidates elected rather than staging public events.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2012/0801/How-tea-party-and-its-unlikely-allies-nixed-Atlanta-s-transit-tax How tea party and its unlikely allies nixed Atlanta's transit tax] The Christian Science Monitor.

The Tea Party's involvement in the [[Republican Party presidential primaries|2012 GOP presidential primaries]] was minimal, owing to divisions over whom to endorse as well as lack of enthusiasm for all the candidates.&lt;ref name="DBDec"/&gt; However, the 2012 GOP ticket did have an influence on the Tea Party: following the selection of [[Paul Ryan]] as [[Mitt Romney]]'s vice-presidential running mate, ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared that the once fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now "indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/ryan-brings-the-tea-party-to-the-ticket/?smid=tw-thecaucus&amp;seid=auto "Ryan Brings the Tea Party to the Ticket"]; ''New York Times''; August 12, 2012; Retrieved August 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Tea Party has had a large influence on the Republican Party, it has attracted major criticism by public figures within the Republican coalition as well. Then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]] particularly condemned many Tea Party-connected politicians for their behavior during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013|2013 U.S. debt ceiling crisis]]. "I think they're misleading their followers," Boehner was publicly quoted as saying, "They're pushing our members in places where they don't want to be, and frankly I just think that they've lost all credibility." In the words of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', Boehner "stamped out Tea Party resistance to extending the debt ceiling... worried that his party's prospects would be damaged by adherence to the Tea Party's preference for default".&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

One 2013 survey found that, in political terms, 20% of self-identified Republicans stated that they considered themselves as part of the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref name=Richardson/&gt; Tea Party members rallied at the U.S. Capitol on February 27, 2014; their demonstrations celebrated the fifth anniversary of the movement coming together.&lt;ref name=realspin&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/02/24/as-the-tea-party-turns-five-it-looks-a-lot-like-the-conservative-base/|title=As The Tea Party Turns Five, It Looks A Lot Like The Conservative Base|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=May 19, 2014|author1=Karlyn Bowman|author2=Jennifer Marsico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership and demographics===
Several polls have been conducted on the demographics of the movement. Though the various polls sometimes turn up slightly different results, they tend to show that Tea Party supporters tend more likely, than Americans overall, to be [[White American|white]], male, married, older than 45, regularly attending religious services, conservative, and to be more wealthy and have more education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |title=Poll Finds Tea Party Backers Wealthier and More Educated |last=Zernike |first=Kate |author2=Megan Thee-Brenan |date=April 14, 2010 |work=New York Times |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-timescbs-news-poll-national-survey-of-tea-party-supporters?ref=politics National Survey of Tea Party Supporters] ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll; April 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G2000_B02001&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-SubjectID=15233308|title= Data Set: 2008 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |work=Survey: American Community Survey |author=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogel1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8E3F7732-18FE-70B2-A8C52111DA960902 |title=Poll: Tea Partiers Like GOP |first=Kenneth P. |last=Vogel |publisher=Politico |date=March 23, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329002130/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8E3F7732-18FE-70B2-A8C52111DA960902 |archive-date=March 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quinnipiac1"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1436 |title=Tea Party Could Hurt GOP In Congressional Races, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Dems Trail 2-Way Races, But Win If Tea Party Runs |publisher=Quinnipiac University |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=September 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809074638/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1295.xml?ReleaseID=1436 |archive-date=August 9, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, multiple surveys have found between 10% and 30% of Americans identify as a member of the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref name=realspin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/147635/tea-party-movement.aspx |title=Tea Party Movement &amp;#124; Gallup Historical Trends |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=August 10, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808203938/http://www.gallup.com/poll/147635/tea-party-movement.aspx |archive-date=August 8, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Republicans and 20% of Democrats support the movement according to one ''Washington Post''–[[ABC News]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller |first=Jaime |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/01/28/what-shutdown-new-poll-shows-tea-party-support-remains-steady/ |title=What shutdown?

The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' has noted that Tea Party activists "have been called neo-Klansmen and knuckle-dragging hillbillies", adding that "demonizing tea party activists tends to energize the Democrats' left-of-center base" and that "polls suggest that tea party activists are not only more mainstream than many critics suggest",&lt;ref name=Jonsson040310&gt;Patrik Jonsson, [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0403/Amid-harsh-criticisms-tea-party-slips-into-the-mainstream "Amid harsh criticisms, 'tea party' slips into the mainstream"] ''Christian Science Monitor'', April 3, 2010

A [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll conducted in March 2010 found that—other than gender, income and politics—self-described Tea Party members were demographically similar to the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/127181/tea-partiers-fairly-mainstream-demographics.aspx |title=Tea Partiers Are Fairly Mainstream in Their Demographics |publisher=Gallup.com |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article from [[Forbes.com]] stated that the Tea Party's membership appears reminiscent of the people who supported independent [[Ross Perot]]'s presidential campaigns in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=realspin/&gt;

When surveying supporters or participants of the Tea Party movement, polls have shown that they are to a very great extent more likely to be registered Republican, have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party and an unfavorable opinion of the Democratic Party.&lt;ref name="quinnipiac1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{Cite news |title=CBS/NY Times Poll: National Survey of Tea Party Supporters|url=http://documents.nytimes.com/new-york-timescbs-news-poll-national-survey-of-tea-party-supporters?ref=politics|work=New York Times |date=April 12, 2010 |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WinstonPoll/&gt;

According to Susan Page and Naomi Jagoda of ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2010, the Tea Party was more "a frustrated state of mind" than "a classic political movement".&lt;ref name = "PageNaomi"&gt;Page Susan; Jagoda Naomi (July 1, 2010). [https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010-07-01-tea-party_N.htm "What is the Tea Party? A growing state of mind"].

===Polling of supporters===

An October 2010 ''Washington Post'' canvass of local Tea Party organizers found 99% said "concern about the economy" was an "important factor".&lt;ref name="agwpostface"/&gt; Various polls have also probed Tea Party supporters for their views on a variety of political and controversial issues. On the question of whether they think their own income taxes this year are fair, 52% of Tea Party supporters told pollsters for [[CBS]]/''New York Times'' that they were, versus 62% in the general population (including Tea Party supporters).&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; A [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg News]] poll found that Tea Partiers are not against increased government action in all cases. "The ideas that find nearly universal agreement among Tea Party supporters are rather vague," says J. Ann Selzer, the pollster who created the survey. "You would think any idea that involves more government action would be anathema, and that is just not the case."

In advance of a new edition of their book ''American Grace'', political scientists David E. Campbell of Notre Dame and [[Robert D. Putnam]] of Harvard published in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' opinion the results of their research into the political attitudes and background of Tea Party supporters. Using a pre-Tea Party poll in 2006 and going back to the same respondents in 2011, they found the supporters to be not "nonpartisan political neophytes" as often described, but largely "overwhelmingly partisan Republicans" who were politically active prior to the Tea Party. The survey found Tea Party supporters "no more likely than anyone else" to have suffered hardship during the [[2007–present recession in the United States|2007–2010 recession]]. Additionally, the respondents were more concerned about "putting God in government" than with trying to shrink government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Campbell, David E.  |author2=Putnam, Robert D. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Crashing the Tea Party|date=August 16, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 17, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/opinion/crashing-the-tea-party.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=God&gt;David E.

The [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]] demonstrated considerable skepticism within the Tea Party movement with respect to the dangers and the reality of [[global warming]]. A ''New York Times''/CBS News Poll during the election revealed that only a small percentage of Tea Party supporters considered global warming a serious problem, much less than the portion of the general public that does. The Tea Party is strongly opposed to government-imposed limits on carbon dioxide emissions as part of [[emissions trading]] legislation to encourage use of fuels that emit less [[Carbon emissions|carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;John M.

On major national issues, 77% of Democrats said their views were closest to Obama's; in contrast, 76% of Republicans and 51% of unaffiliated voters identified closely with the Tea Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/october_2013/42_identify_with_obama_politically_42_with_the_tea_party | title=42% Identify with Obama Politically, 42% with the Tea Party |publisher=Rasmussen Reports |date=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other survey data over recent years show that past trends of partisan divides about the Tea Party remain. For example, a [[Pew Research Center]] poll from October 2013 reported that 69% of Democrats had an unfavorable view of the movement, in contrast to 49% of independents and 27% of Republicans.&lt;ref name=realspin/&gt; A CNN/ORC poll also conducted October 2013 generally showed that 28% of Americans were favorable to the Tea party while 56% were unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2013/images/10/22/10-22-2013.gop-tea.party.poll.pdf|title=CNN/ORC poll|date=October 22, 2013|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an AP/GfK survey from January 2014, 27% of respondents stated that they considered themselves a Tea Party supporter in comparison to 67% that said that they did not.&lt;ref name=realspin/&gt;

==Commentary by the Obama administration==

On April 29, 2009, Obama commented on the Tea Party protests during a townhall meeting in [[Arnold, Missouri]]: "Let me just remind them that I am happy to have a serious conversation about how we are going to cut our health care costs down over the long term, how we're going to stabilize Social Security. Claire McCaskill and I are working diligently to do basically a thorough audit of federal spending. But let's not play games and pretend that the reason is because of the recovery act, because that's just a fraction of the overall problem that we've got. We are going to have to tighten our belts, but we're going to have to do it in an intelligent way. And we've got to make sure that the people who are helped are working American families, and we're not suddenly saying that the way to do this is to eliminate programs that help ordinary people and give more tax cuts to the wealthy. We tried that formula for eight years. It did not work. And I don't intend to go back to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/29/obama_100_days_townhall_in_missouri_96272.html Obama's 100 Days Townhall in Missouri] [[Real Clear Politics]]; April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/04/29/obama-responds-to-tea-party-movement/ Obama responds to tea party movement] CNN Political Ticker; April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, 2010, Obama noted the passage of 25 different tax cuts over the past year, including tax cuts for 95% of working Americans. He then remarked, "So I've been a little amused over the last couple of days where people have been having these rallies about taxes. You would think they would be saying thank you. That's what you'd think."&lt;ref name="ABC pol punch"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/04/obama-at-democratic-fundraiser-tea-partiers-should-be-thanking-him-for-tax-cuts.html |title=Obama at Democratic Fundraiser: Tea Partiers Should Be Thanking Him for Tax Cuts |last=Travers |first=Karen |author2=Rachel Martin |date=April 15, 2010 |work=Political Punch |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419110031/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/04/obama-at-democratic-fundraiser-tea-partiers-should-be-thanking-him-for-tax-cuts.html |archivedate=April 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-dnc-reception-41510 "Remarks by the President at DNC Reception, April 15, 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026091601/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-dnc-reception-41510 |date=October 26, 2010 }} (Transcript). White House Press Office. April 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2010, at a townhall discussion sponsored by CNBC, Obama said healthy skepticism about government and spending was good, but it was not enough to just say "Get control of spending", and he challenged the Tea Party movement to get specific about how they would cut government debt and spending: "And so the challenge, I think, for the Tea Party movement is to identify specifically what would you do. It's not enough just to say, get control of spending. I think it's important for you to say, I'm willing to cut veterans' benefits, or I'm willing to cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, or I'm willing to see these taxes go up. What you can't do—which is what I've been hearing a lot from the other side—is say we're going to control government spending, we're going to propose $4&amp;nbsp;trillion of additional tax cuts, and that magically somehow things are going to work."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2010/09/obama-to-tea-party-what-would-you-do/1 Obama to Tea Party: 'What would you do?'] USA Today; September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/37814131/President-Obama-s-townhall-with-CNBC-John-Harwood-September-20-2010 President Obama's Townhall with CNBC John Harwood] Scribd Transcript; September 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He says that Fox News portrayed the protests "as a big story, CNN as a modest story, and [[MSNBC]] as a great story to make fun of.

According to [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]], a [[progressivism|progressive]] media watchdog, there is a disparity between large coverage of the Tea Party movement and minimal coverage of larger movements. In 2009, the major Tea Party protests were quoted twice as often as the [[National Equality March]] despite a much lower turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2010, a Tea Party protest was covered 59 times as much as the [[US Social Forum]] (177 Tea Party mentions versus 3 for Social Forum) despite the attendance of the latter being 25 times as much (600 Tea Party attendees versus at least 15,000 for Social Forum).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In April 2010, responding to a question from the media watchdog group [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]] posed the previous week, [[Rupert Murdoch]], the chief executive of [[News Corporation]], which owns Fox News, said, "I don't think we should be supporting the Tea Party or any other party." That same week, Fox News canceled an appearance by [[Sean Hannity]] at a [[Cincinnati]] Tea Party rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/us/17fox.html |work=The New York Times |title=Fox Canceled Hannity's Attendance at Tea Party's Tax Day Rally in Cincinnati |first=Brian |last=Stelter |date=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the September 12 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], Fox News said it was the only cable news outlet to cover the emerging protests and took out full-page ads in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the ''[[New York Post]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' with a prominent headline reading, "How did [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], CBS, NBC, MSNBC, and CNN miss this story?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Krakauer |first =Steve |title =Internal Fox News Email Addresses "Standards" After 9/12 Flap |publisher=Mediaite |date =September 21, 2009 |url =http://www.mediaite.com/tv/internal-fox-email-addresses-standards-after-912-flap/ |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news anchor [[Rick Sanchez]] disputed Fox's assertion, pointing to various coverage of the event.&lt;ref name="politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/18/networks-respond-to-false-fox-ad/ |title=Networks respond to false Fox ad |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0909/WaPo_defends_running_Fox_ad.html |title=WaPo defends running Fox ad |last=Calderone |first=Michael |date=September 18, 2009 |publisher=Politico |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediabistro.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/in_full_page_ad_fox_asks_where_were_other_media_on_912_the_answer_they_were_there_136133.asp?c=rss |title=In Full Page Ad, Fox Asks Where Were Other Media on 9/12.

James Rainey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that MSNBC's attacks on the tea parties paled compared to Fox's support, but that MSNBC personalities [[Keith Olbermann]], [[Rachel Maddow]] and [[Chris Matthews]] were hardly subtle in disparaging the movement.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Fox News, MSNBC prejudge 'tea parties' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 15, 2009 |url =http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-onthemedia15-2009apr15,0,189873.column |last=Rainey |first=James |accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Kurtz]] has said that, "These [FOX] hosts said little or nothing about the huge deficits run up by [[George W.

On the other hand, CNN and MSNBC may have dropped the ball by all but ignoring the protests."&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/18/AR2009091801102.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Fox News Ad Draws Protests |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |date=September 18, 2009 |accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January/February 2012 issue of ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', [[Francis Fukuyama]] stated that the Tea Party is supporting "politicians who serve the interests of precisely those [[financiers]] and [[corporate]] [[elites]] they claim to despise" and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] while comparing and contrasting it with the [[occupy movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136782/francis-fukuyama/the-future-of-history |title=The Future of History; Can Liberal Democracy Survive the Decline of the Middle Class? |publisher=Foreignaffairs.com |date=January 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnhp.org/blog/2012/01/06/francis-fukuyama-on-the-decline-of-the-middle-class/ |title=Francis Fukuyama on the decline of the middle class – PNHP's Official Blog |publisher=Pnhp.org |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tea Party's views of media coverage===

In October 2010, a survey conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' found that the majority of local Tea Party organizers consider the media coverage of their groups to be fair. Seventy-six percent of the local organizers said media coverage has been fair, while 23 percent have said coverage was unfair. This was based on responses from all 647 local Tea Party organizers the ''Post'' was able to contact and verify, from a list of more than 1,400 possible groups identified.&lt;ref name="agwpostmedia"&gt;Gardner, Amy [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/26/AR2010102602796.html "Tea party groups say media have been fair, survey finds"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 26, 2010.

Although the Tea Party has a libertarian element in terms of some issue convictions, most American libertarians do not support the movement enough to identify with it. A 2013 survey by the [[Public Religion Research Institute]] (PRRI) found that 61% of identified libertarians stated they did not consider themselves part of the tea party. This split exists due to the strong [[Christian right]] influence in the movement, which puts the majority of the tea party movement at direct odds against libertarians on issues such as the [[war on drugs]] (with the aforementioned survey finding that 71% of libertarians support legalizing marijuana).&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/29/libertarians-dont-call-us-tea-partyers-survey-find/?page=all|title=Libertarians: Don't call us tea partyers; survey finds blocs often clash|work=The Washingtion Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some libertarian leaning supporters have grown increasingly annoyed by the influx of religious social issues into the movement. Many in the movement would prefer the complex social issues such as homosexuality, abortion, and religion to be left out of the discussion, while instead increasing the focus on limited government and states' rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

According to a review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' published in 2012, professor Ronald P. Formisano in ''The Tea Party: A Brief History'' provides an "even-handed perspective on and clarifying misconceptions about America's recent political phenomenon" since "party supporters are not isolated zealots, and may, like other Americans, only want to gain control over their destinies". Professor Formisano sees underlying social roots and draws a parallel between the tea party movement and past support for independent candidate [[Ross Perot]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4214-0596-4 Publishers Weekly Reviewed on: 02/06/2012] ''The Tea Party: A Brief History'' (Ronald P.

==Controversy==
The final round of debate before voting on the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care bill]] was marked with vandalism and widespread threats of violence to at least ten Democratic lawmakers across the country, which created public relations problems for the fledgeling Tea Party movement. On March 22, 2010, in what the New York Times called "potentially the most dangerous of many acts of violence and threats against supporters of the bill," a [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] Tea Party organizer and the [[Danville, Virginia]] Tea Party Chairman both posted the home address of Representative [[Tom Perriello]]'s brother (mistakenly believing it was the Congressman's address) on their websites, and encouraged readers to "drop by" to express their anger against Representative Perriello's vote in favor of the healthcare bill. The following day, after smelling gas in his house, a severed gas line that connected to a [[propane tank]] was discovered on Perriello's brother's screened-in porch. Local police and [[FBI]] investigators determined that it was intentionally cut as an act of vandalism. Perriello's brother also received a threatening letter referencing the legislation. Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]] stated that posting a home address on a website and encouraging people to visit is "an appalling approach. It's not civil discourse, it's an invitation to intimidation and it's totally unacceptable." Leaders of the Tea Party movement tried to contain the public relations damage by denouncing the violent acts and distancing themselves from those behind the acts. One Tea Party website issued a response saying the Tea Party member's action of posting the address "was not requested, sanctioned or endorsed by the Lynchburg Tea Party". The director of the Northern Colorado Tea Party said, "Although many are frustrated by the passage of such controversial legislation, threats are absolutely not acceptable in any form, to any lawmaker, of any party."&lt;ref&gt;See:

In early July 2010, the North Iowa Tea Party (NITP) posted a billboard showing a photo of [[Adolf Hitler]] with the heading "National Socialism", one of Barack Obama with the heading "Democrat Socialism", and one of [[Vladimir Lenin]] with the heading "Marxist Socialism", all three marked with the word "change" and the statement "Radical leaders prey on the fearful and naive". It received sharp criticism, including some from other Tea Party activists. NITP co-founder Bob Johnson acknowledged the anti-socialist message may have gotten lost amid the fascist and communist images. Following a request from the NITP, the billboard was removed on July 14.&lt;ref&gt;See:

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Tranquillitas ordinis''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase meaning the "tranquility of order" or "well-ordered concord". The term is associated with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition of [[just war theory]], and is found in the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. Depending on the author and the context, the term is used to convey various meanings in [[theology]] and [[politics]]. These meanings include the divine order imposed on the universe and a theoretical framework for peace. ''Tranquillitas ordinis'' remains a cornerstone of Catholic teaching on peace. It is included in the framework laid out by [[Pope John XXIII]] in his 1963 [[encyclical]], ''[[Pacem in terris]]'', and is a featured topic at ''The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis'', a conference organized by the [[Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences|title=The Global Quest for Tranquillitas Ordinis|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/acdsoc/2012/passbooklet.pdf|publisher=Pontifical Academies|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Augustinian tradition ==
Augustine of Hippo defines the term "''Tranquillitas Ordinis''" in Book 19 of the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' as "the peace of all things" or "well-ordered concord".&lt;ref&gt;"Peace between man and God is the well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law. Peace between man and man is well-ordered concord. Civil peace is a similar concord among the citizens. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God. The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is the distribution which allots things equal and unequal, each to its own place."{{cite book|last=Augustine|first=Saint|title=The City of God|year=1993|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-679-60087-6|pages=690–691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine links peace with his meaning of order, in which all things in the universe have their proper place established by God, their creator. Peace is therefore the state a person or thing achieves when it is in accordance with the larger created order. In Book 19, Augustine describes the [[supreme good]] and discusses efforts people take in order to reach happiness on earth.&lt;ref&gt;"Augustine reviews the opinions of the philosophers regarding the supreme good, and their vain efforts to make for themselves a happiness in this life; and, while he refutes these, he takes occasion to show what the peace and happiness belonging to the heavenly city, or the people of Christ, are both now and hereafter."{{cite web|last=Dods|first=Marcus|title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, Vol. 2|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1201.htm|publisher=Christian Literature Publishing Co.|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Augustine denies the possibility of achieving ''tranquillitas ordinis'' on earth, he notes that aspects of the peace and happiness of heaven may still be found. Centuries later, Thomas Aquinas continued the tradition of true peace as ''tranquillitas ordinis'' in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kevin|title=Question 29. Peace|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3029.htm|work=The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas built upon the work of Augustine and formalized a theory of just war in which the Augustinian root idea of peace as ''tranquillitas ordinis'' is linked to the just war tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smit|first=Wim|title=Beyond Paralysing Fear and Blind Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re9SBcQ6fu4C&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=thomas+aquinas+tranquillitas+ordinis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FW8SDgygcW&amp;sig=mAURTeGxkxaFsueia6xCDm4wwes&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tmyUT-uuJ8qa6QG5zpmCBA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20aquinas%20tranquillitas%20ordinis&amp;f=false|work=Just War and Terrorism|publisher=Peeters|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Summa Theologica'', Aquinas describes the theory of just war as comprising a ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[jus in bello]]''. ''Jus ad bellum'' articulates the circumstances under which war may be pursued, while ''jus in bello'' describes correct conduct in war.

==George Weigel==
[[George Weigel]] is a prominent Catholic political and social author who serves as a Distinguished Senior Fellow of the [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]]. In his book ''Tranquillitas Ordinis: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace'', published in 1987, Weigel defines ''tranquillitas ordinis'' as the peace of "dynamic and rightly ordered political community" and "the order created by just political community and mediated through law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Moral Clarity in a Time of War|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/01/001-moral-clarity-in-a-time-of-war-30|publisher=First Things|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weigel also argued that ''tranquillitas ordinis'' provided a basis for the establishment of peace as a "''jus ad pacem''" to accompany the just war theory terms ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[jus in bello]]'', that is, a guide to achieving peace through political means, including war.&lt;ref&gt;"There I argued that, as a theory of statecraft, the just war tradition contained within itself a ius ad pacem, in addition to the classic ius ad bellum (the moral rules governing the decision to go to war) and ius in bello (the rules governing the use of armed force in combat). By coining the phrase ius ad pacem, I was trying to prise out of the just war way of thinking a concept of the peace that could and should be sought through the instruments of politics—including, if necessary, the use of armed force. Like the just war tradition itself, this concept of peace finds its roots in Augustine: in The City of God, peace is tranquillitas ordinis, the “tranquillity of order,” or as I preferred to render it in more contemporary terms, the peace of “dynamic and rightly ordered political community.”{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Moral Clarity in a Time of War|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/01/001-moral-clarity-in-a-time-of-war-30|publisher=First Things|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weigel expands on this concept to insist that the U.S. has a moral obligation under the criteria of ''tranquilitas ordinis'' to rid the world of [[terrorist organization]]s and prevent rogue regimes from obtaining [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Moral Clarity in a Time of War|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/01/001-moral-clarity-in-a-time-of-war-30|publisher=First Things|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weigel states in clear terms that ''tranquillitas ordinis'' is a concept of peace that the U.S. must spread internationally in a "quest for ordered liberty in an evolving structure of international public life capable of advancing the classic goals of politics—justice, freedom, order, the general welfare, and peace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=George|title=Moral Clarity in a Time of War|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/01/001-moral-clarity-in-a-time-of-war-30|publisher=First Things|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weigel establishes this view of ''tranquillitas ordinis'' as a practical concept for attempting to achieve peace on earth in combination with other like-minded nations. As such, ''tranquillitas ordinis'' exists as a framework for [[Public Diplomacy (U.S.)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">The '''Vientiane Treaty''' was a cease-fire agreement between the two warring Lao factions  - the [[monarch]]ial government of [[Laos]] and the [[communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] - signed in [[Vientiane]] (the capital of Laos), on February 21, 1973.

The Vientiane Treaty was in some sense a corollary to the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed the month before, which had ended [[United States|U.S.]] involvement in the [[Vietnam war]]. Just as the Paris Accords had mandated the withdrawal of all US forces in [[Vietnam]], the Vientiane Treaty called for the removal from Laos of all foreign forces allied to each side.

Under the terms of the treaty, a new coalition government was to be created; security in major cities (such as Vientiane) was to be undertaken by joint forces from both sides.

There were no outside guarantees to the terms, as the agreement was only between the Lao factions; the [[International Control Commission|ICC]] (which had overseen the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] ending the [[First Indochina War]]) was more powerless than before to monitor compliance.

The coalition government envisaged by the treaty did not long outlast it; as with the treaty itself, events in Laos emulated those in Vietnam. Shortly after [[Vietnam war#Fall of Saigon|the fall]] of the South Vietnamese government on 30 April 1975, the Pathet Lao took over Laos 15 August 1975.

'''Water conflict''' is a term describing a conflict between countries, states, or groups over an access to [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="Allianz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWilson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf A., et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United Nations]] recognizes that water disputes result from opposing interests of water users, public or private.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/pccp/ United Nations Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential, accessed November 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide range of water conflicts appear throughout history, though rarely are traditional wars waged over water alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gleick]], 1993. [http://www2.pacinst.org/reports/international_security_gleick_1993.pdf "Water and conflict."] ''[[International Security]]'' Vol. 18, No. 1, pp. 79-112 (Summer 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, water has historically been a source of tension and a factor in conflicts that start for other reasons.  However, water conflicts arise for several reasons, including territorial disputes, a fight for resources, and strategic advantage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research]] (Department of Political Science, [[University of Heidelberg]]); Conflict Barometer 2007:Crises – Wars – Coups d’Etat – Nagotiations – Mediations – Peace Settlements, 16th annual conflict analysis, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive online database of water-related conflicts—the Water Conflict Chronology—has been developed by the [[Pacific Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwater.org/water-conflict/ |title=Water Conflict Chronology |publisher=Pacific Institute |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This database lists violence over water going back nearly 5,000 years.

These conflicts occur over both [[freshwater]] and [[Seawater|saltwater]], and both between and within nations. However, conflicts occur mostly over freshwater; because freshwater resources are necessary, yet [[Water scarcity|scarce]], they are the center of water disputes arising out of need for [[potable water]], [[irrigation]] and [[energy generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php?id=671&amp;section=14 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010731141012/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/doc.php?id=671&amp;section=14 |archivedate=2001-07-31 |df= }} Freshwater: lifeblood of the planet, accessed November 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As freshwater is a vital, yet [[Water distribution on Earth|unevenly distributed]] natural resource, its availability often impacts the [[Quality of life|living]] and economic conditions of a country or region.

A recent report "Water Cooperation for a Secure World" published by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] concludes that active water cooperation between countries reduces the risk of war. This conclusion is reached after examining trans-boundary water relations in over 200 shared river basins in 148 countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/20795water-cooperature-sm.pdf Water Cooperation for a Secure World], Strategic Foresight Group&lt;/ref&gt; though as noted below, a growing number of water conflicts are sub-national.

== Causes ==
{{See also|Climate security|Causes of water scarcity in India}}
According to the [[1992 International Conference on Water and the Environment]],&lt;ref&gt;ICWE (1992). International Conference on Water and the Environment--Development Issues for the 21st Century, 26–31 January 1992, Dublin, Ireland : [http://www.ircwash.org/resources/international-conference-water-and-environment-development-issues-21st-century-26-31-0 the Dublin statement and report of the conference], Geneva, Switzerland, ICWE Secretariat, [[World Meteorological Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; water is a vital element for human life, and human activities are closely connected to availability and quality of water. Unfortunately, water is a limited resource and in the future access "might get worse with climate change, although scientists' projections of future rainfall are notoriously cloudy" writes [[Roger Harrabin]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Harrabin, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18353963 "Shortages: Water supplies in crises"], "BBC News", 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "it is now commonly said that future wars in the Middle East are more likely to be fought over water than over oil," said [[Lester R. Brown]] at a previous [[Stockholm Water Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-policy.org/press_room/C68/stockholm_transcript|title=EPI Releases - How Water Scarcity Will Shape the New Century - EPI|website=www.earth-policy.org|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water conflicts occur because the demand for water resources and [[potable water]] can exceed supply, or because control over access and allocation of water may be disputed. Elements of a [[water crisis]] may put pressures on affected parties to obtain more of a shared water resource, causing diplomatic tension or outright conflict.

11% of the [[global population]], or 783 million people, are still without access to improved sources of drinking water &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/statistics_san.html "UN Water Statistics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517184922/http://www.unwater.org/statistics_san.html |date=2013-05-17 }}, "UN-Water"&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the catalyst for potential for water disputes. Besides life, water is necessary for proper [[sanitation]], commercial services, and the production of commercial goods. Thus numerous types of parties can become implicated in a water dispute. For example, corporate entities may [[water pollution|pollute water]] resources shared by a community, or governments may argue over who gets access to a [[river]] used as an international or inter-state boundary.

The broad spectrum of water disputes makes them difficult to address. Local and international law, commercial interests, environmental concerns, and human rights questions make water disputes complicated to solve – combined with the sheer number of potential parties, a single dispute can leave a large list of demands to be met by courts and lawmakers.

== Economic and trade issues ==

Water’s viability as a commercial resource, which includes [[fishing]], [[agriculture]], manufacturing, recreation and [[tourism]], among other possibilities, can create dispute even when access to potable water is not necessarily an issue. As a resource, some consider water to be [[oil price|as valuable as oil]], needed by nearly every industry, and needed nearly every day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2008/05/13/water-electricity-industry-biz-energy-cx_bp_0514water_print.html] Pentland, William. "The Water-Industrial Complex," Forbes, May 14, 2008. Accessed November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Water shortages can completely cripple an industry just as it can cripple a population, and affect developed countries just as they affect countries with less-developed water infrastructure. Water-based industries are more visible in water disputes, but commerce at all levels can be damaged by a lack of water.

International commercial disputes between nations can be addressed through the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which has water-specific groups like a Fisheries Center that provide a unified judicial protocol for commercial conflict resolution. Still, water conflict occurring domestically, as well as conflict that may not be entirely commercial in nature may not be suitable for arbitration by the WTO.

=== Fishing ===
Historically, [[fisheries]] have been the main sources of question, as nations expanded and claimed portions of oceans and seas as territory for ‘domestic’ commercial fishing. Certain lucrative areas, such as the [[Bering Sea]], have a history of dispute; in 1886 Great Britain and the United States clashed over sealing fisheries,&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2007, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and today Russia surrounds a pocket of international water known as the Bering Sea Donut Hole. Conflict over fishing routes and access to the hole was resolved in 1995 by a convention referred to colloquially as the Donut Hole Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlap, William W. The International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law, Volume 10, Number 1, 1995, pp. 114-135(22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Corporate interest often crosses opposing commercial interest, as well as environmental concerns, leading to another form of dispute. In the 1960s, [[Lake Erie]], and to a lesser extent, the other [[Great Lakes]] were polluted to the point of massive fish death. Local communities suffered greatly from dismal water quality until the United States Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1251}} ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] poses a significant health risk, especially in heavily industrialized, heavily populated areas like China. In response to a worsening situation in which entire cities lacked safe drinking water, China passed a revised Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-02/29/content_6494712.htm] China Daily, Updated February 29, 2008. Accessed November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of polluted water making it way across international boundaries, as well as unrecognized water pollution within a poorer country brings up questions of human rights, allowing for international input on water pollution. There is no single framework for dealing with pollution disputes local to a nation.

==Classifications==
According to Aaron Wolf, et all.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf A., Yoffe S., Giordano M., International Waters: Indicators for Identifying basins at risk, PCCP project, UNESCO, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  there were 1831 water conflicts over transboundary [[Drainage basin|basin]]s from 1950–2000. They categorized these events as following:

*No water-related events on the extremes
*Most interactions are cooperative
*Most interactions are mild
*Water acts as irritant
*Water acts as unifier
*Nations cooperate over a wide variety of issues
*Nations conflict over quantity and infrastructure

A comprehensive chronology of water-related conflicts is maintained by the [[Pacific Institute]] in their Water Conflict Chronology, which includes an [[open-source data]] set, an interactive map, and full information on citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwater.org/water-conflict/ |title=The Water Conflict Chronology |publisher=Pacific Institute |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These historical examples go back over 4,500 years. In this dataset, water conflicts are categorized as follows:

*Control of Water Resources (state and [[non-state actor]]s): where water supplies or access to water is at the root of tensions.
*Military Tool (state actors): where water resources, or water systems themselves, are used by a nation or state as a weapon during a military action.
*Political Tool (state and non-state actors): where water resources, or water systems themselves, are used by a nation, state, or non-state actor for a political goal.
*Terrorism (non-state actors): where water resources, or water systems, are either targets or tools of violence or coercion by non-state actors.
*Military Target (state actors): where water resource systems are targets of military actions by nations or states.
*Development Disputes (state and non-state actors): where water resources or water systems are a major source of contention and dispute in the context of economic and social development

==Response==

International organizations play the largest role in mediating water disputes and improving water management. From scientific efforts to quantify water pollution, to the World Trade Organization’s efforts to resolve trade disputes between nations, the varying types of water disputes can be addressed through current framework. Yet water conflicts that go unresolved become more dangerous as water becomes more scarce and global population increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoninstitute.org/wbp/global-water-crisis/457] Brooks, Nina. "Impending Water Crisis in China," Arlington Institute. Accessed November 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations ===
The UN [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/water/ihp/about-ihp/ International Hydrological Program] aims to help improve understanding of water resources and foster effective water management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://typo38.unesco.org/index.php?id=240 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302230417/http://typo38.unesco.org/index.php?id=240 |archivedate=2010-03-02 |df= }} UNESCO: International Hydrological Programme, accessed November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; But by far the most active UN program in water dispute resolution is its [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/pccp Potential Conflict to Co-operation Potential] (PCCP) mission, which is in its third phase, training water professionals in the Middle East and organizing educational efforts elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/water/wwap/pccp/] United Nations Potential Conflict to Cooperation Potential accessed November 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Its target groups include diplomats, lawmakers, civil society, and students of water studies; by expanding knowledge of water disputes, it hopes to encourage co-operation between nations in dealing with conflicts.

UNESCO has published a map of trans-boundary [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=43767&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html] UNESCO publishes first world map of underground transboundary aquifers, accessed November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic work focusing on water disputes has yet to yield a consistent method for mediating international disputes, let alone local ones. But UNESCO faces optimistic prospects for the future as water conflicts become more public, and as increasing severity sobers obstinate interests.

=== World Trade Organization ===

The [[World Trade Organization]] can arbitrate water disputes presented by its member states when the disputes are commercial in nature. The WTO has certain groups, such as its Fisheries Center, that work to monitor and rule on relevant cases, although it is by no means the authority on conflict over water resources.

Because water is so central to agricultural trade, water disputes may be subtly implicated in WTO cases in the form of [[virtual water]],&lt;ref&gt;Morrisette, Jason J. and Douglas A. Borer. "Where Oil and Water Do Mix: Environmental Scarcity and Future Conflict in the Middle East and North Africa." Parameters, Vol. 34, Winter 2004 pp 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.kluwerlawonline.com/abstract.php?area=Journals&amp;id=TRAD2013042 Piotr Szwedo, 'Water Footprint and the Law of WTO' (2013) 47 Journal of World Trade, Issue 6, pp. 1259–1284] &lt;/ref&gt; water used in the production of goods and services but not directly traded between countries. Countries with greater access to water supplies may fare better from an economic standpoint than those facing crisis, which creates the potential for conflict. Outraged by agriculture subsidies that displace domestic produce, countries facing water shortages bring their case to the WTO.

The WTO plays more of a role in agriculturally based disputes that are relevant to conflict over specific sources of water. Still, it provides an important framework that shapes the way water will play into future economic disputes. One school of thought entertains the notion of war over water, the ultimate progression of an unresolved water dispute—scarce water resources combined with the pressure of exponentially increasing population may outstrip the ability of the WTO to maintain civility in trade issues&lt;ref&gt;Morrisette, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable conflicts ==
{{See also|Water security#Most affected countries|Water conflict in the Middle East and North Africa}}
Water conflicts can occur on the intrastate and interstate levels. Interstate conflicts occur between two or more neighboring countries that share a transboundary water source, such as a river, sea, or groundwater basin. For example, the [[Middle East]] has only 1% of the world's freshwater shared among 5% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2859937.stm|title=Water shortages 'foster terrorism'|last=Sutherland|first=Ben|date=March 18, 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrastate conflicts take place between two or more parties in the same country. An example would be the conflicts between farmers and industry (agricultural vs industrial use of water).

According to [[UNESCO]], the current interstate conflicts occur mainly in the Middle East (disputes stemming from the [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] and [[Tigris River]]s among Turkey, Syria, and Iraq; and the [[Jordan River]] [[Water politics in the Jordan River basin|conflict]] among Israel, Lebanon, Jordan and the State of Palestine), in Africa ([[Nile River]]-related conflicts among Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan),&lt;ref name="WWilson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kameri-Mbote|first=Patricia|date=January 2007|title=Water, Conflict, and Cooperation: Lessons from the nile river Basin|journal=Navigating Peace|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|issue=4|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/NavigatingPeaceIssue4.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706033750/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/NavigatingPeaceIssue4.pdf|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Central Asia]] (the [[Aral Sea]] conflict among Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan). At a local level, a remarkable example is the [[2000 Cochabamba protests]] in [[Bolivia]], depicted in the 2010 Spanish film ''[[Even the Rain]]'' by [[Icíar Bollaín]].

Some analysts estimate that due to an increase in human consumption of water resources, water conflicts will become increasingly common in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1979, Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] said that if Egypt were to ever go to war again it would be over water. Separately, amidst [[Egypt–Ethiopia relations]], Ethiopian Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] said: "I am not worried that the Egyptians will suddenly invade Ethiopia. Nobody who has tried that has lived to tell the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/next-egypt-do-ethiopia-nile-201312872410501805.html|title=Next on Egypt's to-do: Ethiopia and the Nile|first=Barry|last=Malone|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent research into water conflicts==
Some research from the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[Oregon State University]] has found that water conflicts among nations are less likely than is cooperation, with hundreds of treaties and agreements in place.  Water conflicts tend to arise as an outcome of other social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/index.aspx|title=''Promoting cooperation through management of trans-boundary water resources'', Success Stories, Issue 8, 2010|publisher=[[IWMI]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the [[Pacific Institute]] has shown that while interstate (i.e., nation to nation) water conflicts are increasingly less likely, there appears to be a growing risk of sub-national conflicts among water users, regions, ethnic groups, and competing economic interests. Data from the Water Conflict Chronology show these intrastate conflicts to be a larger and growing component of all water disputes, and that the traditional international mechanisms for addressing them, such as bilateral or multilateral treaties, are not as effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwater.org/water-conflict/ |title=Water Conflict Chronology |publisher=Pacific Institute |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strategic Foresight Group]] in partnership with the Governments of Switzerland and Sweden has developed the Blue Peace approach which seeks to transforms trans-boundary water issues into instruments for cooperation. The Blue Peace framework offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace. By making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries, the chances for peace can be increased.&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Review, March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/40595Blue%20Peace_Middle%20East.pdf Middle East] and the [http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/84153Blue%20Peace%20for%20the%20Nile.pdf Nile basin].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1046">In [[economics]], '''zero-rated supply''' refers to items that are taxable, but the rate of [[tax]] is nil on their input supplies. The term is applied to items that would normally be taxed under valued-added systems such as [[Europe]]'s [[European Union Value Added Tax|Value Added Tax]] (VAT) or [[Canada]]'s [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST). Examples of these items include: most exports, basic groceries, and prescription drugs.
