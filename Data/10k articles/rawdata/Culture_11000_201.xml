      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6795">A small riot took place in [[Ferentari|Ferentari-Zăbrăuți]] area of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] on the evening of November 14, 2006. Ferentari is Bucharest's poorest district, and has the city's largest population of [[Roma people]].

==Events preceding the riot==
The riot took place after four Roma children were asphyxiated in the basement of an apartment block in the Zăbrăuţi area on November 13,&lt;ref name="Intifada"/&gt; as a result of a fire caused by candles. The children had lived with their mother in their dwelling for more than two years, and were obliged to light the basement with candles as they had no access to electricity.&lt;ref name="Intifada"&gt;Evenimentul Zilei:[http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=280463 "Intifada din Ferentari"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the administrator of the apartment block, none of the building's inhabitants had formal access to electricity for four years, with many people connecting themselves illegally to the electricity grid.&lt;ref name="Intifada"/&gt;

==The riot==

The riot occurred because [[Electrica]] &lt;small&gt;(electricity provider)&lt;/small&gt; decided to cut the electricity of some blocks, due to energy theft and consumer debts. However, power outages occurred for several blocks, including few consumers without debts. In most flats there was no central heating and people were using electric radiators (which are costly to operate). There were also some apartments with [[air conditioners]],&lt;ref&gt;Ziua: [http://www.ziua.net/display.php?id=211244&amp;data=2006-11-16 Saracii cu parabolice si aer conditionat]&lt;/ref&gt; so the total debts &lt;small&gt;(not including the stolen energy)&lt;/small&gt; rose to €400,000.&lt;ref name="Stancu"&gt;Gardianul:[http://www.gardianul.ro/print-86964.html Violenta este o metoda de negociere mai eficienta decat diplomatia"]&lt;/ref&gt; The stolen energy was estimated to €430,000 per month.&lt;ref name="DZENO"&gt;[http://www.dzeno.cz/?c_id=12050] Dzeno.cz&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the protesters, the local council of [[Sector 5]] had repeatedly refused to authorize their re-connection to the grid. This led to around 200 inhabitants from the Zăbrăuţi area to violently protest against their situation, by torching tires, blocking traffic in the area and breaking the window of a [[fire truck]], while calling for the electricity supply to be restored. However, only 20% of the inhabitants of the area had any papers proving ownership or rent over the said flats, with the rest being squatters.

The electricity provider was criticized for not cutting the energy in summer, so that people could make plans for winter.

Both the electricity provider and Bucharest 5'th Sector, [[Marian Vanghelie]] were criticized &lt;small&gt;(by then Prefect of Bucharest [[Mioara Mantale]])&lt;/small&gt; for concluding electricity supply contracts for those blocks, as they were built as temporary shelter for construction workers and were never finalized. Apart from electricity, they do not have a fresh water supply, sewage or heating.&lt;ref name="Stancu"/&gt;

[[Marian Vanghelie]] said he would not make any concessions. President [[Traian Băsescu]] also commented on the events: "I stand by my previous statement. Bucharest is not for everyone. Every one of us must pay [our bills]!" ({{lang-ro|Îmi mențin ideea pe care am mai spus-o. Bucureștiul nu este un oraș în care poate locui oricine. Toți trebuie să plătim!}}).&lt;ref name="Stancu"/&gt;

==Outcome==
Realitatea TV was presenting a news broadcast about the riot at the same time with the planned show about the latest ranking of the richest Romanians made by the publication "Capital", at which Cristian Țânțăreanu and [[Gigi Becali]] were invited to speak about their wealth. Cristian Țânțăreanu said the ranking contained the 300 richest Romanians and there were about 300 people protesting, so why shouldn't every one of them help one of the poor people who were protesting. Gigi Becali said he would donate enough money to help all the protesting people, but he doesn't have time to make sure that the respective people would also go to work (clean their buildings, etc.), as Țânțăreanu suggested. At that time Becali didn't know how much money this would cost him; he was later informed it was ~€400,000, which he paid.

Becali was criticized for this, as it might be unfair for the ones who only through effort managed to pay the energy bills. Alex Savitescu, said "crime becomes not only understood, accepted, but rewarded".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supliment.polirom.ro/article.aspx?article=707 Suplimentul de cultura - La loc TELEcomanda&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a poll made by students from SNSPA (The National School for Political and Administrative Studies) two days after the protests, if elections where to be held the following Sunday, 93% of people from Zăbrăuți would go to vote and 70% would vote for Gigi Becali as President, and 55.1% would vote for his party, the [[New Generation Party (Romania)|New Generation Party – Christian Democratic (PNG)]].&lt;ref&gt;Adevarul: [http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/ferentarii-l-las-x103-pe-vanghelie-pentru-becali/207303 Ferentarii îl lasă pe Vanghelie pentru Becali]&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting where people were thanking him, he said
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pe mine mă cheamă Becali. Cuvântul meu e literă de Evanghelie. Nu o să pot să fac toată țara asta, o să fac toată țara asta când o să devin președinte și o să mă doară inima de români&lt;ref name="ZIasi"&gt;[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/cms/site/z_is/news/becali_le_a_promis_locuitorilor_de_ferentari_400.000_de_euro_136883.html] Ziarul de Iasi: Becali le-a promis locuitorilor de Ferentari 400.000 de euro&lt;/ref&gt;(My name is Becali. My word is as good as the word of the Holy Scripture. I cannot do the same for everyone in this country now but I will do so when I become president and as president I'll feel the grief of the Romanian people).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since late 2011, [[Kenya]] has seen an upsurge in violent [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attacks. Kenyan government officials asserted that many of the murders and blasts were carried out by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] in retaliation for [[Operation Linda Nchi]], a coordinated military mission between the [[Military of Somalia|Somalian military]] and [[Kenya Defence Forces|Kenyan military]] that began in October 2011, when troops from Kenya crossed the border into the conflict zones of southern [[Somalia]]. According to Kenyan security experts, the bulk of the attacks were increasingly carried out by radicalized Kenyan youth who were hired for the purpose. Kenya security officials also indicated that they were part of death squads, which carried out many of the killings under the orders of a government security council. By mid-2014, the cumulative attacks began affecting Kenya's tourism industry, as Western nations issued travel warnings to their citizens.&lt;ref name="Rbtkggonswww"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Macharia|first1=James|title=Bombings threaten Kenya growth goals, open new strains with wary West|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/06/01/uk-kenya-security-tourism-idUKKBN0EC1D720140601|accessdate=1 June 2014|agency=Reuters|date=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since the Operation Linda Nchi began, Al-Shabaab vowed retaliation against the Kenyan authorities. At the militant group's urging,&lt;ref name="Rastrikwhb"&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/al-shabaab-retaliate-kenya-"huge-blasts" Al-Shabaab to retaliate in Kenya with "huge blasts"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya have since been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to Islam.&lt;ref name="Nkanbotib"&gt;[http://www.newsomali.com/2011/10/29/7571/ Kenya: A new breed of terrorist is born] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates in 2014 placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 25% of Al-Shabaab's total forces.&lt;ref name="Fjacliyk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Funding jihad: Al-Shabab cash lures in young Kenyans|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-30419987?print=true|accessdate=18 January 2015|agency=BBC|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as the "Kenyan Mujahideen" by Al-Shabaab's core members,&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"&gt;{{cite news|title=Special Report: In Africa, a militant group's growing appeal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/30/us-shabaab-east-africa-idUSBRE84T0NI20120530|newspaper=Reuters|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the converts are typically young and overzealous, poverty making them easier targets for the outfit's recruitment activities. Because the Kenyan insurgents have a different profile from the Somali and Arab militants that allows them to blend in with the general population of Kenya, they are also often harder to track. Reports suggest that Al-Shabaab is attempting to build an even more multi-ethnic generation of fighters in the larger region.&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"/&gt; One such recent convert who helped carry out the [[Kampala]] bombings but now cooperates with the Kenyan police believes that in doing so, the group is essentially trying to use local Kenyans to do its "dirty work" for it while its core members escape unscathed.&lt;ref name="Nkanbotib"/&gt; According to diplomats, Muslim areas in coastal Kenya and [[Tanzania]], such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]], are also especially vulnerable for recruitment.&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"/&gt;

In December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al-Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the [[extrajudicial killing]]s. The murders reportedly totaled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed "Makaburi", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the [[International Bar Association]], Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported [[death squad]]s, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges.&lt;ref name="Kctpctejk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan counter-terrorism police confess to extra judicial killings|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/585087/1/kenyan-counter-terrorism-police.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|agency=Al Jazeera Africa|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2014, the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Australia]] began issuing travel warnings to their citizens in Kenya. This had an immediate impact on Kenya's tourism industry, as European visitors left the country and hotel establishments were consequently forced to lay off staff.&lt;ref name="Rbtkggonswww"/&gt; The U.S. also reduced its staff levels at its [[Nairobi]] embassy.&lt;ref name="Gutckstsag"&gt;{{cite news|title=US to cut Kenya embassy staff as threat of 'sophisticated' attacks grows|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/17/kenya-nairobi-bomb-us-embassy-security|accessdate=14 June 2014|agency=AFP|publisher=The Guardian|date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, the U.K. likewise shut down its Honorary Consulate in Mombasa over security concerns.&lt;ref name="Cukcmcosf"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK closes Mombasa Consulate over security fears|url=http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2014/06/uk-closes-mombasa-consulate-over-security-fears/|accessdate=14 June 2014|agency=Capital News|date=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

===2011===
The first attack by al-Shabaab was on a [[blue-collar]] bar known as Mwaura's in downtown Mfangano Street in [[Nairobi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two grenade blasts rattle Nairobi; 1 dead|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-10-24/kenya-grenade-attack/50898570/1|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=29 May 2012|work=USA Today|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Monday, 24 October 2011, at around 1:15&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Strazius |author2=Tom Odula |others=Associated Press|title=2 blasts in Nairobi amid fears of terrorist reprisal|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/24/MNO31LLM0D.DTL|publisher=2012 Hearst Communications Inc.|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hurled grenade left one person dead and wounded more than 20. Police said that the weapon used was a Russian-made [[F1 grenade (Russia)|F1 grenade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two grenade blasts rattle Nairobi; 1 dead|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2011-10-24/kenya-grenade-attack/50898570/1|publisher=he Associated Press.|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second blast occurred later the same day, when a grenade was tossed out of a moving vehicle into the [[Machakos]] bus terminus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Clarke|title=A grenade attack at a bus station in central Nairobi killed five people and wounded 69, the Kenya Red Cross said on Sunday.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/11/us-kenya-blast-idUSBRE82A03W20120311|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 59 men and ten women were subsequently hospitalised, of which two were in [[intensive care]] and five people were confirmed dead.

The attacks came only two days after the United States warned of "imminent" terror attacks. The US warning had implied that al-Shabaab would carry out reprisals in response to Kenyan troops' incursion into Somalia in mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deadly grenade blasts rattle Nairobi|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/24/kenya-blast.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=24 October 2011|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgiva Bwire Oliacha, a recent Kenyan Muslim convert, was arrested in connection with the two blasts and was sentenced to life in prison after having pleaded guilty to all charges.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tom|first=Odula|title=Kenya grenade suspect: I'm an al-Shabab member|url=https://news.yahoo.com/kenya-grenade-suspect-im-al-shabab-member-132633695.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc28"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15494034 |title=Kenyans in first al-Shabab battle in Somalia |publisher=BBC |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Voakstlipfga&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan Sentenced to Life in Prison for Grenade Attacks|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/east/Kenyan-Sentenced-to-Life-in-Prison-For-Grenade-Attacks-132776978.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=VOA News|date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Shabaab was suspected of carrying out a few more attacks in October as well. In November 2011, Al-Shabaab attacked several other locations including the East African Pentecostal Church, a military convoy, and a Holiday Inn hotel. The militant group is suspected of carrying out nine attacks in Kenya in December 2011; some of the attacks resulted in injuries and casualties while some resulted in no injuries.&lt;ref name="sabahionline.com"&gt;Bosire Boniface; 30 August 2012.

===2012===

====January – June====
Militants were responsible for several attacks over the first few months of 2012. In January, there were three reported attacks, including the killing of the chairperson of the Community Peace and Security Team in Hagadera camp as well as several police officers. It was also reported that Kenyan police seized explosive equipment in an Ifo camp in the Dadaab complex, arresting nine suspects. In February, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for an attack that resulted in the death of a police officer and a civilian while injuring two other civilians. On 10 March 2012, six were killed and over sixty were injured after four grenades were thrown into a Machakos bus station in Nairobi.&lt;ref name="sabahionline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sabahi20120312"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sabahionline.com/en_GB/articles/hoa/articles/features/2012/03/12/feature-01 |title=Police arrest 4 suspects in connection with Nairobi bus station blast |first=Julius |last=Mokaya |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=19 May 2014 |newspaper=Sabahi Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, 29 April 2012, around 8:50am, an attack took place at God's House of Miracles Church at Ngara Estate in [[Nairobi]]. As reported by one of the dailies, an attacker, who goes by the name Amar, entered the church and left.&lt;ref name="Attacker a Terrorist"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ndonga|first=Simon|title=Kenya: Church Grenade Attacker 'A Known Terrorist'|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201205070024.html|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=AllAfrica|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later came back and took a seat in the back, hurling the grenade at worshipers while they had been called by the pastor to the pulpit. The experts said that the grenade used had been made in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CYRUS|first=OMBATI|title=Police link Al Shabaab to Ngara church attack|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000057613&amp;story_title=Police%20link%20Al%20Shabaab%20to%20Ngara%20church%20attack|publisher=Standard Group Limited|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, 15 May, three hand grenades were hurled at the Bella Vista [[nightclub]] in [[Mombasa]], Kenya, killing one and leaving five others injured.

At least six people were shot dead and ten others seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2013-04/19/c_132321036.htm |title=At least six killed, 10 injured in gun attack in northern Kenya: official – Xinhua &amp;#124; English.news.cn |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A History of Chinese Literature''''' is a history of [[Chinese literature]] written by [[Herbert Giles]], and published in 1901. 

Although there had been surveys of Chinese literature in Japanese, it was the first such survey to appear in English.{{sfnb|Wang|2013| p = 9}} In his preface, Giles claims that such a work of history was not already available, even in Chinese, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = J. Dyer Ball | journal = [[The China Review]] | title = Dr. Giles's History of Chinese Literature | pages = 207–210 | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | year = 1901 | url = http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/26/2600451.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; since Chinese scholars realized the "uttter hopelessness" of "achieving even comparative success in a general historical survey of the subject". But he adds that "It may be said without offence that a work which would be inadequate to the requirements of a native public, may properly be submitted to English readers as an introduction into the great field which lies beyond". A large part of the book is devoted to translations, "enabling the Chinese author, so far as is possible, to speak for himself".{{sfnb|Giles|1901|p = v-vi}}

==Reception and influence==
The scholar and writer [[Lin Yutang]] commented that "'History of Chinese Literature' was a misnomer; it was a series of attempted essays on certain Chinese works, and was not even an outline covering the successive periods.” &lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite| first =|last = Wang |title = The ''Alter Ego'' Perspectives of Literary Historiography |year = 2013 | ref = none| p = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Qian Zhongshu]] noted what he called an "amusing mistake" in Giles' "very readable book." Giles 
::Giles gives a complete version of [[Sikong Du|Ssu-k'ung Tu]]'s 'philosophical poem, consisting of twenty-four apparently unconnected stanzas'. This poem, according to Professor Giles, 'is admirably adapted to exhibit the forms under which pure Taoism commends itself to the mind of a cultivated scholar.' This is what Professor Giles thinks Ssu-K'ung Tu to have done, but what Ssu-K'ung Tu really does is to convey in imageries of surpassing beauty the impressions made upon a sensitive mind by twenty-four different kinds of poetry—'pure, ornate, grotesque', etc. &lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/features.php?searchterm=030_literature.inc&amp;issue=030 On 'Old Chinese Poetry]," The China Critic, VI:50 (14 December 1933): 1206-1208., reprinted at The China Heritage Quarterly 39.31 June September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezra Pound#''Ripostes'' and translations|Ezra Pound]] used Giles' translations as the basis for what have been called his English "translations of translations".{{sfnb|Kern|1996| p = [https://books.google.com/?id=uWeRGJW5sNwC&amp;pg=PA185 173]}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49792">The term '''alliteration''' was invented by the Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Giovanni Pontano]] (1426–1503), in his dialogue ''Actius'',&lt;ref&gt;Pontano (1519), ''Actius'', fol. 127b; Naeke (1829) p. 327; Rolfe (1943), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the practice common in Virgil, Lucretius, and other Roman writers of beginning words or syllables with the same consonant or vowel. He gives examples such as '''''S'''ale '''S'''axa '''S'''onabant'' "the rocks were resounding with the salt-water"&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 5.865.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''A'''nchisen '''A'''gnovit '''A'''micum'' "he recognised his friend Anchises"&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 3.82.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''M'''ulta '''M'''unita '''V'''irum '''V'''i'' "defended by a great force of men".&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, 1.725; Pontano, ''Actius'', fol. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pontano also used it to refer to repetition of letters in medial positions. Among other kinds, he mentions the frequent case when the last syllable of a word begins with the same consonant as the first syllable of the next word, as in ''lo'''R'''icam ex ae&lt;u&gt;'''R'''e '''R'''i&lt;/u&gt;gentem'' "the rigid breastplate made of bronze" (Virgil).&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 8.620; Pontano, ''Actius'', fol. 128b; Naeke (1829), pp. 331, 333f.&lt;/ref&gt; Since "x" was pronounced "cs", the phrase '''''S'''ale '''S'''ac&lt;u&gt;'''S'''a '''S'''o&lt;/u&gt;nabant'' "the rocks were resounding with sea water" (Virgil) can also be considered an example of this kind.

Alliteration was a prominent feature of Latin literature (in contrast to Greek), especially in poetry in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, and continued to be used by some writers even in the Middle Ages. 

==Definitions==
Scholars differ as to how alliteration should be defined. Some, such as Keith Maclennan (2017), suggest that the term alliteration should be used only of repeated sounds at the beginning of words, and assonance of sounds repeated in another context.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Maclennan (2017), ''Virgil: Aeneid VIII'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Tracy [[:de:Tracy Peck|Peck]] (1884) also gives examples only of word-initial alliteration.

However, Pontano himself, who invented the term, used it also of the alliteration of medial consonants. The French scholars A. Cordier (1939) and [[:fr:Jules Marouzeau|Jules Marouzeau]] (1933) similarly define it as "the repetition, near or exact, of a phoneme or group of phonemes at the beginning of syllables (e.g. ''fanfare'') or at the beginning of words (e.g. ''bel et bien'') nearby one another in the utterance."&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 226; original in French.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German classicist [[August Ferdinand Naeke|August Ferdinand Naeke]] (1829) also accepted internal alliteration and cited examples such as ''paene e'''FF'''registi '''F'''atue '''F'''oribus cardines'' "you've nearly broken the hinges of the door, you idiot!" (Plautus),&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Amphitruo'' 1025; Naeke (1829), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the first F, though medial, clearly contributes to the effect of the whole.

The [[Lucretius]] specialists [[:de:Cyril Bailey|Cyril Bailey]] (1947) and Margaret Deutsch (1939), on the other hand, give a slightly different definition. They define alliteration as the repetition of ''consonants'' (whether initial or medial), and assonance as the repetition of ''vowel'' sounds or of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), vol 1. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; From the examples Bailey gives, such as ''i&lt;u&gt;p&lt;/u&gt;se'', it is clear that he considered that consonants at the end of syllables and words could contribute to alliteration as well as those at the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), vol 1. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus when several words in a row begin with the same vowel, as in '''''I'''ncidit '''I'''ctus '''I'''ngens ad terram'' "the huge man, struck, falls to the ground" (Virgil),&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 12.925-6.&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars follow Pontano in referring to it as alliteration,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. T.E. Page (1904) on ''Aeneid'' 12.925; Cordier, reported in Rolfe (1943), p. 230; Liegey (1956), p. 383; Clarke (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; while others such as Bailey use the term assonance.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R.D. Williams (1973) on ''Aeneid'' 12.925; Bailey (1947), p. 151; de Ford (1986), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, when a medial consonant is involved, as in '''''S'''a'''X'''a '''S'''onabant'', it is called "internal alliteration" by Bailey&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 149, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; but would be considered as assonance by Maclennan.

==Compound alliteration==
Although simple alliteration involving only the initial consonants of words is very common, in Latin authors of all periods it will often be found that primary alliteration on an initial consonant is accompanied by a secondary or "minor"&lt;ref&gt;de Ford (1986), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; alliteration on a medial consonant. Thus Cicero's '''''P'''a'''T'''ent '''P'''or'''T'''ae'' "the gates are open"&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Cat.'' 1.10; cf. ''Aeneid'' 2.266.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the primary alliteration of P has minor alliteration of T. Occasionally there are two minor consonants involved, as in '''''L'''a'''C'''ū'''S''' '''L'''u'''C'''o'''S'''que'' "lakes and groves" (Cicero)&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Verr.'' 2.5.188; cf. ''Aeneid'' 7.695.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''S'''e'''RP'''entum '''SP'''i'''R'''i'''S''''' "with coils of snakes" (Virgil).&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.845.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other examples, the same consonant occurs both initially and medially,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g.  '''''C'''um se'''C'''uri '''C'''audi'''C'''ali'' (Plautus)&lt;ref&gt;''Pseudolus'' 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''C'''ae'''C'''o '''C'''arpitur'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; with C, or ''lo'''R'''icam ex ae'''R'''e '''R'''igentem'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 8.620.&lt;/ref&gt; with R. Often two different consonants are involved in the same phrase, partly initial and partly medial: '''''M'''agnae '''M'''e'''T'''us '''T'''u'''M'''ul'''T'''us'' (Naevius) and ''ne '''M'''e '''T'''erre'''T'''e '''T'''i'''M'''en'''T'''em'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.875&lt;/ref&gt; with M and T; '''''M'''o'''LL'''īs '''L'''a'''M'''bere f'''L'''a'''MM'''a co'''M'''as'' and '''''M'''o'''LL'''is f'''L'''a'''MM'''a '''M'''edu'''LL'''as'' with M and L (Virgil);&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.680, 4.66.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''R'''e'''G'''i de '''GR'''aecia'' (Nepos),&lt;ref&gt;Nepos ''Themistocles'' 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; '''''R'''e'''G'''ina '''GR'''avi'' (Virgil)&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 4.1&lt;/ref&gt; and ''pe'''RG'''e ... di'''R'''i'''G'''e '''GR'''essum'' (Virgil) with R and G.&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 1.401&lt;/ref&gt;

Any account of alliteration in Latin must therefore take such cases into consideration. However, as Bailey warns, caution must be observed in recognising such examples, as the internal alliteration may sometimes be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliteration and assonance==
Alliteration frequently overlaps with [[assonance]], which is defined by one dictionary as "a resemblance in the sounds of words or syllables, either between their vowels (e.g. ''meat, bean'') or between their consonants (e.g. ''keep, cape'')".&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; (This latter kind is also known as [[Literary consonance|consonance]].)

By this definition some of the examples which Naeke calls alliteration, such as '''''fur''' tri'''fur'''ci'''fer''''' "thief who wears three yokes" (Plautus),&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Auluraria'' 323; cf. Naeke (1829), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; ''neque f'''īctum''', neque p'''īctum''', neque scr'''īptum''''' "it's never been imagined, or painted, or written" (Plautus),&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Asinaria'' 172; Naeke (1829), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''lab'''ōr'''at e dol'''ōr'''e'' "she is overcome with grief" (Terence)&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Andria'' 265; Naeke (1829), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; would usually these days be referred to as assonance.&lt;ref&gt;cf. R.G. Austin (ed.) ''Virgil: Aeneid 2'' on line 107 (''ict'') and 282 (''ōr'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Often alliteration and assonance are combined, as in ''s'''A'''nguine '''LAR'''go col'''L' AR'''mosque '''LA'''vant'' "with copious blood they wash their necks and shoulders" (Virgil),&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.721-2.&lt;/ref&gt; where there is alliteration of L L L, but also assonance of A AR AR A.

==Origins of alliteration==
The earliest appearance of alliteration in Latin seems to have been not in poetry but in proverbs and popular sayings, and phrases of a religious or legal character.&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of popular phrases are: '''''O'''leum et '''O'''peram perdere'' "to waste both oil and time", '''''C'''ave '''C'''anem'' "beware of the dog", '''''V'''i'''v'''us '''V'''idensque'' "alive and well", '''''S'''atis '''S'''uperque'' "enough and more", '''''A'''lbus an '''A'''ter'' "white or black", '''''P'''ublica '''P'''rivata'' "public and private", and so on. Legal and religious phrases included such as '''''T'''abulae '''T'''estesque'' "tablets and witnesses", '''''A'''rae et '''A'''ltaria'' "altars and shrines", '''''T'''ec'''t'''a '''T'''empla'' "houses and temples", '''''F'''ortes '''F'''ideles'' "brave and loyal", '''''F'''usi '''F'''ugati'' "routed and put to flight", '''''F'''ors '''F'''ortuna'' "Chance and Fortune". Frequently such alliterating phrases show [[asyndeton]], i.e. the two words are placed side by side with no conjunction such as ''et'' "and".&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is the boast '''''V'''eni '''V'''idi '''V'''ici'' "I came, I saw, I conquered" attributed to Julius Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius "Life of Julius Caesar" 37; Peck (1884) p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted that in these phrases that if one of two alliterated words has an "a" in it, it is usually placed second: '''''F'''erro '''F'''lammaque'' "by sword and flame", '''''L'''onge '''L'''ateque'' "far and wide", '''''C'''olles '''C'''ampique'' "hills and plains", '''''M'''ulti et '''M'''agni'' "many and great".&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; When the words are of unequal length, the shorter one usually precedes: '''''F'''ama '''F'''ortuna'' "fame and fortune", '''''A'''urum '''A'''rgentum'' "gold and silver", '''''C'''ura '''C'''ustodiaque'' "care and custody", and so on. As both [[:de:Tracy Peck|Peck]] and Cordier noted, the Latin language naturally lends itself to such phrases, making them part of everyday speech. Some apparent examples of alliteration therefore are likely to be fortuitous, for example Jesus's saying ''ego sum '''V'''ia et '''V'''eritas et '''V'''ita'' "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life" (John 14.6), which is translated from a Greek original.&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 61; Rolfe (1943), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliteration in ''carmina''==
Some of the early prayers (''carmina'') which survive, such as the one which begins as follows, are partly alliterative, but the alliteration is not maintained throughout the prayer:&lt;ref&gt;McGann (1958), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Mars '''P'''a'''T'''er, '''T'''e '''PR'''ecor quaesoque''
:''uti sies volens '''PR'''o'''P'''i'''T'''ius'' 
:"Father Mars, I pray and beg you
:that you be willing and propitious"

It contains alliterative lines such as this:
:'''''P'''astores '''P'''ecuaque '''S'''alva '''S'''ervassis''
:"that you may keep the herdsmen and the cattle safe"

However, much of the prayer is not alliterative. McGann (1958) concludes that alliteration is an important but occasional device which adds greatly to the effect of the composition, but does not perform a structural function in the ''carmen'' as a whole.

==Alliteration in poetry==
The earliest Latin poems, unlike early Germanic and English poetry, do not have obligatory alliteration. Most of the fragments of the early accentual [[Saturnian (poetry)|Saturnian]] poetry listed by Lindsay exhibit no alliteration, although some do, for example the following line, attributed to [[Gnaeus Naevius|Naevius]] (c.270–c.201 BC), which has alliteration of M, P, and T:
:'''''M'''agnae '''M'''e'''T'''us '''T'''u'''M'''ul'''T'''us '''P'''ec'''T'''ora '''P'''ossīdi'''t'''''&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay (1893), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"A tumult of great fear possesses their hearts"

The epic poet [[Ennius]] (c.239–c.169 BC) made very frequent use of alliteration. In the following hexameter, the primary alliteration with T is supported by a secondary medial alliteration of R to reinforce the idea of terror and trembling:
:''Af'''R'''ica '''T'''e'''RR'''ibili '''TR'''emi'''T''' ho'''RR'''ida '''T'''e'''RR'''a '''T'''umul'''T'''u''&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Peck (1884), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The rough land of Africa trembles with terrifying tumult."

T and R are also used in the following often-quoted line:&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''at '''T'''uba '''T'''e'''RR'''ibili soni'''T'''u '''T'''a'''R'''a'''T'''an'''T'''a'''R'''a dixi'''t''''' 
:"but the trumpet with terrifying sound went 'taratantara!'"

To a greater extent than later poets, Ennius often uses the same alliteration throughout the line:&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''ne'''c C'''um '''C'''apta '''C'''api, ne'''c C'''um '''C'''ombusta '''C'''remari''
:"nor stay captured when captured, nor burn when set on fire"&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius ''Saturnalia'' 6.60, translated R.A. Kastner (2011) (Loeb).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous line is the following:
:''o '''T'''i'''T'''e, '''T'''u'''T'''e, '''T'''a'''T'''i, '''T'''ibi '''T'''an'''T'''a, '''T'''yranne, '''T'''ulis'''T'''i!''
:"O [[Titus Tatius]], you yourself, o king, have brought such great (troubles) on yourself!"

This line was quoted with disapproval for its excessive alliteration in the [[Rhetorica ad Herennium]] 4.12, and some modern critics have called it "almost absurd"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), vol 1, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; or "embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1970), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Ennius example, which Austin describes as "noble",&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1970), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; is the following [[Metres of Roman Comedy|iambic octonarius]]. Here there is assonance between '''''M'''agna '''Te'''mpla ...'' and ''-'''M'''ixta s'''Te'''llis'' at corresponding places in the two halves of the line, combined with alliteration of C, S, and minor alliteration of L and P:
:''o &lt;u&gt;'''M'''agna '''T'''e'''mpl'''a&lt;/u&gt; '''C'''ae'''l'''i'''t'''um '''C'''o'''m&lt;u&gt;M'''i'''xt'''a '''St'''e'''ll'''is&lt;/u&gt; '''Spl'''endidis''
:"O great temples of the heaven-dwellers, mixed with splendid stars."

The comic playwright [[Plautus]] also has innumerable instances of alliteration, usually for comic effect:&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), vol. 1, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''non '''P'''otuit '''P'''aucis '''Pl'''u'''r'''a '''Pl'''ane '''Pr'''o'''l'''oqui."&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Menaechmi'', 252.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He couldn't in a few words have said more in a plain way."

:''te '''C'''um se'''C'''u'''r'''i '''C'''audi'''C'''ali '''Pr'''aefi'''c'''io '''Pr'''ovin'''c'''iae''&lt;ref&gt;Plautus, ''Pseudolus'', 157.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"You with the axe, I'm putting you in charge of the wood-cutting province!"

The other surviving comic playwright, [[Terence]], by contrast, used alliteration hardly at all,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947),
p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; and this is a major difference between his work and that of Plautus. Naeke, who quotes numerous examples from Plautus, can cite only a few from Terence, including the following:
:'''''Pr'''ofundat, '''P'''e'''r'''dat, '''P'''e'''r'''eat: nihil ad me attinet!''&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Adelphi'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Let him squander it, lose it, and perish; I don't care!"

[[Cicero]] in his poetry has frequent examples of alliteration, but usually involving only two or three words in any one verse.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following lines, which describe the killing of Orion by the Scorpion as depicted in the stars, the primary alliteration of V V V is accompanied by minor alliteration of D, C, T, F and R:
:''hic '''V'''ali'''d'''o '''c'''upi'''d'''e '''V'''enan'''T'''em per'''c'''uli'''T''' i'''cT'''u''
:''mor'''T'''i'''f'''erum in '''V'''enas '''f'''undens per '''V'''olne'''r'''a '''V'''i'''r'''us''
:"this struck him down, when he was eagerly hunting, with a powerful blow,
:pouring deadly poison through the wounds into his veins"

[[Lucretius]] and [[Virgil]] also both used alliteration widely, Lucretius "with striking power in many memorable passages" (Austin). In Virgil, alliteration was "no longer an external ornament ... but an inner secret of sound, subtly employed to serve emotion".&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1970), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Horace]] and [[Catullus]] it occurs much less frequently. Nonetheless even in Catullus there are lines such as the following with its delicate alternation of C, G, T and D sounds, which appear to imitate the shaking of a tambourine:
:'''''Qu'''a'''t'''iens'''Qu'''e '''T'''e'''rg'''a '''T'''au'''r'''i '''T'''ene'''r'''is '''C'''ava '''D'''i'''g'''i'''t'''is''
:'''''C'''ane'''r'''e haec suis a'''d'''o'''rt'''a est '''Tr'''e'''m'''ebun'''d'''a '''C'''o'''m'''i'''t'''ibus.''&lt;ref&gt;Catullus, 63.10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"And shaking the hollow back of a bull with her tender fingers
:she began to sing as follows, trembling, to her companions."

In his lament for his dead brother the [[chiastic structure|chiastic]] alliteration F M M F is reinforced by minor alliteration of T:
:''accipe '''F'''ra'''t'''erno '''M'''ul'''t'''um '''M'''anan'''t'''ia '''F'''le'''t'''u''&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 101.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Receive these gifts soaked with brotherly tears."

[[Ovid]] employs alliteration much less obviously than Lucretius and Virgil (some examples are given below). He sometimes seems to play with words, as when Apollo tells his son Phaethon:
:''ne '''D'''u'''B'''i'''T'''a! '''D'''a'''B'''i'''T'''ur''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 2.101.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Do not doubt! It will be given."

In [[Lucan]] alliteration is found, although not as commonly as in Virgil. His epic poem on the Civil War begins as follows, with an alliteration on C, P and V:
:''bella per Emathios plus '''Q'''uam '''C'''ivilia '''C'''ampos''
:''iu'''sQ'''ue datum '''sC'''eleri '''C'''animus, '''P'''opulumque '''P'''otentem''
:''in '''s'''ua '''V'''i'''c'''tri'''c'''i '''C'''on'''V'''er'''s'''um '''V'''i'''sc'''era de'''x'''trā''
:"We sing of wars worse than civil across the Emathian plains,
:and of licence given to crime, and a powerful people
:who turned against their own innards with victorious right hand."

Alliteration is rarely used in [[Juvenal]] and [[Martial]], although there are occasional phrases such as '''''P'''e'''r'''i'''t'''u'''r'''ae '''P'''a'''rC'''e'''r'''e '''C'''ha'''rt'''ae'' ("to spare paper which is going to perish anyway") (Juvenal)&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal Satura 1.18.&lt;/ref&gt; or the following from Martial, in which L, C, and S are interwoven: 
:'''''L'''a'''sC'''ivos '''L'''eporum '''C'''ur'''s'''ū'''s L'''ū'''s'''ū'''s'''que '''L'''eonum'' 
:"the playful races of hares and the games of lions."&lt;ref&gt;Martial 1.44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliteration in prose==
Although alliteration is found most often in poetry, Pontano notes that prose writers also sometimes used it, and quotes from a sentence from Cicero's treatise Brutus:&lt;ref&gt;cf. Naeke, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:''nulla res magis penetrat in animos eosque '''F'''ingit '''F'''ormat '''F'''lectit''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Brutus'' 38.142.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"Nothing penetrates their minds more and moulds, forms, and persuades them".

In his speeches, Cicero uses alliteration sparingly, but effectively, as in famous suggestion to Catiline: 
:'''''P'''a'''T'''ent '''P'''or'''T'''ae; '''P'''roficiscere!''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 1.10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"The gates are open; depart!"

Again using assonance as well as alliteration, in an emotional moment of indignation in the ''pro Sulla'' he says:
:''cum illae in'''F'''&lt;u&gt;'''estae'''&lt;/u&gt; ac '''F'''un&lt;u&gt;'''estae'''&lt;/u&gt; '''F'''aces ... '''C'''um '''C'''aedes, '''C'''um '''C'''ivium '''C'''ruor, '''C'''um '''C'''inis patriae ... '''C'''oeperat ...''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Sulla'' 19, cited by Brock (1911).&lt;/ref&gt;
:"when those hostile and calamitous torches ... when slaughter, when the blood of citizens, when the ashes of our fatherland had begun..."

Near the ending of the 2nd Philippic oration Cicero uses both alliteration and assonance to add force to an unexpected metaphor. The major alliteration, on stressed initial syllables, is D P P D P; but there is also internal or minor alliteration of L D D L as well as assonance of PAR PAR:
:''ut a'''L'''iquan'''D'''o '''D'''o'''L'''or '''P'''o'''P'''u'''L'''i Romani &lt;u&gt;'''Par'''&lt;/u&gt;iat quo'''d''' iam '''D'''iu &lt;u&gt;'''Par'''&lt;/u&gt;tu'''r'''it''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 2.118&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"so that at long last the pain of the Roman people may give birth to what it has long been in labour with!"

In another example from the same paragraph of the 2nd Philippic, with alternation of M, R, and L, Cicero says:
:''ut '''M'''o'''R'''iens '''P'''o'''P'''u'''L'''um '''R'''o'''M'''anum '''L'''ibe'''R'''um '''R'''e'''L'''inquam''
:"that by dying I may leave the Roman people free."

Some orators evidently used alliteration too much, however, causing the author of the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (c. 80 BC) to complain about ''eiusdem litterae nimia assiduitas'' "the excessive use of the same letter".&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884),
 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among historians [[Cornelius Nepos|Nepos]], according to Rolfe, used it "to excess".&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; The following sentence is an example: 
:''nos eundem '''P'''otissimum Thucydidem auctorem '''P'''robamus, qui illum ait '''M'''agnesiae '''Mor'''bo '''Mor'''tuum '''Ne'''que '''Ne'''gat '''F'''uisse '''F'''amam venenum '''S'''ua '''Sp'''onte '''S'''um'''pS'''i'''SS'''e, cum '''S'''e, quae '''R'''e'''g'''i de '''Gr'''aecia o'''ppr'''imenda '''P'''ollicitus e'''ss'''et, '''Pr'''ae'''s'''ta'''r'''e '''P'''o'''ss'''e de'''sp'''e'''r'''a'''r'''et.''&lt;ref&gt;Nepos, ''Themistocles'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"We approve especially of the same historian Thucydides, who says that he (Themistocles) died in Magnesia of an illness, but he does not deny that there is a rumour that he took poison of his own accord when he was despairing that he would be able to deliver what he had promised the King concerning the conquering of Greece."

[[Tacitus]] did not make great of use alliteration generally, but was fond of alliterative pairs of words such as '''''L'''argitio et '''L'''uxus'' "generosity and extravagance" or '''''S'''ocordia ducum, '''S'''editione legionum'' "by laziness of the generals, and insurrection of the legions".&lt;ref&gt;''Annales'' 1.4; ''Hist.'' 3.46; quoted by Austin (1970), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alliteration became very frequent again in north African authors of the 2nd and 3rd century A.D.: "It occurs on almost every page of [[Apuleius]], [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]], and [[Tertullian]], and is very common in [[Cyprian]]".&lt;ref&gt;Brock, D.M. (1911), ''Studies in Fronto and His Age'', (Cambridge), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical studies==
Some scholars have performed statistical studies on different poets. Clarke (1976) compared Virgil and Ovid, finding minor differences in their usage. For example, Ovid tends frequently to put alliterating words in the first half of the verse, while Virgil is more likely to put them in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1976), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; In both poets, the most likely position for an alliterating word is after the 3rd-foot [[caesura]], and the second most common the beginning of the verse. Often there is alliteration in both of these places at once, as in the following line of Ovid:
:'''''V'''ipereas carnes, '''V'''itiorum alimenta suorum''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 2.769; Clarke (1976), p. 292; 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"flesh of vipers, nutrition for her vices"

Greenberg (1980), who criticises Clarke's study as statistically unsound in some respects,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1980), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt; compares Virgil and Lucretius. One of his conclusions is that Lucretius is more likely than Virgil to use three or more initially alliterating words in the same line,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1980), p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; for example: 
:'''''M'''ulta '''M'''odis '''M'''ultis varia ratione '''M'''overi''&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, ''de Rerum Natura'', 1.341.&lt;/ref&gt;  
:"(we see) many things moving in many ways by various means"

In order to simplify their investigation, neither scholar takes internal alliteration into account, or alliterations such as ''incidit ictus ingens'' which spread over more than one line. However, Greenberg states: "There is no intrinsic reason why alliteration should be limited to the confines of a single verse or to word-initials."&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1980), p. 585.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain letters are used in alliteration more frequently than others. In Virgil, according to Clarke, the commonest letters for word-initial alliteration are ''a, c, p, s, m, t, d, e, f, i, n, v'';&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1976), p. 280; cf. Rolfe (1943), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; alliteration with ''b'' is very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1980), p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an alliterating word comes after a verse-break such as a [[caesura]], the letter ''a'' is less common, coming only in 6th or 7th place.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1976), p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually a letter alliterates only with itself, but sometimes ''qu'' can alliterate with ''c''; ''ph'' may alliterate with ''p''; ''ae'' and ''au'' may alliterate with ''a''; and ''sc'', ''sp'', ''st'' may alliterate with ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

From both studies, it is clear that when only two words in a line begin with the same letter, it is difficult or impossible to identify objectively whether the alliteration is accidental or deliberate, since alliterated words occur no more often in any line than would be due to chance. To identify whether alliteration is present, more subjective criteria must be used, such as whether the two words are important for the meaning of the line. Thus although Lucretius 3.267 (''et sapor et tamen'') is counted as an example of alliteration by Greenberg's computer programme,&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1980), p. 604.&lt;/ref&gt; it is doubtful if alliteration can be made on a weak word such as ''et'' "and".

When two pairs of words alliterate in the same line, the order ''abab'' is most common, then ''aabb'', then ''abba''. An example of the last is the following from Virgil:&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1976), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''M'''ulta '''V'''i '''V'''ulnera '''M'''iscent''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.720.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"they exchange wounds with much violence"

Although alliteration is common in Virgil, Ovid, and Lucretius, it is not found in every line. Overall, some 35-40% of lines in both Virgil and Ovid have no word-initial alliteration at all; in many of the remainder, the alliteration may well be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke (1976), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of alliteration==
===Linking alliteration===
Frequently alliteration simply adorns and beautifies a verse, without adding any particular emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; As Headlam (1920) notes, often the alliteration runs through a passage, linking together the various clauses, as in the opening of ''Aeneid'' 4, where the letters C, C, V, V, T, T recur repeatedly, as well as assonances such as ''vulnus / virtus / multus / vultus'', ''cura / carpitur / recursat'', and ''gentis / haerent'':
:''at '''R'''e'''G'''ina '''GR'''avi iam'''d'''u'''d'''um sau'''C'''ia '''C'''ura''
:'''''V'''u'''ln'''us a'''l'''it '''V'''e'''n'''is et '''C'''ae'''C'''o '''C'''arpitur igni.''
:'''''M'''ul'''t'''a '''V'''iri '''V'''ir'''t'''us animo '''M'''ul'''t'''usque re'''C'''ursat''
:''gen'''t'''is '''H'''onos; '''H'''aeren'''t''' infixi '''P'''ec'''t'''ore '''V'''ul'''t'''us''
:'''''V'''erbaque nec '''P'''la'''c'''idam membris dat '''C'''ura '''Q'''uietem.''
:"But the Queen, for a long time now wounded with serious passion,
:feeds the wound in her veins and is tormented by unseen fire.
:The man's courage keeps occurring to her mind, 
:and the nobility of his race; his face and words remain fixed in her heart
:and her love gives no peaceful sleep to her limbs."

In his commentary on these lines, Ingo Gildenhard suggests that in the repeated alliteration with V in three pairs of words, Virgil seems to be hinting at a thematic link between the ''vulnus'' "wound" of Dido and the ''virtus'' "manliness", ''vultus'' "face", and ''verba'' "words" of Aeneas.&lt;ref&gt;Ingo Gildenhard (2012), [https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product.php/162?162 ''Virgil: Aeneid 4.1-299''] Cambridge, Open Book Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synonyms and antonyms===
Another use for alliteration is to link together synonyms or thematically similar words:&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''neque enim '''L'''evia aut '''L'''udicra petuntur''
:''praemia, sed Turni de vita et sanguine certant''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.764-5&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For it is not &lt;u&gt;unimportant&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;sporting&lt;/u&gt; prizes which are being competed for,
:but they are fighting over the life and blood of Turnus.''

:'''''V'''en'''t'''o hu'''c V'''as'''t'''is et flu'''ct'''ibus a'''ct'''i''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 1.333.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"driven here by &lt;u&gt;the wind&lt;/u&gt; and by &lt;u&gt;huge waves&lt;/u&gt;"

:''o '''G'''e'''R'''mana mihi atque eadem '''GR'''atissima coniunx''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 10.607.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"O my &lt;u&gt;sister&lt;/u&gt;, who art also my &lt;u&gt;most dear wife&lt;/u&gt;"

:''Pe'''RG'''e modo, et, qua te ducit via, di'''R'''i'''G'''e '''GR'''essum''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 1.401&lt;/ref&gt;
:"&lt;u&gt;Be on your way&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;direct your step&lt;/u&gt; wherever the road takes you."

In the following example, the great quantity of blood when the two bulls fight is emphasised by the alliteration on the words ''largo'' "copious" and ''lavant'' "they wash":
:''cornuaque obnixi infigunt et sanguine '''Lar'''go''
:''col'''l' ar'''mosque '''La'''vant, gemitu nemus omne remugit''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.721-2&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Leaning they stab their horns and with &lt;u&gt;copious&lt;/u&gt; blood
:&lt;u&gt;they wash&lt;/u&gt; their necks and shoulders, and the whole forest echoes with bellowing."

Alliteration can also be used in both prose and verse to emphasise an [[antithesis]] between two opposite things:&lt;ref&gt;Austin (1970), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''non tua '''D'''icta ... '''D'''i me terrent''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.894-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"it is not &lt;u&gt;your words&lt;/u&gt; but &lt;u&gt;the gods&lt;/u&gt; who terrify me"

===Onomatopoeia===
Frequently both Lucretius and Virgil use alliteration [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] to paint pictures in sound. Thus alliteration with S may represent the whooshing of an arrow or a spear, the sound of waves breaking on the rocks, or the hissing of serpents:&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''S'''auciu'''S''' at '''S'''erpen'''S''' '''S'''inuo'''S'''a '''v'''olumina '''v'''er'''S'''at''
:''a'''rr'''ecti'''S'''que ho'''rr'''et '''S'''quami'''S''' et '''S'''ibilat ore''.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 11.753-4&lt;/ref&gt;
:"But the wounded serpent writhes its sinuous coils
:and bristles with raised scales and hisses with its mouth"

R, C, T, and S may call up "loud and violent sounds".&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following lines the alliteration is reinforced by assonance of ''or, or'' and ''to, to, tu, tu'':
:''tum ve'''r'''o ex'''or'''itur clam'''or''' '''R'''ipae'''qu'''e lacu'''squ'''e''
:'''''R'''e'''s'''pon'''s'''ant '''C'''i'''rc'''a et '''C'''aelum '''T'''ona'''T''' o'''m'''ne '''T'''u'''m'''ul'''T'''u.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.756-7&lt;/ref&gt;
:"just then there arises a shout and the river banks and lakes
:echo round about and the sky thunders with the tumult"

C, R, T imitate the crackling of flames in the following lines of Lucretius:
:'''''T'''e'''RR'''ibili soni'''T'''u flamma '''CRe'''pi'''T'''an'''T'''e '''CRe'''ma'''T'''u'''r'''''&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius 6.155; cf. Rolfe (1943),
 p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"with a terrifying sound it burns up in a crackling flame"

C and T can also imitate the sounds of musical instruments, as in these lines of Lucretius:&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''T'''ympana '''T'''en'''T'''a '''T'''onan'''t''' palmis et '''C'''ymbala '''C'''ir'''C'''um''
:'''''C'''on'''C'''ava, rau'''C'''isono'''q'''ue minantur '''C'''ornua '''C'''antu.''&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius 2.618-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Taut timbrels thunder in their hands, and hollow cymbals all around,
:and horns menace with harsh-sounding bray"

In the opening of Virgil's first Eclogue, as in the line of [[Theocritus]] that it imitates, the T and P sounds have been explained as the whispering of the leaves of the tree:&lt;ref&gt;Niklas (2009). p. 2. The Greek is: {{lang|grc|ἁδύ τι τὸ ψιθύρισμα καὶ ἁ πίτυς αἰπόλε τήνα}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''T'''i'''T'''yre, '''T'''u '''P'''a'''T'''ulae recubans sub '''T'''egmine fagi''.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Eclogue'' 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Tityrus, you who are lying under the shade of a spreading beech tree."

M may represent the rolling of thunder&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; or the roaring of the sea:&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''interea '''M'''agno '''M'''isce'''r'''i '''M'''u'''rm'''u'''r'''e pontum''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 1.124&lt;/ref&gt;
:"meanwhile the sea began to stir with a loud roaring"

With the letters P and D Virgil can represent the sound of men running:
:''tre'''P'''i'''D'''ique '''P'''e'''D'''em '''P'''e'''D'''e fervi'''D'''us urget''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.748.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"he presses hotly with his foot the foot of the panicking Turnus"

The alternation of T Q C and G combined with a [[Prosody (Latin)|dactylic]] rhythm can imitate the ''tattaka tattaka'' or ''takkatak takkatak'' sound of a horse cantering across the plain:
:''por&lt;u&gt;'''T'''a'''T''' e'''Q'''uus&lt;/u&gt; '''C'''ris'''T'''ā&lt;u&gt;'''Q'''ue '''T'''e'''G'''i'''T&lt;/u&gt; G'''alea au'''R'''ea '''R'''ub'''R'''ā''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'', 9.50.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"his horse carries him and a golden helmet with a red crest covers his head"

The letter H, which is only rarely used, can imitate the panting of a dog:
:''at vividus Umber '''H'''aeret '''H'''ians''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.753-4&lt;/ref&gt;
:"but the lively Umbrian dog sticks to it panting"

In this line, describing the fate of some Lycian peasants who have been transformed into frogs, Ovid uses the alliteration (with assonance) of QUA QUA to represent their quacking, even before revealing what creatures they have been metamorphosed into: 
:'''''Qua'''mvis sint sub a'''Qua''', sub a'''Qua''' maledicere temptant.''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 6.376&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Though they be under water, under water they still try to curse her."

In the following highly alliterative line it has been suggested that Ovid is imitating the chattering sound of the local Black Sea languages:&lt;ref&gt;Holzberg (2009). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''iam '''D'''i'''D'''i'''C'''i '''G'''e'''T'''i'''C'''e Sarma'''T'''i'''C'''e'''Q'''ue lo'''Q'''ui''.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Tristia'', 5.12.58&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By now I have learnt to speak in [[Getae|Getic]] and Sarmatic."

===Light and liquid===
As Bailey points out&lt;ref&gt;Bailey (1947), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; often a key word will set the alliteration in a line. Thus ''murmur'' "rumbling" will suggest the letters M and R, ''ventus'' "wind" and ''vis'' "force" will suggest V, and the letter L, the initial of ''lux'' and ''lumen'' (both meaning "light"), may represent the effects of light:&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''A'''dspirant '''A'''urae in '''N'''o'''c'''tem '''N'''e'''c''' '''C'''andida '''C'''ursus''
:'''''L'''una '''N'''egat; sp'''L'''endet tremu'''L'''o sub '''L'''umine pontus.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 7.8-9&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The breezes breathe into the night; nor does the bright moon deny their passage; 
:the sea glistens beneath its trembling light."

Likewise in the following lines from book 2 of the ''Aeneid'' the L, C, and ŪC sounds of the word ''lūce'' "light" are picked out and repeated:
:''intonuit '''L'''aevum, et de '''C'''ae'''L'''o '''L'''apsa per umbras''
:''ste'''LL'''a fa'''C'''em d'''ŪC'''ens mu'''l'''ta '''C'''um '''LŪC'''e '''C'''u'''C'''urrit''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.693-4&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was thunder on the left, and from the sky gliding through the darkness
:a star, drawing a trail, ran with much light."

L can also suggest the gliding of liquid,&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 234; Bailey (1947), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; as at Lucretius 5.950, where there is secondary alliteration of R:
:''quibus e scibant umore f'''L'''uenta''
:'''''L'''ub'''r'''ica p'''r'''o'''L'''u'''v'''ie '''L'''a'''r'''gā '''L'''a'''v'''e'''r'''e umida saxa''
:"from whom slippery streams flowing with moisture learnt how to wash the wet rocks with plentiful overflow"

Both ideas are combined in the following lines, also from Lucretius:
:'''''L'''argus item '''L'''iquidi fons '''L'''uminis, aetherius so'''L''',
:''in'''R'''igat adsidue '''C'''ae'''L'''um '''C'''ando'''R'''e '''R'''e'''c'''enti&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, 5.280&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Likewise, a plentiful spring of liquid light, the etherial sun,
:constantly irrigates the sky with fresh brightness."

===Echo alliteration===
Another use of alliteration in Virgil is to emphasise particular key words or names. Headlam (1921) demonstrates how when Virgil introduces a proper name he often uses echoes of the sound of that name through alliteration or assonance in nearby words, a technique he refers to as "echo alliteration":&lt;ref&gt;Headlam (1920), p. 24; Headlam (1921), p. 61-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''et centumgeminus '''B'''riareus ac '''B'''e'''L'''ua '''L'''ernae''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 6.287&lt;/ref&gt;
:"and hundred-handed Briareus and the beast of Lerna"

:''talis '''CAS'''us '''CASSan'''dra '''Can'''ebat''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 3.183.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Cassandra used to sing of such events."

:''huc, '''P'''ater o '''LEN'''aee — tuis hic omnia '''PLEN'''a muneribus''&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Georgics'' 2.4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Come hither, Father Lenaeus – here everything is filled with your gifts."

:'''''PR'''i'''AM'''o ... '''P'''e'''R'''g'''AM'''a''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.291&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Priam ... Pergama".

Not only proper names but also other key words can be highlighted in this way. In the passage below, the god Faunus and the wild olive tree (''oleaster'') both play a significant role in the story. The first of these is highlighted by the alliteration F F F; the second by assonance (''-oliis oleas-''). There are further echoes in the syllables ''ste'', ''ter'', ''ol'' and ''le'' in the second line:
:'''''F'''orte sacer '''F'''auno, '''Foliis oleas'''ter amaris''
:''hic '''steter'''at, nautis '''ol'''im venerabi'''le''' lignum.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.766-7&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By chance, sacred to Faunus, a wild olive with bitter leaves
:had stood here, a piece of wood once venerable for sailors."

===Dramatic moments===
Alliteration is frequently used in the ''Aeneid'' at moments of high drama, such as the moment that Aeneas's enemy Turnus is finally struck down by Aeneas in book 12. In this passage can be heard first the noisy STR STR imitating the sound of the spear's flight, then the vocalic alliteration of I I I as Turnus falls, and finally an assonance of PLI PLI as his knees buckle:
:''per medium '''STR'''iden'''S TR'''an'''s'''i'''t''' femu'''r'''. '''I'''ncidit '''I'''ctus''
:'''''I'''ngens ad '''T'''erram du'''PL'''ica'''T'''o '''P'''o'''PL'''i'''T'''e '''T'''urnus.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.926-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Whooshing, (the spear) passes through his thigh. The huge Turnus, 
:struck, falls to the ground with folded knee."

Another warrior dies in book 9 of the ''Aeneid'' as follows, with primary alliteration of V V, F F, and secondary alliteration of L L and NG NG:
:'''''V'''o'''lv'''itur i'''ll'''e '''V'''o'''m'''ens ca'''l'''idum de pectore '''Fl'''u'''m'''en
:'''''F'''ri'''g'''idus et '''L'''o'''ng'''is si'''ng'''u'''l'''tibus i'''l'''ia pu'''l'''sat.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 9.414.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He rolls over, vomiting a hot stream from his chest,
:and becoming cold shakes his flanks with long gulps."

Ovid also sometimes uses alliteration to mark significant moments in the story, as when he describes Echo's transformation. Here the alliteration of F F is accompanied by an assonance of OSS ISS:
:''vox manet; o'''SS'''a '''F'''erunt lapidis traxi'''SS'''e '''F'''iguram.''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 3.337.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Her voice remains, but they say her bones took on the appearance of a stone."

When Scylla silently enters her father's bedroom and cuts off the lock of hair whose loss will destroy the city, the letter T is constantly repeated, the word ''facinus'' "crime" and ''fatali'' "fatal" are emphasised by alliteration of F, and ''intrat ... nata parentem'' are linked by the assonance of NT. Finally alliteration of S emphasises the word ''spoliat'' "robs":
:''...'''T'''halamos '''T'''aci'''T'''urna pa'''T'''ernos''
:''i'''nT'''ra'''T''' e'''T''' (heu '''F'''acinus!) '''F'''a'''T'''ali '''n'''a'''T'''a pare'''nT'''em''
:''cri'''n'''e '''S'''uum '''S'''poliat...''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 8.84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Silently she enters her father's bedroom
:and (alas, dreadful deed!) the daughter robs the parent
:of his fatal lock"

In the following lines Ovid describes the dangerous moment in the flight of [[Icarus]] when he flies too close to the sun. Here the consonants D and C of the word ''audaci'' "daring" are echoed through two lines, before giving way to T T T:
:'''''C'''um puer '''auD'''a'''C'''i '''C'''oepit g'''auD'''ere volatu''
:'''''D'''eseruit'''Q'''ue '''D'''u'''C'''em '''C'''aeli'''Q'''ue '''C'''upi'''D'''ine '''T'''ra'''cT'''us''
:''al'''T'''ius egi'''T''' i'''T'''er.''&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 8.223-5&lt;/ref&gt;
:"when the boy began to take pleasure in audacious flight
:and abandoned his leader, and drawn by desire for the sky
:flew on a higher path."

===Emotional speech===
Alliteration and assonance also often add emphasis to expressions of emotion, such as anger, scorn, grief, panic, and terror,&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe (1943), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; as in the following lines from book 2 of the ''Aeneid'', where the ghost of Hector orders Aeneas to flee. Here alliteration is combined with assonance of ''Priamo ... Pergama'' and ''possent ... fuissent'':

:'''''H'''ostis '''H'''abet muros! '''R'''ui'''t''' al'''t'''o a culmine '''Tr'''oia.''
:'''''S'''at '''P'''atriae '''P'''riamoque '''D'''atum: '''S'''i '''P'''ergama '''D'''extra''
:'''''D'''efendi '''P'''ossent, etiam hac '''D'''e'''F'''ensa '''F'''uissent.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 2.290-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The enemy holds the walls! Troy is falling from its high rooftops.
:Enough has been given to out fatherland and to Priam; if Pergama were able to be defended
:by a right hand, it would have been defended even by this one!"

In book 12 of the ''Aeneid'' Turnus's sister cries these words:
:''ne '''M'''e '''T'''erre'''T'''e '''T'''i'''M'''en'''T'''em!"&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.875&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Do not terrify me, who am already scared!"

Aeneas taunts his enemy with alliteration of T C S and assonance of VA VAR VA AR A as follows:
:'''''vert'''e omnis '''t'''e'''t'''e in fa'''c'''ies et '''c'''ontrahe quidquid''
:'''''s'''i'''V' A'''nimis '''s'''i'''V' AR'''te '''VA'''les; opt' '''AR'''dua pennis''
:'''''As'''tra '''s'''e'''q'''ui '''C'''lau'''s'''um'''q'''ue '''C'''a'''vā T'''e '''Con'''de'''r'''e '''T'''e'''rr'''ā.''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.891-3&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Turn yourself into any shape and draw together whatever
:you can in courage or skill; choose to fly on wings into the stars on high
:or bury yourself enclosed in the hollow earth!"

In his reply, Turnus combines alliteration of T D T D with assonance of FER TER FER TER:
:''ille caput quassans: ‘non me '''T'''ua '''Fer'''vi'''d'''a '''Terr'''ent''
:'''''D'''ic'''t'''a, '''Fer'''ox; '''D'''i me '''Terr'''en'''t e'''t Iuppi'''ter''' hos'''t'''is.’''&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 12.894-5&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Shaking his head, he replied, 'It is not your hot words that terrify me,
:fierce though you are; it is the gods who terrify me, and Jupiter my enemy!"

==Decline of alliteration==
Tastes in alliteration gradually changed, and some writers, such as Plautus, Ennius, Lucretius, and Virgil, used it much more freely than others such as Catullus or Horace.&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; From the first century AD it became less common. The scholar [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (c.400), who wrote a commentary on Virgil, commented on the triple alliteration of ''Aeneid'' 3.183 (''casus Cassandra canebat'' "Cassandra used to sing of these events") and similar phrases: "This style of composition is now considered a fault, although our ancestors liked it".&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He also disapproved of phrases such as ''Dorica castra'' (''Aeneid'' 2.27) in which the final syllable of a word was repeated in the next word.&lt;ref&gt;Naeke (1829), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few years later [[Martianus Capella]] (fl. 410-20) wrote: ''Compositionis vitium maximum est non vitare cuiuslibet litterae assiduitatem in odium repetitam.'' "It is a very great fault in composition not to avoid the constant use of a letter repeated ad nauseam."&lt;ref&gt;Peck (1884), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliteration in Anglo-Latin poetry==
From the 7th century onwards English scholars began writing poetry in Latin, beginning with [[Aldhelm]], Abbot of [[Malmesbury]] in Wiltshire. Imitating and perhaps even exceeding the type of alliteration familiar in Old English, poems were written such as the following, attributed to Aldhelm himself, which displays both major and minor alliteration:&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge (1979), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''T'''u'''rb'''o '''T'''e'''rr'''am '''T'''e'''r'''e'''t'''i'''b'''us''
:'''''Gr'''assa'''b'''a'''t'''ur '''Gr'''andini'''b'''us''
:''quae '''C'''a'''t'''erva'''t'''im '''C'''aeli'''t'''us''
:'''''Cr'''e'''br'''antur '''N'''ig'''r'''is '''N'''u'''b'''i'''b'''us''
:"A whirlwind was coming over the land
:with smooth hailstones,
:which in throngs from the sky
:are sieved by the black clouds."

Aldhelm also used alliteration in many of his hexameter lines, such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge (1979), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''L'''us'''TR'''at dum '''T'''e'''RR'''as ob'''L'''iquo '''TR'''ami'''T'''e '''T'''i'''T'''an''
:"while Titan (= the sun) traverses the lands with his slanting beam"

Lapidge (1979) discusses where exactly alliteration should be sought: at the beginning of the word, on the stressed syllable, or on the verse ictus. However, these questions still remain largely unanswered.

Another highly alliterative work produced in England is the ''Melos Amoris'' ("Melody of Love") written about 1330 by the Yorkshire mystic [[Richard Rolle]]. An excerpt of this work, which is written in prose, but with some characteristics of verse, is the following:&lt;ref&gt;Liegey (1956), p. 372; de Ford (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''''Am'''icam '''A'''utem '''A'''da'''m'''avi, in quam '''A'''ngeli''
:'''''O'''mnipotentis '''A'''nhelant '''A'''spicere.''
:''et '''M'''i'''r'''ificam '''M'''a'''r'''iam '''M'''ise'''r'''ico'''r'''die '''M'''at'''r'''em''
:'''''M'''u'''l'''cebam '''M'''ichi in '''M'''o'''ll'''itie '''M'''e'''ll'''if'''l'''ua.''
:"But I fell in love with a Beloved, on whom the Angels
:of the Omnipotent pant to gaze.
:And Mary, the miraculous mother of mercy,
:I was caressing to myself in honey-flowing softness."

The same author's ''Canticum Amoris'' is a shorter poem written in alliterative verse.&lt;ref&gt;Liegey (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time as Richard Rolle wrote this, an [[Alliterative Revival]] also began in English poetry, and in the same part of England.

The organization is often referred to by members as '''Cosa Nostra''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkɔsa ˈnɔstra}}, ''our thing'') and by the government as  '''La Cosa Nostra''' ('''LCN'''). The organization's name is derived from the original ''Mafia'' or ''Cosa nostra'', the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and it originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American [[gangster]]s and Italian-American crime groups (such as the [[Camorra in New York|American Camorra]]) living in the United States and Canada that are not of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the '''Italian Mafia''' or '''Italian Mob''', though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].

The Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrant]] [[Little Italy|neighborhoods or ghettos]] in New York's [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]), [[Lower East Side]], and [[Brooklyn]]. It also emerged in other areas of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and several other major metropolitan areas (such as [[New Orleans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Dash|author-link=Mike Dash|year=2009|title=First Family}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chicago]]) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from [[Sicily]] and other regions of [[Southern Italy]]. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. [[Campania|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with [[Italian organized crime]] groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the [[Camorra]] of [[Naples]], and [['Ndrangheta]] of [[Calabria]]. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a "[[Crime family|family,]]" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of "family" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto M. Dainotto(2015) The Mafia: A Cultural History pp.7-44 {{ISBN|9781780234434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mafia is currently most active in the [[northeastern United States]], especially in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[New Jersey]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[New England]], in areas such as [[Boston]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and [[Hartford]]. It is also heavily active in [[Chicago]] and other large [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] cities such as [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Cleveland]], [[St. Louis]], [[Kansas City]] as well as in [[New Orleans]], [[Florida]], [[Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles]], with smaller families, associates, and crews in other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=Italian Organized Crime |website=Organized Crime |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010181124/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Mafia's peak, there were at least 26 cities around the United States with Cosa Nostra families, with many more offshoots and associates in other cities. There are five main New York City Mafia families, known as the [[Five Families]]: the [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]], [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]], [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]], [[Bonanno crime family|Bonanno]], and [[Colombo crime family|Colombo]] families. At its peak, the American Mafia dominated [[organized crime in the United States]]. Each crime family has its own territory (except for the Five Families) and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families.

Today, most of the Mafia's activities are contained to the northeastern United States and Chicago, where they continue to dominate organized crime, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Barrett, Devlin|author2=Gardiner, Sean|title=Structure Keeps Mafia Atop Crime Heap|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704115404576096392318489246|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gardiner, Sean|author2=Shallwani, Parvaiz|title=Mafia Is Down—but Not Out|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626804579363363092833756|work=Wall Street Journal|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==
{{further|Sicilian Mafia#Etymology}}

The term ''Mafia'' was originally used in Italy by the media and law enforcement to describe criminal groups in Sicily. The origins of the term are debatable, though most agree the term is derived from the word ''ma'afir'', a term rooted in [[Arabic]] and meaning 'shelter' or 'place of refuge'. Like the Sicilian Mafia, the American Mafia did not use the term ''mafia'' to describe itself. Neither group has a formal name and instead used the term ''cosa nostra'' (Italian for 'our thing') when referring to themselves. When Italian immigrants started forming organized crime groups in the United States, the American press borrowed the term ''mafia'' from Italy and it became the predominant name used by law enforcement and the public.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

"Mafia" properly refers to either the [[Mafia|Sicilian]] or Italian-American Mafia. In modern usage, when referring to the Mafia, there may be several meanings, including a local area's Italian organized crime element, the Mafia family of a major city, the entire Mafia of the United States, or the original Sicilian Mafia. Widespread recognition of the word has led to its use in the names of other criminal organizations, such as the [[Jewish Mafia]], [[Mexican Mafia]], or [[Russian Mafia]],{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as non-criminal organizations, such as [[John F. Kennedy]]'s political team, referred to as the "Irish Mafia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Washington Post|author=Bart Barnes|date=March 28, 1998|page=B05|title=JFK Aide David Francis Powers Dies at 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with the [[Irish Mob]]).

The press also coined the name "[[National Crime Syndicate]]" to refer to the entire network of U.S. organized crime, which includes the [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish Mafia]] elements and the Italian-American Mafia. It was described as a confederation of mainly Italian and [[Jewish-American]] organized crime groups throughout the U.S., as revealed by the findings of a U.S. Senate [[Kefauver Hearings|Special Committee]] in the 1950s chaired by [[Estes Kefauver]].

==History==

===Origins: The Black Hand===
{{Main|Black Hand (extortion)}}
[[File:Paul Kelly-2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]]), founder of the [[Five Points Gang]]]]
The first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869.  The ''[[Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times]]'' reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by "well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city."  Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.

Mafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York City area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor [[Little Italy|Italian ghettos]] to citywide and eventually national organizations. The Black Hand was a name given to an [[extortion]] method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/lippmanstudy/articles/Lombardo.pdf |title=Sagepub.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuseppe Morello was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; He was arrested in [[New Orleans]] in 1881 and extradited to Italy.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

New Orleans was also the site of the first Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent [[David Hennessy]] was murdered execution-style. It is still unclear whether Italian immigrants actually killed him, or whether it was a [[frame-up]] by nativists against the reviled underclass immigrants.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Hundreds of Sicilians were arrested on mostly baseless charges, and nineteen were eventually indicted for the murder. An acquittal followed, with rumors of bribed and intimidated witnesses.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; On [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|March 14, 1891]], the outraged citizens of New Orleans organized a [[Lynching|lynch]] mob after the acquittal, and proceeded to kill eleven of the nineteen defendants. Two were hanged, nine were shot, and the remaining eight escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pontchartrain |first=Blake |url=http://bestofneworleans.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A31813 |title=New Orleans Know-It-All |publisher=Bestofneworleans.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AnhKPlOC?url=http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/new-orleans-know-it-all/Content?oid=1242578 |archive-date=2012-09-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html "Under Attack"].

From the 1890s to 1920 in [[New York City]] the [[Five Points Gang]], founded by [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]], were very powerful in the Little Italy of the Lower East Side. Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century such as [[Johnny Torrio]], [[Al Capone]], [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Frankie Yale]]. They were often in conflict with the [[Eastman Gang|Jewish Eastmans]] of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan [[Camorra]] was also very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the "Bloody Nineteenth" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, [[feud]]s, and vendettas.

===Prohibition era===&lt;!--pls do not change, [[The Mafia during Prohibition]] links to here --&gt;
On January 17, 1920, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] began in the United States with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. Not explicitly related to Mafia involvement the murder rate during the Prohibition Era rose from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003. pg. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The profits that could be made from selling and distributing alcohol were worth the risk of punishment from the government, which had a difficult time enforcing prohibition. There were over 900,000 cases of liquor shipped to the borders of U.S. cities.&lt;ref&gt;Gervais, C.H, The Rum runners A Prohibition Scrapbook. 1980. Thornhill: Firefly Books. Pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal gangs and politicians saw the opportunity to make fortunes and began shipping larger quantities of alcohol to U.S. cities.

[[File:AlCaponemugshotCPD.jpg|thumb|left|[[Al Capone]]'s [[Al Capone#In popular culture|culturally-publicized]] violent rise to power in [[Chicago]] made him an ever-lasting criminal figure of the prohibition era.]]

In the early 1920s, fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] took control of Italy and waves of Italian immigrants fled to the United States. Sicilian Mafia members also fled to the United States, as Mussolini cracked down on Mafia activities in Italy.&lt;ref name="FiveFamilies"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/books/review/11burrough.html | work=The New York Times | first=Bryan | last=Burrough | title='Five Families': Made Men in America | date=2005-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Italian immigrants resided in [[tenement]] buildings. As a way to escape the poor lifestyle, some Italian immigrants chose to join the American Mafia.

The Mafia took advantage of prohibition and began selling illegal alcohol. The profits from bootlegging far exceeded the traditional crimes of protection, extortion, gambling, and prostitution. Prohibition allowed Mafia families to make fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Butts, Edward, Outlaws of The Lakes – Bootlegging and Smuggling from Colonial Times To Prohibition. 2004.Toronto: Linx Images Inc.

Ottawa: Love Printing Service. Pg ix&lt;/ref&gt; As prohibition continued, victorious factions went on to dominate organized crime in their respective cities, setting up the family structure of each city. Gangs hijacked each other's alcohol shipments, forcing rivals to pay them for "protection" to leave their operations alone, and armed guards almost invariably accompanied the caravans that delivered the liquor.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Phillip. Rum running and The Roaring Twenties. 1995. Detroit: Wayne State University Press. Pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butts, Edward, Outlaws of The Lakes – Bootlegging and Smuggling from Colonial Times To Prohibition. 2004.Toronto: Linx Images Inc. Pg 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Italian Mafia families began waging wars for absolute control over lucrative bootlegging rackets. As the violence erupted, Italians fought Irish and Jewish ethnic gangs for control of bootlegging in their respective territories. In New York City, [[Frankie Yale]] waged war with the Irish American [[White Hand Gang]]. In Chicago, [[Al Capone]] and his [[Chicago Outfit|family]] massacred the [[North Side Gang]], another Irish American outfit.&lt;ref name="jrank"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gervais, C.H, The Rum runners A Prohibition Scrapbook. 1980. Thornhill: Firefly Books. Pg10&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, by the end of the 1920s, two factions of organized crime had emerged to fight for control of the criminal underworld, one led by [[Joe Masseria]] and the other by [[Salvatore Maranzano]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; This caused the [[Castellammarese War]], which led to Masseria's murder in 1931. Maranzano then divided New York City into [[Five Families|five families]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Maranzano, the first leader of the American Mafia, established the code of conduct for the organization, set up the "family" divisions and structure, and established procedures for resolving disputes.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; In an unprecedented move, Maranzano set himself up as [[capo di tutti capi|boss of all bosses]] and required all families to pay tribute to him. This new role was received negatively, and Maranzano was murdered within six months on the orders of [[Lucky Luciano|Charles "Lucky" Luciano]]. Luciano was a former Masseria underling who had switched sides to Maranzano and orchestrated the killing of Masseria.

After prohibition ended in 1933, organized crime groups were confronted with an impasse and needed other ways to maintain the high profits that they had acquired throughout the 1920s. The smarter of the organized crime groups expanded into other ventures, such as unions, construction, sanitation, and drug trafficking. On the other hand, those Mafia families that neglected the need to change eventually lost power and influence and were ultimately absorbed by other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dubro, James. Mob Rule – Inside the Canadian Mafia. 1985. Toronto: Macmillan of Canada. Pg, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Commission===
{{further|The Commission (mafia)}}

[[File:CommissionChart1963.jpg|thumb|[[FBI]] chart of American Mafia bosses across the country in 1963.]]
As an alternative to the previous despotic Mafia practice of naming a single Mafia boss as ''[[capo di tutti capi]]'', or "boss of all bosses," Luciano set up [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]],&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; where the bosses of the most powerful families would have equal say and vote on important matters and solve disputes between families. This group ruled over the [[National Crime Syndicate]] and brought in an era of peace and prosperity for the American Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;King of the Godfathers: Big Joey Massino and the Fall of the Bonanno Crime Family By Anthony M. DeStefano. Kensington Publishing Corp., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-century, there were 26 official Commission-sanctioned Mafia crime families, each based in a different city (except for the [[Five Families]] which were all based in New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/26_Family_Cities.html |title=Rick Porrello's AmericanMafia.com – 26 Mafia Families and Their Cities |publisher=Americanmafia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212044523/http://americanmafia.com/26_Family_Cities.html |archivedate=12 December 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each family operated independently from the others and generally had exclusive territory it controlled.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; As opposed to the older generation of "[[Mustache Pete]]s" such as Maranzano and Masseria, who usually worked only with fellow Italians, the "Young Turks" led by Luciano were more open to working with other groups, most notably the [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish-American criminal syndicates]] to achieve greater profits. The Mafia thrived by following a strict set of rules that originated in Sicily that called for an organized hierarchical structure and a [[code of silence]] that forbade its members from cooperating with the police ([[Omertà]]). Failure to follow any of these rules was punishable by death.

The rise of power that the Mafia acquired during Prohibition would continue long after alcohol was made legal again. Criminal empires which had expanded on bootleg money would find other avenues to continue making large sums of money. When alcohol ceased to be prohibited in 1933, the Mafia diversified its money-making criminal activities to include (both old and new): illegal gambling operations, [[loan shark]]ing, [[extortion]], [[protection racket]]s, drug trafficking, [[fence (criminal)|fencing]], and labor racketeering through control of labor unions. In the mid-20th century, the Mafia was reputed to have infiltrated many [[labor union]]s in the United States, most notably the [[Teamsters]] and [[International Longshoremen's Association]].&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; This allowed crime families to make inroads into very profitable legitimate businesses such as construction, demolition, waste management, trucking, and in the waterfront and garment industry.&lt;ref name="Busting"&gt;Busting the Mob: United States v. Cosa Nostra" James B. Jacobs, Christopher Panarella, Jay Worthington. NYU Press, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-8147-4230-3}}. pages 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they could raid the unions' health and pension funds, extort businesses with threats of a workers' strike and participate in [[bid rigging]]. In New York City, most construction projects could not be performed without the [[Five Families]]' approval. In the [[port]] and [[loading dock]] industries, the Mafia bribed union members to tip them off to valuable items being brought in. Mobsters would then steal these products and [[fence (criminal)|fence]] the stolen merchandise.

[[Meyer Lansky]] made inroads into the casino industry in Cuba during the 1930s while the Mafia was already involved in exporting Cuban sugar and rum.&lt;ref name="Cuba"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salinger |first1=Lawrence M. |title=Encyclopedia of white-collar &amp; corporate crime: A – I, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0f7yTNb_V3QC&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq=mafia+cuba+casinos#v=onepage&amp;q=mafia%20cuba%20casinos&amp;f=false  |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=978-0-7619-3004-4 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his friend [[Fulgencio Batista]] became president of Cuba in 1952, several Mafia bosses were able to make legitimate investments in legalized casinos. One estimate of the number of casinos mobsters owned was no less than 19.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; However, when Batista was overthrown following the [[Cuban Revolution]], his successor [[Fidel Castro]] banned U.S. investment in the country, putting an end to the Mafia's presence in Cuba.&lt;ref name="Cuba"/&gt; Las Vegas was seen as an "open city" where any family can work. Once Nevada legalized gambling, mobsters were quick to take advantage and the casino industry became very popular in Las Vegas. Since the 1940s, Mafia families from New York, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago had interests in Las Vegas casinos. They got loans from the [[Teamsters]]' pension fund, a union they effectively controlled, and used legitimate front men to build casinos.&lt;ref name="Vegas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mannion |first1=James |title=The Everything Mafia Book: True-Life Accounts of Legendary Figures, Infamous Crime Families, and Chilling Events |edition=illustrated |series=Everything series |year=2003 |publisher=Everything Books |isbn=978-1-58062-864-8 |page=94}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 1, 2011 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When money came into the [[count room|counting room]], hired men [[Skimming (casinos)|skimmed]] cash before it was recorded, then delivered it to their respective bosses.&lt;ref name="Vegas"/&gt; This money went unrecorded, but the amount is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Operating in the shadows, the Mafia faced little opposition from law enforcement. Local law enforcement agencies did not have the resources or knowledge to effectively combat organized crime committed by a secret society they were unaware existed.&lt;ref name="Busting"/&gt; Many people within police forces and courts were simply bribed, while witness intimidation was also common.&lt;ref name="Busting"/&gt; In 1951, a U.S. Senate committee called the [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce|Kefauver Hearings]] determined that a "sinister criminal organization" known as the Mafia operated in the nation.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Many suspected mobsters were subpoenaed for questioning, but few testified and none gave any meaningful information. In 1957, New York State Police uncovered a meeting and arrested major figures from around the country in [[Apalachin, New York]]. The event (dubbed the "[[Apalachin Meeting]]") forced the FBI to recognize organized crime as a serious problem in the United States and changed the way law enforcement investigated it.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; In 1963, [[Joe Valachi]] became the first Mafia member to [[turn state's evidence]], and provided detailed information of its inner workings and secrets. More importantly, he revealed Mafia's existence to the law, which enabled the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] to begin an aggressive assault on the Mafia's National Crime Syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/valachi/index_1.html |title=The Dying of the Light: The Joseph Valachi Story — Prologue — Crime Library on |publisher=Trutv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119192112/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/valachi/index_1.html |archive-date=2012-01-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Valachi's testimony, the Mafia could no longer operate completely in the shadows. The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime actives nationwide and created the [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]] in various cities. However, while all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little to curb their criminal activities. Success was made by the beginning of the 1980s, when the FBI was able to rid Las Vegas casinos of Mafia control and made a determined effort to loosen the Mafia's strong hold on labor unions.

=== Mafia involvement in the US economy ===
[[File:Carlo_Gambino.jpg|thumb|[[Carlo Gambino]], head of the Gambino crime family.]]
By the late 1970s, the Mafia were involved in many industries,&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; including betting on college sports. Several Mafia members associated with the [[Lucchese crime family]] participated in a [[1978–79 Boston College basketball point shaving scandal|point shaving scandal involving Boston College basketball team]]. Rick Kuhn, [[Henry Hill]], and others associated with the Lucchese crime family, manipulated the results of the games during the 1978{{ndash}}1979 basketball season. Through bribing and intimidating several members of the team, they ensured their bets on the point spread of each game would go in their favor.&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/untagged/2014/10/07/espn_looks_at_how_boston_college_helped_take_down|title=ESPN Looks at How Boston College Helped Take Down 'Goodfellas'|date=2014-10-07|website=Boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most lucrative gains for the Mafia was through gas-tax fraud. They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. [[Michael Franzese]], also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed. Franzese was caught in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-03-26/news/8501110652_1_gas-tax-michael-franzese-colombo-crime-family|title=Gas-tax Fraud Tied To Mob Families|website=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mafia-Aided Scheme Evades Millions in Gas Taxes|first=Selwyn|last=Raab|date=February 6, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/06/nyregion/mafia-aided-scheme-evades-millions-in-gas-taxes.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor racketeering helped the Mafia control many industries from a macroeconomic scale. This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. [[La Cosa Nostra]] was a Mafia group that rose to economic power through their heavy involvement in unions. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the [[Teamster Union|teamster union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|ssrn=2002404|title=American Gangsters: RICO, Criminal Syndicates, and Conspiracy Law as Market Control|last=Levin|first=Benjamin|date=2013|work=periodical|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin through the Al Dente Pizzeria Chain, hiding the cargo in various food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218555.pdf|title=United Nations Activities: La Cosa Nostra in the United States|last=Finckenauer|first=James O.|date=December 6, 2007|work=International Center National Institute of Justice|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort "[[Flamingo Las Vegas|The Flamingo]]".&lt;ref name="weebly"/&gt; Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/03/nevadas-20th-century-economy-a-tale-of-water-minin/|title=Nevada's 20th century economy a tale of water, mining, casinos|date=2000-01-03|website=LasVegasSun.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was through millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts that laid the foundation for further economic growth. This capital didn't come from one Mafia family alone, but many throughout the country seeking to gain even more power and wealth. Large profits from casinos, run as legitimate businesses, would help to finance many of the illegal activities of the Mafia from the 1950s into the 1980s.&lt;ref name="weebly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-mafia.weebly.com/mafia-in-las-vegas.html|title=Mafia in Las Vegas - The Mafia|website=the-mafia.weebly.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s more Mafia-financed casinos were constructed, such as the [[Stardust Resort and Casino|Stardust]], [[Sahara Casino|Sahara]], [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]], [[Desert Inn LPGA International|Desert Inn]], and [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]]. Tourism in the city greatly increased through the 1960s and strengthened the local economy.

However, the 1960s was also when the Mafia's influence in the Las Vegas economy began to dwindle.&lt;ref name="weebly"/&gt; The Nevada State government and Federal government had been working to weaken Mafia activity on [[Las Vegas Strip|the Strip]]. In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the [[RICO Act]] a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/siegel-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-las-vegas|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|last=REVIEW-JOURNAL|first=JEFF GERMAN LAS VEGAS|date=2014-03-09|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RICO Act===
[[File:Sammy Gravano (arrest photo - 1990).jpg|thumb|[[Sammy Gravano]]]]

When the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters. It provides for extended criminal penalties for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization. Violation of the act is punishable by up to 20 years in prison per count, up to $25,000 in fines, and the violator must forfeit all properties attained while violating the RICO Act.&lt;ref name="Abadinsky, Howard 2003. pg. 319"&gt;Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003. pg. 319&lt;/ref&gt; The RICO Act has proven to be a very powerful weapon, because it attacks the entire corrupt entity instead of individuals who can easily be replaced with other organized crime members.&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt; Between 1981 and 1992, 23 bosses from around the country were convicted under the law while between 1981 and 1988, 13 underbosses and 43 captains were convicted.&lt;ref name="Busting"/&gt; Over 1000 crime family figures were convicted by 1990.&lt;ref name="Abadinsky, Howard 2003. pg. 319"/&gt; While this significantly crippled many Mafia families around the country, the most powerful families continued to dominate crime in their territories, even if the new laws put more mobsters in jail and made it harder to operate. With [[Sammy Gravano]] agreeing to cooperate with the FBI and turn state's evidence in 1991, he helped the FBI convict top Mafia leaders in New York. Although not the first Mafia member to testify against his peers, such a powerful mobster agreeing to do so set a precedent for waves of mobsters thereafter to break the code of silence to do the same; giving up information and testifying in exchange for [[immunity from prosecution]] for their crimes.&lt;ref name="FiveFamilies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gravano/commitment_21.html Sammy "The Bull" Gravano] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101094446/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/gravano/commitment_21.html |date=2011-11-01 }} By Allan May. TruTV&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from avoiding long prison stretches, the FBI could put mobsters in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program]], changing their identities and supporting them financially for life. This led to dozens of mobsters testifying and providing information during the 1990s, which led to the imprisonment of hundreds of mobsters. As a result, the Mafia has seen a major decline in its power and influence in organized crime since the 1990s.

In the 21st century, the Mafia has continued to be involved in a broad spectrum of illegal activities. These include murder, extortion, corruption of public officials, gambling, infiltration of legitimate businesses, labor racketeering, loan sharking, [[tax evasion|tax fraud]] schemes and [[stock manipulation]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=FBI — Italian/Mafia |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116163335/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=16 January 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor contributing to the Mafia's downfall is the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Italian Americans, which left a shallower recruitment pool of new mobsters.

==Structure==
{{norefs|section|date=November 2018}}
[[File:Mafia family structure tree.en.svg|right|400px]]
The American Mafia operates on a strict hierarchical structure. While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. All inducted members of the Mafia are called [[made man|"made" men]]. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are "made" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a ''caporegime'' (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the [[chain of command]]. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated. This provides what is called [[plausible deniability]].

There are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader [[Vincent Gigante]].
* '''Boss''' – The [[Crime boss|boss]] is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or "Godfather". The boss receives a cut of every operation taken on by every member of his family and the region's occupying family.&lt;ref&gt;Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.&lt;ref name="Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002"&gt;Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia''. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of [[John Gotti]] in 1986. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.
* '''Underboss''' – The [[underboss]], usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.
* '''Consigliere''' – The [[consigliere]] is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's "right-hand man". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.
* '''Caporegime''' (or capo) – A [[caporegime]] (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10–20 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like [[Anthony Corallo]] they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.
* '''Soldier''' (Soldato in Italian) – A [[soldato|soldier]] is a member of the family, and traditionally can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.

[[File:Meyer Lansky NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish associate [[Meyer Lansky]]'s (right) work with [[Lucky Luciano]] made him an important figure in developing the American Mafia.]]
* '''Associate''' – An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters ("connected guys") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt [[labor union]] delegate or businessman.&lt;ref name="Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002"/&gt; Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italians like [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Murray Humphreys]], [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Frank Sheeran]], [[Gerard Ouimette]] and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Rituals==
The [[American Mafia induction rituals|initiation ritual]] emerged from various sources, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] confraternities and [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]] in mid-19th century Sicily&lt;ref name="initiation"&gt;"Mafia's arcane rituals, and much of the organization's structure, were based largely on those of the Catholic confraternities and even Freemasonry, colored by Sicilian familial traditions and even certain customs associated with military-religious orders of chivalry like the Order of Malta." [http://www.bestofsicily.com/mafia.htm The Mafia] from [http://www.bestofsicily.com bestofsicily.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and has hardly changed to this day. The Chief of Police of Palermo in 1875 reported that the man of honor to be initiated would be led into the presence of a group of bosses and underbosses. One of these men would prick the initiate's arm or hand and tell him to smear the blood onto a sacred image, usually a saint. The oath of loyalty would be taken as the image was burned and scattered, thus symbolizing the annihilation of traitors. This was confirmed by the first [[pentito]], [[Tommaso Buscetta]].

A ''hit'', or murder, of a "made" man had to be approved by the leadership of his family, or retaliatory hits would be made, possibly inciting a war. In a state of war, families would "go to the mattresses"—an Italian phrase which roughly meant to go into battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/159900.html|title='Go to the mattresses' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mafia rules and customs===
When the boss decides to let a member into the family one will be part of a ceremony, involving the drawing of blood, swearing an oath over a gun or holy picture, and obeying the rules of the organization. In [[New York City]], the Mafia created customs and traditions which the members have to follow. If one breaks any of the rules they can be killed by another member of the family and usually the murder is committed by the people closest to that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2heyBa24u8UC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=American+mafia+rules#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20mafia%20rules&amp;f=false |title=Mafia: A history of its rise to power.

===Symbolism in murders===
* On April 18, 1980, [[Philadelphia Mafia]] [[consigliere]] [[Antonio Caponigro]] had [[Angelo Bruno]] killed without [[The Commission (mafia)|The Commission]]'s approval. Caponigro and his brother-in-law Alfred Salerno were taken to an isolated house in upstate New York and tortured before being killed. Salerno had been shot three times behind the right ear and once behind the left ear. The autopsy showed that a rope had been tied around his neck, wrists, and ankles, and most of his neck and face bones shattered. Caponigro had been suffocated, beaten, repeatedly stabbed and shot, and was found in a garbage bag. Around $300 was stuffed up Caponigro's rectum as a sign that he had become greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nevadaobserver.com/Reading%20Room%20Documents/LCN%20-%20Philadelphia%20and%20Southern%20New%20Jersey%20|title=History|journal=The Nevada Observer|date=August 22, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1981, for allowing undercover FBI agent [[Joseph D. Pistone]] (alias Donnie Brasco) to infiltrate the [[Bonanno crime family]], caporegime [[Dominic Napolitano]], also known as Sonny Black, had his hands severed after he was killed. This was because he had Pistone shake hands and introduced to others as a "friend of ours" or a [[made man]] when he was not.

==Cooperation with the U.S. government==

===During World War II===
U.S. Naval Intelligence entered into an agreement with [[Lucky Luciano]] to gain his assistance in keeping the New York waterfront free from saboteurs after the destruction of the ''[[SS Normandie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Newark ''Mafia Allies'', p. 288, 292, MBI Publishing Co., 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-7603-2457-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This spectacular disaster convinced both sides to talk seriously about protecting the United States' East Coast on the afternoon of February 9, 1942. While it was in the process of being converted into a troopship, the luxury ocean liner, ''Normandie'',  mysteriously burst into flames with 1,500 sailors and civilians on board. All but one escaped, but 128 were injured and by the next day the ship was a smoking hulk. In his report, twelve years later,  William B. Herlands, Commissioner of Investigation, made the case for the US government talking to top criminals, stating "The Intelligence authorities were greatly concerned with the problems of sabotage and espionage ... Suspicions were rife with respect to the leaking of information about convoy movements. The ''Normandie'', which was being converted to war use as the Navy auxiliary ''Lafayette'', had burned at the pier in the North River, New York City. Sabotage was suspected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newark|first=Tim|title=Pact With the Devil?|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-newark/pact-devil|website=History Today Volume: 57 Issue: 4 2007|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plots to assassinate Fidel Castro===
In August 1960, Colonel Sheffield Edwards, director of the Office of Security of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), proposed the assassination of [[Cuba]]n head of state [[Fidel Castro]] by Mafia assassins. Between August 1960 and April 1961, the CIA, with the help of the Mafia, pursued a series of plots to poison or shoot Castro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Evans |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html |title=''Bay of Pigs Chronology'', The National Security Archive (at The George Washington University) |publisher=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110208183743/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/bayofpigs/chron.html| archivedate= 8 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those allegedly involved included [[Sam Giancana]], [[Carlos Marcello]], [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]], and [[John Roselli]].&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose &amp; Immerman ''Ike's Spies'', p. 303, 1999 {{ISBN|978-1-57806-207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery of murdered Mississippi civil rights workers===
In 2007, Linda Schiro testified in an unrelated court case that her late boyfriend, [[Gregory Scarpa]], a ''capo'' in the Colombo family, had been recruited by the FBI to help find the bodies of three civil rights workers who had been [[Murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner|murdered in Mississippi]] in 1964 by the Ku Klux Klan. She said that she had been with Scarpa in Mississippi at the time and had witnessed him being given a gun, and later a cash payment, by FBI agents. She testified that Scarpa had threatened a [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansman]] by placing a gun in the Klansman's mouth, forcing the Klansman to reveal the location of the bodies. Similar stories of Mafia involvement in recovering the bodies had been circulating for years, and had been previously published in the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', but had never before been introduced in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 20, 2010|title=At Trial of Ex-F.B.I.

Retrieved February 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law enforcement and the Mafia==
In several Mafia families, killing a state authority is forbidden due to the possibility of extreme police retaliation. In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate [[Dutch Schultz]] was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill [[New York City]] prosecutor [[Thomas Dewey]] and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer [[Joe Petrosino]] was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily. A statue of him was later erected across the street from a Lucchese hangout.&lt;ref&gt;''Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kefauver Committee===
In 1951, a U.S. Senate [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|special committee]], chaired by Democratic Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], determined that a "sinister criminal organization" known as the Mafia operated around the United States. The [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce]] (known as the "Kefauver Hearings"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the "Top Hoodlum Program". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |title=FBI — Using Intel to Stop the Mob, Pt. 2 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=1963-10-01 |accessdate=2011-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616042610/https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |archivedate=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Apalachin meeting''' was a historic [[summit (meeting)|summit]] of the American Mafia held at the home of mobster [[Joseph Barbara (mobster)|Joseph "Joe the Barber" Barbara]], in [[Apalachin, New York]], on November 14, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 1| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie| first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Top U.S. Hoods Are Run Out of Area After 'Sick Call' on Barbara| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204247.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 8| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Hoods Run Out of Area--| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204258.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 3| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Barbara's Life and Business Record| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| pages = 29| last1 = Fitchette| first1 = Woodie|  first2 = Steve| last2 = Hambalek| title = Barbara--| work = Binghamton Press| location = Binghamton, NY| date = 1957-11-15| url = http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper4/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957.pdf/Binghamton%20NY%20Press%20Grayscale%201957%20a%20-%204286.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Crime Inquiry Still Checking on Apalachin Meeting| newspaper =Toledo Blade| location =| pages =two| publisher =Associated Press| date =2 July 1958| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DjoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3gAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7133,3946334&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Apalachin Meeting Ruled Against Gang Killing Of Tough, Probe Told| newspaper =Schenectady Gazette| pages =1, 3| publisher =Associated Press| date =February 13, 1959| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pI5GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cekMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3749,1668608&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate =27 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the meeting was held to discuss various topics including loansharking, narcotics trafficking, and gambling, along with dividing the illegal operations controlled by the late [[Albert Anastasia]].&lt;ref name=5th&gt;{{cite news| title =Ex-Union Officers Take 5th On Mafia, Apalchin Meeting| newspaper =Meriden Record| location =| pages =1| publisher =Associated Press| date =July 2, 1958| url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vu1HAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5P8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6249,99836&amp;dq=apalachin+meeting&amp;hl=en| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;{{cite news|last=Blumenthal|first=Ralph|title=For Sale, a House WithAcreage.Connections Extra;Site of 1957 Gangland Raid Is Part of Auction on Saturday|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/nyregion/for-sale-house-with-acreage-connections-extra-site-1957-gangland-raid-part.html?src=pm|accessdate=2 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 100 [[Mafiosi]] from the United States, Italy, and Cuba are thought to have attended this meeting.&lt;ref name=Ralph/&gt; [[Vito Genovese]], then head of the renamed [[Genovese crime family|Genovese family]], initially called the meeting as a way to recognize his new power as ''[[Capo di tutti capi|capo dei capi]]''.

===Valachi hearings===
{{Main|Valachi hearings}}
In 1963, [[Joe Valachi]] became the first American Cosa Nostra member to provide a detailed look at the inside of the organization. Having been recruited by FBI special agents, and testifying before the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs|U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations]], Valachi exposed the name, structure, power bases, codes, swearing-in ceremony, and members of this organization. All of this had been secret up to this point.

===RICO Act===
The [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act), passed as part of the [[Organized Crime Control Act]] of 1970, made it a crime to belong to an organization that performed illegal acts. The [[witness protection program]] was also enhanced by the same legislation. Frequent use of the act began during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Charges of [[racketeering]] were successfully pressed against scores of mobsters, including three of New York's Godfathers, [[Anthony Corallo]], [[Carmine Persico]] and [[Philip Rastelli]] during the [[Mafia Commission Trial]] in 1985. Others like [[Anthony Salerno|Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno]], was thought of as the [[Genovese crime family|Genovese]] Godfather but was only a front-boss while Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] was murdered before the trial began. The act continues to be used to great effect today and has hurt the Mob severely.

===2011 indictments===
On January 20, 2011, the [[United States Justice Department]] issued 16 indictments against Northeast American Mafia families resulting in 127 charged defendants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/January/11-ag-077.html |title=91 Leaders, Members and Associates of La Cosa Nostra Families in Four Districts Charged with Racketeering and Related Crimes, Including Murder and Extortion |publisher=Justice.gov |date=2011-01-20 |accessdate=2011-01-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110126202500/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/January/11-ag-077.html| archivedate= 26 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than 110 arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore |first=Martha T. |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-01-20-mob-sweep_N.htm?csp=34news |title=Feds nab nearly 130 in Mafia crackdown |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges included murder, murder conspiracy, loansharking, arson, robbery, narcotics trafficking, extortion, illegal gambling and labor racketeering.

The release mentioned the 'New England LCN', but follow the article for [[Luigi Manocchio]] to see the Patriarca name&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The film ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932) is loosely based on the story of [[Al Capone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018323-scarface/ |title=Scarface |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, [[Paramount Pictures]] released the film ''[[The Brotherhood (1968 film)|The Brotherhood]]'' starring [[Kirk Douglas]] as a mafia don, which was a financial flop. Nevertheless, Paramount's production chief [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] subsidized the completion of a [[Mario Puzo]] novel with similar themes and plot elements, and bought the screen rights ''before'' completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2016/08/story-behind-godfather/|title=The Story Behind The Godfather|date=8 August 2016|website=Todayifoundout.com|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], ''[[The Godfather]]'' became a huge success, both critically and financially (it won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] and for a year was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film ever made]]). It immediately inspired other mafia-related films, including a direct sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), also (partly) based on [[The Godfather (novel)|Puzo's novel]], and yet another big winner at the [[47th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], as well as films based on real Mafiosi like ''[[Honor Thy Father]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luciano (film)|Lucky Luciano]]'' (both in 1973) and ''[[Lepke (film)|Lepke]]'' and ''[[Capone (film)|Capone]]'' (both in 1975). An ambitious 13-part miniseries by [[NBC]] called ''[[The Gangster Chronicles]]'' based on the rise of many major crime bosses of the 1920s and 1930s, aired in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto M.

{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[heraldry]], an '''armiger''' is a person entitled to use a [[heraldic achievement]] (e.g., bear arms, an "armour-bearer") either by hereditary right, grant, matriculation, or assumption of arms. Such a person is said to be '''armigerous'''.

==Etymology==
The Latin word ''armiger'' literally means "arms-bearer". In high and late medieval England, the word referred to an [[esquire]] attendant upon a [[knight]], but bearing his own unique armorial device. &lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Chivalry'', Uden. Kestrel Books, Harmondsworth, 1968. {{ISBN|0-7226-5372-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Armiger'' was also used as a Latin [[cognomen]], and is now found as a rare surname in English-speaking countries.

==Modern period==

Today, the term ''armiger'' is well-defined only within jurisdictions, such as [[Canada]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where [[heraldry]] is regulated by the state or a heraldic body, such as the [[College of Arms]], the [[Chief Herald of Canada]], the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] or the [[Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland]]. A person can be so entitled either by proven (and typically [[agnatic]]) descent from a person with a right to bear a [[heraldic achievement]], or by virtue of a grant of arms to himself. Merely sharing the same family name of an armiger is insufficient.

Most of the time, the usage of a heraldic achievement is governed by legal restrictions; these restrictions are independent of the copyright status and independent of a coat of arms depiction. A coat of arms represents its owner. Though it can be freely represented, it cannot be appropriated, or used in such a way as to create a confusion with or a prejudice to its owner.

In the [[Netherlands]], titles of nobility are regulated by law but heraldry is not. In [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] the nobility has had, since 1762, the prerogative to use an [[open helmet]], while others use a [[closed helmet]].

'''Bet van Beeren''' (12 February 1902—16 July 1967) was a flamboyant, legendary bar owner in Amsterdam. While hers wasn't the first bar that allowed LGBT persons to openly associate, the fact that she was openly [[lesbian]], and accepting of a very diverse clientele, led her establishment to be one of the most known. In 2017, she was honored by the city of Amsterdam when a canal bridge was renamed in her honor.

==Early life==
Elisabeth Maria van Beeren was born on 12 February 1902 in the [[Jordaan]] neighborhood of [[Amsterdam]] to Maria Johanna (née Brants) and Johannes Hendrik van Beeren. She was the oldest daughter and one of thirteen children of the couple. Her father worked in street construction and her mother ran a [[boarding house]] and delivered fish and vegetables by car around the neighborhood. Bet's education ended at middle school because her family needed her to work.{{sfn|Brand|2015}}

==Career==
Van Beeren went to work in a canning factory on Haarlemmerweg, quickly working her way up to foreman, but she didn't like the job and the work was dangerous. She lost two fingertips while working and after a fight with her boss, quit and went to work for her uncle at his pub, ''Amstelstroom'', where she had previously worked part-time.{{sfn|Brand|2015}}{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}} She also rode around town in leather clothing on her motorcycle and sold fish.{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}} In 1927, she bought the bar with loans from the [[Oranjeboom Brewery]] and thereafter, was always loyal to that brand of beer,{{sfn|Brand|2015}} though other breweries later tried to gain her patronage. It was very unusual for a woman to own a business at that time, especially on the rough [[seawall]] area where it was located.{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}} She renamed the pub, [[Café 't Mandje]] (The Basket Café) because her mother brought the food in every day in a basket.{{sfn|Brand|2015}}

Van Beeren ran an open establishment where lesbians and gays could freely associate as long as there was no kissing, which would have violated the vice laws and have cost her her liquor license.{{sfn|Brand|2015}}{{sfn|Mol|van den Heuij|van Laar|2016}} Her mixed clientele included artists, intellectuals, pimps and prostitutes, sailors, and Major Bosshardt, the disapproving head of the [[Salvation Army]].{{sfn|Brand|2015}}{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}}{{sfn|I Amsterdam Mediabank|2016}} Van Beeren was flamboyant, craving the spotlight, and often dressed in a sailor suit or leathers, entertaining her clients with singing and dancing. She was openly lesbian, though she could entertain wealthy men if it would put meat or pastries on her family table. She drank a lot, some reports were 40 bottles of beer a day, and could curse like a sailor.{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}}

Making a lot of money from the pub, van Beeren was known for her charitable works, helping the poor, children and the elderly. She also claimed to have paid for one of the crosses atop the [[Basilica of St. Nicholas, Amsterdam|Nicholaas Church]].{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}} Among her other legendary deeds, she allowed the bar to be used as an arms depot for the [[Dutch resistance]] during the [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]]. While homosexual men became targets of the Germans, van Beeren's pub was off-limits to German troops because of its reputation as a [[De Wallen|red-light district]] establishment.{{sfn|Schuyf|2013|p=542}} The use of the term ''owl'' for heterosexuals has been attributed to a device van Beeren used when the bar was being raided or when homophobic patrols were sweeping the area. She had a light installed in a plaster owl, which was lit to warn her customers.{{sfn|''Het Parool''|2017}}{{sfn|van Gemert|Verbraeck|1994|p=162}} She hung neckties and souvenirs from patrons from the ceiling, held dances on [[Queen's Day]] where same sex couples could dance together, and on Fridays would let the Salvation Army band come in to raise funds for charity.{{sfn|Lakeman|2008}}

==Death and legacy==
Van Beeren died of liver disease on 16 July 1967. She laid in state on the billiard table of the pub for several days before her burial on 20 July at the Nieuwe Oosterbegraafplaats in Amsterdam. Greet, van Beeren's younger sister, continued to operate the business until 1982, when she closed it because of the heroin trade expansion in the area. Some of the items from the bar were incorporated into the [[Amsterdam Museum]] in 1998, but for the most part, the building remained untouched until Greet, shortly before her death, sold it to her niece, Diana van Laar. Van Laar completed a renovation of the pub and reopened it on 2 April 2008.{{sfn|Brand|2015}} In 2017, a  bridge spanning the {{ill|Oudezijds Achterburgwal|nl}} canal between the Korte Stormsteeg and Korte Niezel streets was renamed on the pub's 90th anniversary to honor van Beeren in a symbolic representation of her building bridges in the community between diverse groups.{{sfn|''AT5''|2017}}

The '''British school of diffusionism''' was an [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] movement which believed [[ancient Egypt]] was the source of all human culture. According to this school of thought culture cannot have its origin in every parts of the world. According to them, it is only the ancient Egypt where there is favorable conditions for the origin of the culture. Hence, the British school of thought that accepts that Egypt is the place of the origin of all cultures is called "Pan Egyptian Theory".

The '''''Carry On''''' series primarily consists of 31 British comedy motion pictures (1958–92), four [[Carry On Christmas Specials|Christmas specials]], a [[Carry On Laughing|television series]] of thirteen episodes, and three [[West End of London|West End]] and provincial stage plays. The films' humour was in the British comic tradition of the [[music hall]] and bawdy [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]]s. Producer [[Peter Rogers]] and director [[Gerald Thomas]] drew on a regular group of actors, the [[List of Carry On films cast members|Carry On team]], that included [[Sid James]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]], [[Joan Sims]], [[Kenneth Connor]], [[Peter Butterworth]], [[Hattie Jacques]], [[Terry Scott]], [[Bernard Bresslaw]], [[Barbara Windsor]], [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]], and [[Jim Dale]].

The ''Carry On'' series contains the largest number of films of any British series, and it is the longest continually running UK film series, although with a fourteen-year break (1978–92). [[Anglo-Amalgamated|Anglo Amalgamated Film Distributors Ltd]] produced twelve films (1958–66), [[the Rank Organisation]] made eighteen (1966–78) and [[United International Pictures]] made one (1992).

Producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas made all 31 films, usually on time and to a strict budget, and often employed the same crew. Between 1958 and 1992, the series employed seven writers, most often [[Norman Hudis]] (1958–62) and [[Talbot Rothwell]] (1963–74). In between the films, Rogers and Thomas produced four Christmas specials in 1969, 1970, 1972, and 1973, a thirteen episode television series in 1975, and various [[West End theatre|West End stage shows]] which later toured the regions.

All the films were made at [[Pinewood Studios]] near [[Iver|Iver Heath]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. Budgetary constraints meant that a large proportion of the location filming was undertaken close to the studios in and around south Buckinghamshire, including areas of [[Berkshire]] and [[Middlesex]]. However, by the late 1960s (at the height of the series' success) more ambitious plots occasionally necessitated locations further afield, which included [[Snowdonia#Snowdonia National Park|Snowdonia National Park]], Wales, (with the foot of [[Snowdon|Mount Snowdon]] standing in for the [[Khyber Pass]] in ''[[Carry On Up the Khyber]]''), and the beaches of the [[Sussex]] coast doubling as Saharan sand dunes in ''[[Follow That Camel]]''.

==Background==
''[[Carry On Sergeant]]'' (1958) was about a group of recruits doing [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]]; its title, the command commonly issued by army officers to their sergeants in the course of their routine duties, was in keeping with its setting. The film was sufficiently successful to inspire a similar venture, again focusing on an established and respected profession in ''[[Carry On Nurse]]''. When that too was successful, further forays with ''[[Carry On Teacher]]'' and ''[[Carry On Constable]]'' established the series. This initial 'pattern' was broken with the fifth film in 1961, ''[[Carry On Regardless]]'', but it still followed a similar plot to that of many of the early films—a small group of misfit newcomers to a job make comic mistakes, but come together to succeed in the end.

The remainder of the series developed with increased use of the British comic traditions of [[music hall]] and bawdy [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]]s. Many titles parodied more serious films, such as their tongue-in-cheek homages to James Bond (''[[Carry On Spying|Spying]]''), westerns (''[[Carry On Cowboy|Cowboy]]''), and [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer]] horror films (''[[Carry On Screaming!|Screaming!]]''). The most impressive of these was ''[[Carry On Cleo]]'' (1964), after the [[Richard Burton|Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor|Taylor]] epic ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963),&lt;!-- Mainly shot in Rome, the British sets were abandoned. --&gt; where the budget-conscious ''Carry On'' team made full use of some impressive sets which had been intended for that film. ''[[Carry On Emmannuelle]]'', inspired by the soft-porn ''[[Emmanuelle]]'', brought to an end the original 'run'.

The stock-in-trade of ''Carry On'' humour was [[innuendo]] and the sending-up of British institutions and customs, such as the [[National Health Service]] (''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', ''Again Doctor'', ''Matron'' and the [[#Carry On Again Nurse|proposed]] ''Again Nurse''), the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] (''[[Carry On Henry|Henry]]''), the [[British Empire|Empire]] (''[[Carry On Up the Khyber|Up the Khyber]]''), the armed forces (''[[Carry On Sergeant|Sergeant]]'', ''[[Carry On England|England]]'', ''[[Carry On Jack|Jack]]'' and the [[#Unmade films|proposed]] ''Flying'' and ''Escaping''), the police (''[[Carry On Constable|Constable]]'') and the [[trade union]]s (''[[Carry On at Your Convenience|At Your Convenience]]'') as well as camping (''[[Carry On Camping|Camping]]''), foreign holidays (''[[Carry On Cruising|Cruising]]'', ''[[Carry On Abroad|Abroad]]''), [[Beauty pageant|beauty contests]] (''[[Carry On Girls|Girls]]''), [[Caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]] holidays (''[[Carry On Behind|Behind]]''), and the education system (''[[Carry On Teacher|Teacher]]'') amongst others. Although the films were very often panned by critics, they mostly proved very popular with audiences.&lt;ref name="More than just a Carry On"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7525258.stm |title=More than just a Carry On? |publisher=BBC News |date=25 July 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/may/15/comment.features |title=What a Carry On! |work=The Guardian |date= 15 May 2004|accessdate=12 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook |first=William |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/03/stop_carry_ons.html |title=Film Blog: Stop Carry Ons |publisher=Blogs.guardian.co.uk |date=18 March 2008 |accessdate=12 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tanya Gold |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/17/gender.filmnews |title=Infamy?

A film had appeared in 1957 under the title ''[[Carry On Admiral]]''; although this was a comedy in similar vein (and even featured Joan Sims in the cast) it has no connection to the ''Carry On'' series itself. The much earlier 1937 film ''[[Carry On London]]'' is also unrelated (though it coincidentally starred future ''Carry On'' performer [[Eric Barker]]).

The cast were poorly paid—around £5,000 per film for a principal performer.&lt;ref name="unseen"&gt;''Kenneth Williams Unseen'' by Wes Butters and Russell Davies, HarperCollins 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In his diaries, Kenneth Williams lamented this, and criticised several of the movies despite his declared fondness for the series as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kenneth Williams Diaries'' edited by Russell Davies, HarperCollins 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Rogers, the series' producer, acknowledged: "Kenneth was worth taking care of, because while he cost very little &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; he made a very great deal of money for the franchise."&lt;ref name="unseen"/&gt;

===Unmade films===
Several other films were planned, scripted (or partly scripted) or entered [[pre-production]] before being abandoned:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Carry Ons: Scenes That Never Made it to the Screen|author=Morris Bright and Robert Ross|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2000|isbn=1-85227-990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Carry on Companion|author=Robert Ross|publisher=Batsford|year=2002|isbn=0-7134-8771-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete A-Z of Everything Carry On|author=Richard Webber|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|isbn=0-00-718223-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''What a Carry On...'', 1961
* ''Carry On Smoking'', 1961. The story revolved around a fire station, and various attempts to train a bungling group of new recruits.
* ''Carry On Spaceman'', 1961 and again in 1962. See section below.
* ''Carry On Flying'', 1962. Scripted by Norman Hudis, about a group of [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] recruits. It got as far as pre-production before being abandoned. [[Jim Dale]] was to have a starring role.
* ''Carry On Robin'', 1965. A planned spoof of [[Robin Hood]] starring the "Carry On regulars"  was outlined by Rogers and registered with the British Film Producers Association but never pursued.&lt;ref name="50years"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Years of Carry On|page=188|author=Richard Webber|publisher=Random House|year=2009|isbn=0099490072}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Carry On Again Nurse'', 1967 and two other attempts. See section below ↓.
* ''Carry On Escaping'', 1973. Scripted by Talbot Rothwell, a spoof of World War II escape films. The complete script was included in the book ''The Complete A-Z of Everything Carry On''.
* ''Carry on Dallas'', 1980. A planned spoof of the popular US series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. A script was written and casting offers made to Williams, Connor, Douglas, Sims, Hawtrey and Dale. The production was abandoned when [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar Productions]] demanded a [[Royalty payment|royalty fee]] of 20 times the total production budget.
* ''Carry On Down Under'', 1981. Gerald Thomas did some location scouting while on holiday in Australia and spoke to the [[Australian Film Commission]]. The production was abandoned when finance fell through. A complete script was written by [[Vince Powell]] and is included in the book ''Fifty Years of Carry On''.

==== ''Carry On Spaceman'' ====
''Carry On Spaceman'' was to be released shortly after ''[[Carry On Regardless]]'', in 1961. It was scripted by [[Norman Hudis]], and was to satirise interests in the [[Space Race]] from the Western world's point of view. The cast was to consist of three would-be [[astronaut]]s who constantly bungled on their training and their mission into outer space – most likely the trio would have been played by the trinity of [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Kenneth Connor]], and [[Leslie Phillips]] that had been established in ''[[Carry On Constable]]''.

Attempts to revive ''Carry On Spaceman'' in 1962 under [[Denis Gifford]], again by Hudis, failed, and the project was subsequently abandoned.

==== ''Carry On Again Nurse'' ====
Three scripts were written for an intended sub-sequel to the successful ''[[Carry On Nurse]]'', the second instalment of the ''Carry On'' series. The first film was renamed, and the other two never made.

The first intended ''Carry On Again Nurse'' was made in 1967, but released as ''[[Carry On Doctor]]''.&lt;ref name="50years"/&gt; ''Carry On Nurse'' was alluded to twice in ''Carry On Doctor'', firstly with the sub-titles (one reading ''Nurse Carries On Again'' and ''Death of a Daffodil''), and again in a later scene with [[Frankie Howerd]] commenting on a vase of daffodils in his ward.

A second attempt at ''Carry On Again Nurse'' came in 1979, after the series left Rank Films and moved to Hemdale. A completed script had been written by [[George Layton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgelayton.co.uk/biog.html#film|title=Welcome to George Layton`s Official Website|author=George Layton|work=georgelayton.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in 1977. It was cancelled due to the financial loss of '' [[Carry On Emmannuelle]]''.

The final attempt to create ''Carry On Again Nurse'' came in 1988, with a script written by [[Norman Hudis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEXpFWr_zgEC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=%22carry+on+again+nurse%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Iy8sQcbs5r&amp;sig=fKgcKgLhcAOI0qTmQ-hTCKLHwCk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fp2YUozJGdSjhgej_oAI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carry+on+again+nurse%22&amp;f=false|title=Fifty Years Of Carry On|first=Richard|last=Webber|page=186|date=31 March 2011|publisher=Random House|accessdate=23 October 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to revolve around a hospital set for closure, and set to star original actors [[Barbara Windsor]], [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]], [[Kenneth Williams]], [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]], [[Kenneth Connor]] and [[Joan Sims]], with Sims filling in the role of matron that was previously held by [[Hattie Jacques]]. The end of the film was going to be a tribute to Jacques, with Sims turning around a photograph of the actress and asking "Well, did I do alright?" (the script is included in the book ''The Lost Carry Ons''). Production was scheduled to begin in June 1988, but the deaths of Williams and Hawtrey (in April and October 1988 respectively), combined with a budget of £1.5 million which was deemed too expensive, proved to be the end of the film and it was cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0801330/bio|title=Joan Sims|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== ''Carry On London'' ====
A new film, ''Carry On London'', was announced in 2003 by producer [[Peter Rogers]] and producer James Black but remained in pre-production well into 2008. The script was signed off by the production company in late March 2008, and "centred on a limousine company ferrying celebrities to an awards show."&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7292810.stm |title=Carry On script gets green light  |accessdate=13 March 2008|work=BBC News | date=13 March 2008 |first=Genevieve |last=Hassan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had several false starts, with the producers and cast changing extensively over time. Only the rather unknown Welsh actress [[Jynine James]] remained a consistent name from 2003 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/3094158.stm |title=From Convent to Carry On |publisher=BBC News |date=10 September 2003 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danniella Westbrook]], [[David Jason]], [[Shaun Williamson]] and [[Burt Reynolds]] were also once attached to the project. In May 2006 it was announced [[Vinnie Jones]] and [[Shane Richie]] were to star in the film, which was to be directed by [[Peter Richardson (British director)|Peter Richardson]], though [[Ed Bye]] later replaced him as the named director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| coauthors =| title =Vinnie Jones in new Carry On film | work =| pages =| language =| publisher =BBC| date =16 May 2006| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4987704.stm| accessdate =21 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 50th anniversary party held at Pinewood Studios in March 2008, Peter Rogers confirmed that he was planning a series of ''Carry On'' films after ''London'', subject to the success of the first.

In early 2009, ''Carry On London'' or ''Carry On Bananas'' was once again 'back on', with [[Charlie Higson]] attached as director, and a different more modern cast list involving [[Paul O'Grady]] (as the acidic Kenneth Williamsesque character), [[Jynine James]], [[Lenny Henry]], [[Justin Lee Collins]], [[Jennifer Ellison]] (as the saucy [[Barbara Windsor]] type), [[Liza Tarbuck]] (Hattie Jacques), [[Meera Syal]], [[James Dreyfus]], and [[Frank Skinner]] (filling in the [[Sid James]] role). Despite new media interest and sets being constructed at Pinewood film studios, the film once again was put on hold, and the project was shelved after the death of Peter Rogers in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8000111.stm "'Carry On' producer Rogers dies"], ''BBC News'', 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reboot  ====
In May 2016, producer [[Jonathan Sothcott]] of Hereford Films announced plans for a new series of ''Carry On'' films, beginning with ''Carry On Doctors'' and ''Carry On Campus''. As of early 2017, no news had surfaced on if the planned reboot is still going ahead. On 12 April 2017, Sothcott confirmed to thehollywoodnews that he is no longer involved with the film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2017/04/12/jonathan-sothcott-interview/|title=Exclusive Interview: Jonathan Sothcott for We Still Steal The Old Way|first=Paul|last=Heath|date=12 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barraclough |first=Leo |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/global/carry-on-comedy-movie-revived-1201775752/ |title=‘Carry On' Comedy Movie Series to Be Revived |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=16 May 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritman |first=Alex |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/british-carry-producer-at-center-897760 |title=British 'Carry On' Producer at Center of Series of Fraud Allegations |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=30 May 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music For Pleasure]] released a long playing record, ''Oh! What a Carry On!'' (MFP MONO 1416), featuring songs performed by Kenneth Williams, Jim Dale, Kenneth Connor, Frankie Howerd, Bernard Bresslaw, Joan Sims, Barbara Windsor, and [[Dora Bryan]].

==Documentaries==
A 50-minute television documentary, ''What's a Carry On?'', was made in 1998 for the 40th anniversary of the first film. It included archive clips, out-takes and interviews with surviving cast members. It was included as an extra on the DVD release of ''Carry On Emmannuelle''.

In November 2003 a T.V. series called Popcorn ran a ''Carry On'' Special documentary and interviews on [[S4C]] featuring [[Jynine James]]. This was in respect of a new ''Carry On'' film being produced by Peter Rogers called Carry On London. It featured interviews and clips of the past ''Carry On'' films and went into detail about the new film and cast. However, despite the script being signed off and sets constructed at Pinewood film studios, the project was shelved, owing to the untimely death of producer Peter Rogers.

A two-hour radio documentary ''Carry On Forever!'', presented by [[Leslie Phillips]], was broadcast in two parts on [[BBC Radio 2]] in two parts on 19–20 July 2010. A three-part television retrospective with the same title, narrated by [[Martin Clunes]], was shown on [[ITV3]] in the UK over Easter 2015.

The success of the ''Carry On'' series occasionally led to affectionate parodies of the series by other contemporary comedians:

'''Chairman Mao badge''' ({{zh|c=毛主席像章|p=Máo zhǔxí xiàngzhāng}}) is the name given to a type of [[Badge|pin badge]] displaying an image of [[Mao Zedong]] that was ubiquitous in the [[People's Republic of China]] during the active phase of the [[Cultural Revolution]], from 1966 to 1971. The term is also used for badges associated with Mao that do not actually have a picture of him on them. Chairman Mao badges were, together with the "[[Quotations from Chairman Mao|little red book]]", one of the most visible and iconic manifestations of the [[:zh:毛澤東崇拜|Cult of Mao]].  It is estimated that several billion Chairman Mao badges were produced during the period of the Cultural Revolution.

==History==

Badges depicting Mao Zedong first appeared at the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political College (中国人民抗日军事政治大学) at [[Yan'an]] during the 1930s. These early badges were homemade, usually being constructed out of the metal from used toothpaste tubes.&lt;ref name="wang-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s badges showing Mao by himself or together with other important people were being produced in small numbers as commemorative medals or as awards for service to the [[Communist Party of China|communist party]] or to the [[People's Liberation Army|army]].&lt;ref name="wang-4"/&gt; Unlike the later Cultural Revolution period badges, which normally portrayed Mao by himself, these badges frequently portrayed Mao side by side with other Chinese revolutionary figures such as [[Zhu De]], [[Chen Yi (communist)|Chen Yi]], [[He Long]], [[Lin Biao]] and [[Lu Xun]], or showed Mao with communist leaders from other countries, such as [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Kim Il Sung]]. During this period badges were smaller but more robust than the Cultural Revolution period badges, and some badges produced during the 1950s were even made of gold (initially 22 [[Carat (purity)|carat]], but later reduced to 13 or 14 carat).&lt;ref name="wang-5"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, and throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, badges showing an image of Mao were produced mainly for special occasions, for example Chinese soldiers were given star-shaped badges with a portrait of Mao when they returned to China from the [[Korean War]], and labourers working on the [[Sichuan-Tibet Highway]] were given gold-plated copper badges with a bilingual inscription in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] on completion of the road in December 1954.&lt;ref name="wang-5"/&gt;  By the mid-1960s Mao badges began to become more prevalent, and were even distributed at international events such as the 1965 [[Leipzig Trade Fair]], but it was not until the end of 1965 that small aluminium Mao badges, similar to the Cultural revolution period badges, first started to be produced in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="wang-5"/&gt;

Mao badges exploded in popularity with the launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Almost overnight the function of Mao badges changed completely: what had previously been largely commemorative or ceremonial items worn by a comparative few suddenly became required symbols of loyalty to Mao worn by almost everyone. Along with the "little red books" of Mao's sayings, badges with a portrait of Mao become essential indicators of the wearer's loyalty to Mao, worn on the left side just above the heart. Bigger badges indicated a greater degree of loyalty to Mao, and some even pinned the badges directly into their skin as an extreme indication of their loyalty. Conversely, members of the landowning class and reactionaries were not allowed to wear Mao badges, and the conspicuous lack of a Mao badge marked them out as [[enemies of the people]].&lt;ref name="wang-3"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution few ordinary people wore Mao badges in the ordinary course of their daily life, and although production of badges in Shanghai increased steadily from 32,000 in July 1966 to 175,000 the following month,&lt;ref name="wang-19"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was only when Mao was presented with some Mao badges by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] at a mass rally at [[Tiananmen Square]] on 18 August 1966 that the wearing of these badges became widespread.&lt;ref name="wang-19"/&gt; In September 1966 production of Mao badges in Shanghai soared to 1.3 million,&lt;ref name="wang-19"/&gt; and during the height of the Cultural Revolution, from 1968 to 1971, an estimated total of between 2 and 5 billion Chairman Mao badges were produced throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schrift|2001|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges were primarily distributed to workers, students and soldiers by their [[work unit]]s, and they were not widely available for purchase at shops.&lt;ref name="wang-20"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges were further distributed by trading between friends or on the [[black market]], and by being given as gifts.&lt;ref name="wang-20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Wang]] and Paul Crook, [https://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/chinablog/mao-badges-red-bright-shiny-open-every-form-capitalist-speculation/ "Red, bright and shiny (and open to every kind of capitalist speculation"], in LARB China Blog, 25 May 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;

The high tide of Mao badge mania was reached in April 1969, during the 9th [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China]], when huge numbers of Mao badges were produced for distribution at the congress.&lt;ref name="wang-21"&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast quantities of aluminium being used was having serious repercussions on Chinese industry, causing Mao to demand "Give me back the airplanes" (还我飞机), and in June 1969 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] issued a document forbidding the production of any more Mao badges unless specially authorized.&lt;ref name="wang-21"/&gt; After the death of Lin Biao in September 1971, the wearing of Mao badges declined rapidly, and few people outside rural areas wore Mao badges in public during the latter part of the Cultural Revolution, from 1972 to 1976.&lt;ref name="wang-21"/&gt; After the fall of the [[Gang of Four]] in October 1976, a month after the death of Mao, work units started to organize the collection and recycling of Mao badges, although many people secretly held on to their badges.&lt;ref name="wang-21"/&gt;

==Description of badges==
[[File:Mao Porcelain Badge.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Porcelain badge depicting a young Mao at [[Yan'an]], the portrait based on a photograph taken in 1935.]]
The typical Chairman Mao badges of the Cultural Revolution period were made from an [[aluminium]] base, either coloured gold or left silver, covered with a red plastic pattern, to produce a red and gold or a red and silver design. Other colours were also used sometimes, such as yellow for a field of sunflowers as a background to Mao. In addition to the typical aluminium and plastic badges, badges were also made in other materials, such as porcelain, bamboo, perspex and plastic, but these made up only a tiny fraction of the total number of badges produced.
The vast majority of designs have the same profile image of Mao, coloured gold or silver, always looking to the left. The central image of Mao is usually set in a red background, which may be plain or patterned, with or without a border design, and with or without an inscription. Inscriptions vary from a single character (most commonly 忠 ''zhōng'' meaning "loyalty") to quotations from Mao or lines of his poetry, or simply slogans such as "the [[Revolutionary committee (China)|Revolutionary Committee]] is good" (革命委员会好).

Most badges have an inscription on the reverse, which often recorded where the badge was made and, if appropriate, what special occasion it commemorated. In addition the reverse may also feature a revolutionary slogan, a quotation from Mao, or respectful wishes for long life to Chairman Mao. Thus each obverse design may have hundreds of different varieties with different reverse inscriptions, being produced in different parts of the country or to commemorate different events.

==Classification of badges==
The British Museum catalogue of Chairman Mao badges classifies the obverse designs of Mao badges from the Cultural Revolution period as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

Even during the Cultural Revolution, Mao badges were extensively collected, traded and given as gifts. However it is unlikely that anyone was able to match the collection of Mao badges that [[Ye Qun]], wife of Lin Biao, managed to put together at the start of the Mao badge craze. She collected several thousand different types of Mao badge to give to Mao on his 73rd birthday on 26 December 1966, although she was unable to achieve the symbolic target of [[Ten thousand years|ten thousand]] badges that she was hoping for.&lt;ref name="wang-19"/&gt;

After the end of the Cultural Revolution upon Mao's death in September 1976, Mao badges were meant to be handed in for recycling, but many or most remained in private ownership. From the mid-1980s Mao memorabilia became very collectible, and Mao badges could be bought at [[flea market]]s across China. There are now many private collectors of Chairman Mao badges in China, with the most prolific collectors accumulating tens of thousands of specimens. Wang Anting (王安廷)  from [[Chengdu]], had a collection of more than 50,000 badges by 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schrift|2001|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 Lin Yizhou (林意洲)  was reported to have amassed a collection of more than 200,000 badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Zhongshan Ribao (中山日报) | title=林意洲20年收藏20多万枚毛主席像章 | date=8 December 2006 | url=http://www.cangdian.com/Doc/CangNews/html/061208104958.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106214936/http://www.cangdian.com/Doc/CangNews/html/061208104958.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=6 January 2007 | accessdate=2010-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jianchuan Museum]] in China has a vast collection of Cultural Revolution material. Outside of China, some museums have started to acquire collections of objects relating to Chairman Mao, including badges, and the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] has a modest but well-catalogued collection of nearly 350 Chairman Mao badges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2008|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In museums===
Outside of China, there are private and public collections of Mao badges: at the [[British Museum]] (London, UK), at the [[Kulturen]] Museum (Lund, Sweden),&lt;ref&gt;Collection of about 2300 badges, donated by Sinologist Michael Schoenhals.http://prchistory.org/june-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Revolution: Art and Literacy during China's Cultural Revolution", exhibition and catalogue by Jennifer Purtle and Elizabeth Rodolfo, with the contribution of Stephen Qiao, [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]], University of Toronto, 2016, {{ISBN|978-0-7727-6119-4}} - based on the Mark Gayn and Suzanne Gayn Collection.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see Amy Jane Barnes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The '''Corps Hubertia Freiburg''' is a fraternity (''[[Studentenverbindung]]'') in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. It was founded on October 29, 1868 and is one of 162 [[German Student Corps]] in Europe today. The Corps is a member of the [[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband]] (KSCV), the oldest federation of classical European [[Corporation (university)|fraternal corporations]] with roots dating back to the 15th century and member fraternities across Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Latvia and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="interessenten"&gt;Die Corps. "Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?" 
http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2c" /&gt;

Membership to the fraternity is open to [[Honour|honorable]] men&lt;ref name="duel" /&gt; studying at one of [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]]'s [[University|universities]] and based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;Die Corps. "Prinzipien der Corps" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freiburg.de/pb/,Lde/231163.html Freiburger Hochschulen]&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Corps Hubertia value and engage in the tradition of [[Mensur|academic fencing]] duels as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Hubertia's members wear the traditional [[Couleur]], colored stripes, in green-gold-black. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, stemming from diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lit_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2" /&gt; Hubertia's members are often referred to as ''Huberten''.

Members of the fraternity controlled the forestry departments of [[Baden-Württemberg|Baden]], the south-west of Germany, in a de facto monopoly from the late 1800s to the early 20th century. Many of the members today practice this heritage as passionate [[hunting|hunters]] in private and fraternity events.

== Fundamentals and Principles ==
Like all [[German Student Corps|Corps]], Hubertia expects and practices tolerance in [[German Student Corps#Politics|political]], [[German Student Corps#Sciences|scientific]] and religious affairs.

Members of the Corps Hubertia value and practice the tradition of [[Mensur|academic fencing]] duels, or ''"[[Mensur]]"'' in German, with members of other proper fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the [[German school of fencing]], is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing the corps member to show his determination by standing one's ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the corps brothers at the same time.&lt;ref name="fechten"&gt;Die Corps. "Hoch bitte – Los!" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt;

Hubertia's members identify themselves wearing the traditional [[Couleur]], colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition known as "wearing colors" (German: ''Farben tragen'') provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the corps brothers with each other and their traditions.

Members are encouraged to have their own world view and be able to argue it; but Hubertia as such always remains neutral. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (''Rezeption'').

The fraternity has approximately 255 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or residing in Austria, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, France, Germany, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. Every full member is member for life.&lt;ref name="principles" /&gt;

Hubertia's members value nature, and the manifold ways to experience her. Enjoyed in good company and providing a benevolent [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], hunting is tradition and it provides means to spend time among Corps Brothers of high standard.

{{Quote|The &lt;B&gt;object and purpose of the Corps&lt;/B&gt; was and still is solely the education of students to become a strong, free and cosmopolitan personality who is not held back by religious, racist, national, scientific or philosophical limitations of the mind. Three primary institutions within the fraternity aid with achieving this aim; including the &lt;B&gt;Corpsconvent&lt;/B&gt; [regular council meetings of the Corps Brothers], the &lt;B&gt;Kneipe&lt;/B&gt;  [celebratory get-together of Corps Brothers with speeches, beer and songs], and today's &lt;B&gt;Bestimmungsmensur&lt;/B&gt;  [the event of academic fencing with sharp blades for the first or one of the first times], where the ones to fence are chosen on the basis of placing two equal opponents in front of each other. [...] This experience, and the intertwined need to overcome one's own fear, dedicated to the union of his Corps, and the connected strengthening of the sense of community aids the personal growth just as does taking a hit without losing one's stand and accepting the assessment of the &lt;B&gt;Mensur&lt;/B&gt;  by the own Corps Brothers.|[[:de:Hermann Rink]]&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Rink: ''Die Mensur, ein wesentliches Merkmal des Verbandes.'' In: Rolf-Joachim Baum (Hg.), ''„Wir wollen Männer, wir wollen Taten!“ Deutsche Corpsstudenten 1848 bis heute''. Siedler Verlag, Berlin 1998, ISBN 3-88680-653-7, S. 383 f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Fraternity Couleur and Slogan ==
[[File:Hubertia Freiburg Programm 145 Stiftungsfest.png|thumb|Hubertia's colors winding around the invitation to the 145th anniversary.]]
Hubertia defined its fraternity [[Couleur|colors]] ''green-gold-black'' on February 7, 1897. These colors are worn in the form a [[Couleur#Ribbon|ribbon]] with a golden percussion (rim)  diagonally across the chest, as it is typical for European fraternities. The common fraternity [[Couleur#Cap|cap]] is the green [[Couleur#Cap|''Tellermütze'']] or the more traditional [[Couleur#Stürmer|Stürmer]] in dark-green. The freshly admitted (pledging "fox") members wear the two-colored ribbon in green-and-gold. To official fraternity events, some members might additionally wear a traditional green jacket, an adapted version of the contemporary [[United States Chief Foresters|chief forester]]'s jacket typical for the [[Alsace|Elsass]], a former German region bordering France. This jacket is then combined with a [[Hunting dagger|Hirschfänger]], a specific style of hunting dagger, on the side.

The [[Slogan]] ''[[Unity makes strength|Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur]]'' (concord will make small things flourish, discord will destroy even the greatest) was adapted on August 23, 1870.&lt;ref name="concordia"&gt;The full quotation is "nam concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur" - concord will make small things flourish, discord will destroy great things. It also appears in [[Seneca the Younger]]'s ''Letters to Lucilius'' (XCIV, 46).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German „Durch Eintracht wachsen kleine Dinge, durch Zwietracht zerfallen die größten.“&lt;/ref&gt; It still defines the fraternity members' association with each other and the way things are managed inside, as well as outside the fraternity, today.

== History ==
{{Further|German Student Corps|List of members of German student corps|Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband}}

=== Origins in Karlsruhe ===
[[File:Karlsruhe 00315u.jpg|thumb|left|Karlsruhe around 1900]]
Hubertia was founded on Oktober 29, 1868 als association among students of forestry at the university Polytechnikum der Forstschule [[Karlsruhe]]. The colors ''green-gold-black'' were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles, and initially were not yet worn openly. The slogan ''Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia maximae dilabuntur'' (understood as "strength through unity") was defined in 1870, influencing the fraternities members' connections up to this day. Then, on Oktober 18, 1874, the fraternity was openened up to students outside of forestry and [[Couleur]] became part of every Corps brother's daily routine on Juni 7, 1875. Shortly after that, a local fencing club was established at the fraternity's location in 1876.

[[File:SchlägerOvBMuseumFriedrichsruh.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by Hubertia's members then and now.]]
The so-called ''compulsory satisfaction'', meaning everyone's duty to keep or regain one's honor in a fencing duel with sharp blades if challenged, became part of the fraternity's charter in 1886 and every member's tradition.&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;Chr. Wehle (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; This step further intensified the number and quality of academic fencing duels of Hubertia's fraternity members.

When the department of forestry moved from [[Karlsruhe]] to [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Hubertia settled in Freiburg and became [[German Student Corps|Corps]] on November 27, 1920. After a short acquaintance period with the other SC-Corps in Freiburg, the Corps Hubertia became a full member of the Freiburg's league of corps (SC) on February 2, 1921.&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;P. Gladen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hubertia in Freiburg ===
Hubertia had 14 student members in Summer of 1920, a large number at that time, especially considering that they were all forestry students as all other members had to remain in Karlsruhe for the time being, as their departments had not moved and switching universities was a complicated procedure. The first weeks in Freiburg were filled with establishing regular meetings to celebrate or fence. Official fencing relationships, so-called ''Paukverhältnisse'', were established with the other local Corps in Freiburg's league of corps (SC) and the fraternity ''Turnerschaft Markomanno-Albertia''. Establishing this fencing relationship allowing regular fencing practice and duels to take place was back then the common procedure for a Corps to become a member of the local League of Corps at a university location, a tradition that has not changed to this day. This step was supported by the [[:de:Corps Rhenania Freiburg]]&lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt; and [[Corps Suevia Freiburg]] who were hoping to increase the number of students from [[Baden]] (lower Germany) to counteract the rising number of students from the north of Germany in Freiburg's fraternity landscape.

[[File:Universität Freiburg Kollegiengebäude I (Altbau).jpg|Kollegiengebäude in Freiburg|thumb|College building of Freiburg's University]]
The fraternity's alumni convention, ''Alte Herren Vereinigung'' in German, granted the student members' convention ([[:de:Convent (Studentenverbindung)#Corps|Corpsburschen-Convent]]&lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt;), to file an application to enter Freiburg's League of Corps ([[:de:Senioren-Convent (Hochschule)|SC]]&lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt;). Following a short period of joint gatherings and duels in academic fencing with Freiburg's other Corps as well as an inspection of Hubertia's statutes, Corps Rhenania officially requested for Corps Hubertia to become an official member of the local SC on February 2, 1921. Culminating in a grand ceremony, Hubertia thus had, 53 years after her inception, become a full member Corps of the [[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband]] (KSCV).

=== The Culture Struggle in Baden with Hubertia in the middle of it ===
{{Further|Grand Duchy of Baden|Kulturkampf|Culture struggle|Republic of Baden}}

Members of dueling fraternities (fraternities practicing academic fencing) were highly respected during the time of the [[German Empire]],&lt;ref name="lit_2b" /&gt; 1871 to 1918, both in general terms as well as holding public offices. This started to change slowly during times for the [[Weimar Republic]], 1918 to 1933, even in local forestry departments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademikerverbaende.de/files/stuhita_einladung_2012.pdf Vortragsankündigung M. Neuhaus 2012] ([[:de:Arbeitskreis der Studentenhistoriker]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Neuhaus (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The finance minister of [[Baden]], [[:de:Heinrich Köhler (badischer Politiker)|Heinrich Köhler]], a politician belonging to the [[:de:Deutsche Zentrumspartei|Deutschen Zentrumspartei (German Central Party)]], demanded openly in the state senate that ''"Hubertia's members are to be extinct in Baden's state forestry duties and minteries"''.&lt;ref name="CW" /&gt;

{{Quote|We need to change the current forestry establishment using an iron fist. The central government seems factually and personally ossified, driven by state arrogance and with alumni members of the fraternity "Hubertia" calling the shots, untouchable now as then, and monopolizing the general direction the state is taking. Everywhere from local to state levels having the alumni of this fraternity ensured their ability to prevent outsiders from marginalizing them.|Heinrich Köhler&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;J. Becker (1969), S. 106 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In 1920, 118 of the 227 of Hubertia's living members were men in forestry (~1/2). Of these 118, 83 held a state or private forestry office in the area of what is [[Baden-Württemberg]] today, formed by combining the former states [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]] during the post-war area in 1952. Hence, as there were roughly 240 forestry offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg in 1920, Hubertia had members managing about 1/3 of all the forestry offices in today's state borders. Köhler wanted to minimize this high number of Huberten[s].&lt;ref name="JB" /&gt; His first step was to establish a so-called ''[[Numerus clausus]]'' for forestry in Freiburg and determined personally about a prospective student's admission in person. During the following ten years, Köhler's selection had its effect on Hubertia's influence: While the fraternity provided 37 prospective forestry officers in 1920, the number fell to only six in 1938.

[[File:Karte Entstehung der Corps.png|thumb|Emergence and development of the [[German Student Corps]] in Europe. &lt;br&gt; Distributed over a wide range of religious and political backgrounds, the Corps always remained neutral and expected tolerance.]]
As this so-called culture fight was originally one between Catholics and more Protestant, Bismark-oriented and Prussia-friendly group of people, Hubertia was caught in the middle. Becker was a politician of the catholic Centrum party and openly voiced that Catholics only made it into higher offices in the area of Baden-Württemberg when they had been members of Hubertia. This can be understood as a typical statement during the cultural war ([[Kulturkampf]]) with Köhler voicing his antipathy towards the fraternity of Hubertia. On the other hand, Hasel completely disproves Köhller's view: He points out that the view of Catholics only having gotten into higher office positions if they had been Hubertia's members must be false as access to Baden's office career track was not bound by confession. Catholic forestry office applicants were not hindered on their path, which is proven by several of personnel files.

{{Quote|When the governing forestry manager Duke von Wiser of Meßkirch was set to become the head of the state forestry office in Karlsruhe, the then-governing manager reported on him (signed Krutina) that "he is a Catholic, but has an evangelical wife, who is daughter to a diseased forestry council head of Davans. Though he is a hunter, he does not pursue it with passion, as he lacks passion in general. So far he has done his uneasy duties well in Meßkirch and qualifies.|Karl Hasel&lt;ref&gt;Karl Hasel:  ''Aus alten Dienerakten – Badische Bezirksförster zwischen 1780 und 1880''. Selbstverlag der Landesforstverwaltung Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgart 1994, S. 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This report and the catholic men mentioned for offices in forestry provide evidence that religions orientation of applicants did not influence hiring decisions in Baden's forestry department. Furthermore, there was not one of Hubertia's members within the ranks of the foresrty officers mentioned in Hasel's notes. Due to that, there was no verifiable connection between an applicant's religious orientation and his connection to the fraternity of Hubertia, when he ran for a public forestry office.

The report on Duke Wiser, mentioned above, on the other hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, had been a member of Hubertia since 1877. Krutina on the other hand, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia.&lt;ref name="SR55"&gt;Schriftreihe der Landesforstverwaltung Baden-Württemberg, Bd. 55: ''Biographie bedeutender Forstleute aus Baden-Württemberg''. Stuttgart 1980&lt;/ref&gt; If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then we should be able to deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.

When the position of the state's forestry minister and office head of Baden's forestry department was to be reappointed, Köhler intentionally decided against a member of Hubertia and put Karl Philipp in the position.&lt;ref name="SR55" /&gt; Karl Phillip represented the so-called ''young forestry school'' and was knows to be very critical of the old establishment in Baden's forstry departments. He made many enemies with his destructive critique and his dogmatic lopsidedness, especially with his predecessors.

With Philipp's assumption of office, two fractions developed within Baden's forestry departments. The ''young forest school'', being under Philipp's management, was supported by younger forestry officers; while none of the older ones openly sided with Philipp. With a majority of Hubertia's members belonging to the conservative and older members within Baden's forestry depeartments, this had to hurt long-term, as indicated in several publications and memoirs criticizing Philipps actions or workings.&lt;ref name="SR55"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Eichhorn (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Eichhorn (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Eichhorn (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O. Eberbach (1926)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Fr.

From 1919 to 1936, 41 forsety officers were members of Hubertia, five of which were governors of the state forestry department and three had been the foresrty president.&lt;ref&gt;Kösener Corpslisten 1996: ''Hubertia Freiburg''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1933 to 1945 ===
Free and open-minded student organizations were a thorn in the [[Nazism|National Socialist]] party's view of the world. Before coming to power, the national socialists had instituted the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] (NSDSB) that strove to be the one and only students' association. Once in power in 1933, Hitler's party started to ban independent fraternities and sororities in Germany. Similar to other Corps, Hubertia's reaction was first to go underground and exist as a so-called "association among Freiburg's fencing circle" instead of being referred to as a Corps. As pressure increased, Hubertia's members chose the official self-liquidation (''Selbst-Suspension'') on May 18, 1936 to avoid discovery or annexation to the NSDSB.

To still provide means for Hubertia's Corps student and Alumni members to meet, the SC-Comradeship ''[[Hermann Löns]]'' was formed together with representatives from other Corps in Freiburg. This comradeship allowed fraternity members to remain undiscovered during congregations and to continue their practice of academic fencing, which had become strictly forbidden and could, when discovered, lead to capital punishment in [[Nazi Germany]] at that point in time. The meeting place remained Hubertia's fraternity house. While partially interrupted due to heightened pressure of nazi espionage, fencing [[academic fencing|Mensur duels]] continued and even intensified from 1941 on, with over 100 of such duels happening during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Alexander Ricker: ''Freiburger Mensuren in der nationalsozialistischen Verbotszeit''. Einst und Jetzt 10 (1968), S. 70–82&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war period and Hubertia today ===
{{Further|Post-war}}
Following the war, Hubertia's alumni association was reactivated on May 20, 1946. Both, the members of the formerly established SC-Comradeship and the ''Association of Bremer Students'' (est. on Oct. 29, 1947 by members of Hubertia who had started alternative comradeships during the war) were formerly accepted into the fraternity on January 17, 1948. The students from [[Bremen]] officially moved to Freiburg that year and re-established the [[Studentenverbindung]] Hubertia not yet as Corps as these were still forbidden under Allied control. The official Allied guideline was to make sure that ''"nothing Nazi"'' would be re-established post-war and student organizations were handled with care in general. Hubertia took the following two years to establish that it was her confrontation with Nazi-Germany that led to the former dissolution by choice and underground existence. In parallel, some of Hubertia's members moved from Bremen to [[Marburg]] as Freiburg university did not yet provide certain departments that early after the war. These members helped to re-establish, or reconstitute, the [[:de:Corps Holsatia Kiel]]&lt;small&gt;de&lt;/small&gt;, [[:de:Corps Hansea Bonn]]&lt;small&gt;de&lt;/small&gt; and [[:de:Corps Suevia Straßburg]]&lt;small&gt;de&lt;/small&gt; in [[Marburg]].&lt;ref name="CW" /&gt;

[[File:Freiburg from above.jpg|thumb|250px|View on Freiburg im Breisgau today.]]
On November 14, 1950, Hubertia officially took the title Corps Hubertia back on. The League of Corps ''SC-Freiburg'' reconstituted in the following year with Hubertia, Rhenania and Suevia. Next, Hubertia helped to reconstitute the KSCV at the [[Godesburg]] the same year, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;R.-J. Baum (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The next years were ones of ensuring balance and normality for fraternities in Germany again. Hubertia became the leading Corps in 1966 with ''Hans-Joachim Hiebsch'' as the president of the oKC, the official Kösen Congregation.

Today, Hubertia is the oldest fraternity in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the second-oldest one in Germany that continues to practice a tradition of ''forestry and fencing''. As, currently, the oldest fraternity sharing Corps Hubertia Freiburg's traditions, Corps Hubertia München is giving up on the tradition of forestry and hunting, Hubertia is set to become the oldest fraternity in Europe keeping these values alive.

When [[Baden-Württemberg]]'s Minister of Justice and Vice-Ministerpresedent and Corps Hubertia's alumni [[:de:Ulrich Goll]] was interviewed by local and national media about his relationship to guns, media focused on his fraternity background too and the value that hunting has in our society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schwaebische.de/region/wir-im-sueden/baden-wuerttemberg_artikel,-Justizminister-schiesst-aus-%E2%80%9EJux-und-Tollerei%E2%80%9C-_arid,4094166.html Andreas Schanz: ''Justizminister schießt aus „Jux und Tollerei“'' In: ''schwaebische.de'' vom 7.

== Reconstruction of other Corps ==
Since 1945, Hubertia's members were essential for the reconstruction / re-endowment of the following Corps: 
* [[:de:Corps Holsatia Kiel|Holsatia &lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt;]] (1947)
* [[:de:Corps Hansea Bonn|Hansea Bonn &lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt;]]  (1949)

== House in Freiburg and the Lodge in the Black Forest ==
[[File:Hubertia 2927.jpg|thumb|Hubertia's house (side view)]]
[[File:Hütte des Corps Hubertia.jpg|thumb|Hubertia's lodge]]
The original house in Freiburg „Zum Felsenkeller“ was bought on Schlossbergstraße 7 in 1921 and served the fraternity through the troubled times before, during and shortly after WW II. The house was then torn down in 1968 and replaced with a new house at Fürstenbergstraße 23 in the south of Freiburg.

Many fraternity members pay regular visits to the lodge higher up in the [[Black Forest]] mountains near Freiburg. Traditionally, the last hour of the hike is done around sun-down to soak up what nature has to offer from dusk 'till dawn. The lodge provides means for relaxation, recreation and meditation without iPhones and computers.

== Unique features of Corps Hubertia: fencing, fire arms and friendship ==
[[Image:Hunting dogs with catch.jpg|thumb|[[Hunting dog]]s with [[pheasant]]s]]
Hubertia's members are - quite literally - Brothers in Arms. Be it the proper handling of a fencing blade under the psychological and physical strains of the [[academic fencing|Mensur]] or the correct management of a hunting rifle out in the field; be it hunting as a team or deerstalking in a dusky Sunday evening, followed by hours spent together near the campfire: Hubertia provides some of life's experiences in its purest form.

A [[:de:Alter Herr (Studentenverbindung)|Corps Alumni's (''Alter Herr'') &lt;small&gt;ge&lt;/small&gt;]] [[hunting| hunting school]] offers courses to obtain the hunting license,with classes taking place at the fraternity house. This license, colloquially referred to as the ''"Green Diploma"'' does take about half a year of work and covers information from flora and fauna to legal and safety issues as well as the proper way to handle and successfully apply fire arms, in essence delivering a ''"forestry light"'' course. Most of the participants are students at the local universities, studying subjects from Algebra over Medicine, and Law to Engineering.

[[Hunting]] in general and the experience with other Corps brothers specifically has a very high standing within the fraternity. Many of the alumni provide the hunting location and hospitality to members as well as invited guests, often organizing joint events with the younger members from Freiburg. The tradition strengthens bonds across different age groups and usually forms and deepens lifelong friendships.

Corps form relationships with each other that are the basis for regular visits and various forms of support between the fraternities. One of Hubertia's relationships, yet, is an exceptional one: The bond formed with the Corps Friso-Cheruskia (WSC) in Karlsruhe established a bridge between the two main Corps associations, the [[Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband|KSCV]] and the [[:de:Weinheimer Senioren-Convent|WSC]]. This brigding bond is unique for all Corps in Europe. Hubertia continued to form relationships with like-minded Corps, as elaborated in the following section.

[[Image:Billets de 5000.jpg|150px|thumb|Banknotes of 5000 denomination in different currencies including Franc, Yen, Lire, and Dollar]]'''Denomination''' is a proper description of a [[currency]] amount, usually for [[coin]]s or [[banknote]]s. Denominations may also be used with other means of payment like [[scrip|gift card]]s. For example, ''five euros'' is the denomination of a [[five euro note]].

==Subunit and super unit==
In a currency, there is usually a main unit (base), and a subunit that is a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]  of the main unit. In some countries, there are multiple levels of subunits. In the former [[Ottoman Empire]], 1 lira = 100 [[kuruş]] = 4000 para = 12000 [[akçe]]. Today, only a few places have more than one subunit, notably the [[Jordanian dinar]] is divided into 10 dirham, 100 qirsh/piastres, or 1000 fils. Many countries where [[Western Europe]]an languages are spoken currently have their main units divided into 100 subunits. Some currencies that previously had subunits no longer do, because [[inflation]] has rendered the subunit useless. A prominent example is the [[Japanese yen]], which was formerly divided into 100 sen or 1000 rin. Both subunits were demonetized at the end of 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Nihongo|A law of the abolition of currencies in a small denomination and rounding off a fraction, 15 July 1953 Law No.60|[http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_housei.nsf/html/houritsu/01619530715060.htm 小額通貨の整理及び支払金の端数計算に関する法律]|Shōgakutsūka no seiri oyobi shiharaikin no hasūkeisan ni kansuru hōritsu}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a super unit is used as a multiple of the main unit. Examples include [[Korea]]n won = 5 [[Korean yang|yang]] in 1893, [[Iranian toman]] 10 [[Iranian rial|rials]] (used informally today). In the [[Ottoman Empire]], lira and kuruş were super units at some point before becoming the main unit.

==Decimal vs. non-decimal==
A [[decimal currency]] is a currency where the ratio between the main unit and the subunit is an integral [[exponentiation|power]] of 10. [[Non-decimal currencies]] are now rare but had some advantages in daily life transactions.  For example, 1 [[South German gulden|South German Gulden]] = 60 [[Kreuzer]]. 60 can be divided into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 or 30 parts that are still [[integer]]s, making pricing easy. This advantage (in an age without mechanical or electronic calculators) and the lack of widespread accurate weighing apparatus (meaning an item might sometimes simply be divided in 2,4,6 etc.) coupled with tradition were the reasons why non-decimal currencies were used.

In theory, two countries currently use non-decimal currency: Mauritania (1 ouguiya = 5 khoums) and Madagascar (1 [[Malagasy ariary|ariary]] = 5 iraimbilanja).  In practice, however, the value of the main unit in each case is so low (less than 1/1000 of a United States dollar) that the sub-unit is not of any practical use and is rarely seen in circulation.  In the case of the iraimbilanja, this is a carryover of the Madagascar's previous currency, the Malagasy franc, which had the ariary as a super unit worth 5 francs, and iraimbilanja was an alternate term for the franc.  The last major countries to use non-decimal currencies in practice were the United Kingdom (until 1971), Ireland (1971), Malta (1972) and Nigeria (1973).

The "optimal denomination problem"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=J. Shallit |title=What this country needs is an 18c piece |journal=[[Mathematical Intelligencer]] |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=20–23 |doi=10.1007/BF02984830 |url=http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/change2.pdf}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a problem for people who design entirely new currencies:
What denominations should be chosen for the coins
in order to minimize the average effort required to make change --
i.e., the average number of coins needed to [[change-making problem | make change]]?
As of 2014, most decimal currencies use a [[1-2-5 series]] of coins,
but some other set of denominations would require fewer denominations of coins or a smaller average number of coins to make change or both.

==Choice of name==
It is common to name a unit with a [[units of measurement|unit of weight]], such as [[pound (currency)|pound]], [[lira]], and [[Thai baht|baht]]. In most cases, these currencies were originally defined as that amount of some [[precious metal]]. Another choice of name is some form of derivative of the political entity. The [[Afghan afghani]] and European [[euro]] fall into this category. Sometimes the name is simply the name of the metal of which the coins were or are made, such as [[Polish złoty]] (“golden”) and [[Vietnamese đồng]] (“copper”), or its geographical origin, e.g. Joachimsthaler (see [[Dollar#Etymology|Dollar]]).

In general, '''detection''' is the action of accessing information without specific cooperation from or synchronization with the sender.

In the history of [[radio]] communications, the term "[[detector (radio)|detector]]" was first used for a device that detected the simple presence or absence of a radio [[signal (electronics)|signal]], since all communications were in [[Morse code]].  The term is still in use today to describe a component that extracts a particular signal from all of the [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] present.  Detection is usually based on the [[frequency]] of the [[carrier signal]], as in the familiar frequencies of [[radio broadcasting]], but it may also involve filtering a faint signal from [[noise]], as in [[radio astronomy]], or reconstructing a hidden signal, as in [[steganography]].

In [[optoelectronics]], "detection" means converting a received optical input to an electrical output. For example, the light signal received through an [[optical fiber]] is converted to an electrical signal in a detector such as a [[photodiode]].

In [[steganography]], attempts to detect hidden signals in suspected carrier material is referred to as [[steganalysis]].  Steganalysis has an interesting difference from most other types of detection, in that it can often only determine the [[probability]] that a hidden message exists; this is in contrast to the detection of signals which are simply [[encryption|encrypted]], as the [[ciphertext]] can often be identified with certainty, even if it cannot be decoded. 

In the [[military]], detection refers to the special discipline of [[reconnaissance]] with the aim to recognize the presence of an object in a location or ambiance.

Finally, the art of detection, also known as ''following clues'', is the work of a [[detective]][https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://ca.geocities.com/t369%40rogers.com/index.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:06:49 ] in attempting to reconstruct a sequence of events by identifying the relevant information in a situation.

      <comment>Where language likely began ~~&gt; Hypothesized to have begun. (Wording was, as written, uncitable.)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6760">In [[linguistics]], '''displacement''' is the capability of [[language]] to communicate about things that are not immediately present (spatially or temporally); i.e., things that are either not here or are not here now.

In 1960, [[Charles F. Hockett]] proposed displacement as one of 13 [[design features of language]] that distinguish human language from [[animal communication]] systems (ACSs):

{{quote|Man is apparently almost unique in being able to talk about things that are remote in space or time (or both) from where the talking goes on. This feature—"displacement"—seems to be definitely lacking in the vocal signaling of man's closest relatives, though it does occur in bee-dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Charles F. |last=Hockett |authorlink=Charles F. Hockett |title=The origin of speech |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=203 |pages=88–96 |url=http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |accessdate=19 February 2011 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0960-88 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426023122/http://www.isrl.illinois.edu/~amag/langev/paper/charles60theOrigin.html |archivedate=26 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In animal communication systems==
[[Honeybee]]s use the [[waggle dance]] to communicate the location of a patch of flowers suitable for foraging. The degree of displacement in this example remains limited when compared to human language. A bee can only communicate the location of the most recent food source it has visited. It cannot communicate an idea about a food source at a specific point in the past, nor can it speculate about food sources in the future.&lt;ref name="Yule"&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Yule |year=2010 |title=The Study of Language |edition=4th |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-76527-5 |pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, displacement in the waggle dance is restricted by the language's lack of creativity and productivity. The bees can express direction and distance, but it has been experimentally determined that they lack a sign for "above". It is also doubtful that bees can communicate about non-existent nectar for the purpose of deception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Paul Georg |last=Meyer |year=2005 |title=Synchronic English Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=3rd |location=[[Tübingen]] |publisher=[[Gunter Narr Verlag]] |isbn=3-8233-6191-0 |page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, in honeybee communication, the potential for displacement is limited, but it is there insofar as they have the ability to communicate about something not currently present (i.e., something that is spatially removed).

[[Ant]]s have been observed sending out scouts to patrol for food items, and coming back for other workers if the food found is too large to bring to the nest by the finder alone, for example a dead caterpillar that is too heavy. This again would involve displacement by communicating outside of the here and now.  Recruitment has also been observed by the African [[Weaver Ant]] ''Oecophylla longinoda'' for the purpose of communicating new food sources, emigration to new sites, and for defense against intruders.  Researchers have described no less than five distinct systems to fulfill these functions in this species.&lt;ref&gt;Holldobler, Bert and Wilson, Edward O. 1977.  The Multiple Recruitment Systems of the African Weaver Ant ''Oecophylla longinoda'' (Latreille) (Hymenopetera: Formicidae) ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 3,19-60 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ants communicate using a system composed of olfactory or scent clues from several glands together with body movements.  The animals will use antennation, body jerking, and/or mouth-opening, and will combine these clues with the application of the scent trails or scent release to pass on information regarding resources or intruders.

[[Raven]]s (''Corvus corax'') have been observed to recruit other ravens to large feeding sites, such as to the carcass of an animal. However, at first glance their motivation for recruiting is less obvious, and the specifics of their communication system are more elusive.  Still, it has been documented that ravens must have such a system, as their patterns of gathering at sites clearly indicate that they must have been informed of the presence of the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. Winter foraging at carcasses by three sympatric  corvids, with emphasis on recruitment by the raven, ''Corvus corax''. ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'':3, 141-156 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B and Marzluff, J.M. Do common ravens yell because they want to attract others? ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'': 28, 13-21 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that non-mated ravens call in a group of other non-mated birds to be able to feed and not get chased away by mated territorial pairs of established ravens.

==Importance in evolution of language==
The need to convey information using displacement has been suspected to have been the [[evolutionary pressure]] leading to [[Origin of language|language development in humans]], as outlined by [[Derek Bickerton]] in ''Adam's Tongue''.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, Derek (2009). ''Adam's Tongue''. Hill and Wang. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-2281-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of such need is present in species with a foraging strategy that presents the challenge of directing members of its group to a food source too large to be utilized singly or in small numbers, requiring recruitment of assistance.
{{quote|It's only when you fully appreciate what displacement means, how the absence of displacement is not just a casual feature of ACSs but a crucial defining feature of pre-human minds, that you can start getting the complete picture.| Bickerton, page 217}}
The unique environmental need selecting for a communication system capable for displacement in humans or our direct ancestors is not identified, but hypotheses include Bickerton's theory of small groups finding large herbivore carcasses, and needing the assistance from other small groups of humans to defend against other dangerous scavengers (large cats, hyenas) competing for the same source of food. Language development most certainly did not stop there—since otherwise bees or ants would have comparable communication systems to ours—but this is where it is hypothesized to have begun, giving our ancestors the ability to take communication out of the here and now.

'''''Dragon's Kin''''' is a [[science fiction]]  [[novel]] by the American-Irish author [[Anne McCaffrey]] and her son [[Todd McCaffrey]]. Published by [[Del Rey Books]] in 2003, it is the eighteenth book in the ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series and the first with Todd as co-author.&lt;ref&gt;{{isfdb series |482 |Dragonriders of Pern}}. Retrieved 2011-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon's Kin'' may be considered the first of a trilogy by the McCaffreys, preceding ''[[Dragon's Fire]]'' and ''[[Dragon Harper]]''. Primarily the three books feature [[Kindan]] as a boy and young man, about 500 years after landing on [[Pern]] (500 AL).

==Collaboration==
Anne McCaffrey (1926–2011) created Pern in the novella ''Weyr Search'' (1967) when her second child Todd was eleven. In 2001 and 2002 she published her fifteenth Pern novel and second collection of short stories. ''Dragon's Kin'' was their first collaborative work.

Todd later recalled that a Del Rey editor in the 1990s "pitched it to me that someone ought to continue Mum’s legacy when she was no longer able. At the time I had misgivings and no story ideas."{{sfn|''Dragonholder''|1999|pp=3, 6}}

Previously, as Todd Johnson, he had contributed the chapter "Training and Fighting Dragons" to ''The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern'' (1989).{{sfn|Nye|1989|pp=54–65}} Mother and son had also discussed Pern and its setting for years, and she had suggested that he "write the military science fiction prequels" to the colonization, but that never progressed far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pernhome.com/tjm/?p=1683 "Letter from Nathan"] (2009-12-26). Todd McCaffrey blog. Retrieved 2011-07-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

They co-authored four Pern novels and, as of December 2011, Todd has done three alone. All are set just before and during the "Third Pass", about 500 years after human settlement on Pern and 2000 years before the "Ninth Pass" events chronicled in most of Anne McCaffrey's Pern books.

==Plot summary==
The story tells how the people of the fictional planet [[Pern]] discover the special abilities of the [[watch-whers]] or whers, a distant relative of the dragons. Subsequently, these beasts are used in mines to warn miners of gas pockets and also to locate stranded miners, should there be a cave-in.

The story begins some years before the 3rd Pass in Camp Natalon, a mining camp. There, the reader is introduced to a young boy Kindan, whose father owns a watch-wher called Dask. During a mining cave-in, Kindan loses his entire family as well as Dask, and is adopted by the Master Harper Zist, who begins to train him to be both an entertainer and a spy, something that Harpers do. This is how Kindan learns that the camp is divided into two parties, Natalon's and his uncle Tarik's.

Meanwhile, the camp is without a watch-wher and minor accidents keep delaying the work. Despite the protests from Tarik and his group, Natalon decides to trade an entire winter's worth of [[coal]] for a chance for Kindan to ask a queen watch-wher for an egg. He succeeds and begins the difficult task of raising a nocturnal animal. As no records exist on how to raise or train the watch-wher, Kindan has no clue but is luckily aided by the mysterious Nuella. Together, they train Kisk and, in the process, learn a great deal about this species. This proves to be vital as, towards the end of the novel, Kisk's abilities will save many lives, including that of the camp leader, Natalon.

'''''Duck, Death and the Tulip''''' (German title: ''Ente, Tod und Tulpe'') is a 2007 [[Children's literature|children's book]] by German author and illustrator [[Wolf Erlbruch]]. The book, which deals with death and the afterlife, has been translated into various languages, including Dutch and English, and was adapted in animated and movie format.

==Synopsis==
The story involves a duck who acquaints a character called [[Death (personification)|Death]] who, as it turns out, has been following her all her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2844/Archief/archief/article/detail/922106/2008/01/18/Een-dode-eend-een-verlepte-tulp-en-een-extravagante-hoed-voor-de-koningin.dhtml|title=Een dode eend, een verlepte tulp en een extravagante hoed voor de koningin|last=Lenteren|first=Pjotr van|date=18 January 2008|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two become friends, discussing life, death, and what any afterlife might be like. They go diving together and sit in a tree, pondering what would happen to the duck's lake after her death. The duck reports that some ducks say that they become angels and sit on clouds, looking down on earth. Death says that this is possible since ducks already have wings. Then, she says that some ducks also say that there is a hell, down below, where bad ducks are roasted; Death replies that it's remarkable what ducks all think of, and says "who knows," prompting the duck to respond, "so you don't know either." In the end, the duck indeed dies, and Death carries her to a river, placing the duck gently in the water and laying the tulip on her: "For a long time he watched her. When she was lost to sight, he was almost a little moved."&lt;ref name=rosoff/&gt;

==Critical reception==
The book was nominated for the 2008 [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]]; the jury praised Erlbruch's "soft-philosophical ''Pas de deux''" and his sparse illustrations: "the radical reduction of the images underlines the dramatic subject matter in a fulminant manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djlp.jugendliteratur.org/2008/bilderbuch-1/artikel-ente_tod_und_tulpe-19.html|title=Ente, Tod und Tulpe|year=2008|publisher=[[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meg Rosoff]], in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', called ''Duck, Death and the Tulip'' an "outstanding book": "There is something infinitely tender in the way Death strokes her ruffled feathers into place, lifts her body and places it gently in the river, watching as she drifts off into the distance."&lt;ref name=rosoff&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rosoff  | first = Meg  | title = Rev. of ''Duck, Death and the Tulip''  | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]  | date = 19 December 2009  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/19/wolf-erlbruch-children-picturebook-review  | accessdate =3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sieglinde Duchateau, in a review of the Dutch translation, also praised the book: "The atmosphere is warm, intimate, and full of comfort. In the masterpiece a difficult theme is made accessible for children in an idiosyncratic manner with a touch of humor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pluizer.be/kinderboeken-jeugdboeken/de-eend-de-dood-en-de-tulp|title=Rev. of Wolf Erlbruch, ''De eend, de dood en de tulp''|last=Duchateau|first=Sieglinde|publisher=Pluizer.be|accessdate=8 May 2012|quote=De sfeer is warm, innig en troostrijk. In dit meesterwerk wordt op een eigenwijze manier en met een humoristisch trekje een moeilijk thema in een voor kinderen toegankelijke wereld geplaatst.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his illustrations, Erlbruch received honorable mention in the 2008 Dutch [[Gouden Griffel|Gouden Penseel]] competition for best children's book illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/26/boeken/article/detail/15414/2008/05/30/Gouden-Penseel-voor-Charlotte-Dematons.dhtml|title=Gouden Penseel voor Charlotte Dematons|date=30 May 2008|work=[[Het Parool]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4492/Nederland/article/detail/1212067/2008/05/29/Gouden-Penseel-voor-Charlotte-Dematons.dhtml|title=Gouden Penseel voor Charlotte Dematons|date=29 May 2008|work=[[Trouw]]|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ELLEN SULLEY FRAY.jpg|thumb|Ellen Sulley Fray]]
'''Ellen Sulley Fray''' (December 2, 1832 – 1903) was a British-born American social reformer. She formed suffrage clubs in several different states and in Canada, and became one of the district presidents of the [[Ohio]] Women's Suffrage Association.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=561}}

==Early years and education==
Ellen Sulley was born in the parish of [[Calverton, Nottinghamshire]], England, December 2, 1832. She was descended from [[Huguenot]] and Danish ancestors. Her mother was a near relative of [[Lord Denman]], Chief Justice of England. Her father was Richard Sulley. who married Elizabeth Denman in 1827, and of their six children, Fray was the third daughter. Her father was a well-known writer upon social and economical questions, and had distinguished himself at the time of the repeal of the [[Corn]] Laws in England. When she was but a child, Mr. Sulley moved with his family to the United States, and after some years located in [[Rochester, New York]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=300}}

During the early years of her life, while they were traveling from place to place, opportunities for education were limited so lar as books were concerned. Her father thought that it mattered little, as all that girls needed was to write and read, with a little knowledge of arithmetic added. Fray became a reader and a student of history. As a young girl, Fray heard such subjects discussed constantly and became deeply interested in all reforms of the day.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=300}}

==Career==
In 1848, she first became roused upon the question of [[Women's suffrage in the United States|woman suffrage]], through attendance upon a convention held in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and presided over by [[Abigail Bush]], with [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and others of the earlier agitators as speakers. That marked an epoch in her life. She had learned of woman's inferiority through the religious instruction which she had received, but henceforth she felt that something in it was wrong. She was advised by her [[Sunday School]] teacher carefully to study and compare passages in the Old and New Testaments. That she did thoroughly, and became satisfied that Christ nowhere made any difference between the sexes. Henceforth, her work lay in the direction thus given, and she labored to promote political equality for woman and to advance her rights in the industrial fields.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=301}}

She formed suffrage clubs in several different States and in Canada, and was repeatedly a delegate to National councils, giving her time and money for the cause. In 1886, Fray entered into a political canvass in Rochester to put a woman upon the board of managers of the State Industrial School; with [[Mary Stafford Anthony]], she worked for three weeks and gained the victory. She went on to become one of the district presidents of the Ohio Woman's Suffrage Association and a prominent member of several of the leading clubs -literary, social and economic- in Toledo.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=301}} Fray was a member of the [[Lucas County, Ohio|Lucas County]] Board of Visitors to Charitable and Correctional Institutions, and served as president of the Lucas County Woman Suffrage Association.{{sfn|Gordon|2009|p=574}}

==Personal life==
In 1853, she married Frank M. Fray, and they made their home in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], before moving to [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 1870.{{sfn|Gordon|2009|p=574}} It was a happy union, lasting for twenty years, until the death of Mr. Fray. Her two children died in childhood, leaving her alone and free to devote herself to those things which she felt were of a character to help humanity.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=301}} She died in 1903.{{sfn|Gordon|2009|p=574}}

A '''father-daughter dance''' is a dance between a [[daughter]] and her [[father]]. Father-daughter dances are common at Western [[wedding reception]]s, although not all weddings have a father-daughter dance. In situations where a daughter's father is not available, he may be substituted with a man of an older generation, such as an [[uncle]] or the father of a close friend. Father-daughter dances are very common at [[quinceañera]]s and [[debutante ball]]s.

A father-daughter dance can also refer to an [[dance (event)|event]] where girls and their fathers can dance. Many [[elementary school]]s have father-daughter dances, particularly on [[Valentine's Day]]. While these events are intended for girls and their fathers, some schools allow other people, such as the girls' cousins, brothers and close friends to attend.

Mother-son dances use the same analogy of a son and his mother, although they are not as common as father-daughter dances.

The '''group theatre of Kolkata''' refers to a tradition in theatres in the [[India]]n city [[Kolkata]], which developed in the 1940s as an alternative to entertainment-oriented theatres.&lt;ref name=heierstad39&gt;{{Cite thesis|type= [[Cand.polit.]]|chapter= |title= Nandikar: Staging Globalisation in Kolkata and Abroad|url= http://folk.uio.no/gheierst/nandikar.pdf|format= PDF|last= Geir|first= Heierstad|year= 2003|publisher= University of Oslo|accessdate= 9 March 2012|pages= 39–48|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060512065317/http://folk.uio.no/gheierst/nandikar.pdf|archivedate= 12 May 2006|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to commercial theatres, group theatre is "a theatre that is not professional or commercial",&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; characterized by its tendency for experimentation in theme, content and production,&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; and its aim of using the [[proscenium]] stage to highlight social messages, rather than having primarily making-money objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=Malini |editor1-first= Jasodhara|editor1-last=Bagchi |title= The changing status of women in West Bengal, 1970–2000: the challenge ahead |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1Xq8FARrFKUC&amp;dq|accessdate= 10 February 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Sage Publications |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-0-7619-3242-0  |pages=99–100 |chapter= Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zarilli&gt;{{cite book|title= Theatre Histories: An Introduction| first1=Phillip |last1=Zarilli |first2=Bruce |last2=McConachie|first3= Gary Jay|last3= Williams|last4=  Sorgenfrei|first4=Carol Fisher|editor-last=Williams|editor-first=Gary Jay|publisher= Rotledge|year=2010|origyear=2006|location=Abingdon, UK|isbn=978-0-415-46223-5 |pages=429–430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z88LLjzoWqQC|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;Bikramgarh Maru Behag  group theatre director Smt.Jolly Guha  Roy

==IPTA and ''Nabanna''==
{{Main|Indian People's Theatre Association|Nabanna (play)}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Shobha sen in nabanna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shobha Sen]] in ''Nabanna'', 1944]] --&gt;
The play ''Nabanna'' in 1944 is said to be the birth of group theatres in Kolkata.&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; ''Nabanna'' was written by  [[Bijon Bhattacharya]], who also co-directed it with [[Sambhu Mitra]]. They were both active members of the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA), the association of [[leftist]] theatre-artists.&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; In the commercial theatres at that time, entertainment was the sole purpose.&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; However, the time was tumultuous—the [[Indian independence movement]] was strengthening on the backdrop of the World War 2, and the plight of [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal province]] was further worsened by the  [[Bengal famine of 1943]].&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; Activists and thinkers attempted to use the media of theatre to highlight the plight of the people, and to stage a form of artistic protest.

In this backdrop, the drama ''Nabanna'' portrayed a group of peasants as victim of the famine. The peasants had to leave their village due to famine, and they traveled to Kolkata with the hope for survival in the big city. However, they faced a series of crises and eventually got "...reduced to the most abject acknowledge poverty in Kolkata, where they develop a political awareness of their suffering".&lt;ref name=heierstad39/&gt; Another production of IPTA was ''Jobanbondi''.

==Notion of group==

Prior to the start of group theatre movement, the commercial theatre of Kolkata strived to attract audiences based on star-power. Popular actors such as Sisir Bhaduri, Ahindra Chowdhury and others were considered consistent crowd-pullers. The group theatre tried to depart from this paradigm.&lt;ref name=ghosh/&gt; Instead of superstars, the emphasis in group theatre was on the group—which was commonly an amalgamation of non-professional participants who identified themselves with the social motives of the movement and participated in the production out of passion for the art.&lt;ref name=ghosh/&gt; The attempt was to make ''gononatyo'' (people's theatre).&lt;ref name=ghosh/&gt;

==Groups after IPTA==

The initial group of IPTA dispersed in 1947. However, the principal members continued to carry the legacy of IPTA by forming several groups with similar ideology. [[Ahindra Chowdhuri]], [[Sombhu Mitra]] and [[Tripti Mitra]] were the leading members of the group ''[[Bohurupee]]''. ''Raktakarabi'', ''Tahar Nam Ti Ranjana'', ''Char Adhyay'' (written by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]) were some of the earlier productions of [[Bohurupee]]. [[Utpal Dutt]] led another faction of artists and went to create classics like ''Tiner Talowar'' and ''Kallol''. In 1950s and 1960s, many critically acclaimed productions were staged, which used international literature including the works of [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]].&lt;ref name=zarilli/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosh/&gt; According to one critic, the productions had the "right mix of democratic politics&amp;nbsp;— with certain groups drifting towards a revolutionary rhetoric&amp;nbsp;— and humane ideals, based on literature drawn from the world over".&lt;ref name=ghosh/&gt;

Notable group theatres include  the Little Theatre Group, Gandharba, Theatre Commune, Amulya Natyagosthi, Calcutta Theatre, [[Nandikar]].&lt;ref name=ghosh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh |first1=Parimal |year=2012 |title=Rise and fall of Calcutta's group theatre: the end of a political dream |journal=Economic &amp; Political Weekly |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=36–42 |publisher=Economic and Political Weekly |issn=0012-9976 |doi= |url=http://epw.in/epw/uploads/articles/17211.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=9 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Im schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon'''" ("In [[Ashkelon]]'s Black Whale") is a popular academic [[commercium song]]. It was known as a beer-drinking song in many German speaking ancient universities. [[Joseph Victor von Scheffel]] provided the lyrics under the title '''''Altassyrisch''''' ([[Assyria|Old Assyrian]]) 1854, the melody is from 1783 or earlier&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lieder-archiv.de/im_schwarzen_walfisch_zu_askalon-notenblatt_600700.html Lieder-Archiv (de) (Song Archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Content ==
The lyrics reflect an endorsement of the [[bacchanalia]]n mayhem of student life, similar as in [[Gaudeamus igitur]]. The song describes an [[Assyria|old Assyrian]] [[drinking binge]] of a man in an inn with some references to the [[Classics]]. The desks are made of marble and the large invoice is being provided in [[cuneiform]] on bricks. However the carouser has to admit that he left his money already in Nineveh. A Nubian house servant kicks him out then and the song closes with the notion, that (compare John 4:44) a prophet has no honor in his own country, if he doesn't pay cash for his consumption.  [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] has translated the poems among other works of Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], Gaudeamus! Humorous Poems by Joseph Viktor von Scheffel, [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35848?msg=welcome_stranger#bibrec Ebook-Nr. 35848 on gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Each stanza begins with the naming verse "Im Schwarzen Walfisch zu Askalon", but varies the outcome. The "Im" is rather prolonged with the melody and increases the impact. Some of the stanzas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Im schwarzen Wallfisch zu Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
Da trank ein Mann drei Tag',
&lt;br&gt;
Bis dass er steif wie ein Besenstiel
&lt;br&gt;
Am Marmortische lag.
&lt;br&gt;

'In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
A man drank day by day,
&lt;br&gt;
Till, stiff as any broom-handle,
&lt;br&gt;
Upon the floor he lay.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
The waiters brought the bill,
&lt;br&gt;
In arrow-heads on six broad tiles
&lt;br&gt;
To him who thus did swill.
&lt;br&gt;

...

In the Black Whale at Ascalon
&lt;br&gt;
No prophet hath renown;
&lt;br&gt;
And he who there would drink in peace
&lt;br&gt;
Must pay the money down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In typical manner of Scheffel, it contains an anachronistic mixture of various times and eras, parodistic notions on current science,&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to German Poetry: A Dual-Language Book, Gustave Mathieu, Guy Stern Courier Dover Publications, 31.05.2012, including as well a translation 
&lt;/ref&gt; as e.g. [[Historical criticism]] and interpretations of the [[Book of Jonah]] as a mere shipwrecking narrative. According to Scheffel, the guest didn't try to get back in the inn as „Aussi bini, aussi bleibi, wai Ascalun, ihr grobi Kaibi“ (I been out, I stay so, you rude Aschkelon calves). There are various additional verses, including political parodist ones and verses mocking different sorts of fraternities.
The song has been used as name for traditional inns and restaurants, e.g. in Heidelberg and [[Bad Säckingen]]. In Bad Säckingen the name was used on several (consecutive) inns and was namegiver for the still existing club "Walfisch Gesellschaft Säckingen" (Walfischia), honoring Scheffel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotel-restaurant-schwarzer-walfisch.de/de/geschichte.html Hotel-Restaurant “Zum Schwarzen Walfisch” Bad Säckingen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematics International ==
There is one version just and only one for mathematics, called 'International'.&lt;ref&gt;History of Mathematics: A Supplement C. Smoryński, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient times, upon the door &lt;br&gt;
Of Plato, there was writt'n: &lt;br&gt;
“To each non-mathematicus &lt;br&gt;
The entrance is forbidd'n.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same stanza is available in further 13 languages, including Greek (Μελαίνῃ τῇ ἐν Φαλαίνᾳ - Melaínē (black) tē (the) en (in) Phalaína (whale)) and Volapük, which are sung one after the other.

[[File:Entertainer f0400705.jpg|thumb|upright|Figure of an Entertainer (here, a female dancer)]]
'''Kkoktu''' are Korean funerary figures that protect, serve and care for the deceased in the immediate afterlife. They come in a procession that comprises a leading Guardian figure, followed by a Caregiver and an Entertainer. Figures of Dragons and Phoenixes are also common as symbols of freedom and regeneration.

In Korean mythology, the dead was believed to be in angst and confusion. To ease the experience of the afterlife, a procession of helpful figures would accompany them to guide and protect them, care for them, and entertain them. These figures were symbolised by lavishly decorated wooden servant statuettes that ornated the funeral bier, and were commonplace during the [[Joseon Dynasty]], including for commoners. The practice came in favour in the 4th century CE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yesweekly.com/article-5544-love-and-death-in-korea.html |title=Love and death in Korea |author=Keith Barber |date=14 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Yes! Weekly |accessdate=7 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223231009/http://www.yesweekly.com/article-5544-love-and-death-in-korea.html |archive-date=2009-02-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and endured until the early 20th century.

The Guardian serves the dead by guiding him in the afterlife, and by driving away evil spirits. Traditionally mounted, fierce-looking and armed with swords or poled weapons, he later took the form of an army officer or policeman in Western-inspired attire, with a sabre.

The Caregiver serves the dead as if he was still alive, providing medical and prophylactic care. This figure is often a woman, or sometimes a couple. He comes immediately behind the Guardian in the procession.

The Entertainer fulfills a comforting role for both the spirit of the deceased and for the living who mourn them. This figure is often an acrobat or a musician.

Figures of Dragons or Phoenixes are often featured on the bier, as symbols of regeneration as well as of the freedom gained by the soul of the deceased departing their body.

'''LASCO''' is the Laboratory for the Analysis of Organizational Communication Systems of the [[Université catholique de Louvain]] (UCL), located in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] and [[Mons]] in [[Belgium]].

The LASCO was created in February 2000 as part of the Communication Department of the  [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. Its founders were Pierre de Saint-Georges, Axel Gryspeerdt and Vincent Defourny. LASCO has been chaired by [[Thierry Libaert]] and François Lambotte; since 2015, it is chaired by Andrea Catellani.

The LASCO brings together researchers of different origins, united by the common aim of observing and analysing internal and external, strategic and spontaneous phenomena in the field of [[Organizational Communication]], [[Public relations|Public Relations]], [[Corporate communication|Corporate Communication]] and [[Strategic communication|Strategic Communication]]. Such phenomena are to be considered as the origins and consequences of interactions occurred within organizations, or produced by them.

The LASCO originated from the consistent continuation of work done inside the Communication Department in the [[Public Relations]] sector (from 1961 onwards, via the CETEDI, Centre of Diffusion Techniques and Public Relations) and of Institutional Mediation (from 1994 on). Correlations between communication and organizations have always constituted a traditional research field at the Communication Department at the Université catholique de Louvain. The Université catholique de Louvain is thereby a Europe-wide recognised pioneer in this area: Organisational Communication has been taught since 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Catellani: Un laboratoire de recherche en transformation: le Lasco de l'Université catholique de Louvain.

[[File:Laundry symbols with japanese.jpg|thumb|Laundry care symbols with instructions in Japanese. The four symbols shown indicate that the garment must not be washed in water, must not be bleached, may be ironed only with a protective pressing cloth, and must be dry cleaned.]]
[[File:Guide to Procedures; LAUNDRY.jpg|thumb|upright|A poster from a laundromat in Beckley, West Virginia, that lists many of the common laundering instruction icons found on garment tags]]

A '''laundry symbol''', also called a '''care symbol''', is a [[pictogram]] which represents a method of [[washing]], for example drying, [[dry cleaning|dry-cleaning]] and [[ironing]] [[clothing]]. Such symbols are written on labels, known as '''care labels''' or '''care tags''', attached to clothing to indicate how a particular item should best be cleaned. Standard symbols for these care labels differ by region. In some standards, pictograms coexist with or are complemented by written instructions.

The Canadian system was formerly based on colour: green for "go ahead", yellow for "be careful", and red for "stop". That system was abandoned in favour of a common North American scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/oca-bc.nsf/eng/ca02009.html|title=Guide to Apparel and Textile Care Symbols|website=IC.GC.ca|publisher=Office of Consumer Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is an international standard that has been agreed by the ISO and within Europe by the EU, copyright laws make it difficult to publish these widely. However, there have been attempts to summarize the main national and international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Caring About the Consumers Beyond the Label|url=http://www.intertek.com/uploadedFiles/Intertek/Divisions/Consumer_Goods/Media/PDFs/Services/Low%20Res%20CompleteCareLabelling.pdf|publisher=Intertek|website=Intertek.com|year=2014|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Europe ==
[[GINETEX]], based in France, is the European association for textile care labelling, and formed in 1963 after academic conferences in the late 1950s were formed to define one standard of labelling.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== General ===
The care label describes the allowable treatment of the garment without damaging the textile. Whether this treatment is necessary or sufficient, is not stated. A milder than specified treatment is always acceptable. The symbols are protected and their use is required to comply with the license conditions; incorrect labelling is prohibited. A bar below each symbol calls for a gentler treatment than usual and a double bar for a very gentle treatment.

=== Washing ===
A stylized ''washtub'' is shown, and the number in the tub means the maximum wash temperature (degrees Celsius). A bar under the tub signifies a gentler treatment in the [[washing machine]]. A double bar signifies very gentle handling. A hand in the tub signifies that only (gentle) hand washing (not above 40°C) is allowed. A cross through washtub means that the textile may not be washed under normal household conditions.  

In the European standard, the level of wash agitation recommended is indicated by bars below the wash tub symbol. Absence of bar indicates a maximum agitation (cotton wash), a single bar indicates medium agitation (synthetics cycle) and a double bar indicates very minimal agitation (silk/wool cycle).&lt;ref name="GINETEX CARE LABELLING"&gt;{{cite web|title=Care Symbols|url=http://www.ginetex.net/GB/labelling/care-symbols.asp|website=GINETEX.net|publisher=[[GINETEX]]|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bar symbols also indicate the level of spin recommended with more bars indicating lower preferred spin speed.&lt;ref name="GINETEX CARE LABELLING" /&gt;

&lt;gallery perrow="5"&gt;
File:Waschen.svg|Washing symbol
File:Waschen 30.svg|Wash at or below 30°C (USA, 1 dot, ●)
File:Waschen 40.svg|Wash at or below 40°C (USA, 2 dots, ●●)

File:Handwäsche.svg|Hand wash
File:Nicht waschen.svg|Do not wash
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bleaching ===
An empty ''triangle'' (formerly lettered Cl) allows the [[bleach]]ing with [[chlorine]] or [[sodium percarbonate|non-chlorine bleach]]. Two oblique lines in the triangle prohibit chlorine bleaching. A crossed triangle prohibits any bleaching.

&lt;gallery perrow="5"&gt;

File:Nicht bleichen v2.svg|Do not bleach
File:Nicht bleichen.svg|Do not bleach
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Drying ===
A ''circle in the square'' symbolizes a [[clothes dryer]]. One dot requires drying at reduced temperature and two dots for normal temperature. The crossed symbol means that the clothing does not tolerate machine drying. In the U.S. and Japan, there are other icons for natural drying.

==== Tumble drying ====
&lt;gallery perrow="4"&gt;

File:Trommeltrocknen 1.svg|Tumble drying (low temperature)
File:Trommeltrocknen 2.svg|Tumble drying (normal)

File:Trocknen (liegend im schatten).svg|Dry flat in shade
File:Trocknen (tropfnass im schatten).svg|Drip dry in shade
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Ironing ===
The ''iron'' with up to three dots allows for [[ironing]]. The number of dots are assigned temperatures: one prescribes 110°C, two for 150°C and three for 200°C. An iron with a cross prohibits ironing.

&lt;gallery perrow="5"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Professional cleaning ===
{{Main|Surfactant}}

A ''circle'' identifies the possibilities of professional cleaning. A bar under the symbol means clean gently, and two bars means very gentle cleaning.

==== Chemical cleaning ====
The letters P and F in a circle are for the different [[solvent]]s used in professional [[dry cleaning]].

&lt;gallery perrow="4"&gt; 
File:Professionelle_reinigung.svg|Professional cleaning symbol

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Canadian [[rock music|rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] has written, recorded, and performed several [[instrumental]]s throughout its career.

==Studio recordings==

===2112===
{{main|2112 (song)}}

====Overture====
From the ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' album, "Overture" opens up one of Rush's concept suites. [[Geddy Lee]]'s voice is recorded as an instrument in the early parts of the song, as he sings no words. However, there is, despite the Overture's overall instrumental nature, one line sung at the end, as the piece transitions to "The Temples of Syrinx": "And [[the meek shall inherit the earth|the Meek shall inherit the Earth]]". Like some overtures, music from the ''2112'' Overture is repeated or built upon in other places in the suite, such as "The Temples of Syrinx", "Presentation", "Oracle: The Dream", and "Soliloquy." At the end of Overture, there's a direct quotation from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] ''[[1812 Overture]]'', played by Lifeson.

====Grand Finale====
This section of the suite includes some ''spoken'' lines at the end, with the following sentences repeated three times successively: ''"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation"'', and then ''"We have assumed control"''.

'''La Villa Strangiato''' was released on the 1978 album ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'', and is subtitled "An Exercise in Self-Indulgence". The 9:37 song, the fourth and final track of the album, was Rush's first entirely instrumental piece. The multi-part piece was inspired by a dream guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] had, and the music in these sections correspond to the occurrences in his dream. The opening segment was played on a nylon-string classical guitar. The next segment introduces the main theme of La Villa, the Strangiato theme. The song progresses to include an increasingly complex guitar solo backed by string synthesizer, followed closely by [[bass guitar|bass]] and drum fills. The Strangiato theme is then revisited before the song ends abruptly with phased bass and drums. The song is divided as follows:

* I: "Buenas Noches, Mein Froinds!" (0:00–0:26)
* II: "To sleep, perchance to dream..." (0:27–1:59)
* III: "Strangiato theme" (2:00–3:15)
* IV: "A Lerxst in Wonderland" (3:16–5:48)
* V: "Monsters!" (5:49–6:09)
* VI: "The Ghost of the Aragon" (6:10–6:44)
* VII: "[[Danforth Avenue|Danforth]] and [[Pape Village|Pape]]" (6:45–7:25)
* VIII: "The Waltz of the Shreves" (7:26–7:51)
* IX: "Never turn your back on a Monster!" (7:52–8:02)
* X: "Monsters! (Reprise)" (8:03–8:16)
* XI: "Strangiato theme (Reprise)" (8:17–9:20)
* XII: "A Farewell to Things" (9:20–9:37)

Live versions of "La Villa Strangiato" have often featured altered sections. For instance, on ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'', Lee sings part of a nursery rhyme over "Danforth and Pape" (the liner notes include a translation of his words) and adds a short bass solo during "Monsters! (Reprise)." During later tours, as documented on [[Rush in Rio]], a drum/bass vamp was inserted before "Strangiato Theme (Reprise)," over which Lifeson made a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] rant. The classical guitar introduction was either played on electric guitar or, more commonly, cut out altogether. During the 2010-2011 [[Time Machine Tour]], the piece began with a [[polka]] rendition of "To sleep, perchance to dream," then transitioned into the original arrangement.

The band set out to record the song in one take, however it ultimately required three separate takes. According to Lee, "We spent more time recording 'Strangiato' than the entire ''[[Fly By Night (album)|Fly By Night]]'' album.  It was our first piece without any vocals at all. So each section had to stand up with a theme and musical structure of its own."&lt;ref name="visions"&gt;Banasiewicz, Bill; ''Rush: Visions: The Official Biography'', Chapter 7, Omnibus Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The segments titled "Monsters!" and "Monsters! (Reprise)" are an adaptation of [[Raymond Scott|Raymond Scott's]] popular composition [[Powerhouse (song)|"Powerhouse"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Villa Strangiato / Powerhouse|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/view/39397/Rush-La%20Villa%20Strangiato_Raymond%20Scott-Powerhouse/|publisher=Who Sampled}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Scott's publishers did not attempt to take legal action until the statute of limitations had run out, Rush's management, feeling it was the right thing to do, gave some monetary compensation to Mr. and Mrs. Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Official Raymond Scott Site, FAQ. http://raymondscott.com/#faq&lt;/ref&gt;

"La Villa Strangiato" translates roughly to "The Strange Village" or "Weird City".&lt;ref name="visions"/&gt;

===YYZ===
{{main|YYZ (instrumental)}}
From the ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' album. "YYZ" (natively pronounced ''why-why-zed'') is the [[IATA airport code|airport code]] for the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], and the instrumental opens with a rhythm in 5/4 that is [[Morse code]] for "YYZ" (-.-- -.-- --..).  The piece evolved into a drum/bass solo during the 1980s. "YYZ" was the first of six Rush songs (over three decades) to be nominated for a [[Grammy]] in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].

From the ''[[Roll the Bones]]'' album, "'''Where's My Thing?'''" was Rush's second song nominated for a Grammy, losing to [[Eric Johnson]]'s [[Cliffs of Dover (song)|"Cliffs of Dover"]]. The song has a pop-oriented feel, featuring an upbeat tempo and a brass-like synthesizer line.  On the original album, it is humorously subtitled "'''Part IV: 'Gangster of Boats' Trilogy'''."  The song was performed on the ''Roll the Bones'' tour and did not appear in concert again until the 2012 [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], with an added drum solo. This version of the song was titled "Where's My Thing?/Here It Is!" on the live album ''[[Clockwork Angels Tour (album)|Clockwork Angels Tour]]''.

It was then omitted from the set lists until 2010's [[Time Machine Tour]].

This track was the third song nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1994, losing to [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Marooned (song)|Marooned]]."

From the ''[[Test for Echo]]'' album. Like the "2112 Overture," "Limbo" features vocals by Lee; however, he does not sing any lyrics. The song includes spoken samples from [[Bobby Pickett|Bobby "Boris" Pickett]]'s novelty song "[[Monster Mash]]."

===The Main Monkey Business, Hope, and Malignant Narcissism===

Rush's album ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows]]'' is the first Rush album to feature multiple instrumental tracks: "[[The Main Monkey Business]]", "[[Hope (instrumental)|Hope]]", and "[[Malignant Narcissism (instrumental)|Malignant Narcissism]]". "The Main Monkey Business" is just over six minutes long. As with "Limbo" and "2112 Overture", Lee's voice is briefly heard, but no words are sung. The other two songs, "Hope" and "Malignant Narcissism", are two of the shortest songs ever recorded by Rush, both being just over two minutes long. "Hope" is a solo guitar piece written by Lifeson. "Malignant Narcissism" features Lee playing a [[Fretless guitar|fretless bass]] and Peart on a four-piece drum kit.&lt;ref&gt;Peart, Neil: [http://rush.com/thegameofsnakesandarrows/Rush.Essay4.S&amp;A.pdf The Game of Snakes and Arrows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421054633/http://www.rush.com/thegameofsnakesandarrows/Rush.Essay4.S%26A.pdf |date=2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Malignant Narcissism" contains a spoken sample, "Usually a case of malignant narcissism brought on during childhood," from the movie ''[[Team America: World Police]]''. "Malignant Narcissism" became the fifth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance, in 2008, losing to Bruce Springsteen's "Once Upon A Time In The West".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx#04 GRAMMY.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208065050/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/50th_Show/list.aspx |date=2007-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A live recording of "Hope" from the album ''[[Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace]]'' became the sixth Rush instrumental to be nominated for a Grammy under the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#04 GRAMMY.com 2009 site&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205000233/http://content.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |date=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It lost to [[Zappa Plays Zappa]]'s "[[Peaches en Regalia]]".

}}
Found on the ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]'' live album, "Broon's Bane" is a short classical guitar arrangement performed by Lifeson as an extended intro to "[[The Trees (Rush song)|The Trees]]." The song is named after [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], nicknamed "Broon" by the band, who produced ''Exit...Stage Left'' and 10 [[Rush discography|other Rush albums]]. (On the same album, Lee refers to Brown as "T.C. Broonsie" when introducing "Jacob's Ladder.") It is not featured on any other live or studio recording by [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. The song repeats and builds upon the same three-beat line, coming to a climax about one minute into the piece before segueing into "The Trees."

===Cygnus X-1 (Live Recordings)===

On the live album ''[[Rush in Rio]]'', an abridged version of "Cygnus X-1" is performed as an instrumental. The piece consists of the "Prologue" section of the song, without the spoken introduction. The [[Moog Taurus]] synthesizer heard in the studio recording is replaced with a choir-like synthesizer sound.

On the [[R40 Live Tour]], the Prelude of Book II was played, transposed down by one whole step due to Lee's decreased vocal range. Immediately afterward, the band played the first and third parts of Book I as instrumentals, with a Peart drum solo as an interlude between them.

The opening song of Rush's 2004 tour dates featured an instrumental combining sections of one song from each of the band's first six albums.

The songs featured in the medley were:
#"[[Finding My Way (song)|Finding My Way]]'" (''[[Rush (Rush album)|Rush]]'')
#"[[Fly by Night (album)|Anthem]]" (''[[Fly by Night (album)|Fly by Night]]'')
#"[[Bastille Day (song)|Bastille Day]]" (''[[Caress of Steel]]'')

#"[[Cygnus X-1 (song series)|Cygnus X-1 Prologue]]" (''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'')
#"[[Cygnus X-1 (song series)|Hemispheres Prelude]]" (''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'')

===O'Malley's Break===
During the 2010-11 Time Machine Tour, Lifeson would perform a brief 12-string guitar piece (entitled "O'Malley's Break" on the CD and DVD) that segued into "[[Closer to the Heart]]."

===Peke's Repose===
During the 2012 [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], Lifeson would play a guitar solo (called "Peke's Repose" on the CD/DVD/BD) that served as an introduction to "[[Clockwork Angels|Halo Effect]]".

===Neil Peart's drum solos===
A staple and highlight of Rush's concerts is a [[drum solo]] by Neil Peart. These solos have been featured on every live album released by the band. On the early live albums (''[[All the World's a Stage (album)|All the World's a Stage]]'' and ''[[Exit...Stage Left]]''), the drum solo was included as part of a song ("Working Man/Finding My Way" and "YYZ," respectively). On all subsequent live albums, the drum solo has been included on a separate track. On ''[[A Show of Hands]]'' and ''[[Different Stages (Rush album)|Different Stages]]'', the drum solos were titled "The Rhythm Method" (a pun on the [[calendar-based methods|form of birth control]]); on ''[[Rush in Rio]]'', it was entitled "O Baterista"; and on ''[[R30 Live In Frankfurt]]'' it was titled "Der Trommler". On Rush's 2008 live album, ''[[Snakes &amp; Arrows Live]]'', it is titled "De Slagwerker," and is coupled with "Malignant Narcissism" on the track-list. "O Baterista" was the fourth song nominated for a Grammy, in 2005, losing to [[Brian Wilson]]'s "[[Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (song)|Mrs. O'Leary's Cow]]". For the 2010 [[Time Machine Tour]], the solo was called "Love 4 Sale," but was renamed "Moto Perpetuo" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.

The titles "O Baterista", "Der Trommler" and "De Slagwerker" all translate to "The Drummer" in Portuguese, German and Dutch respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Drummer | publisher = Woxikon.com | url =http://www.woxikon.com/eng/drummer.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Peart's drum solos include a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, leaving each performance unique.&lt;ref&gt;Drummer translations, Hudson Music, 2005, DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Each successive tour sees the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favor of newer, more-complex ones. Since the mid-late 1980s Peart has utilized [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], [[glockenspiel]], [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], [[tubular bell]]s, [[timpani]] and [[vibra-slap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion. Some purely electronic, description-defying sounds are also used. All are incorporated into each drum solo.

Peart's solos from 1987 until 2007 included [[marimba]] excerpts from "Pieces of Eight," a piece that first appeared as a [[flexi disc]] record in the May 1987 issue of ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' magazine. In addition, all solos since 1991 have contained marimba portions of another Peart composition entitled "Momo's Dance Party," and those from 1991 to 2004 featured a complex pattern from the song "Scars" (from the studio album ''[[Presto (album)|Presto]]''). For the ''[[Vapor Trails]]'' and R30 tours, each solo concluded with a section of the [[Count Basie]] standard "[[One O'Clock Jump]]," which Peart recorded while producing ''Burning For Buddy'', a two-volume tribute album to legendary [[big band]] drummer and bandleader, [[Buddy Rich]]. For the Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour, Peart replaced the finale with an excerpt from "[[Cotton Tail]]," which he recorded with the Buddy Rich Band in the mid-1990s. For the [[Time Machine Tour]], Peart again replaced the finale with an excerpt from the Buddy Rich standard "[[Love for Sale (song)|Love for Sale]]," which he also performed with the Buddy Rich Big Band at a 2008 memorial concert. He initially named the solo after that song, calling it "Love 4 Sale," but eventually changed the name to "Moto Perpetuo" for the CD and DVD release in November 2011.

For the [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], Peart played three short drum solos instead of a single long one: an interlude during "Where's My Thing?" in the first set, then an interlude during "Headlong Flight" and a lead-in to "[[Red Sector A]]" in the second. The solos were respectively named "Here It Is!", "Drumbastica," and "The Percussor - (I) Binary Love Theme / (II) Steambanger's Ball" on the tour's live album/DVD release. "The Percussor" is a mainly electronic drum solo dominated by the sounds of triggered samples assigned to many parts of Peart's kit.

For the [[R40 Live Tour]], Peart played two short solos: the "Drumbastica" interlude during "Headlong Flight" in the first set, and an interlude named "The Story So Far" during "Cygnus X-1" in the second.

{{nihongo|'''''Metal Slug'''''|メタルスラッグ|Metaru Suraggu|lead=yes}} is a series primarily of [[run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[video game]]s created by [[SNK Playmore|SNK]]. Spin-off games include a [[third-person shooter]] and a [[tower defense]] game. Originally created for [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] arcade machines and game consoles, the original games have also been [[porting|ported]] to other [[video game console|consoles]], with several later games created for various other platforms. The games focus on the Peregrine Falcon Squad, a small group of soldiers who fight against a rebel army, aliens and various other forces intent on world domination.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay of the series is characteristic of run and gun games: large numbers of enemies and a player character with extremely powerful weapons. In most run and guns, contact with an enemy leads to damage.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In this series, however, contact results in the opportunity to perform a melee attack and the opportunity for the enemy to perform a melee attack of his own, if he has one. The player's melee attack is also much stronger than most shots. This leads to the players ability to run in and use melee attacks to take down a number of enemies, and the ability to quickly defeat enemies that can take plenty of damage, such as the mummies in ''Metal Slug 2''.

The player starts with only a simple handgun; as the game progresses, the player may pick up new weapons. The player can only use one weapon at a time. When a new weapon is found, it replaces the previous one. Similarly, when [[ammunition]] runs out, the player reverts to using the handgun, which has unlimited ammunition. A new system was implemented with ''[[Metal Slug 6]]'' allowing players to carry and switch between the handgun and two other weapons. The player is also equipped with [[grenades]] which can be used to throw at enemies and cause more damage, however the number of grenades is limited and must be replenished periodically with ammunition found along the way.

The SV-001 (SV being an abbreviation for "Super Vehicle") or 'Metal Slug' is the main vehicle of the ''Metal Slug'' franchise. It is a small, [[cartoonish]] silver-gray [[tank]] propelled by [[continuous track|caterpillar treads]]. The tank is armed with one [[cannon]] which shoots powerful bombs in limited numbers, and twin [[vulcan cannon]]s which shoot unlimited tracer bullets. The vehicle can jump and crouch. Crouching opens a hatch on the top of the tank through which grenades already in the player's possession can be thrown. The grenades remain independent of the cannon's ammunition system. The vehicle's bombs can also be replenished with ammunition boxes found along the way. The vehicle can run over infantry and perform a suicide attack, with the driver jumping clear and the tank ramming into and exploding upon the target. The vehicle can take three direct hits before it is destroyed, at which point a warning will be given to eject before the vehicle explodes. The enemy chaser variant has a shield that must be destroyed before the vehicle can be destroyed.

Over time, these specifications changed into any vehicle armed with a vulcan cannon and a cannon variant suited to the role of the vehicle, and propelled suitably for that vehicle's environment. Some vehicles will only provide vulcan cannons (which are more powerful than the handgun's bullets and are also unlimited), but neither special bombs (grenades must be used) nor armored protection to the player. In ''Metal Slug 6'' (and the home version of ''Metal Slug'' X, 3, 4, 5), the playable character Tarma can lock the vulcan cannons into one position and fire continuously.

Metal Slug games typically have 6 levels. The exceptions are [[Metal Slug 3]], [[Metal Slug 5]], and [[Metal Slug 6]], which have 5 and [[Metal Slug 7]] which has 7.  In several of the arcade and console versions, the game would have the blood censored, showing white blood instead of red. However, there is a code to disable this censor.

==Games==
{{Main|List of Metal Slug video games}}

===Platforms===
Metal Slug 1 through to 5 were created for [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo-Geo]], though some of these titles were later ported to platforms including the [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]], [[Virtual Console]], [[PlayStation Network]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and also for PC via [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. Subsequent main games and spin-offs were created for platforms including [[Nintendo DS]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]]. A collection of the first seven games in the main series, including the ''Metal Slug X'' remake, ''[[Metal Slug Anthology]]'', is available for the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation Portable]], and [[PlayStation 2]], with a similar collection, ''Metal Slug Collection PC'', being available for PC, while a revamped version of the seventh game, [[Metal Slug XX]] is separately sold from the collection. A spin-off [[tower defense]] game, ''Metal Slug Defense'', was created for iOS and Android. Another spin-off game, ''Metal Slug Touch'', was created just for iOS in 2009, though was removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] in 2012.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The first game's story involved the Peregrine Falcon (PF) Squad, a small but skilled team of soldiers serving under the Regular Army's special operations division, who fight against the army of General Donald Morden in order to prevent a massive coup d'état and the creation of a New World Order. Later games featured characters from the Sparrows Unit, which is under the control of the Regular Army's intelligence division. Beginning with ''Metal Slug 2'', the PF Squad also battles an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] threat to Earth (the Mars People), as well as several other [[supernatural]] threats including [[yeti]]s, [[zombie]]s, ambulatory Venus flytraps, giant crabs, and [[mummy|mummies]]. These outlandish elements were removed from the fourth game to return to the feel of the original title. The fifth moved to the motif of modern guerrilla warfare, leaving only traces of the series' signature quirky humor and paranormal enemies, with the exception of the final boss.  ''Metal Slug 6'' returned to the plot of the first three installments, bringing back Morden's Rebel Army and the Mars People. ''Metal Slug 7'' has less outlandish elements with the Mars People replaced by an alternative universe of Morden's Army with futuristic equipment and weapons.

Marco Rossi and Tarma Roving were the only playable characters in the first game, and each was reserved solely to the first and second player, respectively. From the second installment, characters can be chosen independently, and Eri Kasamoto and Fiolina "Fio" Germi were added to the cast. These four are typically considered to be the quintessential ''Metal Slug'' team. In the fourth game, Nadia Cassel and Trevor Spacey made their debut, replacing Eri and Tarma. They have not returned in later games, as they were created by the Korean-based Mega Enterprise and due to Playmore retaining intellectual rights to all SNK titles. Eri and Tarma returned in the fifth game. The Game Boy Advance edition of the game features two new characters specific to that title: PF squad trainees Walter Ryan and Tyra Elson. ''[[The King of Fighters]]''/''[[Ikari Warriors]]'' characters [[Ralf Jones]] and Clark Still have appeared since ''Metal Slug 6'', and their ''King of Fighters'' teammate [[Leona Heidern]] is available as an extra downloadable character for ''Metal Slug XX'', a revised edition of ''[[Metal Slug 7]]''.

;Enemies
General Donald Morden is the main [[antagonist]] of the ''Metal Slug'' franchise. He is depicted as a rambling madman wearing a beret, eyepatch, and wearing his army's uniform. He appears in every game except ''Metal Slug 5.'' He apparently mends his ways by the end of ''Metal Slug 6'', as he (or Rootmars depending on the player(s)' chosen route) rescues the player(s) after they are knocked off a wall by an explosion caused by the alien end boss. His army is the main force of opposition in the Metal Slug games, with the exception of ''Metal Slug'' 5 and 6.  He commands the Rebel Army, and in ''Metal Slug 4'' he was thought to be behind the Amadeus Terror Syndicate. He once again returns to his roots of attempted world domination in ''Metal Slug 7'', this time with the help of the Rebel Army from the future, also being the final boss for the first time since the original ''Metal Slug''. Like the main characters, General Morden appears in various SNK games as a cameo, especially in the ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'' series.

Allen O'Neil, a sub-boss, appears in all of the games except Metal Slug 5 and 6. He returns in Metal Slug 7. He uses an [[M60 machine gun]], a knife, and grenades. Despite the fact that Allen is clearly killed at the conclusion of every encounter, the game makers have humorously brought him back in each new iteration of the series. Allen's son, Allen Jr., appears in ''[[Metal Slug Advance]]'' as the recruits' drill sergeant but later reveals himself as a double-agent for the Rebel Army. He can be fought in the final mission as an optional boss.

The Mars People are [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]s that are in a plot to take over Earth in the ''Metal Slug'' universe. They resemble squids, using their tentacles as a form of movement, and a strange fighting style which involves gas and a laser pistol. In ''Metal Slug 2'', they appeared as enemies near the climax of the game, with their [[mothership]] appearing as the final boss. They appear again in ''Metal Slug 3'', abducting Morden and one of the members of the Regular Army in the final level (which ever one the player uses will be abducted), only for the Regular Army and Morden's army to take the fight to their mothership and defeat them, and their leader Rootmars.  In ''Metal Slug 6'', the Mars People, Morden, as well as his rebel army, and the Ikari Warriors, join forces with the Regular Army to fight a new alien invader who feeds on the Mars People. In ''Metal Slug X'' they appear as enemies early in the game. Mars People also are the first characters from the ''Metal Slug'' series who appear in a fighting game: first in ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos]]'' as a hidden (but playable) character, and later in ''Neo Geo Battle Coliseum'' as an unlockable playable character.

'''''Metal Slug Zero Online''''' was a [[massively multiplayer online game]], part of the ''Metal Slug'' series. It was being developed by [[SNK Playmore]], Namco Bandai Games, and [[Sammy Corporation]] for the South Korean market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Slug OL: Released in 2009|url=http://feature.mmosite.com/content/2008-12-01/20081201193827139,1.shtml|publisher=mmosite.com|accessdate=20 January 2014|archivedate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no word on a Japanese or North American release. The game was on course for a 2009 release, however in summer of 2009, developer Dragonfly suspended development of the game due to their belief that the achievement of ''Metal Slug Zero Online'' being developed by Wiz Hands is far below their expectation, and the game could not conform to the trend of current gaming industry. The online game ended 24 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metal Slug Zero Online Development Suspense|url=http://news.mmosite.com/content/2009-07-30/20090730010404902,1.shtml|publisher=mmosite.com|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The aspect of the ''Metal Slug'' series was to create a simple, but exciting side-scrolling shoot-em-up game with a very easy control scheme (one joystick and three buttons). The same team that created ''Metal Slug'' for the Neo-Geo previously created several games for [[Irem (company)|Irem]] which have very similar graphics and gameplay, such as ''[[GunForce]]'' (1991), ''[[In the Hunt]]'' (1993) and ''[[Gunforce 2]]'' (1994). Because of this, some fans {{who|date=January 2018}} refer to ''Gunforce 2'' as "''Metal Slug Zero''".

Some of the stock sound effects and sprites from Irem and [[The King of Fighters]] titles were used in the ''Metal Slug'' games. The music was composed by Takushi Hiyamuta (who is credited as ''Hiya!''), a key member of the [[Nazca Corporation]], which was acquired by SNK in 1996. The first 3 titles were developed by the ''Nazca'' team before SNK declared bankruptcy in October 2001, leading to the disbandment of the original team. Anticipating the collapse of SNK, the company Playmore was launched August 2001, which became known as [[SNK Playmore]] in 2003, the year after ''Metal Slug 4'' was released. Development on the series has since continued without the original staff.

'''Monastic sign languages''' have been used in Europe from at least the 10th century by [[Christian]] [[monk]]s, and some, such as [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] and [[Trappists|Trappist]] sign, are still in use today—not only in Europe but also in Japan, China and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;*'''Benedictine''' : {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} &lt;br /&gt;*'''Cistercian''' :  Barakat, Robert. (1975). ''Cistercian sign language: A study in non-verbal communication.'' Cistercian Studies Series, 7.

Cîteaux: Commentarii cistercienses, Vol. 52 (3-4), pp. 211-230&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike deaf [[sign language]]s, they are better understood as forms of symbolic [[gesture|gestural]] communication rather than [[language]]s, and some writers have preferred to describe them as sign [[lexicon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Barley, Nigel F. (1974). ''Two Anglo-Saxon sign systems compared.'' Semiotica, 12, 227–237. (see pp. 234–35 on this point).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The purposes for which these sign lexicons were used were varied. Travelling [[Franciscan]] [[friars]] used [[fingerspelling|finger alphabet]]s, possibly as memory aids for preaching, and in [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Monastery|monasteries]], signs representing words were used for limited communication when silence was required. Rather than the popularly imagined total "[[Vow]]s of Silence," the [[Rule of St. Benedict]] actually dictates that conversation is only not allowed in certain areas of the monastery and during certain hours of the day. It was only much later, in the 17th century, that certain Cistercian and Trappist orders came to see absolute silence as a penance to endure along with the other deprivations of their austere lives.&lt;ref&gt;Bragg, Lois (1997). ''Visual-Kinetic Communication in Europe Before 1600: A Survey of Sign Lexicons and Finger Alphabets Prior to the Rise of Deaf Education'' Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education 2:1 Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs==
Signs are well documented in medieval Benedictine monasteries of Western Europe, from Portugal to England. Antique texts present lists of words with accompanying signs, including instructions for sign production, and occasionally also the rationale for the choice of sign. Signs are mostly [[noun]]s relating to monastic life, such as foods, articles of clothing, particular rooms and buildings, ritual objects, and the many different ranks of clerical office. The few signs that act as [[verb]]s include "sit," "stand up," "kneel," and "confess."&lt;ref&gt;Rijnberk, G. van (1954). ''Le langage par signes chez le moines.'' Amsterdam: North-Holland. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; They almost always bear an [[iconic]] or visually motivated connection to the thing represented by the sign. No grammar is described for these signs, and they were probably used in the [[word order]] of an oral language—either Latin or the local vernacular—and possibly with accompanying gesture such as pointing. Modern Cistercian monks in England or the United States use a syntax derived "heavily, but not exclusively," from English,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, N. S. (1981). ''Speech, writing, and sign: A functional view of linguistic representation.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press. p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; while Cistercian monks in France loosely follow the syntax of the French language; at least as much as it is possible to do so, given the limited lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;Barakat, R. (1975). ''Cistercian sign language: A study in non-verbal communication.'' Cistercian Studies Series, 11. Kalamazoo, Michigan: Cistercian Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Vocabulary lists in the medieval texts ranged from 52 signs to 472, with "the average at 178 and a mean at 145."&lt;ref&gt;Calculations by Bragg (1997), using data from Rijnberk (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Benedictine sign books date from around 1075 (and again at about 1083) at the [[Abbey of Cluny]]&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard of Cluny, ''De notitia signorum'', in: Umiker-Sebeok et al., Monastic Sign Languages, Approaches to Semiotics 76 (1987), Amsterdam: Benjamins, 345-4&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[France]]), and [[Hirsau Abbey]]&lt;ref&gt;''Constitutions Hirsaugienses.'' Book I, ch. 6-25. In J.-P. Migne, (Ed.), Patrologiae: Cusus Completus (Paris, 1844-64), vol. 150, colo. 940-57.&lt;/ref&gt; (in what is now [[Germany]]) at around the same time. [[Bonaventure]] in the 13th century used a finger alphabet,&lt;ref&gt;Werner H. (1932). ''Geschichte des Taubstummenproblems bis ins 17, Jahrhundert'' ("History of the deaf-mute problem in the 17th century"). Jena, Germany: Verlag von Gustav Fisher; 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; and the medieval ''Monasteriales Indicia'' describes 127 signs used by Anglo-Saxon Benedictine monks.&lt;ref&gt;''Monasteriales Indicia: The Anglo-Saxon Monastic Sign Language'', Edited with notes and translation by Debby Banham. {{ISBN|0-9516209-4-0}}. &lt;!-- this link is broken: [http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/english/Indicia.htm Text online]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A Portuguese list from the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, M.

The current '''national anthem of Mauritania''' ({{lang-ar|نشيد وطني موريتاني}}), also known by its incipit "'''Bilada-l ubati-l hudati-l kiram'''" ({{Lang-en|The Country of Fatherhood is the Honorable Gift}}; {{Lang-fr|Le pays de la paternité est l'honorable cadeau}}), was adopted on 16 November 2017 and was composed by [[Rageh Daoud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=قصة نشيد موريتانيا الجديد.. وسر الدور المصري (in Arabic)|url=https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/north-africa/2018/02/10/%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, following a [[Mauritanian constitutional referendum, 2017|referendum]] to amend the constitution of July 1991, the [[National Assembly (Mauritania)|Mauritanian National Assembly]] adopted a new national anthem to replace [[National anthem of Mauritania (1960–2017)|the previous one]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Assemblée Nationale adopte le projet de loi constitutionnelle portant révision de la constitution du 20 juillet 1991|url=http://fr.ami.mr/Depeche-39905.html|publisher=Agence Mauritanienne d'Information|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rolandfealty.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Roland]] receives the sword [[Durandal]] from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]]. From a manuscript of a ''[[chanson de geste]]''.]]
The '''paladins''' ({{etymology|la|palātīnus|servant, government official}}&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;), sometimes known as the '''Twelve Peers''', were the foremost warriors of [[Charlemagne]]'s court, according to the literary cycle known as the [[Matter of France]].&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50169459?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=paladin&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 "Paladin"]. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They first appear in the early ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', where they represent [[Christian]] valour against the [[Saracen]] hordes inside Europe.

The paladins and their associated exploits are largely later fictional inventions, with some basis in historical [[Franks|Frankish]] retainers of the 8th century and events such as the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] in 778 and the confrontation of the [[Frankish Empire]] with [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Al-Andalus]] in the ''[[Marca Hispanica]]''.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded instance of the word ''paladin'' in the [[English language]] dates to 1592, in ''Delia'' (Sonnet XLVI) by [[Samuel Daniel]].&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; It entered English through the [[Middle French]] word ''paladin'', which itself derived from the Latin ''palatinus''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; All these words for [[Charlemagne]]'s Twelve Peers descend ultimately from the [[Latin]] ''[[palatine|palatinus]],'' most likely through the [[Old French]] ''palatin''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

The Latin ''palatinus'' referred to an official of the [[Roman Emperor]] connected to the imperial palace on the [[Palatine Hill]]. Over time this word came to refer to other high-level officials in the imperial, majestic and royal courts.&lt;ref name="Palatine"&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50169581?query_type=word&amp;queryword=palatine&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=BPdQ-U5f5Hu-11411&amp;hilite=50169581 "Palatine"]. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. Retrieved November 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[palatine]], used in various European countries in the medieval and modern eras, has the same derivation.&lt;ref name="Palatine"/&gt;

By the 13th century words referring specifically to Charlemagne's peers began appearing in European languages; the earliest is the Italian ''paladino''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Modern French has ''paladin'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] has ''paladín'' or ''paladino'' (reflecting alternate derivations from the French and Italian), while [[German language|German]] has ''Paladin''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; By extension, ''paladin'' has come to refer to any chivalrous hero such as [[King Arthur]]'s [[Knights of the Round Table]].&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;

''Paladin'' was also used to refer to the leaders of armies supporting the Protestant [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]] ending in 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Peter H. ''The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy'', Harvard University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Rolandslied.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''Roland stürmt den Tempel Mahomets'' – Roland storms the temple of Muhammad, ''[[:de:Codex Palatinus Germanicus|Codex Palatinus Germanicus]]'', 12th century.]]
In their earliest appearances the paladins were not the companions of Charlemagne, but of his vassal [[Roland]]. This Roland is based on the historical figure [[Roland|Hruodland]] mentioned by Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] as a Lord of the [[Breton March]] who died in the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] in 778. Nothing else is known of him.&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Paul Edward, ed. and trans. ''Charlemagne's Courtier: The Complete Einhard'', pp. 21–22. Peterborough, Ontario, Canada: Broadview Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 12th century the paladins were increasingly thought of as an association reporting to the king after the fashion of the [[Round Table]]; the earliest romance to portray them in this way is ''[[Fierabras]]'', dating to around 1170.

The names of the twelve paladins vary from romance to romance, and often more than twelve are named. The number is popular because it resembles the [[Twelve Apostles]] giving the king the position of [[Jesus]] as a reminder of his holy mission as ruler.{{citation needed|reason=The number twelve has other connotations.  Evidence is needed to support this claim.|date=June 2015}}
All Carolingian paladin stories feature paladins named Roland and [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]]; other recurring characters are [[Turpin (archbishop)|Archbishop Turpin]], [[Ogier the Dane]], [[Huon of Bordeaux]], [[Fierabras]], [[Renaud de Montauban]] and [[Ganelon]]. Tales of the paladins once rivaled the stories of [[King Arthur]] and the knights of the Round Table in popularity.

The paladins figure into many ''chansons de geste'' and other tales associated with Charlemagne. In the above-mentioned ''Fierabras'', they retrieve holy relics stolen from [[Rome]] by the [[Saracen]] giant Fierabras and (in some versions) convert him to Christianity and recruit him to their ranks. In ''[[Le Pèlerinage de Charlemagne]]'' they accompany their king on a pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]] in order to outdo the [[Byzantine Emperor]] Hugo.

=== ''The Song of Roland'' (11th–12th century) ===
Their greatest moments come in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', which depicts their defense of Charlemagne's army against the Saracens of [[Al-Andalus]], and their deaths at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] due to the treachery of [[Ganelon]]. ''The Song of Roland'' lists the twelve paladins as [[Roland]], [[Charlemagne]]'s nephew and the chief hero among the paladins; [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]], Roland's friend and strongest ally; and Gérin, Gérier (these two are killed in the same ''laisse'' [123] by the same Saracen, Grandonie), Bérengier, Otton, Samson, Engelier, Ivon, Ivoire, Anséis, Girard (similar spellings are possible).&lt;ref&gt;Conradus the priest (12th century), ''Song of Roland''. {{ISBN|3-920153-02-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other characters elsewhere considered part of the twelve appear in the song, such as [[Turpin (archbishop)|Archbishop Turpin]] and [[Ogier the Dane]].

=== Boiardo and Ariosto (16th century) ===
The [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] authors [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] and [[Ludovico Ariosto]], whose works were once as widely read and respected as [[William Shakespeare]]'s, contributed prominently to the literary and poetical reworking of the tales of the epic deeds of the paladins. Their works, ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' and ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', send the paladins on even more fantastic adventures than their predecessors. They list the paladins quite differently, but keep the number at twelve.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Grace, "La Passion du Palatinus: mystère du XIVe siècle," in ''Les Classiques français du moyen âge'' (30) Paris 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiardo and Ariosto's paladins are [[Roland|Orlando]] (Roland), [[Charlemagne]]'s nephew and the chief hero among the paladins; [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]], the rival to Roland; Ferumbras ([[Fierabras]]), the Saracen who became a Christian; [[Astolpho]], descended from [[Charles Martel]] and cousin to Orlando; [[Ogier the Dane]]; [[Ganelon]] the betrayer, who appears in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXXII|''The Divine Comedy'', Canto XXXII]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rinaldo ([[Renaud de Montauban]]); Malagigi ([[Maugris]]), a sorcerer; Florismart, a friend to Orlando; Guy de Bourgogne; Namo ([[Naimon]] or Namus), Duke of Bavaria, Charlemagne's trusted adviser; and Otuel, another converted Saracen.

The Italian ''Orlandos'' inspired a number of composers over the next few centuries, who created operas and other musical works on Orlando and the paladins. Afterwards the Charlemagne material went into decline. While the Arthurian legend experienced a major revival in the 19th century in the hands of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poets, writers, and artists, ensuring that Arthur and his knights are well known into the 21st century, no such resurgence occurred for Charlemagne and his paladins. Modern adaptations and reworkings including the Carolingian paladins are few and far between, but the concept of the chivalrous "paladin" lives on.

=== Modern examples ===
In the fantasy novel ''[[The Castle of Iron]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Fletcher Pratt]], a man from the 20th century, [[Harold Shea]], uses mathematics to travel to the world of [[Orlando Furioso]].

The hero of the television program ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' takes the name Paladin and has a picture of a chess knight on his calling card.

'''Pathos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|oʊ|s}}; plural: ''pathea''; {{Lang-el|[[wiktionary:πάθος|πάθος]]}}, for "[[suffering]]" or "[[experience]]"; [[adjective|adjectival]] form: ''pathetic'' from {{lang|el|παθητικός}}) [[appeal to emotion|appeallogic  to the emotions]] of the audience and elicits [[feeling]]s that already reside in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMXxhuVU-SYC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Pathos+emotional+appeal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUnbULPeFaeD4gT82YGgBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pathos%20emotional%20appeal&amp;f=false |title=Strategic Business Communication: For Leaders |author=Robyn Walker |publisher=Google Books |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathos is a communication technique used most often in [[rhetoric]] (in which it is considered one of the three [[modes of persuasion]], alongside [[ethos]] and [[logos]]), as well as in literature, film, and other narrative art.

[[Emotion]]al appeal can be accomplished in many ways, such as the following:
* by a [[metaphor]] or [[storytelling]], commonly known as a [[hook (rhetoric)|hook]];
* by [[passion (emotion)|passion]] in the delivery of the speech or writing, as determined by the audience; and
* by personal [[anecdote]].

==Aristotle’s text on pathos==
In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', [[Aristotle]] identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is "awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired."&lt;ref name=CivDis&gt;Aristotle, and George Alexander Kennedy. ''Aristotle On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse''. New York: Oxford UP, 1991. Print. p.119&lt;/ref&gt; In the first chapter, he includes the way in which "men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects" (Book 2.1.2–3).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that "to understand the emotions—that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24–1356a25).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good [[ethos]] in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5–9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

Aristotle details what individual emotions are useful to a speaker (Book 2.2.27).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; In doing so, Aristotle focused on whom, toward whom, and why, stating that "[i]t is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions." He also arranges the emotions with one another so that they may counteract one another. For example, one would pair sadness with happiness (Book 2.1.9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

With this understanding, Aristotle argues for the [[rhetor]] to understand the entire situation of goals and audiences to decide which specific emotion the speaker would exhibit or call upon in order to persuade the audience. Aristotle’s theory of pathos has three main foci: the frame of mind the audience is in, the variation of emotion between people, and the influence the rhetor has on the emotions of the audience. Aristotle classifies the third of this trio as the ultimate goal of pathos.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aristotle|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=On Rhetoric|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Aristotle outlines the individual importance of persuasive emotions, as well as the combined effectiveness of these emotions on the audience. Moreover, Aristotle pointedly discusses pleasure and pain in relation to the reactions these two emotions cause in an audience member.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt; According to Aristotle, emotions vary from person to person. Therefore, he stresses the importance of understanding specific social situations in order to successfully utilize pathos as a mode of persuasion.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt;

Aristotle identifies the introduction and the conclusion as the two most important places for an emotional appeal in any persuasive argument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Irving|title=Some Conceptions on Emotional Appeal in Rhetorical Theory|journal=Speech Monographs|year=1939|volume=6|issue=1|pages=66–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathos in politics ===
Pathos has its hand in politics as well, primarily in speech and how to persuade the audience. Mshvenieradze states that "Pathos is directly linked with an audience. Audience is a collective subject of speakers on which an orator tries to impact by own argumentation." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA353321541&amp;asid=9d2bc550dad3214ec473c84fe078fe62.&amp;authCount=1|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to how Aristotle discusses how to effectively utilize pathos in rhetoric, the way in which one appeals to the reader is similar in appealing to an audience of voters. In the case of politics and politicians, it is primarily more in argumentative writing and speaking. In Book II of Aristotle's writing's in ''Rhetoric,'' in essence knowing people's emotions helps to enable one to act with words versus writing alone, to earn another's credibility and faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Aristotle's teachings expanded, many other groups of thinkers would go on to adopt different variations of political usage with the elements of pathos involved, which includes groups such as the Epicureans and Stoics.

==Alternative views on pathos==
Scholars have discussed the different interpretations of Aristotle’s views of [[rhetoric]] and his philosophy. Some believe that it is actually a myth, that Aristotle invented it entirely.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} In the second chapter of ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle's view on pathos changes from the use in discourse to the understanding of emotions and their effects. William Fortenbaugh pointed out that for the [[Sophist]] [[Gorgias]], "Being overcome with emotion is analogous to rape."&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo&gt;Fortenbaugh, ''W. W. Aristotle's Rhetoric on Emotions''. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1974. Print. p.232.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle opposed this view and created a systematic approach to pathos. Fortenbaugh argues that Aristotle's systematic approach to emotional appeals "depends upon correctly understanding the nature of individual emotions, upon knowing the conditions favorable to, the objects of, and the grounds for individual emotions".&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo/&gt;

Modern philosophers were typically more skeptical of the use of emotions in communication, with political theorists such as [[John Locke]] hoping to extract emotion from reasoned communication entirely. [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]] presents another view unlike the common systematic approach of Aristotle. Campbell explored whether appeals to emotion or passions would be "an unfair method of persuasion," identifying seven circumstances to judge emotions: probability, plausibility, importance, proximity in time, connection of place, relations to the persons concerned, and interest in the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, George, and Lloyd F. Bitzer. ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1963. Print.p.81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 84 BC ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' book of an unknown author theorizes that the conclusion is the most important place in a persuasive argument to consider emotions such as mercy or hatred, depending on the nature of the persuasion.&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anonymous|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St.Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "appeal to pity", as it is classified in ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', is a means to conclude by reiterating the major premise of the work and tying while incorporating an emotional sentiment. The author suggests ways in which to appeal to the pity of the audience: "We shall stir pity in our hearers by recalling vicissitudes of future; by comparing the prosperity we once enjoyed with our present adversity; by entreating those whose pity we seek to win, and by submitting ourselves to their mercy."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt; Additionally, the text impresses the importance of invoking kindness, humanity and sympathy upon the hearer. Finally, the author suggests that the appeal to pity be brief for "nothing dries more quickly than a tear."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt;

=== Other Hellenistic Groups ===
Aristotle's teachings would go on to influence many influential groups of thinkers. One such group of thinkers, the Epicureans who practiced Epicureanism, interpreted and placed pathos in much more colloquial means and situations. The group would place pathos in pleasure, and study it in almost every facet in regards to pleasure, analyzing emotional specificity that an individual may feel or may need to undergo to appreciate said pathos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=James|title=Epicureans and Cyrenaics on pleasure as a pathos|url=https://www.academia.edu/4695271/Epicureans_and_Cyrenaics_on_pleasure_as_a_pathos|journal=forthcoming in S. Marchand and F. Verde eds. Épicurisme et scepticisme, Rome: Sapienza Università Editrice: 127–44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathos before Aristotle==

The concept of emotional appeal existed in rhetoric long before Aristotle’s ''Rhetoric''. [[George A. Kennedy (classicist)|George A. Kennedy]], a well-respected, modern-day scholar, identifies the appeal to emotions in the newly formed democratic court system before 400 BC in his book, ''The Art of Persuasion in Greece''.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=George|title=The Art of Persuasion in Greece|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gorgias]], a Sophist who preceded Aristotle, was interested in the orator’s emotional appeal as well. Gorgias believed the orator was able to capture and lead the audience in any direction they pleased through the use of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"/&gt; In the ''Encomium of Helen'', Gorgias states that a soul can feel a particular sentiment on account of words such as sorrow and pity. Certain words act as "bringers-on of pleasure and takers-off of pain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorgias|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Bruce|first3=Herzberg|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Encomium of Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Gorgias equates emotional persuasion to the sensation of being overtaken by a drug: "[f]or just as different drug draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to disease and other to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick to soul."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Plato]] also discussed emotional appeal in rhetoric. Plato preceded Aristotle and therefore laid the groundwork, as did other Sophists, for Aristotle to theorize the concept of pathos. In his dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato discusses pleasure versus pain in the realm of pathos though in a fictional conversation between Gorgias and Socrates. The dialogue between several ancient rhetors that Plato created centers around the value of rhetoric, and the men incorporate aspects of pathos in their responses. Gorgias discredits pathos and instead promotes the use of [[ethos]] in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition Second Edition). Gorgias|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of Plato’s texts, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', his discussion of emotions is more pointed; however, he still does not outline exactly how emotions manipulate an audience.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Phaedrus|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato discusses the danger of emotions in oratory. He argues that emotional appeal in rhetoric should be used as the means to an end and not the point of the discussion.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"/&gt;

==Contemporary pathos==
[[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]], a contributor to the Scottish Enlightenment, was one of the first rhetoricians to incorporate scientific evidence into his theory of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Norman|title=Feeling and Emotion: A History of Theories|date=1937|publisher=American Book Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell relied heavily on a book written by physician [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], entitled ''[[Observations on Man]]''. The book synthesized emotions and neurology and introduced the concept that action is a result of impression. Hartley determined that emotions drive people to react to appeals based on circumstance but also passions made up of cognitive impulses.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt; Campbell argues that belief and persuasion depend heavily on the force of an emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=James|last2=Corbett|first2=Edward|title=The Rhetoric of Blair, Campbell, and Whately|date=1990|publisher=SIU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Campbell introduced the importance of the audience’s imagination and will on emotional persuasion that is equally as important as basic understanding of an argument.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"/&gt; Campbell, by drawing on the theories of rhetoricians before him, drew up a contemporary view of pathos that incorporates the psychological aspect of emotional appeal.

An orator’s reliance on emotional appeal is evident in modern-day speechmaking, but in some schools of thought this is seen primarily as psychological versus emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

=== Speech ===
Speech is one of the primary places where one sees the application of pathos. Pathos is in essence the driving force behind an argument, to hit the emotional pangs that allow the audience to relate to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA503310627&amp;asid=c070d952c2a30962a72ca6167914c0f4|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Any emotional response from the audience correlates to pathos used by the director. Pathos can also be utilized for manipulation and propaganda purposes and is very prevalent within the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriebuero.org/2089/defending-pathos-in-film-eisenstein/|title=Defending Pathos In Film {{!}} Theoriebüro - Zur Förderung kritischer Gesellschaftstheorie und emanzipatorischer Praxis|website=theoriebuero.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pillar of Shame''''' is a series of sculptures by [[Denmark|Danish]] artist [[Jens Galschiot]]. Each sculpture is an 8-metre tall statue of [[bronze]], [[copper]] or [[concrete]]. The sculpture was inaugurated at the NGO Forum of the [[FAO]] summit in [[Rome]] in 1996. Since then three other pillars have been erected, in [[Hong Kong]], [[Mexico]], and [[Brazil]]. A fourth one in [[Berlin]] was planned for completion in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/art_and_events/pos/berlin/ukposberlindok.htm The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Berlin]. Aidoh.dk. Retrieved on 2015-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the plan has not come to fruition due to various issues.&lt;ref name="aidoh.dk"&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/?categoryID=60 The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Berlin - a Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Terror]. Aidoh.dk. Retrieved on 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
According to Galschiot,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidoh.dk/art_and_events/pos/ukposdok.htm ''The Pillar of Shame'' — detailed description of the art happening that is being carried out by Jens Galschiot], Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; the sculptures remind people of a shameful event which must never recur. The torn and twisted bodies of the sculpture symbolize the degradation, devaluation and lack of respect for the individual. The black colour symbolizes grief and loss and the sculpture, which represents the victims, expresses the pain and the despair of the event. It can be used by both sides in complicated conflict situations, where it can be difficult to point out the guilty party.

== ''Pillar of Shame'' in Hong Kong ==
[[Image:HKU Pillar of Shame in Orange Color 02a.jpg|thumb|The ''Pillar of Shame'' in Haking Wong Podium of the [[University of Hong Kong]], 2008. The [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] painted the sculpture orange in support of [[The Color Orange]] project.
]]
The ''Pillar of Shame'' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|國殤之柱}}) in Hong Kong is a concrete sculpture, first erected in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] in 1997 to mark the eighth anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square massacre|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The statue depicts 50 torn and twisted bodies to symbolize those who died in the government crackdown. On the base of the statue, the history and pictures of the [[massacre]] are carved in  and engraved into the base, in both English and Chinese, are the words "The Tiananmen Massacre", "June&amp;nbsp;4th 1989" and "The old cannot kill the young forever."

The ''Pillar'' was first exhibited at the Candlelight Vigil in commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]] on 3 June 1997. Following the vigil on the night of 4 June 1997, local university students fought for a place to permanently home the statue.  After scuffles with the police and controversy with the university leadership, at 3 a.m. students succeeded in moving the 2-tonne statue onto the podium of the Haking Wong Building at the [[University of Hong Kong]], however the pieces were not assembled due to concerns that the floor was not strong enough. The ''Pillar'' was re-erected at the same place on 16 June 1997.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During the following months, the ''Pillar'' was exhibited at the following universities:
*[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] from 28 September 1997
*[[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan College]] from 2 November 1997
*[[Hong Kong Baptist University]] from 29 November 1997
*[[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] from 23 January 1998
*[[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] from 1 March 1998
*[[City University of Hong Kong]] from 29 March 1998.

On 31 May 1998, the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, the sculpture was returned to Victoria Park where a candlelit vigil was held. On the morning before the vigil, a self-professed artist splashed two buckets of red paint onto the ''Pillar'', claiming that "the blood of people is also my blood."&lt;ref&gt;Chu, Prisca &amp; Luk, Mandy (5 June 1999).

On 24 and 25 September 1998, [[The Hong Kong University Students' Union]] (HKUSU) held a general polling on a motion to home the ''Pillar of Shame'' at the University of Hong Kong on a long-term basis. The students' motion was carried, when 1,629 out of 2,190 voted to support,&lt;ref name=erect&gt;Lam Wan Rhonda (17 May 1999).

It was again exhibited at the 10th anniversary candlelit vigil of the Massacre in 1999 at Victoria Park.&lt;ref name=without&gt;Wong, Samantha (3 June 1999). "''Pillar of Shame'' still without a home" ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;  Without the University authorities' endorsement, the ''Pillar'' was moved back to the Haking Wong podium after the anniversary,&lt;ref name=without/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff reporter and agencies (6 June 1999) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=30205&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=19990606&amp;sear_year=1999 "Campus war of words over pillar"], ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; where has remained on display at; a silent tribute is held by HKUSU and [[The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] in May every year.

On 30 April 2008, the ''Pillar of Shame'' was painted orange as part of the project [[The Color Orange]], to raise awareness about [[human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights in China]]. As the sculptor Galschiot was denied access to Hong Kong, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] painted the ''Pillar'' without his participation.

==Other ''Pillars of Shame'' ==
Other ''Pillars'' have been erected in the following locations:

'''Public affairs''' generally refer to the building and development of relations between an organization and politicians, governments and other decision-makers.

The industry has developed over recent years and is normally considered a branch or sub-discipline of [[public relations]] (PR).  Given the broad nature of public affairs, what exactly the industry encapsulates remains a point of discussion. While often equated with [[lobbying]], this is usually only a small part of what a public affairs practitioner might do. Other typical functions include research, strategy planning and providing advice.   

It is difficult to determine the size of the public affairs industry in the [[United Kingdom]].  Studies suggest the industry is becoming more professionalized, and that it is more widespread than often assumed. The [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]] (CIPR), which is the UK's professional body for public relations including public affairs, estimates there are around 48,000 people involved in PR, of which 30%  are involved in public affairs. This research is limited as it only measures specific job titles and those who declare themselves to be working in PR. There are large numbers of professionals providing public affairs services while working under different job titles across a wide variety of sectors. The job titles of public affairs practitioners may vary, depending on the focus of their role, but may include, "public affairs", "external affairs/relations", "corporate communications", "government/parliamentary affairs" and "policy".  

Organizations who make use of public affairs are typically large companies, charities, trade unions, membership organizations and interest groups. They will either have staff working directly for them or employ a firm of public affairs consultants. Very often public affairs staff will work with their non-PR colleagues who are experts in a given field.  

== Issues of contention in the industry == 

It has been argued that professional lobbying goes against [[democracy]] as it allows big business to buy power and influence with well funded campaigns giving them an unfair advantage. Steps are being taken in several countries to attempt to increase levels of regulation and transparency in the public affairs industry. Several countries have introduced a mandatory register for lobbyists. The [[European Union]] has been working with a voluntary register since July 2008. Many other governments including the United Kingdom are debating a register of some kind.

In the [[United States]], President [[Barack Obama]] has introduced several measures intended to increase transparency in public affairs. In an attempt to close the "revolving door" of executive-branch officials becoming lobbyists immediately following the expiration of their federal appointments, he issued [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13490&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Order 13490 - Ethics Commitments|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/ExecutiveOrder-EthicsCommitments|website=www.whitehouse.gov|publisher=Office of the President of the United States|date=January 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on January 21, 2009, dictating, among other things, a two-year ban on lobbying for former top executive branch officials related to any issue that they worked on during their final year in government employment. He also introduced a ban on verbal communication between lobbyists and the federal agencies tasked with awarding economic recovery funds. These measures have proved controversial and while some argue they are a positive and necessary step, others have deemed the policies as failures due to various loopholes.

== Role of a public affairs practitioner ==

Public affairs practitioners are engaged in a variety of roles. These can include lobbying, monitoring and predicting political, legal, economic and social developments, and providing political intelligence and strategic advice. In addition, public affairs practitioners may undertake media relations work, understanding and relating with the many streams of business, trade and electronic media in seeking publicity for an organization or in responding to media inquiries and issues. 

Central to all of these areas is the concept of stakeholder relations. Building relationships and partnerships are key when engaging with policymakers.
Consideration should be given to potential partnership with a variety of groups and individuals, usually encompassed in the ubiquitous public affairs term "key stakeholders" which includes community groups, pressure groups, [[nongovernmental organizations]], technical experts and policy and influences from [[think tanks]] and academics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">The '''ripieno concerto''' is a somewhat later type of [[Baroque]] music, the term [[concerto]] here reverting to its earlier meaning of work for an [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]]. The word ''[[Wikt:ripieno|ripieno]]'' is from the Italian for "padding". The ''{{Lang|it|concerto ripieno}}'' was sometimes referred to as a "{{Lang|it|concerto a quattro}}" (or "{{Lang|it|a cinque}}" if the orchestra included two [[viola]] parts, a standard scoring in the 17th century). These were merely compositions for the ripieno alone (i.e. for [[string orchestra]] and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]]), with either no solo parts or clearly subsidiary ones. Beginning with the six ripieno concertos, Op. 5 (1692), of [[Giuseppe Torelli]], this [[genre]] enjoyed an efflorescence that extended until about 1740.

==Types==
Most ripieno concertos fall into one of two distinct classes: a [[sonata]] type and a [[sinfonia]] type. The sonata type generally mirrors the form and style of the ''{{Lang|it|[[sonata da chiesa]]}}'' in its use of four-[[Movement (music)|movement]] slow–fast–slow–fast cycles and predominantly [[Fugue|fugal]] texture.

The more modern sinfonia type was firmly established in Torelli's second publication to include concertos, Op. 6 (1698), and in Giulio Taglietti's {{Lang|it|Concerti a Quattro}}, Op. 4 (1699), which turn to the three-movement (fast-slow-fast) pattern and more [[homophonic]] texture familiar to us from the [[solo concerto]] and [[opera]] sinfonia. The opening movements also parallel the solo concerto in utilizing [[ritornello]] form (without solo sections), in which the opening material recurs from one to several times in various [[Key (music)|keys]], the last statement normally in the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]. [[Finale (music)|Finales]] are most often [[Binary form|binary in form]] and dancelike in style. The sinfonia type gradually merged with the early concert [[symphony]] beginning in the 1720s, doubtless in part because the term concerto was by that time acquiring an indelible association with the notion of [[tutti]]-solo contrast.

A special class of 20th-century concertos is the [[Concerto for Orchestra]]. These works are not for the most part ripieno concertos in the [[Baroque]] sense but rather display pieces in which the orchestra itself is the [[virtuoso]], from soloists to sections of the orchestra, choirs or tutti. Examples of this genre, best known through [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]'s popular [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|work of 1943]], include compositions by [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] (1925), [[Walter Piston]] (1933), [[Zoltán Kodály]] (1939–40), [[Michael Tippett]] (1962–63), and [[Elliott Carter]] (1969). In the latter piece, Carter dramatically personifies or characterizes the various concertino groupings, a technique he had previously explored in his Double Concerto for harpsichord and piano (1961) and his Piano Concerto (1964–65).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2271">In [[Māori mythology]], '''Rongomai''' refers to several entities:&lt;ref&gt;In the genealogies of the '''[[Moriori people|Moriori]]''' people of the [[Chatham Islands]], '''Rongomai''' is the son of Tangaroa, and the father of Kahukura (Tregear 1891:425).&lt;/ref&gt;

* a deity by whose assistance [[Haungaroa]] traveled from [[Hawaiki]] to New Zealand as she went to tell [[Ngātoro-i-rangi]] that he had been cursed by [[Manaia (legendary chief)|Manaia]].
* a being in whale form which attacked and almost wiped out the war-party of Maru.
* a god of comet.&lt;ref&gt;http://islandheritage.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RNJ_12_3_Cressey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* the war-[[god]] of the tribes in the Lake Taupo region.
* a celebrated demi-god [[ancestor]] of some [[iwi]]. He went with Ihinga and others of his friends to visit the dread [[Miru (goddess)|Miru]] in her abode in the underworld. There they were taught incantations, witchcraft, religious songs, dances, and certain games. One of Rongomai's men was caught, and was claimed by Miru in sacrifice, as payment for having imparted the sacred knowledge, but Rongomai and the others got safely back to the world again.
* the chief of the [[Mahuhu]] canoe in its voyage from Hawaiki to New Zealand. He was drowned when the canoe overturned, and his body was eaten by the [[White trevally|araara]] fish, since held sacred by the [[Nga Puhi]] and [[Rarawa]] iwi, who claim descent from Rongomai. Until they embraced Christianity, those iwi would not eat the araara (or trevally, ''Caranx georianus'') .
* a [[meteor]] or [[comet]], seen in the full light of day when in comparatively recent times, the [[Ngati Hau]] tribe were besieging the fortress named Rangiuru at Otaki, occupied by the [[Ngati Awa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4879">The '''Sound and Music Computing''' ('''SMC''') '''Conference'''&lt;ref name="official_site" /&gt; is the forum for international exchanges around the core interdisciplinary topics of [[Sound and music computing|Sound and Music Computing]]. The conference is held annually to facilitate the exchange of ideas in this field.

==Focus topics==
''This sections speaks briefly about subfields related to Sound and Music Computing, for the main article, see'' [[Sound and music computing]].

Sound and Music Computing (SMC) is a research field that studies the whole sound and music communication chain from a multidisciplinary point of view. The current SMC research field can be grouped into a number of subfields that focus on specific aspects of the sound and music communication chain.

* ''Processing of sound and music signals'': This subfield focuses on [[audio signal processing]] techniques for the analysis, transformation and resynthesis of sound and music signals.
* ''Understanding and modeling sound and music'': This subfield focuses on understanding and modeling sound and music using computational approaches. Here we can include [[Computational musicology]], [[Music information retrieval]], and the more computational approaches of [[Music cognition]].
* ''Interfaces for sound and music'': This subfield focuses on the design and implementation of computer interfaces for sound and music. This is basically related to [[Human Computer Interaction]].
* ''Assisted sound and music creation'': This subfield focuses on the development of computer tools for assisting [[Sound design]] and [[Music composition]]. Here we can include traditional fields like [[Algorithmic composition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10061">A '''strategy of tension''' ({{lang-it|strategia della tensione}}) is a policy wherein violent struggle is encouraged rather than suppressed.  It is usually associated when governments, or security apparatuses within a government, allow or even encourage extremist groups to perform attacks, bombings, murders, and the like.  In extreme circumstances, it can even involve [[agent provocateur]]s and [[false flag]] operations where a terrorist threat is outright invented or created.  The goal in such strategies is that such a struggle will rally support behind the military or police forces opposing the radicals, to radicalize opposing movements so that they can be better marginalized, or to permit loosely allied extremist groups to attack enemies of the government.  As few organizations would openly say that they are pursuing a strategy of tension, accusations generally come from opponents that such a strategy is being pursued.

The strategy of tension is most closely identified with the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]] in Italy from 1968&amp;ndash;1982, wherein both far-left Marxist extremists and far-right neo-fascist groups performed bombings, kidnappings, arsons, and murders.&lt;ref&gt;Campani, Giovanna.

==Alleged examples==
&lt;!-- OR?
The "strategy of tension" may also have its roots in [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s treatise ''[[On War]]'', which heavily influenced Cold War thinking and modern military strategy. Book 3, Chapter 18 of ''On War'' pertinently describes the psychological and sociological effects of fear and their relationship to the furtherance of military objectives, "If a state of tension exists, the effects of the decision are always greater, partly because a greater force of will and a greater pressure of circumstances manifest themselves therein; partly because everything has been prepared and arranged for a great movement." Further explanation by Clausewitz lends to the idea that officials were alluding to this section of the book, "Now the real use which we derive from these reflections is the conclusion that every measure which is taken during a state of tension is more important and more prolific in results than the same measure could be in a state of equilibrium, and that this importance increases immensely in the highest degrees of tension."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clausewitz.com/readings/OnWar1873/BK3ch18.html|title=Carl von Clausewitz: ON WAR. Book 3, Chapter 18|website=www.clausewitz.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are immensely important to the development of public policy, which makes a "strategy of tension" a highly effective way to manipulate such policy.

===Italy===
{{See also|Years of Lead (Italy)}}
From 1968&amp;ndash;1982, Italy suffered numerous terrorist attacks by both the left and the right, which were often followed by government round-ups and mass arrests.  An allegation, especially made by adherents of the [[Italian Communist Party]], was that the government trumped up and intentionally allowed the attacks of communist radicals as an excuse to arrest other communists, and allowed the attacks of far-right paramilitary organizations as an extrajudicial way to silence enemies.&lt;ref name="bull"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Anna Cento |date=2012 |title=Italian Neofascism: The Strategy of Tension and the Politics of Nonreconciliation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUtFAAAAQBAJ&amp;d |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=0857454501}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The veracity of parts of these allegations has been disputed; while most sources agree that elements within the Italian government were eager to use the terrorist strikes as a reason to round-up communists, the idea that the government directly worked with said communist groups is more far-fetched.  In the same way, some contacts between the government and far-right organizations existed, but allegations of an explicit "green light" to perform raids and the like are considered less reliable.

Various parliamentary committees were held to investigate these crimes as well as prosecute them in the 1990s.  A 1995 report from the [[Democrats of the Left|Left Democrats]] (the rebranded Communist Party of Italy, PCI) to a subcommittee of the Italian Parliament stated that a "strategy of tension" had been supported by the United States to "stop the PCI, and to a certain degree also the [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]], from reaching executive power in the country".  Aldo Giannuli, a historian who worked as a consultant to the parliamentary terrorism commission, wrote that he considered the Left Democrats' report as dictated primarily by domestic political considerations rather than historical ones: "Since they have been in power the Left Democrats have given us very little help in gaining access to security service archives," he said. "This is a falsely courageous report."  Giannuli did decry the fact that many more leftist terrorists were prosecuted and convicted than rightist terrorists, though.&lt;ref name="bull" /&gt;

Swiss academic [[Daniele Ganser]] wrote ''NATO's Secret Armies'', a 2004 book that alleged direct NATO support for far-right terrorists in Italy as part of its "strategy of tension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.danieleganser.ch/assets/files/Inhalte/Interviews/Zeitungsinterviews/pdf_06/GanserInterviewVoltairenet29dez06.pdf |title=Interview with Daniele Ganser }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(154&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, December 29, 2006, on [[Voltaire network]]'s website {{fr icon}}: "It is a [[Military tactics|tactic]] which consists in committing [[bombing]]s and attributing them to others. By the term 'tension' one refers to emotional tension, to what creates a sentiment of fear. By the term 'strategy' one refers to what feeds the fear of the people towards one particular group".&lt;/ref&gt;  Ganser also alleges that [[Operation Gladio]], an effort to organize [[stay-behind]] guerillas and resistance in the event of a communist takeover by the Eastern bloc of Italy, continued into the 1970s and supplied the far-right [[neofascism|neofascist]] movements with weapons.  Ganser's conclusions have been disputed;&lt;ref name="hansen2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olav Riste and Leopoldo Nuti, "Introduction: Strategy of 'Stay-Behind'," The Journal of Strategic Studies, December 2007, 930.&lt;/ref&gt; most notably, Ganser heavily cites the document ''[[U.S. Army Field Manual 30-31B|US Army Field Manual 30-31B]]'', a 1976 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] hoax meant to discredit the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |title=Misinformation about "Gladio/Stay Behind" Networks Resurfaces - US Department of State |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-07-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710005257/http://usinfo.state.gov/media/Archive/2006/Jan/20-127177.html |archivedate=2008-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term arises from the perception that members of this generation have grown up  being [[Helicopter parent|overprotected by their parents]] and in an environment of [[Economy of Taiwan|economic prosperity]], in a similar manner to how strawberries are grown in protected [[greenhouse]]s and command a higher price compared to other fruits.

The term is starting to gain prominence in the [[Media of Taiwan|East Asian press]], as it could be a way to designate a rising [[demographic]] or [[psychographic]] in terms of [[consumer behavior]]. The Strawberry Generation, like the [[Post-80s]] of China, could be the [[Asia]]n counterpart of the [[Millennials]] in the [[Western world]].

==Ironic usage==
[[File:Wild Strawberry Logo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The official logo of the [[Wild Strawberries Movement]]]]
In an [[Irony|ironic]] reference to the term, a 2008 student-led political movement in Taiwan started the [[Wild Strawberries Movement]]. This movement was in response to the visit of [[China]]'s [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits|ARATS]] chairman [[Chen Yunlin]] to the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cooper, Marc|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-cooper/wild-strawberries-taiwane_b_149231.html|title=Taiwanese students protest demonstration law|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=7 December 2008|accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/12/07/asia/AS-Taiwan-Protest.php|title=Wild Strawberries: Taiwanese Student Movement Stirs Anew|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=12 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police actions on protests aimed at Chen suppressed the display of [[Flag of the Republic of China|Taiwan's national flag]] and the playing of Taiwanese songs. This prompted a group of 400 students in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], to begin a [[sit-in]] in front of the [[Executive Yuan]] in protest of Taiwan's Parade and Assembly Law ({{zh|t=集會遊行法}}).&lt;ref name="Taiwan"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Chang, Rich  |author2=Wang, Flora |author3 = Ko, Shu-ling |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2008/11/11/2003428265|title=DPP proposes parade law amendment|date=11 November 2008|work=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">'''Taco Trucks At Every Mosque''' (also '''#TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque''') is a community initiative started in [[Orange County, California]] that aims to bring together [[Muslim]] and [[Latino]] communities through sharing food. The events were the idea of Rida Hamida and Ben Vazquez. The first event took place on June 3, 2017 and have taken place throughout California, in [[Mexico]] and [[Milwaukee]].

== History ==
While [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] currently make up around a third of [[Orange County, California|Orange County's]] residents and there are 120,000 [[Muslim|Muslims]], both minority groups do not have much political power.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/02/08/584057034/building-a-latino-muslim-coalition-with-tacotrucksateverymosque|title=Building A Latino-Muslim Coalition With #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque|last=Arellano|first=Gustavo|date=8 February 2018|publisher=NPR.org|access-date=2018-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208194746/https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/02/08/584057034/building-a-latino-muslim-coalition-with-tacotrucksateverymosque|archive-date=8 February 2018|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, both groups of people saw an increase in documented [[Hate crime|hate crimes]] against their communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also in 2016, [[Marco Gutierrez]] of the ''Latinos for Trump'' group, said, "You're going to have [[taco trucks on every corner]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/23/most-influential-2017-rida-hamida-and-benjamin-vazquez/|title=Most Influential 2017: Rida Hamida and Benjamin Vazquez bring halal tacos, cultural mingling, to mosques throughout Southern California.|last=Bharath|first=Deepa|date=2017-12-23|work=Orange County Register|access-date=2018-02-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223184600/https://www.ocregister.com/2017/12/23/most-influential-2017-rida-hamida-and-benjamin-vazquez/|archive-date=23 December 2017|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Donald Trump]] won the presidency, there was an increase in the amount of both anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim feelings in American culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After Trump won, Rida Hamida, a Muslim from [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], and Benjamin Vazquez, who is a Latino from [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], met and began a discussion about what Muslims and Latinos could learn from one another.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-tacos-ramadan-20170604-story.html|title=Muslim and Latino groups unite during Ramadan, breaking fast with tacos at mosques|last=Do|first=Anh|date=4 June 2017|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamida and Vasquez thought about the [[Food truck|taco truck]] idea and about bringing Muslims to [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican restaurants]].

'''The Matheson Trust''' is an educational charity based in London dedicated to further and disseminate the study of [[comparative religion]], especially from the point of view of the [[Perennial philosophy#Definition|underlying harmony]] of the major religious and philosophical traditions of the world. 

== History ==

The Matheson Trust was established in London in 1974 by [[Donald Macleod Matheson]] [[CBE]] (1896-1979),&lt;ref&gt;Settlement recorded in the archives of the London Borough of [[Bromley]], 12 January 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition to his work as a civil servant&lt;ref&gt;Matheson was appointed CBE in 1945, after serving for years as the Secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]: [http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37119/supplements/2953/page.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; was active as a translator of [[Traditionalist School|Perennialist]] works, most notably ''Understanding Islam'' by [[Frithjof Schuon]]&lt;ref&gt;George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''An Introduction to Sufi Doctrine'' by [[Titus Burckhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwisdom.com/public/authors/Donald-McLeod-Matheson.aspx |title=Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, Lahore Pakistan, 1963. For some more biographical information, see his author page at World Wisdom Books |publisher=Worldwisdom.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Matheson Trust associates have included, among others, [[Martin Lings]], [[Gai Eaton|Charles Le Gai Eaton]], [[William Stoddart]] and [[Reza Shah-Kazemi]].

== Matheson Monographs ==

Since 2008, The Matheson Trust had been co-producing publications with a number of kindred organisations and established publishers: The Prometheus Trust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prometheustrust.co.uk/index.html |title=Prometheus Trust |publisher=Prometheus Trust |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fons Vitae&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fonsvitae.com/ |title=fonsvitae.com |publisher=fonsvitae.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (KY), Archetype UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archetype.uk.com/home.htm |title=Archetype Home |publisher=Archetype.uk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but December 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Samuel Zinner |url=http://samuelzinner.blogspot.com/ |title=See Samuel Zinner's blog announcement |publisher=Samuelzinner.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw the launch of an independent series, the "Matheson Monographs", covering "scriptural exegesis, the modalities of spiritual and contemplative life, studies of particular religious traditions, comparative analyses, studies of traditional arts, crafts and cosmological sciences, contemporary scholarly expositions of religious philosophy and metaphysics, translations of both classical and contemporary texts and transcriptions of lectures by, and interviews with, spiritual and scholarly authorities from different religious and philosophical traditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/publications/index.php#copublications |title=Publications |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matheson Library ==

In March 2011 the Matheson Trust website was launched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/announce/2011/03/04/matheson-website-launched/ |title=Matheson Website Launched — The Matheson Trust |publisher=Themathesontrust.org |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting an online library of free selected books and articles, almost exclusively in English, including authors and sources as varied as [[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Shaykh Abdallah Bin Bayyah]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/ |title=archbishopofcanterbury.org |publisher=archbishopofcanterbury.org |date=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Berzin]] archives, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[Jonathan Sacks|Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks]], [[James Cutsinger]], [[Gavin D'Costa]], [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], [[Harry Oldmeadow]], the journal [[Ali Lakhani|Sacred Web]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Timothy Winter]] (Shaykh Abdal Hakim Murad), [[The Woolf Institute of Abrahamic Faiths]] and others. Documents are free to browse and download, most in [[PDF]] format, with a few articles in HTML.&lt;br /&gt;

As of October 2018, there are more than 600 holdings in the library, a quarter of which are audio recordings.

=== Audio Library ===

One of the purported aims of the Matheson Library is to use existing contemporary media technologies to make available resources from ancient traditions, either in the form of recitation of traditional scriptures or in the scholarly transmission of the doctrines and insights pertaining to the different religions. An ongoing ''hear!'' project is converting scholarly texts and other texts of interest into [[MP3]] format, and making them available through the Audio section of the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themathesontrust.org/type/audio/ |title=Audio |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012 the ''Matheson Trust Sacred Audio Collection'' was launched, a repository of selected liturgical audio recordings from the major religious traditions. This collection includes live recordings from temples and ritual gatherings around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themathesontrust.org/sacred-audio-collection |title=Sacred Audio Collection |publisher=The Matheson Trust |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tuckerby Underbank''' is the main character in [[Dennis L. McKiernan]]'s [[Mithgar]] novel ''[[The Iron Tower]]''. 

== Life ==

Tuckerby Underbank was born to an ordinary Warrow family in the Boskydells, and apparently had the same carefree upbringing as any other Warrow child. He became fast friends with several other young Warrows, including Danner Bramblethorn and his dammia Merrilee. 

However, when an unnaturally bitter winter falls over all of Mithgar, Tuck began training as a Thornwalker and soon became one of the best archers. After being assigned to the Spindlethorn, Tuck had two narrow escapes with Vulgs, each time losing a close friend, and one time nearly losing his life when he fell into a river and was carried under by the current.

When the call came out for Warrows to fight at Challerain Keep, Tuck volunteered along with Danner and Patrel Rushlock. Upon arriving, they become acquainted with High King Aurion Redeye, his son Prince Igon, his future daughter-in-law Princess Laurelin, as well as the elf lord Gildor Goldbranch and Hrosmarshal Vidron, all of whom become friends with the Warrows. They also are invited to Laurelin's nineteenth birthday party, but during the party a messenger arrives, saying that the fortress is about to be attacked.

Tuck and the Warrows take part in the battle against Modru's Horde, but he becomes lost and ends up inside a crypt with the crown prince, [[King Galen]], where Tuck retrieves a small red arrow. He and Galen manage to escape the slaughter as Challerain Keep is destroyed, and end up in an elven village where they are cared for and fed. Tuck is satisfied to stay there, until he is informed that Laurelin has been captured by Modru and Aurion has been killed. He agrees to follow Galen, since only Warrow eyes can see in the dark.

Tuck follows Gildor and Galen along the road to rally their allies, and come across a dwarf named Brega, who leads them to the ancient dwarf mine of Kraggen-Cor, where they are almost killed by a monstrous tentacled creature. When they encounter the monstrous Gargon on the other side, Tuck distracts it by stabbing it in the leg, allowing the others to finish it off.

He is reunited with Merrilee as the armies march to Gron, and he manages to infiltrate the Iron Tower before being captured. He learns that Modru is planning to sacrifice Laurelin, and release his master Gyphon from exile. However, Tuck uses the red arrow to pierce the darkness-creating Myrkenstone, which destroys his vision, but also keeps Gyphon in exile, and kills Modru and his Horde.

Upon his return to the Boskydells, Tuck marries Merrilee. They have one child, Raven, and his journals become a famed historical epic. He dies at a ripe old age.

== Appearance ==

Like other Warrows, Tuck is very short, at exactly three and a half feet. He has black hair cut to his shoulders, and large tilted blue eyes which are said to be sapphire. Like all Warrows, he is able to see great distances in the dark, even further than Elves.

{{For|the surname|Bališ}}
'''Usog''' or '''balis''' is a topic in psycho-medicine in [[Filipino Psychology]] (but considered just as a [[Philippines|Filipino]] superstition in Western Psychology) where an affliction or psychological disorder is attributed to a greeting by a stranger, or an [[evil eye]] [[Curse|hex]]. It usually affects an unsuspecting child, usually an infant or toddler, who has been greeted by a visitor or a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuartxchange.com/PweUsog.html PWE-USOG / PWE-BUYAG: Miscellaneous Therapies in Philippine Alternative Medicine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some limited areas, it is said that the condition is also caused by the stranger having an evil eye or ''masamang mata'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], lurking around. This may have been influenced by the advent of the Spaniards who long believed in the ''[[mal de ojo]]'' superstition.

Once affected, the child begins to develop [[fever]], and sometimes [[convulsion]]s. Supposedly, the child can be cured by placing its clothing in hot water and boiling it.  In most other places, to counter the effects of the "usog" the stranger or newcomer is asked to put some of his or her [[saliva]] on the baby's abdomen, shoulder or forehead before leaving the house. The newcomer then leaves while saying: "''Pwera usog... pwera usog...''" The saliva is placed on the finger first, before the finger is rubbed on the baby's abdomen or forehead. The stranger is never to lick the child.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.viloria.com/secondthoughts/archives/00000176.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice is that the stranger or visitor is asked to touch his or her finger with saliva to the child's body, arm or foot (''"lawayan"'') to prevent the child from getting overpowered (''"upang hindi mausog"'').

==Possible scientific explanation==

One theory (Kristina Palacio)&lt;ref&gt;Fadul, J. Public Forum on Witchcraft and Illnesses. Rizal Technological and Polytechnic Institute, Morong, Rizal. July 24, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100% PINOY"&gt;100% PINOY (Kapuso Network's cultural program on GMA7 featuring Filipino Culture and Ingenuity to strengthen the Filipino identity.) Aired internationally through GMA Pinoy TV. "Bata, bata, paano ka ginawa?" episode aired August 28, 2008. Pinoy culture, beliefs and practices about "paglilihi, pagbubuntis, panganganak at pag-aalaga sa bata".&lt;/ref&gt; explains ''usog'' in terms of child distress that leads to greater susceptibility to illness and diseases. There are observations that a stranger (or a newcomer or even a visiting relative) especially someone with a strong personality (physically big, boisterous, has strong smell, domineering, etc.) may easily distress a child. Thus, the child is said to be "overpowered" or ''nauusog'' and thus may feel afraid, develop fever, get sick, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen S, Janicki-Deverts D, Miller GE | title = Psychological stress and disease. | journal = JAMA | volume = 298 | issue = 14 | pages = 1685–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17925521 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/298/14/1685 | doi = 10.1001/jama.298.14.1685}} "Stress Contributes To Range Of Chronic Diseases, Review Shows" ScienceDaily.com (Oct. 10, 2007) [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071009164122.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In ''usog'', the child's distress is the consequence of the child's failure to adapt to change. It is, in [[medical]] terms, the consequence of the disruption of homeostasis through physical or psychological stimuli brought about by the stranger.&lt;ref name="Revisiting"&gt;{{cite book

The stressful stimuli to the child may be mental (stranger is perceived as a threat, malevolent or demanding), physiological (loud and/or high-pitched voice of the stranger that is hurting to the child's eardrum; strong smell of the stranger that irritates the child's nasal nerves), or physical (stranger has heavy hands or is taking up too much space).

The stranger's act of gently placing his finger with his saliva to the child's arm, foot, or any particular part of the child's body, could make him more familiar to the child, and thus, reduce if not remove the stress. As the stranger keeps gently saying, "Pwera usog... pwera usog...," the child is made to feel and assured that he means no harm.  The ''usog'' is said to be counteracted because the child is prevented from succumbing to an illness since the child is no longer in distress. Children or even adults who are shy or have weak personalities are more susceptible to ''usog'' in accordance with observations and theory. Some have observed that at times even praising a shy child by a visiting relative caused an ''usog''.&lt;ref name="100% PINOY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JakqnTEuUsE Usog]&lt;/ref&gt;

The saliva from the stranger, granted that he or she is healthy and consistent with his or her [[oral hygiene]], is relatively clean&lt;ref&gt;http://neurophilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/11/14/lick-your-wounds/ Neurophilosophy: Lick your wounds&lt;/ref&gt; and contains enough [[antimicrobial]] compounds such as [[lactoferrin]], [[lactoperoxidase]], and secretory [[immunoglobulin A]] which can help clear [[pathogens]] from the child and benefit the child against infection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discover.com/issues/oct-05/departments/the-biology-of-saliva/ Discover Magazine, "The Biology of ...Saliva" October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, human saliva has [[opiorphin]], a newly researched pain-killing substance. Initial research with mice shows the compound has a painkilling effect of up to six times that of morphine. It works by stopping the normal breakdown of natural pain-killing opioids in the spine, called [[enkephalins]]. Opiorphin in human saliva is a relatively simple molecule, and the child's immune system may trigger a [[biochemical cascade]] ([[complement system]]) to produce other stress-reducing compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wisner |first=Anne |author2=Evelyne Dufour |author3=Michaël Messaoudi |author4=Amine Nejdi |author5=Audrey Marcel |author6=Marie-Noelle Ungeheuer |author7=Catherine Rougeot |title=Human Opiorphin, a natural antinociceptive modulator of opioid-dependent pathways |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=103 |pages=17979–17984 |date=November 13, 2006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0605865103 |pmid=17101991 |issue=47 |pmc=1693858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn10514|title=Natural-born painkiller found in human saliva|author=Andy Coghlan|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6142842.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=Natural chemical 'beats morphine'|date=November 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/2006/1113/3|title=Prolonging Painkillers|author=Mary Beckman|publisher=[[Science (journal)|ScienceNOW]]|date=November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usog can also, though less commonly, affect adults, and it may induce vomiting and stomach ache rather than fever. Supposedly, it can be prevented by stopping a stranger or visitor from greeting the person.

Unlike "[[lihi]]", however, usog is not yet medically accepted. More than the superstitious folks, researchers dealing with Filipino Psychology say they have observed this phenomenon with regularity and suggest that this be added to the Psychiatric Disorders Handbook [[DSM-V]].&lt;ref name ="100% PINOY" /&gt;

'''White slavery''', '''white slave trade''', and '''white slave traffic''' refer to the [[chattel slavery]] of [[White Europeans]] by non-Europeans (such as [[North Africa|North Africans]] and the [[Muslim world]]), as well as by Europeans themselves, such as the [[Viking]] [[thralls]] or European [[Galley slave]]s. From Antiquity, European slaves were common during the reign of [[Ancient Rome]] and were prominent during the [[Ottoman Empire]] into the [[early modern period]]. In [[Feudalism]], there were various forms of status below the [[Free tenant|Freeman]] that is known as [[Serfdom]] (such as the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bordar bordar], [[villein]], [[Vagrancy_(people)#United_Kingdom|vagabond]] and [[Serfdom#Slaves|slave]]) which could be bought and sold as property and were subject to labor and branding by their owners or [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/demesne demense]. Under [[History of slavery under Muslim rule|Muslim rule]], the [[Arab slave trade]]s that included [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] captives were often fueled by raids into European territories or were taken as children in the form of a [[Devshirme|blood tax]] by the families of citizens of [[Ottoman territories in Europe|conquered territories]] to serve the empire for a variety of functions. In the mid 1800s, the term 'white slavery' was used to describe the Christian slaves that were sold into the [[Barbary slave trade]].

Modern use of the term can also include [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution]] and [[human trafficking]].

==History==
The phrase "white slavery" was used by Charles Sumner in 1847 to describe the chattel slavery of Christians throughout the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary States]] and primarily in the [[Algiers]], the capitol of [[Ottoman Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sumner |first1=Charles |title=White Slavery in The Barbary States.

As Algiers was its chief seat, it seems to have acquired a current name for the place. This I shall not disturb; though I shall speak of white slavery, or the slavery of Christians, throughout the Barbary States."|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encompassed many forms of slavery, including the European concubines often found in [[Ottoman Imperial Harem|Turkish harems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sumner |first1=Charles |title=White Slavery in The Barbary States.

There is an account of "One Mrs. Shaw, an Irishwoman," in words hardly polite enough to be quoted. She was swept into the harem of Muley Shmael, who "forced her to turn moor";"but soon after, having taken a dislike to her, he gave her to a soldier." - Braithwaite's Morocco, p. 191."|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used from the beginning of the twentieth century when most of the countries of Europe signed in Paris in 1904 an [[International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic]] aimed at combating the sale of women who were forced into prostitution in the countries of continental Europe. In the early twentieth century, the term was used against the [[forced prostitution]] and [[History of sexual slavery in the United States|sexual slavery]] of girls who worked in Chicago brothels.

The Volga trade route was established by the [[Varangians]] (Vikings) who settled in Northwestern Russia in the early 9th century. About {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|0}} south of the [[Volkhov River]] entry into [[Lake Ladoga]], they established a settlement called [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (Old Norse: ''[[Aldeigjuborg]]'').&lt;ref name="Brondsted"&gt;Brøndsted (1965), pp. 64&amp;ndash;65&lt;/ref&gt; It connected [[Northern Europe]] and Northwestern Russia with the [[Caspian Sea]], via the [[Volga River]]. The [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] used this route to trade with [[Muslim history#The Umayyad Caliphate|Muslim countries]] on the southern shores of the Caspian Sea, sometimes penetrating as far as [[Baghdad]]. The route functioned concurrently with the [[Dnieper]] trade route, better known as the [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]], and lost its importance in the 11th century.

[[Saqaliba]] refers to [[Slavs|Slavic]] slaves, kidnapped from the coasts of Europe or in wars, as well as white [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] in the medieval [[Muslim world]], in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily]] and [[Al-Andalus]]. Saqaliba served, or were forced to serve, in a multitude of ways: servants, [[harem]] [[concubines]], [[eunuch]]s, craftsmen, soldiers, and as [[Caliph]]'s guards.  In [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], [[Morocco]], [[Damascus]] and [[Sicily]], their military role may be compared with that of [[mamluk]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In Spain, Slavic eunuchs were so popular and widely distributed that they became synonymous with Saqāliba.&lt;ref&gt;''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A-K ; Vol. II, L-Z'', by [[Junius P.

===Crimean Khanate===
{{main article|History of slavery in Asia|Crimean Khanate}}
{{see also|Crimean–Nogai raids into East Slavic lands}}
In the time of the Crimean Khanate, Crimeans engaged in frequent raids into the [[Danubian principalities]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland-Lithuania]], and [[Muscovy]]. For each captive, the khan received a fixed share (savğa) of 10 percent or 20 percent. The campaigns by Crimean forces categorize into "sefers", declared military operations led by the khans themselves, and ''çapuls'', raids undertaken by groups of noblemen, sometimes illegally because they contravened treaties concluded by the khans with neighbouring rulers. For a long time, until the early 18th century, the khanate maintained a massive [[slave trade]] with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. [[Caffa]] was one of the best known and significant trading ports and slave markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Historical survey &gt; Slave societies]&lt;/ref&gt; Crimean Tatar raiders enslaved between 1 and 2 million slaves from Russia and Poland-Lithuania over the period 1500–1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Galina I.

[[File:Purchase of Christian captives from the Barbary States.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=1.5|The purchase of Christian captives by Catholic monks in the [[Barbary states]].]]
Slave markets flourished on the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa, in what is modern-day [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], and western [[Libya]], between the 15th and middle of the 18th century.

These markets prospered while the states were nominally under [[Ottoman Algeria|Ottoman suzerainty]], though, in reality, they were mostly autonomous. The [[North African]] slave markets traded in [[Arab slave trade|European slaves]] which were acquired by Barbary pirates in [[slave raids]] on ships and by raids on coastal towns from Italy to Spain, Portugal, France, England, the Netherlands, and as far afield as the [[Turkish Abductions]] in Iceland. Men, women, and children were captured to such a devastating extent that vast numbers of sea coast towns were abandoned.

[[File:Captain walter croker horror stricken at algiers 1815.jpg|thumb|250px|1815 illustration of a British Captain horrified by seeing Christians worked as slaves in [[Algiers]].]]

According to Robert Davis, between 1 million and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in [[North Africa]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] between the 15th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Robert. ''Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast and Italy, 1500-1800''.[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1403945519]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="researchnews.osu.edu"&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm "When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed"], ''Research News'', [[Ohio State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, to extrapolate his numbers, Davis assumes the number of European slaves captured by Barbary pirates were constant for a 250-year period, stating:

{{quote|There are no records of how many men, women and children were enslaved, but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died, escaped, were ransomed, or converted to Islam. On this basis it is thought that around 8,500 new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers - about 850,000 captives over the century from 1580 to 1680.  By extension, for the 250 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000."&lt;ref name=Earle&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/mar/11/highereducation.books|title=New book reopens old arguments about slave raids on Europe|last=Carroll|first=Rory|date=2004-03-11|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-11|last2=correspondent|first2=Africa|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Davis' numbers have been challenged by other historians, such as David Earle, who cautions that true picture of Europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-Christian whites from eastern Europe and black people from west Africa.&lt;ref name=Earle/&gt;

In addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia.  Hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.  Middle East expert, John Wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation.&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wright|first=John|title=Trans-Saharan Slave Trade|year=2007|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such observations, across the late 1500s and early 1600s observers, account for around 35,000 European Christian slaves held throughout this period on the Barbary Coast, across Tripoli, Tunis, but mostly in Algiers. The majority were sailors (particularly those who were English), taken with their ships, but others were fishermen and coastal villagers.  However, most of these captives were people from lands close to Africa, particularly Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml|title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast|last=Davis|first=Robert|date=17 Feb 2011|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the [[Barbary pirates]] raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids along seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. On some occasions, settlements such as [[Baltimore, County Cork|Baltimore]], [[Ireland]] were abandoned following the raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone had 466 merchant ships lost to Barbary pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml "British Slaves on the Barbary Coast"], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

While Barbary corsairs looted the cargo of ships they captured, their primary goal was to capture people for sale as slaves or for ransom. Those who had family or friends who might ransom them were held captive, but not obliged to work; the most famous of these was the author [[Miguel de Cervantes]], who was held for almost five years. Others were sold into various types of servitude. Attractive women or boys could be used as [[sex slaves]]. Captives who converted to Islam were generally freed, since enslavement of Muslims was prohibited; but this meant that they could never return to their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;Diego de Haedo, ''Topografía e historia general de Argel'', 3 vols., Madrid, 1927-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Eisenberg, "¿Por qué volvió Cervantes de Argel?", in ''Ingeniosa invención: Essays on Golden Age Spanish Literature for Geoffrey L. Stagg in Honor of his Eighty-Fifth Birthday'', Newark, Delaware, Juan de la Cuesta, 1999, {{ISBN|9780936388830}}, pp. 241-253, http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/por-qu-volvi-cervantes-de-argel-0/, retrieved 11/20/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

16th- and 17th-century customs statistics suggest that Istanbul's additional slave import from the [[Black Sea]] may have totaled around 2.5 million from 1450 to 1700.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge World History of Slavery: Volume 3, AD 1420–AD 1804&lt;/ref&gt; The markets declined after the loss of the [[Barbary Wars]] and ended in the 1830s, when the region was [[French conquest of Algeria|conquered by France]].

===Christian slavery in Muslim Spain===
{{main|Slavery in Spain}}
[[File:Duquesne fait liberer des captifs chretiens apres le bombardement d Alger en 1683.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Abraham Duquesne]] delivering Christian captives in Algiers after the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1683)]].]]
During the [[Al-Andalus]] (also known as Muslim Spain or Islamic Iberia), the [[Moors]] controlled much of the peninsula. They imported white Christian slaves from the 8th century until the [[Reconquista]] in the late 15th century. The slaves were exported from the Christian section of Spain, as well as Eastern Europe, sparking significant reaction from many in Christian Spain and many Christians still living in Muslim Spain. Soon after, Muslims were successful, taking 30,000 Christian captives from Spain. In the eighth century slavery lasted longer due to "frequent cross-border skirmishes, interspersed between periods of major campaigns". By the tenth century, in the eastern Mediterranean Byzantine, Christians were captured by Muslims. Many of the raids designed by Muslims were created for a fast capture of prisoners. Therefore, Muslims restricted the control in order to keep captives from fleeing. The Iberian peninsula served as a base for further exports of slaves into other Muslim regions in Northern Africa.&lt;ref name="Constable"&gt;Trade and traders in Muslim Spain, Fourth Series, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman slave trade===
{{main article|Ottoman slave trade}}

Slavery was a legal and a significant part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s economy and society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html Supply of Slaves]&lt;/ref&gt; The main sources of slaves were war captives and organized enslavement expeditions in Africa, Eastern Europe and [[Circassia]] in the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves fell after large military operations.&lt;ref name="Spyropoulos"&gt;Spyropoulos Yannis, Slaves and freedmen in 17th- and early 18th-century Ottoman Crete, ''Turcica'', 46, 2015, p. 181, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  Enslavement of Europeans was banned in the early 19th century, while slaves from other groups were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TnVgKpqCxzQC&amp;pg=PA28 Ottomans against Italians and Portuguese about (white slavery)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after several measures to ban slavery in the late 19th century, the practice continued largely unabated into the early 20th century. As late as 1908, female slaves were still sold in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Dursteler2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Dursteler|title=Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8uer6PMfAC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2006|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8324-8|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual slavery]] was a central part of the Ottoman slave system throughout the history of the institution.&lt;ref name="Schierbrand1886"&gt;{{cite news | title=Slaves sold to the Turk; How the vile traffic is still carried on in the East.

In the [[Roman Republic]] and later [[Roman Empire]], slaves accounted for most of the means of industrial output in [[Roman commerce]]. Slaves were drawn from all over [[Europe]] and [[the Mediterranean]], including [[Gaul]], [[Hispania]], [[North Africa]], [[Syria]], [[Germania]], [[Britannia]], [[the Balkans]], and [[Greece]]. Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Santosuosso |first=Antonio |year=2001 |title=Storming the Heavens |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-3523-0 |pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital, where their number was largest, at its peak.

Slaves numbering in the tens of thousands were condemned to work in the mines or quarries, where conditions were notoriously brutal. ''Damnati in metallum'' ("those condemned to the mine") were convicts who lost their freedom as citizens (''libertas''), forfeited their property (''bona'') to the state, and became ''servi poenae'', slaves as a legal penalty. Their status under the law was different from that of other slaves; they could not buy their freedom, be sold, or be set free. They were expected to live and die in the mines.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Michael Hirt, ''Imperial Mines and Quarries in the Roman World: Organizational Aspects 27–BC&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;235'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2010), sect.&amp;nbsp;3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial slaves and freedmen (the ''familia Caesaris)'' worked in mine administration and management.&lt;ref&gt;Hirt, ''Imperial Mines and Quarries'', sect. 4.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Late Republic, about half the [[gladiator]]s who fought in Roman arenas were slaves, though the most skilled were often free volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Futrell, ''A Sourcebook on the Roman Games'' (Blackwell, 2006), p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful gladiators were occasionally rewarded with freedom. However, gladiators being trained warriors and having access to weapons, were potentially the most dangerous slaves. At an earlier time, many gladiators had been soldiers taken captive in war. [[Spartacus]], who led the [[Third Servile War|great slave rebellion of 73-71 BCE]], was a rebel gladiator.

The slaves imported in Italy were native Europeans, and very few of them were from outside Europe. This has been confirmed by biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three imperial-era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only one individual came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another two possibly did, but results are inconclusive. In the rest of the Italian peninsula, the fraction of non European slaves was much lower than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Isotopic evidence for age-related immigration to imperial Rome| doi=10.1002/ajpa.20541 | pmid=17205550 | volume=132| issue=4 |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|pages=510–519|year = 2007|last1 = Prowse|first1 = Tracy L.| last2=Schwarcz | first2=Henry P. | last3=Garnsey | first3=Peter | last4=Knyf | first4=Martin | last5=MacChiarelli | first5=Roberto | last6=Bondioli | first6=Luca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Killgrove and Montgomery.

{{main article|Dhimmi|Dhimmitude|Jizya}}
Christians and Jews, known as [[People of the Book]] in Islam, were considered [[dhimmis]] in territories under Muslim rule, a status of [[second-class citizens]] that were afforded limited freedoms, legal protections, personal safety, and were allowed to "practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy". In order to keep these protections and rights, dhimmis were required to pay the [[Jizya]] and [[Kharaj]] taxes as an acknowledgement of Muslim rule. According to [[Abu Yusuf]], Failure to pay this tax should render the dhemmi's life and property void and subject the dhemmi to [[forced conversion]], enslavement, imprisonment or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=The Jews of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0EbKFRxrT4C|year=1984|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3 |page=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If anyone had agreed to pay the jizya, leaving Muslim territory for enemy land was punishable by enslavement if captured. &lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Fisher (2001), ''Slavery in the History of Muslim Black Africa.'' NYU Press. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to pay the jizya was commonly punished by house arrest and some legal authorities allowed enslavement of dhimmis for non-payment of taxes.&lt;ref name="Lewis, B. 1992 pages 7"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry|date=1992|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0195053265|pages=7|quote=[...] those who remained faithful to their old religions and lived as protected persons (dhimmis) under Muslim rule could not, if free, be legally enslaved unless they had violated the terms of the dhimma, the contract governing their status, as for example by rebelling against Muslim rule or helping the enemies of the Muslim state or, according to some authorities, by withholding payment of the Kharaj or the Jizya, the taxes due from dhimmis to the Muslim state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcmh&gt;Mark R.

The [[Devshirme]] was a blood tax largely imposed in the [[Balkans]] and [[Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry Anderson|title=Lineages of the Absolutist State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7Wz4b4JTC8C&amp;pg=PA366|year=1979|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-710-6|pages=366–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Ottoman Empire sent military to collect Christian boys between the ages of 8 to 18 that were taken from their families and raised to serve the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W.

===Indentured servitude===
{{main article|Indentured servitude|Irish indentured servants}}
In the modern era, many whites in England, Ireland and [[British North America]] were [[indentured servant]]s, a form of slavery now banned by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Between 50 and 67 percent of white immigrants to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], from the 1630s and American Revolution, had traveled under [[indenture]].&lt;ref&gt;Galenson 1984: 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==White slave traffic==
{{main article|International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic}}
{{see also|History of sexual slavery in the United States#White slavery}}
The International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic is a series of anti–[[human trafficking]] treaties, the first of which was first negotiated in Paris in 1904. It was one of the first multilateral treaties to address issues of slavery and human trafficking.  The [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery, Servitude, Forced Labour and Similar Institutions and Practices Convention of 1926]] and the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women of Full Age]] of 1933 are similar documents.

===White Slave Traffic Act of 1910===
{{main article|Mann Act}}
To battle [[sex trafficking in the United States]], in 1910 the US Congress passed the [[Mann Act|White Slave Traffic Act]] (better known as the Mann Act), which made it a [[felony]] to transport women across state borders for the purpose of "prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose."  As more women were being trafficked from foreign countries, the US began passing immigration acts to curtail aliens from entering the country such as the [[Emergency Quota Act|Emergency Quota Act of 1921]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Following the banning of immigrants during the 1920s, human trafficking was not considered a major issue until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="candidate"&gt;Candidate, Jo Doezema Ph.D. "Loose women or lost women?

===Criminal Law Amendment (White Slave Traffic) Bill===
An attempt was made to introduce a similar law into the UK between 1910 and 1913 as the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act| Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912]]. [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham | Arthur Lee]] would state in the [[House of Commons]]:
"the United Kingdom, and particularly England, is increasingly becoming a clearing-house and depot and dispatch centre of the white slave traffic, and the headquarters of the foreign agents engaged in the most expensive and lucrative phase of the business."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard CRIMINAL LAW AMENDMENT (WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC) BILL. [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/jun/10/criminal-law-amendment-white-slave HC Deb 10 June 1912 vol 39 cc571-627]&lt;/ref&gt; [[South America]] was stated as the main destination for the trafficked girls.
''[[The Spectator]]'' commented that "the Bill has been blocked by a member [alluding to [[Frederick Booth]] ] or members who, for various reasons consider that it is not a measure which ought to be placed upon the statute book" as it would affect the liberty of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/11th-may-1912/7/criminal-law-amendment-white-slave-traffic ''The Spectator'' 11 May 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;
