      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''Access to Knowledge''' ('''A2K''') movement is a loose collection of [[civil society]] groups, [[government]]s, and individuals converging on the idea that access to [[knowledge]] should be linked to fundamental principles of [[justice]], [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and [[economic development]].

==History ==

The [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] from 2003 is a major declaration reflecting the goals of the movement pertaining to academic publishing.

In October 2004, the [[Geneva declaration on the future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]] emerged from a call from [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] for a development agenda for the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and was supported by hundreds organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters included the [[Free Software Foundation]], with a statement ''Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation": Supporting the Geneva Declaration.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfe.org/activities/wipo/wiwo.en.html|title=FSFE - Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the proposals of the declaration was to a «call for a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology. The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/futureofwipodeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the [[mailing list]] of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly at https://web.archive.org/web/20090213032523/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/, now at http://lists.keionline.org/mailman/listinfo/a2k_lists.keionline.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
A draft "A2K treaty" was later produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/a2k_treaty_may9.pdf |title=Treaty on Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=19&amp;res=1280_ff&amp;print=0 |title=Experts Debate Access To Knowledge &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Watch |publisher=Ip-watch.org |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights debate===
Access to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 27
Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn= 1354788 |title=The Right to Science and Culture |first=Lea |last=Shaver|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1354788 |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |date=2010 |volume=1 |pages=121–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporters==

=== Knowledge Ecology International ===
[[CP Tech]] (now [[Knowledge Ecology International]]) say: "the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers International===
Many different groups refer to the A2K movement. [[Consumers International]] is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a2knetwork.org/ |title=A global advocacy network for consumers in the digital age |publisher=A2Knetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030152718/http://a2knetwork.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defines the movement as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;
These goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.

'''Agnes Christine Johnston''' (January 11, 1896 &amp;ndash; July 19, 1978) was an American [[screenwriter]].

==Biography==
Johnston was born in [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania]]. She wrote for 84 films between 1915 and 1948. She had intended to go to college, but was sufficiently proficient in writing scenarios for films following graduating from high school that she ended up taking just a single course in writing plays at Harvard in 1918.&lt;ref name="MPW"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agnes Johnston, Scenarist |journal=Moving Picture World |volume=39 |issue=6 |page=744 |publisher=Chalmers Publishing Company |location=New York City |date=February 8, 1919 |url=https://archive.org/details/movingwor39chal |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Vitagraph Studios]] gave her an assignment to write a scenario for a [[James Oliver Curwood]] novel ''God's Country and the Woman'', she completed the scenario for the [[William Duncan (actor)|William Duncan]] and [[Nell Shipman]] 1916 film within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="MPW"/&gt;

A number of [[Andy Hardy]] films starring [[Mickey Rooney]] were written by Johnston, among them ''[[The Hardys Ride High]]'', ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]'', ''[[The Courtship of Andy Hardy]]'', ''[[Andy Hardy's Double Life]]'' and ''[[Andy Hardy's Blonde Trouble]]''. Her other films included the coming-of-age comedy ''[[Seventeen (1940 film)|Seventeen]]'', the romantic comedy ''[[Janie (1944 film)|Janie]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Janie Gets Married]]'', plus the 1946 adaptation of the classic ''[[Black Beauty (1946 film)|Black Beauty]]''.

She also wrote the screenplays for a 1946 musical comedy, ''[[The Time, the Place and the Girl (1946 film)|The Time, the Place and the Girl]]'' and the 1948 film ''[[Stage Struck (1948 film)|Stage Struck]]''.

Johnston died in [[San Diego, California]] in 1978.

'''Amdo Jampa''' (born 1911 in [[Jainca County|Chentsa]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]], died {{date|March 28, 2002}}, [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], [[China]]), also known as '''Jampa Tseten''', was a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] painter.

== Biography ==
[[File:Die drei großen religiösen Könige.jpg|thumb|''The Three Great Dharma Kings'' by Amdo Jampa, Drepung]]
Amdo Jampa was known for his photo-realistic style. He made famous portraits of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN"&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2002&amp;m=5&amp;p=24-2_5 Obituary of the painter Amdo Jampa], TIN, 22 May 2002 / no of pages: 3 {{ISSN|1355-3313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the first Tibetan artists to study at a Chinese art college.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He was a student of the Tibetan scholar and artist [[Gendün Chöphel]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

As a teenager, he became a monk at [[Drepung Monastery]] and study traditional Tibetan thangka painting. He left Drepung when he accompanied the Dalai Lama to [[Beijing]] in 1954.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

There, he studied traditional Chinese painting and Western painting techniques under the guidance of the Chinese teacher Li Zhongjin.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

When he came back in Lhasa in 1956, he was commissioned to paint in the Tagtu Mingyur Podrang new palace recently completed in the [[Norbulingka]]. His murals merged a traditional Tibetan style with a modern one. The innovation he introduced was that his portraits were easily recognisable.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

The [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama]], later asked Amdo Jampa a portrait, which he also realised in realist style.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa travelled to India in the 1980s. He performed paintings for religious buildings for the Dalai Lama in [[Dharamshala]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

He returned to Lhasa, Tibet. According to Drangchar, a Tibetan magazine, he occupied the official positions of Chairman of the Tibet Fine Arts Association and Chief Research Officer of the Central Executive Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Museum of Cultural Artefacts. He opened an art school in Shol village, before the Potala Palace.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Amdo Jampa's paintings spread in Tibet and influenced Tibetan contemporary painting. 
Hence, before 1996 when the Chinese ban on Dalai Lama pictures, many monasteries had such a picture in the style of Amdo Jampa's famous painting of the Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

According to Gonkar Gyatso, a Tibetan artist from Lhasa now in the UK, Amdo Jampa is the most important Tibetan modern artist. He was trained in the 1950s at thangka painting and he was the only one to perform original works different from traditional painting and had the support of the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for his creative work. His paintings were partly influenced by painters such as [[Vittore Carpaccio]].&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

For [[Jamyang Norbu]], Amdo Jampa was influenced by Gendun Choephel who travelled in India and knew Indian Buddhist and Hindu art as well as European art, as seen in his nudes and dancers. Like other Tibetan artists, Amdo Jampa did not produce anything during the [[Cultural Revolution]] years.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

Even at an old age, Amdo Jampa walked every day around Lhasa, performing a ''[[Kora (pilgrimage)|kora]]''. He was survived by his wife, 2 daughters and 2 sons.&lt;ref name="TIN" /&gt;

== History ==
In 1939, philanthropist and social advocate Aileen Osborn Webb formed the Handcraft Cooperative League of America, an affiliation of craft groups organized to develop markets in metropolitan areas for rural craftsmen. The same year, the American Handcraft Council is formed in Delaware by [[Anne Morgan (philanthropist)|Anne Morgan]], a friend and neighbor of Webb. In 1940, Webb's League opens a cooperative retail venue called America House at 7 East 54th Street in Manhattan. In 1941, they publish a first, untitled issue of what would later become the magazine ''Craft Horizons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|title=Craft Horizons, November 1941 (Volume 1, Number 1)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll2/id/30/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Anne Morgan's American Handcraft Council and Aileen Osborn Webb's Handcraft Cooperative League of America merge into a single organization, the American Craftsmen's Cooperative Council, Inc. In 1943, the merged organizations initiate the American Craftsmen's Educational Council, and are granted a provisional charter from the Board of Regents of the Education Department of New York.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|title=craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729093430/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/our-history|archive-date=2017-07-29|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
For the next decade, the Council maintained their New York retail venue, initiated exhibitions featuring practicing craft artists (including "Designer Craftsmen USA", which was hosted by the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|title=Catalog of the exhibition "Designer Craftsmen U.S.A. 1953"|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/4074/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and hosted national competitions such as "Young Americans" for craftspeople under 30. In 1955, the American Craftsmen's Education Council shortened its name to the American Craftsmen's Council and the acronym ACC fell into use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
 
In 1956, the Council opened the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, now the [[Museum of Arts and Design]], in a brownstone purchased by Webb at 29 West 53rd Street in New York City. The museum's inaugural exhibition "Craftsmanship in a Changing World"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|title=digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130130838/http://digital.craftcouncil.org/digital/collection/p15785coll5/id/2614/rec/1|archive-date=2017-11-30|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured 314 objects by 180 craftspeople from 19 states. The new building also housed the offices for ''Craft Horizons'' and the council's first formal library space. The Council launched its first national conference and began publishing a newsletter, ''Outlook'', in 1957. In 1959, the Council divests in the retail space America House, which relocates to a brownstone purchased by Webb until closing 1971. In 1960, ''Craft Horizons'' is officially incorporated into the Council and subscribers are automatically enrolled as members. For the next decade, the council continues to host conferences, present and tour exhibitions through the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, and expand educational and awards programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1966, ACC held its first regional craft fair in Stowe, Vermont, a precursor to the annual shows the Council continues to present in Baltimore, Atlanta, Saint Paul, and San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/shows|title=ACC Shows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20132216345300/http://www.craftcouncil.org/shows|archive-date=2018-02-11|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, one year after celebrating its 25th anniversary, the American Craftsmen's Council changed its name to the American Crafts Council.

The 1970s bring many significant changes to ACC, including its first cohort of Fellows, elected in 1975. Over 200 craft artists, scholars, and philanthropists have now been honored through induction into the Council's College of Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|title=College of Fellows|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823121352/https://craftcouncil.org/about-acc/acc-awards/american-craft-council-college-of-fellows|archive-date=2017-08-23|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While continuing to host shows and conferences, the Council relocates in 1978 to 22 West 55th Street and in 1979 the Museum of Contemporary Crafts reopens as the American Craft Museum at 44 West 53rd Street. The same year, ''Craft Horizons'' is renamed ''American Craft'' and founder Aileen Osborn Webb dies at age 87.

Another series of relocations take place throughout the 1980s, and in 1990 the American Craft Museum becomes independent. At the Council's new, larger space at 72 Spring Street, the library has space to expand throughout the 1990s, taking on significant donations from the estate of glass artist Robert Sowers and from [[Ed Rossbach]] and [[Mildred Constantine]]. Efforts  to develop a computer database for the library began in 1988, and the Council officially launches its website in 1999. In 2001, the library's catalog becomes accessible online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 2000s, the Council renames and restructures its awards program and begins hosting "convenings," small-scale gatherings of key stakeholders in the field of craft meant to encourage peer-to-peer conversation. In 2010, ACC relocates from New York City to Minneapolis, MN, establishing an office and library in the historic Grain Belt Brewery building at 1224 Marshall Street NE. Not long after the relocation, the Council launches a new website that includes information for both ''American Craft'' magazine and the Council itself. In 2015, ACC launches several programs to highlight and serve emerging artists; Hip Pop, a shows initiative that provides a pathway for emerging artists to successfully take part in ACC shows, and Emerging Voices, an awards program that honors top emerging artist and scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ammassalik wooden maps''' are carved, tactile maps of the [[Greenland]]ic coastlines. In the 1880s, [[Gustav Frederik Holm|Gustav Holm]] led an expedition to the Ammassalik coast of eastern [[Greenland]], where he met several [[Tunumiit]], or Eastern Greenland [[Inuit]] communities, who had had no prior direct contact with Europeans. He returned to Denmark with a set of three-dimensional wooden maps of the coast around {{coord|66|-36|dim:100000|display=inline,title}}, carved by a native of [[Umivik, Ammassalik|Umivik]] named Kunit.

==History==
Kunit approached Holm on February 8, 1885 and sold the maps representing the coast from [[Sermiligaaq|Sermiligak]] to Kangerdlugsuatsiak. Kunit returned on March 21 with another piece representing the peninsula between Sermiligak and Kangerdluarsikajik.{{sfn|Holm|1886|p=104}}

Upon Holm's return, the maps were deposited along with the rest of the collection at the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]. As of 1948 the maps were still in Copenhagen; copies were deposited in the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Bagrow|1948|p=92}} At some point the maps were transferred to the [[Greenland National Museum]] in [[Nuuk]], which was established in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natmus.gl/Forsiden/tabid/80/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Woodward|Lewis|1998}} write that the "only other known example" of such a map is a specimen at the [[Michigan State University]] museum — item 896.7, 62154 — which is probably a copy of Kunit's work.{{sfn|Woodward|Lewis|1998|p=168}}

In 2000, [[Post Greenland]] issued a stamp designed by [[Anne-Birthe Hove]] featuring the coastal map, as part of its "Greenland's Cultural Heritage" series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danstopicals.com/woodmap.htm http://www.stamps.gl/uk/info/kunstnere/Anne_Birthe_Hove/annebirthehove.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greenland National Museum loaned out the maps for a 2007-8 exhibition at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] entitled ''Maps: Finding Our Place in the World'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/maps/about.asp |title=Maps: Finding Our Place in the World: All About Maps |work=fieldmuseum.org |accessdate=2009-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317200556/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/maps/about.asp |archivedate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also traveled to the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalters.org/exhibits/maps/image_pages/inuit.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174154/http://thewalters.org/exhibits/maps/image_pages/inuit.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' Annunciation of Fano''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed around 1488-1490, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy.

The work was successful, and a few years later he was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the same church, the [[Fano Altarpiece]].

==Description==
The painting is set within a four bay portico, a common element in Perugino's paintings from the 1480s (as, for example, in the [[Albani-Torlonia Polyptych]] and the ''[[Pietà (Perugino)|Pietà]]''). Behind it, is a background with hills featuring light trees.

In the foreground is the [[Annunciation]], lit from the left. The angel, holding a white lily (symbol of purity), announces that she will bear Jesus; Mary, who was previously reading a book on a classical altar in front of her, has a surprised face. Behind them, in the upper center, is God in an oval with cherubim and seraphim, sending the Holy Spirit (portrayed as a dove) to her.

'''Festival books''' ({{lang-nl|feestboeken}}, {{lang-es|libros de festivos}}) are books, often [[illustrated books|illustrated]], that commemorate a notable event such as a [[royal entry]],  coronation or wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=festival+book&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300194116 |publisher=[[J.

The genre thrived in [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and [[Early modern Europe|early modern]] Europe, where rulers utilized the form to both document and [[Propaganda|embellish]] displays of wealth and power.

==Description==
Large numbers were produced, often surviving in very few copies; the largest collection, in the [[British Library]], has over 2000 examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/collfestbooksbl.html The British Library collection of festival books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were [[ephemera]]; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] into [[Valladolid]], 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by [[Louis XII]] to Ferdinand at [[Savona]] (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.  [[Roy Strong]] finds that they are "an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:47.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip II of Spain]]'s ceremonial entry into [[Antwerp]] in 1549 was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/habsburg.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], the playwright and author of the book on ''The Magnificent Entertainment'' for [[James I of England]] is refreshingly frank:
:''Reader, you must understand, that a regard, being had that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches; A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left unspoken; So that thou doest here receive them as they should have been delivered, not as they were.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0238&amp;strPage=69 British Library online book]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ehrenpforte.kol.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of top (about 1/10 of the height) of the ''Triumphal Arch'' of Maximilian, coloured [[woodcut]], overall design by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]
The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large [[woodcut]]s by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on Dürer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194–7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]], to [[Constantinople]].

'''Georges Hulin de Loo''' (10 December 1862, in [[Ghent]] – 27 December 1945, in [[Brussels]]) was a Belgian art historian specialising in [[Early Netherlandish art]]. He was educated in his home city of Ghent where he attended high school and university, earning a Ph.D from the Faculty of Arts in 1883, and a degree in law three years later. He then traveled to Germany and Paris to continue his studies, returning to Ghent in 1889 to take up a teaching position the [[University of Ghent]] in a variety of subjects such as logic and law.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/hulindeloog.htm Hulin de Loo] ''Dictionary of Art Historians''. Retrieved 18 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After visiting the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|1902 Bruges exhibition of Netherlandish art]] (''Exposition de tableaux flamands des XIVe, XVe et XVIe siècles'') he published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He went on to become a leading scholar in the field.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos"&gt;Ridderbos, Bernhard; Van Buren, Anne; Van Veen, Henk. ''Early Netherlandish Paintings: Rediscovery, Reception and Research''. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89236-816-0}}, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a separate introduction to the catalogue in which he speculated about the painters' identities (''De l’identité de certains maîtres anonymes''), followed by publications about [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and [[Jan Provoost]]. He was the first art historian to suggest that [[Robert Campin]] was in the fact the painter known as the Master of Flemalle and to identify [[Roger van der Weyden]] as an apprentice to Campin.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;

In 1911 he studied and published a study of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] suggesting a number of miniatures were painted by [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]], an assertion which continues to be a contentious issue among art historians.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;
 
Hulin became active in the art community, sat on committees and associations, and was a consulting editor to ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]''. He continued in his teaching position at Ghent University, however, when in 1930 the university became a Flemish speaking institution, he retired soon after.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt; He continued to write, publishing a biography of Roger van der Weyden in 1938.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt; Along with [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max Friedländer]], who also visited the 1902 Bruges exhibition and wrote a review, Hulin became a leading scholar in the field of Netherlandish art.&lt;ref name = "Ridderbos"/&gt;

He died unmarried and without children in 1945.&lt;ref name = "Hdl"/&gt;

'''Gruene Hall''', was built in 1878 by Henry (Heinrich) D. Gruene and is located in the historical town of [[Gruene, Texas]] (now a part of [[New Braunfels]]), and bills itself as "the oldest continually run dance hall in Texas." By design, not much has physically changed since the Hall was first built. The 6,000 square foot dance hall with a high pitched tin roof still has the original layout with side flaps for open air dancing, a bar in the front, a small lighted stage in the back and a huge outdoor garden. Advertisement signs from the 1930s and 1940s still hang in the old hall and around the stage.

Under the current ownership, Gruene Hall has become internationally recognized as a destination tourist attraction and major music venue for up-and-coming as well as established artists. Gruene Hall has hosted such acts as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[George Strait]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Hal Ketchum]], [[Gregg Allman]] and many more. It was also used as a set for ''[[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]'', starring [[John Travolta]]. Booking agent of 30 years, Tracie Ferguson is credited with starting the original music approach that has made Gruene Hall an [[iconic]] music venue, helping to jump start the careers of Lyle Lovett, Townes Van Zandt, Hal Ketchum, [[Bruce Robison]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Ryan Bingham]], [[Jimmy Dale Gilmore]], [[Robert Earl Keen]], [[Lucinda Williams]] and many others.

The hall has been featured in several books including Pat Green's Dancehalls &amp; Dreamers, Gail Folkins' Texas Dance Halls: A Two Step Circuit, Vokac's The Great Towns of America and Schultz's 1000 Places to See Before You Die.

Taipei: National Palace Museum. Retrieved 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-481 BCE) through the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE - 220 CE), [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo or wooden slips]] were bound together and used to write texts on.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of [[paper]] and [[silk]] in the handscroll format became more common.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; The handscroll was the one of the main formats for texts up until the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Since the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280), the handscroll became a standard format for paintings.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; New styles were developed over time.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

==Description==
A handscroll has a backing of protective and decorative silk (包首) usually bearing a small title label (題籤) on it.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; In Chinese art, the handscroll usually consists of a frontispiece (引首) at the beginning (right side), the artwork (畫心) itself in the middle, and a colophon section (拖尾) at the end for various inscriptions.&lt;ref name=delbanco/&gt;&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;&lt;ref name=artchicago&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Scrolls|url=http://www.artic.edu/taoism/diag-scrolls.php|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the scroll, where the frontispiece was located, is known as the "heaven" (天頭).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Vertical strips (隔水) are sometimes used to separate the different sections.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Most handscrolls contain only one painting, although several short paintings can also be mounted on the scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; At the beginning of the scroll is a wooden stave (天杆), which serves as a support.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A silk cord (帶子) and a fastener (別子) is attached to the stave and used to secure the rolled-up scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A wooden roller (木杆) is attached at the very end, around which the scroll is rolled.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

The '''Henry II style''' was the chief artistic movement of the sixteenth century in [[France]], part of [[Northern Mannerism]]. It came immediately after [[High Renaissance]] and was largely the product of Italian influences. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and his daughter-in-law, [[Catherine de' Medici]], had imported to France a number Italian artists of [[Raphael|Raphael's]] or [[Michelangelo|Michelangelo's]] school; the Frenchmen who followed them in working in the [[Mannerist]] idiom. Besides the work of Italians in France, many Frenchman picked up Italianisms while studying art in Italy during the middle of the century. The Henry II style, though named after [[Henry II of France]], in fact lasted from about 1530 until 1590 under five French monarchs, their mistresses and their queens. 

The most lasting products of the Henry II style were architectural. First [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and then [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and [[Sebastiano Serlio]] served Henry II as court artisans, constructing his gallery and the [[Aile de la Belle Cheminée]] (1568). The French architect [[Pierre Lescot]] and the sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] rebuilt the [[Palais du Louvre]] around the now famous square court. The [[Château d'Anet]], commissioned by [[Diane de Poitiers]], mistress of Henry II, was designed by [[Philibert Delorme]], who studied in [[Rome]]. The very mannerist château housed a statue of Diana by [[Benvenuto Cellini]], who was working in France. In 1564 Delorme began work on the [[Tuileries]], the most outstanding Parisian ''palais'' of the Henry II style. It too exhibited a mannerist treatment of classical themes, for which Delorm had developed his own "[[French order]]" of columns. 

[[Image:Chateau de Chantilly.jpg|thumb|left|Chateau de Chantilly]]
[[Jean Bullant]], another architect who studied in Rome, also produced designs that combined classical "themes" in a mannerist structure. The [[Château d'Écouen]] and the [[Château de Chantilly]], both for [[Anne de Montmorency]], exemplify the Henry II-style château, which was proliferating among the nobility. A very thorough catalogue of engravings of sixteenth-century French architecture was produced by [[Jacques Androuet du Cerceau the Elder]] under the title ''Les plus excellents bastiments de France'' (between 1576 and 1579, in two volumes). Much of the buildings so engraved have been destroyed (like the Tuileries) or significantly altered (like Écouen), so that Cerceau's reproductions are the best guide to the Henry II style. 

[[Image:Pilon-risenchrist.jpg|thumb|right|''Resurrection'' by Pilon]]
In painting, like in architecture, the French were influenced by Italian mannerism and many Italian painters and sculptors were active members of the [[School of Fontainebleau|First School of Fontainebleau]], which in turn produced an active and talented crop of native painters and sculptors, such as [[Germain Pilon]] and [[Juste de Juste]]. By the end of the century the Henry II style, a Gallicised form of Italian mannerism, had been replaced by a more consistent classicism, with hints of the coming [[Baroque]]. Its immediately successor in French art historiography is the [[Henry IV style]].

'''''Il teatro alla moda''''' (The Fashionable Theater) is a satirical pamphlet in which its author, the Venetian composer [[Benedetto Marcello]] (1686–1739), vents his critical opinions on the ''milieu'' of the Italian ''[[opera seria]]'' in the first decades of the eighteenth century. It was first published anonymously in [[Venice]], by the end of 1720. Virtually every aspect of ''opera seria'' and its social environment is mercilessly criticized by Marcello: the [[artificiality]] of plots, the stereotyped format of music, the extravagant scenography and machinery, the inability and venality of composers and poets, the vanity and vulgarity of singers, the avidity of impresarios, the ineptitude of musicians.

[[Image:Teatro_alla_moda.jpg|250px|left|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]
The full title reads "THE FASHIONABLE THEATER – OR – safe and easy METHOD for correctly composing and performing Italian OPERAS in the modern style, – In which – useful and necessary Advice is given to Librettists, Composers, Musicians of both sexes, Impresarios, Performers, Engineers, and Scene Painters, comic Characters, Tailors, Pages, Dancers, Prompters, Copyists, Protectors, and MOTHERS of female Virtuoso singers, &amp; other People belonging to Theater." In fact, ''Il teatro alla moda'' is written as a series of chapters where advice is ironically given to the various people involved in operatic productions, in order to meet "the modern customs" and bizarre requirements of such theatrical events.

Besides the title, the frontispiece contains several allusions to well-known protagonists of the Venetian theater of the time. For instance, the publisher's name "Aldiviva Licante" refers, by means of anagrams, both to [[Antonio Vivaldi]], then very famous as an opera composer, and to the singer [[Caterina Canteli]].

The text of ''Il teatro alla moda'' displays several striking features. To begin with, it shows a degree of vacillation in attitude toward its subject — perhaps resulting from Marcello's personal ambivalence regarding operatic music, as both a critic and a composer. For example, the dedicatory is by "the author of the book to its composer." In addition, it exhibits a number of surrealistic elements, which reach a climax in the last chapter, "The Raffle" (presumably organized by the mother of a young female singer), where the prizes include "a full dress of modern poet in fever-colored tree bark, wrapped with metaphors, translations, hyperboles" as well as "the pen that wrote ''Il teatro alla moda''." The printing accompanies these peculiarities with a chaotic use of italic and normal typography and of capital fonts.

==Translated excerpts (typography preserved)==

"To the Poets – In the first place, the ''modern'' Poet should not have read and should never read the ancient Authors, ''Latin'' or ''Greek''. And this is because the ancient ''Greeks'' or ''Latins'' have never read the ''moderns''."

"To the Music Composers – The ''modern'' Music Composer should possess no knowledge about the ''Rules'' of good composition, except for some principle of universal practice... He should not understand the ''numeric Musical Proportions'', nor the optimal effect  of ''contrary Motions'', or the ''bad Relation'' of ''Tritones'' and ''augmented Intervals''."
 
"To the Singers – It is not necessary that the VIRTUOSO can ''read'', or ''write'', or have a ''good pronunciation of vowels, and of single and double Consonants, or understand the sense of Words'', etc., but it is better if he mistakes ''Senses, Letters, Syllables'', etc., in order to perform ''Ornaments, Trills, Appoggiature, very long Cadences'', etc. etc. etc."

"To the Mothers of Female Singers – When the ''Girls'' have an audition with the Impresario, ''they'' (the mothers) ''will move the mouth with them'', will ''prompt'' them the usual ''Ornaments'' and ''Trills'' and, asked about the age of the ''Virtuosa'', will cut down at least ''ten years''."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3600">[[File:Portrait of Józef Kremer by Maksymilian Fajans. Cropped..jpg|thumb|Józef Kremer]]
'''Józef Kremer''' (February 22, 1806, Kraków - June 2, 1875 Kraków), was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[history of art|historian of art]], a philosopher, an aesthetician and a [[psychologist]].

==Life==
He studied at Kraków, Berlin, Heidelberg and Paris.

He was a professor of philosophy and rector of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Kraków: 1847, assistant professor; 1850, full professor; 1865, Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy; in academic year 1870–71, rector.

He was a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] from the day of its founding (1872). Professor of art history and [[aesthetics]] of [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Kraków.

Kremer was the first proponent of [[Hegelianism]] in Poland. In 1843 he published the first volume of ''Listy z Krakowa'' (Letters from Kraków), a dissertation in aesthetics in the Hegelian spirit (vols. 1-3, Vilnius 1855-1856), which brought him recognition and renown. Also his ''Wykład systematyczny filozofii'' [''A systematic course of philosophy''] (vol. 1, Kraków 1849; vol. 2, Vilinius 1852), apart from the work of [[Karol Libelt]], the first systematic textbook of philosophy in 19th-century Poland, was well received.

Kremer's popularity and fame was, however, ensured primarily by his ''Podróż do Włoch'' (Journey to Italy; vols. 1-5, Vilnius 1859-64), which soon found place among the classics of Polish literature, and its excerpts were included in textbooks and anthologies of the day. Thanks to the efforts of [[Henryk Struve]], in 1877-80 a twelve-volume edition of Kremer's collected works was published in Warsaw. No other Polish philosopher contemporary of Kremer's could boast such a publication.

Kremer's most important achievement in [[psychology]] was the systematic division of psychic phenomena into the conscious and the unconscious, and the treatment of [[anthropology]] as a science which probes the mutual relations between these two. By considering the act as the best source of information about a person, Kremer anticipated [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s position.

==History==
On May 8, 1902, the Actors Fund opened a home for retired entertainers on [[Staten Island]], a [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

In 1928, the [[Government of New York City|New York City government]] took the property using [[eminent domain]] to enlarge an adjacent city park. That year, the residents were moved to the former mansion of American businesswoman [[Hetty Green]] in Englewood.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Jersey –  A Guide to the State |author=Westergaard, Barbara |page=95 |location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2006 | isbn = 978-0-813-51242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mansion was razed in 1959, and a modern facility was erected in 1961.

In 1975, the facility was merged with the Percy Williams Home on [[Long Island]], New York.

The facilities were expanded in 1988 with a 50-bed [[nursing home]]. In the same year, the [[Edwin Forrest]] wing was created at the nursing home after a merger with the Edwin Forrest Home in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].

In 1993, a wing was named in honor of actress [[Natalie Schafer]], notable for her role as [[Lovey Howell|Eunice "Lovey" Wentworth Howell]] on the television [[sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' (1964&amp;ndash;1967), who left $1.5 million to the Actors Fund after her death.&lt;ref name=fund/&gt;

In 2003, it was named in honor of Lillian Booth, a philanthropist who donated $2 million to the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Andrew H. (November 5, 1991).

'''Lois Weber''' (June 13, 1879 – November 13, 1939) was an American [[silent film]] actress, screenwriter, producer, and director. She is identified in some historical references as "the most important female director the American film industry has known",&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Slide, [http://www.gptx.org/index.aspx?page=294 Lois Weber Film Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; and among “the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films".&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;"Lois Weber (1881–1939)", ''Dictionary of Women Worldwide: 25,000 Women Through the Ages'' (2007), [http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2588824604/weber-lois-18811939.html Dictionary of Women Worldwide].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0301/wr1fr12a.htm "Lois Weber, or the exigency of writing"]&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian [[Anthony Slide]] has also asserted, "Along with [[D.W. Griffith]], Weber was the American cinema's first genuine [[auteur]], a filmmaker involved in all aspects of production and one who utilized the motion picture to put across her own ideas and philosophies."&lt;ref name="slide"&gt;Anthony Slide, ''The Silent Feminists'', pp. 29, 151.&lt;!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber produced an ''oeuvre'', which Jennifer Parchesky argues is comparable to Griffith's in both quantity and quality,&lt;ref name="Jennifer Parchesky 1999"&gt;Jennifer Parchesky, "Lois Weber's 'The Blot': Rewriting Melodrama, Reproducing the Middle Class", ''Cinema Journal'' 39:1 (Autumn, 1999):23.&lt;/ref&gt; and brought to the screen her concerns for humanity and social justice in an estimated 200 to 400 films,&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Her first husband, Phillips Smalley indicates they collaborated on 350 films. See Terry Ramsaye, ed., "Phillips Smalley", ''Motion Picture Almanac'', Vol. 38 (Quigley Publications, 1929): 56.&lt;/ref&gt; of which as few as twenty have been preserved,&lt;ref name="Linda Seger 2003"&gt;Linda Seger, ''When Women Call the Shots: The Developing Power and Influence of Women in Television and Film'' (iUniverse, 2003): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One source estimates that fewer than fifty of Weber's films survive. See [[Annette Kuhn]] and Susannah Radstone, ''The Women's Companion to International Film'' (University of California Press, 1994): 418.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been credited by [[IMDb]] with directing 135 films, writing 114, and acting in 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0916665/ Lois Weber filmography]&lt;/ref&gt; Weber was "one of the first directors to come to the attention of the censors in Hollywood's early years".&lt;ref name="Aubrey Malone 2011"&gt;Aubrey Malone, ''Censoring Hollywood: Sex and Violence in Film and on the Cutting Room Floor'' (McFarland, 2011): 7.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber has been credited as pioneering the use of the [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] technique to show simultaneous action in her 1913 film ''[[Suspense (1913 film)|Suspense]]''.&lt;ref name="'24': Split Screen’s Big Comeback"&gt;Julie Talen, [http://www.salon.com/2002/05/14/24_split "'24': Split Screen’s Big Comeback"], Salon.com (May 15, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with her first husband, [[Phillips Smalley]], in 1913 Weber was "one of the first directors to experiment with sound", making the first sound films in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/film/8.html Women Behind the Camera: Women as Directors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514102526/http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/film/8.html |date=2012-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louella O.

During the [[United States home front during World War I|war years]], Weber "achieved tremendous success by combining a canny commercial sense with a rare vision of cinema as a moral tool".&lt;ref name="Richard Koszarski 1994"&gt;Richard Koszarski, ''An Evening's Entertainment: The Age of the Silent Feature Picture, 1915–1928'' (University of California Press, 1994): 223.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At her zenith, "few men, before or since, have retained such absolute control over the films they have directed – and certainly no women directors have achieved the all-embracing, powerful status once held by Lois Weber."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Slide, in Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, "Early Women Filmakers as Social Arbiters", ''Troping the Body: Gender, Etiquette, and Performance'' (SIU Press, 2000): 110.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, Weber was considered the "premier woman director of the screen and author and producer of the biggest money making features in the history of the film business".&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;

Among Weber's notable films are: the controversial ''[[The Hypocrites (1915 film)|Hypocrites]]'', which featured the first full-frontal female [[Nudity in film|nude scene]] in 1915; the 1916 film ''[[Where Are My Children?]]'', which discussed abortion and birth control, and was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 1993; her adaptation of [[Edgar Rice Burrough]]'s ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' novel for the very first [[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes film]] in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece, ''[[The Blot]]'' in 1921.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Weber is credited with discovering, mentoring, or making stars of several women actors, including [[Mary MacLaren]],&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Keil and Shelley Stamp, ''American Cinema's Transitional Era: Audiences, Institutions, Practices'' (University of California Press, 2004): 338.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mildred Harris]], [[Claire Windsor]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Ramsaye, ed, ''Motion Picture Almanac'', Vol. 38 (Quigley Publications, 1929): 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esther Ralston]],&lt;ref&gt;Esther Ralston, "How I Broke into the Movies", ''St. Joseph Gazette'' (November 30, 1930):7A.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billie Dove]],&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Callahan, ''Reclaiming the Archive: Feminism and Film History'' (Wayne State University Press, 2010): 131.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ella Hall]], [[Cleo Ridgely]],&lt;ref name="Harrison Carroll 1933"&gt;Harrison Carroll, "The Flim Shop", ''Tyrone Daily Herald'' (Tyrone, PA: February 4, 1933): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anita Stewart]],&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber, Director of Moving Pictures; Helped Anita Stewart and Other Stars to Win Success", ''The New York Times'' (November 14, 1939): 23:2.&lt;/ref&gt; and discovered and inspired screenwriter [[Frances Marion]].

One film that illustrates the paradoxical nature of Weber's role and films was her 1914 film ''The Spider and Her Web'', where she advocates both modesty and maternalism. In this film, Weber plays "The Spider", a [[femme fatale|vamp]] living the "ultra-modern high life" who seduces and ruins intellectual men until frightened into adopting an orphan baby, which results in the salvation of the lead character through motherhood.&lt;ref name="Mahar90-92"/&gt;

===Universal===
In April 1915, Weber and Smalley left Bosworth when [[Hobart Bosworth|the founder]] left the company due to ill health.&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; After being promised they could make feature-length films by [[Carl Laemmle]], they returned to [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;"Smalleys Back with Universal", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (April 3, 1915): 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's first movie for Universal was ''Scandal'', in which both Weber and Smalley starred, that featured the consequences of gossip mongering.&lt;ref name="Eagan51"/&gt;

In 1916, Weber directed 10 feature-length films for release by Universal, nine of which she also wrote, and she also became [[Universal Studios]]' highest-paid director, earning $5,000 a week,&lt;ref name="Linda Seger 2003"/&gt; and "enjoyed complete freedom in overseeing most stages of the film-making process – choice of stories and actors, writing of scripts (which she invariably did herself), as well as direction".&lt;ref name="Annette Kuhn 1988"&gt;Annette Kuhn, ''Cinema, Censorship, and Sexuality, 1909–1925'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988):28.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal head Carl Laemmle, "who was known more for his frugality and cunning business sense than philanthropy", said of Weber: "I would trust Miss Weber with any sum of money that she needed to make any picture that she wanted to make. I would be sure that she would bring it back."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Laemmle, in Bret Wood, [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/212812%7C0/The-Blot.html ''The Blot''], tcm.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Weber explained her philosophy of directing films: "I'll never be convinced that the general public does not want serious entertainment rather than frivolous", and "A real director should be absolute. He (or she in this case) alone knows the effects he wants to produce, and he alone should have authority in the arrangement, cutting, titling or anything else that may seem necessary to do to the finished product. What other artist has his work interfered with by someone else?... We ought to realize that the work of a picture director, worthy of a name, is creative".&lt;ref name="slide"/&gt;

In ''[[Where Are My Children?]]'' ([[working title]]: ''The Illborn''), which was released on April 16, 1916, Weber advocates social purity, [[birth control]], and [[eugenics]] to prevent the "deterioration of the race" and the "proliferation of the lower classes", and makes "an indirect case for birth control or perhaps even for legalized, and safe, abortions".&lt;ref&gt;E.

It also makes use of several [[trick photography]] scenes, with an emphasis on [[multiple exposure]]s to convey information or emotions visually. As a recurring [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], every time a character becomes pregnant, a child's face is double exposed over their shoulder.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

''[[Shoes (1916 film)|Shoes]]'', a "sociological" film released in June 1916 that Weber directed for the [[Universal Pictures|Bluebird Photoplays]], was based on the 1912 novel ''A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil'' by noted social reformer [[Jane Addams]] and depicts the struggles of working class women for consumer goods and [[upward mobility]] and their dubious sexual activities, including prostitution.&lt;ref name="beannegra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper134"&gt;Mark Garrett Cooper, ''Universal Women: Filmmaking and Institutional Change in Early Hollywood'' (University of Illinois Press, 2010): 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Starring Mary Maclaren as Eva Meyer, a poverty-stricken shopgirl who supports her family of five, who needs to replace her only pair of shoes, and is so desperate that she sells her virginity for a new pair,&lt;ref&gt;Larry Lee Holland, "Mary MacLaren and Katherine MacDonald", ''Films in Review'' 36 (National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, 1985): 227.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it proved to be the most booked Bluebird production of 1916.&lt;ref name="Cooper134"/&gt; A version restored digitally from three extant fragments by [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;Annike Kross, [http://www.the-reel-thing.co/the-reel-thing-xxvii-program-abstracts/ "Restoration and Screening of 'Shoes' (USA, Lois Weber, 1916)"].&lt;/ref&gt; made its debut in North America in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yam-mag.com/features/film-features/the-16th-annual-sf-silent-film-festival-day-4/ "The 16th Annual SF Silent Film Festival: Day 4"], ''YAM'' (July 16, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

After another significant censorship battle, and a vigorous publicity campaign by Universal, on May 13, 1917, Universal released ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', "one of the most forceful films ever made in support of legalizing birth control", a follow-up to the previous year's top money-maker for Universal, ''Where Are My Children?'' Directed by Weber and Smalley based on their original script, it starred Smalley and Weber, in her last screen appearance, as a doctor's wife arrested and imprisoned for illegally disseminating family planning information.&lt;ref name="starts-thursday.com"&gt;Shelley Stamp, [http://www.starts-thursday.com/2010/08/shelley-stamp-lois-weber-and-hand-that.html "Lois Weber and 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'"], starts-thursday.com, August 2010. August 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the recent trial and imprisonment of pioneer birth control advocate [[Margaret Sanger]],&lt;ref name="beannegra"/&gt; the film drew explicitly on her headline-generating activism.&lt;ref name="starts-thursday.com"/&gt;

The film was released only weeks after Sanger's own film, ''[[Birth Control (film)|Birth Control]]'', was banned under a 1915 ruling of the [[United States Supreme Court]] that films "did not constitute free speech",&lt;ref&gt;Kay Sloan, "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle: An Introduction", ''Film History'' 1:4 (1987): 341.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the ruling of the New York Court of Appeals that a film on family planning may be censored "in the interest of morality, decency, and public safety and welfare". Sensitive to the opinions of local communities, and hoping to avoid powerful censorship boards in the northeast and midwest, ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' was distributed primarily in the southern and western regions of the United States, with the result that it did not attain the record-breaking attendance set by ''Where Are My Children?'' the previous year.&lt;ref name="starts-thursday.com"/&gt; When ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' opened at [[Hazard's Pavilion|Clune's Auditorium]] in Los Angeles in June 1917, Weber appeared on stage, bitterly denouncing attempts to alter or suppress her film. While ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'' is now lost, the surviving script and accompanying marketing materials make it clear that Weber mounted an unstinting argument in favor of "voluntary motherhood".&lt;ref name="starts-thursday.com"/&gt;

In June 1917 Weber became the first American female director to establish and run her own [[movie studio]]&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; when she formed her own [[production company]], Lois Weber Productions,&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber Starts Production", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (June 30, 1917):2106.&lt;/ref&gt; with the financial assistance of Universal.&lt;ref name="Lois Weber"/&gt; She leased a self-contained estate, and had offices, dressing rooms, scenic and property rooms, and a {{convert|12000|sqft|m2}} [[sound stage|shooting stage]] constructed.&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber Starts Production", ''Motion Picture World'' (June 30, 1917): 2106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"News of Lois Weber Productions", ''Lois Weber Bulletin'' 1 (June 1917): RIC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Blot"&gt;Bret Wood, [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/212812%7C0/The-Blot.html "The Blot"]&lt;/ref&gt; Smalley was made [[studio manager]], and the Smalleys made their home on the studio lot&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; at 1550 N. Sierra Bonita Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture Studio Directory'' (1919): 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to film historian Shelley Stamp, while Weber and Smalley were often co-credited as directors, it was "the wife who clearly had the artistic vision to drive the business partnership forward".&lt;ref name="The Blot"/&gt; By this time, Weber's "idealized collaborative marriage" with Smalley had begun to show signs of deterioration, which was accelerated by the increased focus of critics and journalists on Weber as the dominant filmmaker, at the expense of Smalley, after 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ward Mahar, ''Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood'' (JHU Press, 2008): 141.&lt;/ref&gt; and Weber increasingly took credit for her contributions after 1917.&lt;ref name="Richard Koszarski 1994"/&gt; However, as early as 1913, some saw Weber as the "fertile brain" in the partnership, with Smalley seen as an indolent womanizer "who chased every woman on the lot", which resulted in arguments and shouting matches.&lt;ref name="Mahar90-92"&gt;Karen Ward Mahar, ''Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood'' (JHU Press, 2008): 90-92.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber consciously resisted the industry's movement toward assembly line-style studio film making. "By concentrating on only one production at a time, and mobilizing her entire work force around that effort, Weber aimed for quality film making rather than efficient bookkeeping". Weber's independence allowed her to shoot her films in sequence, as she preferred (rather than out of order to suit production schedules).&lt;ref name="The Blot"/&gt; William D. Routt indicates that "Lois Weber Productions were a good investment, cost-effective. The company made movies cheaply: in later years at least shooting on location even for interiors, using a small cast, working fast. Its somewhat sensational topics and titles guaranteed at least a modest box office return, and at times may have done much better than that."&lt;ref&gt;William D. Routt, [http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0301/wr3fr12a.htm "Lois Weber on Writing", ''Lois Weber, or the Exigency of Writing''], latrobe.edu.au, March 1, 2001.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed, if any--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen Ward Mahar {{Who|date=December 2016}} attributes the success of Weber's films of the 1910s to their representation of "the generational conflict of the era" between the traditional view of women and that of the freedoms of the emerging "[[New Woman]] and the emergent consumer culture".&lt;ref name="Mahar90-92"/&gt; Mahar argues that "Weber's life was an expression of this generational divide: she was a stage performer and a Church Army Worker, a filmmaker and a middle-class matron, a childless advocate of birth control who 'radiates domesticity'". While Weber was clearly a New Woman by virtue of her career, she was also publicly identified as the wife and collaborator of her first husband.&lt;ref name="Mahar90-92"/&gt;

Shelley Stamp argues that Weber's "image was instrumental in defining both her particular place in film-making practices, and women's roles within early Hollywood generally", and that her "wifely, [[bourgeois]] persona, relatively conservative and staid, mirrored the film industry's idealized conception of its new customers: white, married, middle-class women perceived to be arbiters of taste in their communities".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Stamp, "Presenting the Smalleys, 'Collaborators in Authorship and Direction'", ''Film History'' 18:2 (2006): 119.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  While Weber's beliefs reflected modern values, as did her career as a filmmaker that was atypical for women of her era, she had "internalized much of what the [[Victorian era|Victorians]] deemed proper behavior for women", and there are "strong elements of the Victorian code of womanhood in her films".&lt;ref name="Lisa L. Rudman 1987"&gt;Lisa L. Rudman, "Marriage: The Ideal and the Reel: Or, the Cinematic Marriage Manual", ''Film History'' 1:4 (1987): 327.&lt;/ref&gt; The Smalleys exemplified and promoted the Victorian ideal of marriage as companionship and a partnership.&lt;ref name="Lisa L. Rudman 1987"/&gt;

In 1917, Weber was the only woman granted membership in the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]], and from 1917 Weber was active in supporting the newly established [[Hollywood Studio Club]], a residence for struggling would-be [[actress|starlet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Keil and Shelley Stamp, ''American Cinema's Transitional Era: Audiences, Institutions, Practices'' (University of California Press, 2004): 345.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the United States entered World War I, Weber served on the board of the Motion Picture War Service Association, headed by [[D. W. Griffith]] and including [[Mack Sennett]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[William S. Hart]], [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and [[William Desmond Taylor]]. The Association raised funds for the construction of a thousand-bed hospital.&lt;ref&gt;E.J. Fleming, ''Wallace Reid: The Life and Death of a Hollywood Idol'' (McFarland, 2007): 126–27.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, the [[Fox Film Corporation]] hired Weber to direct ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0009527/ Queen of the Seas]'', in which [[Annette Kellerman]] swam and dove naked. However, she was replaced eventually by [[John G. Adolfi]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay Saunders, ''Notorious Australian Women'' (HarperCollins Australia, 2011).&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1918, Weber broke her left arm in two places when she fell in Barker Brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/lsc&amp;CISOPTR=5419&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=1 "Lois Weber Hospitalized"], ''The Los Angeles Camera'', September 22, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; a downtown Los Angeles store, forcing her to be hospitalized in the California Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Flsc&amp;CISOPTR=5394&amp;DMSCALE=33.42618&amp;DMWIDTH=600&amp;DMHEIGHT=600&amp;DMMODE=viewer&amp;DMFULL=0&amp;DMOLDSCALE=3.08135&amp;DMX=0&amp;DMY=0&amp;DMTEXT=&amp;DMTHUMB=1&amp;REC=3&amp;DMROTATE=0&amp;x=25&amp;y=105 "Lois Weber Breaks Arm by Fall in Downtown Store: Husband of Film Director Arrives From East and Hears of Accident"], ''Los Angeles Examiner'', September 18, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber Breaks Arm", ''Moving Picture World'', October 12, 1918: 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber's arm was still causing her trouble seven months later.&lt;ref&gt;"Broken Arm Causing Trouble", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (February 8, 1919): 754; "Lois Weber's Arm", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (April 12, 1919): 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anita Stewart Productions====
Despite continuing to work at Universal, and renting out her studio to other independent producers, including [[Marshall Neilan]], Weber found it difficult to pay the bills and to find the capital to finance her own productions.&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; By December 1918, Weber had left Universal, and signed a contract with [[Louis B. Mayer]] to direct [[Anita Stewart]] for $3,500 a week.&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber to Direct Anita Stewart", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (December 7, 1918): 1056.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham, ''Merchant of Dreams: Louis B. Mayer, M.G.M., and the Secret Hollywood'' (Laurel, 1994): 46–47.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Weber, Mayer proclaimed: "My unchanging policy will be great star, great director, great play, great cast. You are authorized to get these without stint or limit. Spare nothing, neither expense, time, or effort. Results only are what I'm after."&lt;ref&gt;Louis B. Mayer to Lois Weber, in Mark A. Vieira, ''Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder to Producer Prince'' (University of California Press, 2010):18.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber made two films with Stewart as the lead: ''A Midnight Romance'' and ''Mary Regan'', both released in 1919 to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="Mahar143"&gt;Karen Ward Mahar, ''Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood'' (JHU Press, 2008):143.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Famous Players-Lasky====
Needing finances, in July 1919 Weber signed a contract with [[Famous Players-Lasky]] to direct five films to be distributed through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount-Artcraft]] for $50,000 each,&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American History 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/07/27/97107550.pdf "In the News Net"] ''The New York Times'' (July 27, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber Signs with Famous Players-Lasky", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (August 2, 1919):644.&lt;/ref&gt; plus one-third of the profits,&lt;ref&gt;Autumn Stephens, ''Drama Queens: Wild Women of the Silver Screen'' (Conari Press, 1998):190.&lt;/ref&gt; and guaranteed first-run bookings in Paramount theaters.&lt;ref name="Mahar143"/&gt; By January 1920, Smalley and Weber purchased a two-level home at 1917 N.

In October 1920, Weber purchased the studio facilities at 4634 [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in Los Angeles, near Sunset Boulevard, which she had been leasing for the previous three years.&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber Buys Studio She Has Leased for Past Three Years", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (October 2, 1920): 635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com.

By February 1921, Weber was at the zenith of her career,&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone, ''The Women's Companion to International Film'' (University of California Press, 1994): 418.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and regarded "as fearless in the production of her pictures as she once was in her struggle for a living, and her indubitable position is that of one of the best directors of the screen",&lt;ref name="Carolyn Lowrey 1920"/&gt; One newspaper wrote, "Lois Weber is not only the foremost woman director-she's the whole works", and attributed her success to having "a feminine touch lacking in most man-made films".&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber is "The Whole Works" in Filmdom", ''Iowa City Press-Citizen'' (Iowa City, IA: February 7, 1921): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to protect the American film industry, by 1921 Weber advocated the prohibition of the importation of all European films into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Sandburg]], ''The Movies Are: Carl Sandburg's Film Reviews and Essays, 1920–1928'', ed.  Arnie Bernstein (Lake Claremont Press, 2000):83.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1921, Weber anticipated the possibility of both color and "[[3D film|three-dimensional films]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lois Weber, "Three-Dimensional Films", ''The Washington Post'' (Washington, DC: May 15, 1921): 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following "the cinematic rumination on modern marriage begun by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]",&lt;ref name="Lucy Fischer 2009"&gt;Lucy Fischer, ''American Cinema of the 1920s: Themes and Variations'' (Rutgers University Press, 2009):48.&lt;/ref&gt; and like other post-war filmmakers, Weber turned her attention toward marriage and domestic life to honor her deal with Famous Players-Lasky with such melodramas as ''To Please One Woman'', ''What's Worth While?'' ''Too Wise Wives'', and ''What Do Men Want?''&lt;ref name="Mahar143"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucy Fischer 2009"/&gt; However, as the United States entered the [[Jazz Age]] in the 1920s, Weber, came to be seen as passé, in part because of her "propensity for didacticism",&lt;ref&gt;Lea Jacobs, ''The Decline of Sentiment: American Film in the 1920s'' (University of California Press, 2008):84.&lt;/ref&gt; but also because her "values became increasingly archaic; her moralising, propagandistic tone was unsuited to the era of the [[flapper|'flapper' girl]] and a [[hedonism]] that seemed all the more urgent".&lt;ref name="E. Ann Kaplan 1992"&gt;E. Ann Kaplan, ''Motherhood and Representation: The Mother in Popular Culture and Melodrama'' (Routledge, 1992): 138.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time her "morally upright films bored modern audiences", her crusading was unwanted, and her views were considered "quaint".&lt;ref name="Mahar149"&gt;Karen Ward Mahar, ''Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood'' (JHU Press, 2008): 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Her fall from favor was also due to her inability or unwillingness to adapt to changing audience tastes,&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; and "her refusal to feature big-name stars or to glamorize consumerist excess in her films."&lt;ref name="Fischer60"&gt;Lucy Fischer, ''American Cinema of the 1920s: Themes and Variations'' (Rutgers University Press, 2009): 60.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After an advance screening in February 1921, Paramount executives decided not to distribute the fourth film in their arrangement with Weber, ''[[What Do Men Want?]]''&lt;ref name="Fischer60"/&gt; a domestic [[melodrama]] about a philandering husband and a faithful wife&lt;ref name="Mahar143"/&gt; ([[Claire Windsor]]), and to cancel their arrangement with Weber to distribute her films.&lt;ref name="Lois Weber"/&gt;

After making 13 films,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0134936/ Lois Weber Productions]&lt;/ref&gt; by April 1921, Lois Weber Productions collapsed, and Weber was forced to release all her contracted staff, with the exception of two novice actors.&lt;ref&gt;"Food For Film Fans", ''Providence News'' (Providence, RI: April 4, 1921): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; While she would direct a few other movies, effectively her career as a Hollywood director was over.&lt;ref name="Mahar149"/&gt;

After reading the articles "Impoverished College Teaching" and "Boycotting the Ministry" in the April 30, 1921 issue of ''[[Literary Digest]]'' about the underpayment of educators and clergy, Weber, with scenarist [[Marion Orth]], crafted a melodramatic narrative to bring the issue to life in ''[[The Blot]]''.&lt;ref name="tcm.com"&gt;Bret Wood, [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/212812%7C0/The-Blot.html ''The Blot'' (film profile)], tcm.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Starring [[Claire Windsor]] and [[Louis Calhern]],&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth White Munden, ed., ''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States'', Part 1: ''Feature Films, 1921–1930'' (University of California Press, 1997): 70.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Blot'', was her masterpiece,&lt;ref name="American History p C"/&gt; her most successful film from this period,&lt;ref name="Gwendolyn Audrey Foster 2000"&gt;Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, "Early Women Filmakers as Social Arbiters", ''Troping the Body: Gender, Etiquette, and Performance'' (SIU Press, 2000): 111&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and probably Weber's best-known film today.&lt;ref name="Fischer60"/&gt; The film "rejects the values of capitalist America that measures the value of people in wealth and property" by depicting the compromises and choices impoverished women are forced to make to achieve social mobility and financial security.&lt;ref name="Gwendolyn Audrey Foster 2000"/&gt; It "condemns capitalistic materialism and linked consumerism with sexual exploitation",&lt;ref name="American History 2011"/&gt; and addresses class, money, and ethnicity,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Mellencamp, ''A Fine Romance--: Five Ages of Film Feminism'' (Temple University Press, 1995): 213.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Weber's basically Christian [[ethos]] shines clearly through this plot: the text disapproves of both the new consumerist immigrant class, and the old aristocratic one".&lt;ref name="E. Ann Kaplan 1992"/&gt; Despite xenophobic assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;E. Ann Kaplan, ''Motherhood and Representation: The Mother in Popular Culture and Melodrama'' (Routledge, 1992): 136.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Weber advocates learning, [[asceticism]], and service to the needy.&lt;ref name="E. Ann Kaplan 1992"/&gt;

According to film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]], in ''The Blot'' "Weber's technique is reminiscent of that of [[William C. deMille]], with its quietness, in its use of detail, and its emphasis on naturalism. Weber used the same method of direction, too, filming in continuity."&lt;ref name="Kevin Brownlow 1990"&gt;Kevin Brownlow, ''Behind the Mask of Innocence'' (Knopf, 1990): 292.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To tell with maximum realism this story of a college professor's family – hardworking but with only a meager income – Weber filmed in real houses, using a special [[Stage lighting|lighting rig]], and gave supporting roles to non-actors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photoplay.co.uk/film_pages/blot.html ''The Blot''], photoplay.co.uk; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize this film was a woman-centered narrative, in a "radical departure from Hollywood practice", Weber used point-of-view cutting from the perspective of the professor's wife.&lt;ref name="Jennifer Parchesky 1999"/&gt; Weber also used extreme [[close-up]]s and an ambiguous ending, that Richard Combs describes ''The Blot'' as "so un-Griffithian as to seem almost modernistically open-ended", while others see it as almost [[surrealism|surreal]], declaring it "the ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' of the literally down at heel middle class".&lt;ref name="Jennifer Parchesky 1999"/&gt;

Due to the collapse of her [[distribution deal]] with Paramount, Weber was forced to distribute ''The Blot'' through the F.B. Warren Corporation, a newly formed small independent company that would also distribute a film each by Canadian women producers [[Nell Shipman]] and May Tully, later in 1921.&lt;ref name="Fischer60"/&gt; ''The Blot'' was released on September 4, 1921, but was not well-received critically and did little box office, and vanished after its run. After ''The Blot'', Weber's films did not make money at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Mellencamp, ''A Fine Romance--: Five Ages of Film Feminism'' (Temple University Press, 1995): 214.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, ''The Blot'' was considered a [[lost film]], until it was rediscovered by the [[American Film Institute]] in 1975, and was reconstituted and restored by [[Robert Gitt]] of the [[UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive]] in 1986 from an incomplete negative and an incomplete print.&lt;ref name="tcm.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kevin Brownlow 1990"/&gt; ''The Blot'' was then produced for video by [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]] of [[Photoplay Productions]], and released on home video and DVD.&lt;ref name="tcm.com"/&gt;

As part of the deal to distribute ''The Blot'', F.B. Warren also released ''What Do Men Want?''&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth White Munden, ed., ''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States'', Part 1: ''Feature Films, 1921–1930'' (University of California Press, 1997): 879.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0012827/ ''What Do Men Want?'']&lt;/ref&gt; After the film's premiere at Manhattan's [[Lyric Theatre (1903 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]] on November 13, 1921, ''[[The New York Times]]'', while praising Weber for her casting and the technical aspects of the film, and also the performance of Claire Windsor, dismissed the film as a "simplified sermon" that provided "pat answers" which ignored "the real facts of life", which it considers "incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial".&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/11/14/109826427.pdf "The Screen"], ''The New York Times'' (November 14, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the New York city premiere of ''The Blot'', and in an attempt to salvage their troubled marriage, Weber and Smalley sailed for Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Callahan, ''Reclaiming the Archive: Feminism and Film History'' (Wayne State University Press, 2010): 149.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with Weber's sister and brother-in-law, Ethel and Louis A.

Upon her return to Hollywood, Weber found an "'industry in transition', evident in the fact that [[Erich von Stroheim]] was out of favor, D. W. Griffith was gradually more marginalized, and [[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], like von Stroheim, could not adapt to production changes demanded by the consolidated studios." As Shelley Stamp explains: "In an age of studio conglomeration and [[vertical integration]], few independents could survive, a reality that hit women particularly hard: both [[Alice Guy|Alice Guy-Blaché]] and [[Nell Shipman]] closed their production companies during this period as well. [[Will H.

In November 1922, Weber returned to Universal,&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lois Weber in Jazz Age Hollywood"/&gt; where she directed ''[[A Chapter in Her Life]]'',&lt;ref name="Vicki Callahan 2010"&gt;Vicki Callahan, ''Reclaiming the Archive: Feminism and Film History'' (Wayne State University Press, 2010): 134.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; based on the 1903 novel ''Jewel: A Chapter in her Life'' by Clara Louise Burnham,&lt;ref name="Kenneth White Munden 1997"&gt;Kenneth White Munden, ed., ''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States'', Part 1: ''Feature Films, 1921–1930'' (University of California Press, 1997): 117.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and a remake of a 1915 film called ''Jewel'', which she had directed previously with Smalley. ''A Chapter in Her Life'' was part of "a slate of literary adaptations Universal released that year, headlined by [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' and marketed under the tag line "Great Pictures made from Great Books with Great Exploitation Tieups."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; The film starring [[Claude Gillingwater]] was released on September 17, 1923.&lt;ref name="Kenneth White Munden 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013917 ''A Chapter in Her Life'' (profile)], imdb.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Stamp, ''"Without a chain of theaters under its control, like emerging studio giants MGM and Paramount, Universal now occupied a significantly different market position than it had during the height of Weber’s career there in the mid- 1910s. With the bulk of urban, first-run theaters closed to Universal, the studio now relied on independent theaters mainly located in small towns and rural areas. Nor was the studio home to the female directing talent it had once been—Weber was now on her own."''&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; Consequently, Universal's trade ads made a clear pitch to small-town exhibitors, offering them "quality" pictures at reasonable prices, providing access to first-run pictures many studios reserved for their large urban venues. ''A Chapter in Her Life'' is available on home video and DVD from Nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentsaregolden.com/silentvideolistAC.html "Silent Films on Video A-C"], silentsaregolden.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiatus===
While Weber was praised for her direction in ''A Chapter in Her Life'', "critics felt the film's subject matter—a young girl whose love and faith transform the troubled adults in her life – was ultimately out of step with the times. ''Film Daily'' dubbed the material 'old fashioned', with other critics objecting to the film's '[[Pollyanna]]' themes."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt; Weber subsequently left Universal, vowing not to produce any films for a while, intending to write plays and a novel instead. She traveled to Europe again and spent time at the Colorado summer home of her friend, novelist [[Margaretta Tuttle]], who had written the novel ''Feet of Clay'', later made into [[Feet of Clay (1924 film)|a 1924 film by Cecil B. deMille]], saying she would remain on vacation until the censors "came to their senses".&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

At the time, Weber complained of both the control exerted by consolidated studios, as well as the ever more strenuous censorship of the [[Hays Code]]: "I have received many offers, but in each case I'm hampered with too many conditions. ... The producers select the stories, select the cast, tell you how much you can pay for a picture and how long you can have to make it in. All this could be borne. But when they tell you that they also will cut your picture, that is too much."&lt;ref&gt;Grace Kingsley, "Flashes: She Rebels. Lois Weber Says Too Many Film Restrictions", ''Los Angeles Times'' (July 7, 1923): I7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lois Weber in Jazz Age Hollywood"/&gt;

The trade journal ''Film Mercury'' declared that "it would be interesting to know why [Weber] has made no films in the past year or so," noting that "it is almost a crime for such wonderful director material to be lying idle while third-raters flood the screen with junk."&lt;ref&gt;''Film Mercury'' (October 2, 1925): n.p., quoted in Slide, ''Lois Weber'', 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt; After suffering a nervous collapse in 1923, Weber made no movies until 1925.&lt;ref name="Lois Weber"/&gt; During this period, when Weber ostensibly "retired from public life", it was rumored that Weber had attempted suicide and had entered a mental facility to treat her mental depression.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Heck-Rabi, Women Filmmakers: A Critical Reception (Scarecrow Press, 1984): 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of January 1925, Weber announced her engagement to Captain Harry Gantz (born in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] on September 4, 1887; died August 11, 1949 in [[Cairns|Cairns, Queensland, Australia]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

In 1926, Weber signed a new distribution deal with Universal, making her "one of the highest paid women in the business".&lt;ref name="Vicki Callahan 2010"/&gt; One of her first "comeback" movies was ''The Marriage Clause'', which Weber adapted from the short story "Technic" by Dana Burnet in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' of May 16, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/498017/The-Marriage-Clause/screenplay-info.html ''The Marriage Clause'' (screenplay)], tcm.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[Francis X.

===United Artists===
In November 1926, Weber joined [[United Artists]] to direct a comedy film called ''Topsy and Eva'' based on a popular play of that name written by [[Catherine Chisholm Cushing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://utc.iath.virginia.edu/onstage/films/duncmovhp.html Topsy &amp; Eva: The Movie]&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the [[Duncan Sisters]] in [[blackface]].&lt;ref&gt;"BIG PICTURES COMING; 'Potemkin,' Russian Film; 'Michael Strogoff and "Old Ironsides" to Open Soon", ''The New York Times'' (November 28, 1926).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Assign Lois Weber to Direct Duncan Girls", ''Moving Picture World'' (USA) (December 4, 1926): 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had adapted from [[Uncle Tom's Cabin|the original novel]] when she was attached to the Universal version of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. She attempted to make another serious adaptation, but the studio decided that it should be a comedy rather than a drama. After some shooting by Weber, she thought some of the scenes to be shot were insulting to African Americans, including such "racist humor as a stork dropping a black baby into a trash can".&lt;ref name="michelebeverly.com"/&gt; ''Topsy and Eva'' was reassigned to [[Del Lord]] to direct, with some additional scenes by D.W. Griffith.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173340/fullcredits#writers Full cast and crew for ''Topsy and Eva'' (film profile)], imdb.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927, Weber advised young women to avoid filmmaking careers.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Ward Mahar, ''Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood'' (JHU Press, 2008): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 De Mille Pictures signed Weber to direct her final silent movie, ''The Angel of Broadway'', which featured [[Leatrice Joy]],&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth White Munden, ed., ''The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States'', Part 1: ''Feature Films, 1921–1930'' (University of California Press, 1997): 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kay Armatage, ''The Girl From God's Country: Nell Shipman and the Silent Cinema'' (University of Toronto Press, 2003): 51–52.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and released on October 3, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017630 ''The Angel of Broadway'' (film profile)], ibdb.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the advent of sound technology and the demise of silent movies, coupled with some negative reviews and poor box office receipts, ended her comeback in 1927.&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; For example, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' believed ''The Angel of Broadway'' its sentimentality would appeal to the masses, but not to sophisticated urban audiences: "For New York this title is a dud, but in the hinterland it may well be esteemed box office. Pathe has, in fact, a very good commercial property for the territory west of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'' (November 2, 1927): 18, in Lea Jacobs' ''The Decline of Sentiment: American Film in the 1920s'' (University of California Press, 2008)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 1927, Weber owned and operated Lois Weber's Garden Village at 4633 Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (February 27, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, Weber and Gantz sub-divided the El Rancho Ranch, creating the upscale "Brookdale Heights", now at West Brookfield Place, Fullerton, with the 300–400 residential lots advertised for $1,500 to $3,000 each, and houses priced at $8,000 to $9,000 each.

===Final comeback===
Through the intervention of [[Frances Marion]], by early June 1932 Weber was hired by [[United Artists]] as a [[script doctor]],&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; to work on [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022796 ''Cynara''] with Marion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louella O. Parsons]], "Hal Roach's Doctor Story", ''Rochester Evening Journal'' (June 3, 1932): 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1933, Universal signed Weber to scout for new talent and to direct screen tests.&lt;ref name="Harrison Carroll 1933"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lois Weber"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' (February 12, 1933).&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, Weber had interviewed 250 girls and young women from dramatic schools.&lt;ref&gt;"A Movie Talent Scout Considers The Girls Who Pass Before Her", ''The Sun'' (Baltimore, MD: February 19, 1933).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Universal offered Weber another directing contract, assigning her to [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''[[Glamour (1934 film)|Glamour]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kay Armatage, ''The Girl From God's Country: Nell Shipman and the Silent Cinema'' (University of Toronto Press, 2003):52.&lt;/ref&gt; but she was removed from the project abruptly and it was transferred to a reluctant [[William Wyler]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Jan Herman, ''William Wyler: A Talent for Trouble'', director Wyler was "forced into doing the picture." He "felt it was 'a real disappointment' and couldn't muster the enthusiasm to save it. He always remembered it as 'kind of a screwy picture'".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Weber and Gantz divorced about 1935.&lt;ref name="Notable American Women 1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lois Weber", ''The Hartford Courant'' (Hartford, CT: November 14, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1939, Weber was admitted to [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in critical condition, suffering from a stomach ailment that had afflicted her for years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hedda Hopper]], "Lois Weber Critically III: Pioneer of Films, in Hospital, Fights Ravages of Stomach Ailment", ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 6, 1939): A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt; Almost two weeks later, she died on Monday, November 13, 1939, destitute,&lt;ref name="Foster366"/&gt; from a bleeding ulcer. She was 60 years old. Her younger sister, Ethel Howland, and friends, Frances Marion and Veda Terry, were at her bedside.&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;

Her death was largely overlooked, with her ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' obituary only two brief paragraphs long,&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'' (November 15, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; and a brief mention in the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Los Angeles Examiner'' (November 14, 1939).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gossip columnist]] [[Hedda Hopper]] contributed a more substantial tribute in ''The Los Angeles Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Hedda Hopper, "Death Takes Lois Weber: Veteran Film Writer, Director, Producer and Musician Passes", Los Angeles Times (November 14, 1939): A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, November 17, 1939, more than 300 people attended Weber's funeral,&lt;ref name="Los Angeles 1939"&gt;"LOIS WEBER BURIED" (Los Angeles, CA: November 17, 1939), (AP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times 1939"&gt;"Lois Weber Rites Set for Today", ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 17, 1939): 30.&lt;/ref&gt; which was paid for by Frances Marion.&lt;ref name="Cari Beauchamp 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foster366"/&gt; After the funeral, Weber was cremated at the [[Chapel of the Pines Crematory|Los Angeles Crematory]]&lt;ref&gt;"Weber Funeral to Be Friday: Hollywood Mourns Woman Film Director Who Died on Monday", ''Los Angeles Times'' (November 15, 1939): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the location of her remains are unknown.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles 1939"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times 1939"/&gt;

Weber wrote a memoir, ''The End of the Circle'', which was to have been published shortly before her death,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Schallert, "Movieland Jottings and Castings", ''Los Angeles Times'' (August 22, 1939): 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  but ultimately was not, despite the efforts of her sister, Ethel Howland, and was later stolen in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="slide"/&gt; For her contribution to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Weber was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6518 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name="Awards for Lois Weber"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0916665/awards|title=Awards for Lois Weber|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre censorship==
The [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s Office had a more significant role in British society prior to 1968, as it was the official [[censorship|censor]] for virtually all theatre performed in Britain. Commercial theatre owners were generally satisfied by the safety this arrangement gave them; so long as they presented only licensed plays they were effectively immune from prosecution for any offence a play might cause.  There were campaigns by playwrights, however, in opposition to the Lord Chamberlain's censorship, such as those involving [[J. M. Barrie]] in 1909 and 1911. Some plays were not licensed in the 1930s, during the period of [[appeasement]], because they were critical of the German Nazi regime and it was feared that allowing certain plays to be performed might alienate what was still thought of as a friendly government.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Steve|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/21/royal-household-suppressed-anti-nazi-theatre-1930s|title=Theatre of war: how the monarchy suppressed anti-Nazi drama in the 1930s|work=The Guardian|date=21 July 2015|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rowland Baring, 2nd Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]], then Lord Chamberlain, regularly consulted the Foreign Office and sometimes, the German Embassy. In the latter case, the submissions were intended to be read by a "friendly German".&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

By the 1960s, there were many playwrights and [[theatrical producer|producer]]s who wished to produce controversial works such as ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]''. Theatre companies such as the [[Royal Court Theatre]] came into open conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Sometimes they would resort to such measures as declaring themselves private clubs for the performance of certain plays. The Lord Chamberlain's Office technically had jurisdiction over private performances, but had generally avoided getting involved with bona-fide private clubs. The various activist groups did not actually come up with solid legal loopholes, but the publicity they generated eventually resulted in the abolition of the role of official censor in the [[Theatres Act 1968]].

The '''Marinko Sudac Collection''', based in [[Zagreb]], Croatia, has been created with a clear collecting strategy based on the region of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], additionally spanning from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] area to the [[Black Sea]]. The guiding principle of the Collection is systematic exploration, researching, and promotion of the [[avant-garde]] practices which have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely negated due to the historical, social and political circumstances. In this context, the Marinko Sudac Collection gives the most complete and comprehensive overview on the art of this region. The Collection starts at 1909, and it show the continuity from the first Avant-Gardes, through [[neo-avant-garde]] and [[New Artistic Practice]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, ending with the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The global uniqueness of the Marinko Sudac Collection is also seen in the kind of media it contains.  It contains not only traditional artworks, such as paintings, sculptures, and photographs, but it gives equal importance to documentary and archival material. Great importance is put on these almost forgotten media, which enable research of specific phenomena, artists and the socio-political situation which affected this type of art. The Collection contains a great number of museological units, and it treats the documentary and archival material on the same level as traditional artworks. By examining the units contained in the Marinko Sudac Collection, one can read not only the art scene or the art production of a certain artist, but the full status of the society, the socio-political atmosphere of the region in which this art was created in.

This Collection is not merely a process of gathering artworks, but a contextualisation of the art of region in the global history of art and an effort of putting it on its deserved place in history. The aim of the Marinko Sudac Collection is to preserve the cultural heritage of the Central and Eastern European region from globalisation, by maintaining it in a contextual unity. The end goal is to place the Collection in an architectural, physical building of the Museum of Avant-Garde, in which this art will be valorised, museologically processed, open to researchers and experts, and presented to the public. A part of the works from the Marinko Sudac Collection is available in digital form on an innovative platform of the [[Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde]] (www.avantgarde-museum.com/en), which unites the work of the Virtual Museum of the Avant-Garde, the Marinko Sudac Collection, and the [[Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde]], with a goal to form a central database for the researching of the phenomena of the Avant-Garde.

Alongside more than 80 already accomplished successful collaborations with museum institutions and independently organized exhibition in great museum centres such as [[Tate Modern]], London; [[Ludwig Museum]], Budapest, [[Haus der Kunst]], Munich; [[Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe|ZKM]], Karlsruhe, [[Deutsches Filmmuseum Frankfurt]], [[Museum of Modern Art]], Warsaw, [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb|Museum of Contemporary Art]], Zagreb,... or exhibition of the Collection in unofficial places such as Marshall [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s boat ''Seagull'' (''At Standstill'' exhibition, Rijeka, 2011), Marinko Sudac is also an editor of numerous publications – art monographs, exhibition catalogues and collections of texts, and an author of a successful artist residence project ''Artist on Vacation,'' held annually since 2012, which hosted over 50 of the leading world artists which continue the tradition of the Avant-Garde.

== Collection strategy ==
The Collection's interest extends from the Baltic area to the Black Sea, with particular emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The collector's strategy is directed towards systematic exploration, research, and promotion of Avant-Garde practices that have been marginalized, forbidden, and at times completely rejected, due to historical, social and political circumstances. In this respect, the Collection is, in relation to already existing European art collections, regionally cohesive, and presents an inexhaustible resource for the research of Avant-Garde art and a dynamic platform for the exchange of knowledge on the phenomenon of Avant-Garde. This can be seen in numerous topical and retrospective exhibitions, organized events, followed by connected detailed publications or studies, articles in professional journals, some published in the framework of research projects and collaborations with numerous important institutions, experts, theoreticians, art historians, and artists from the entire world.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Museum of Avantgarde ==
The Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde, based on the Marinko Sudac Collection, was created in 2009. It presents the digital database of the Collection through which you can see the overview of Avant-Garde art in the countries of former Yugoslavia structured according to authors, artworks, time periods, and geographical areas, as well as links and influences of the artists with cultural happenings and artistic centres in the region and the world. The website, beside the high-quality digitized artworks, contains biographies and bibliographies, alongside the connection of the artists with other artists, art institutions and cultural forums, as well as selected publications.

The online database show only a small part of the Collection. Speedy digitization of the material is crucial to accomplish the Museum's main aim, which is to make it a centre for information on the regional Avant-Garde practices.

The Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde is a free online platform to research all forms of Avant-Garde art of Eastern and Central Europe, to show connection with the rest of the world, to be a place for free thought and making realisations on the relevant cultural phenomena of Avant-Garde thought and artistic doing, to be a space for creating and publishing expert materials and research on the phenomena of the Avant-Garde. In its work, the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde managed to become a meeting point of experts and intellectuals from the region and the artists, as well as interested public who can, in one place, find many information on the Avant-Garde movement in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/about-us/museum-of-avantgarde/|title=Avantgarde Museum|website=avantgarde-museum.com|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international Board is made up of leading theoreticians and art historians: Lutz Becker, Jerko Denegri, Živko Grozdanić, Matko Meštrović, Želimir Koščević, Irina Subotić, Feđa Vukić, and Laszlo Beke. The director is Branko Franceschi.

== Projects ==
Since its beginning, the Marinko Sudac Collection has been open to collaboration with various institutions. Through the years, the works from the Collection have been exhibited both locally and internationally.

The Collection has been recognised as a good partner and the growing interest in different types of collaborations (exhibitions, conferences, projects, movies, publications) shows the quality of the Collections and its open character.

== Publications ==
As part of its activities, the interconnected institutions of the Museum of Avant-Garde, Marinko Sudac Collection, and the Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde publish various types of publications – artist monographies, exhibition catalogues etc.

The aim of these publishing projects is to present relevant artists, artist groups, artistic movements and developments of the former Yugoslavia region, as well as of Eastern and Central Europe. By presenting them through publications, the aim is to provide them with better international recognition and valorisations, so they could be placed in their rightful position in the global art scene.

== Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde ==
The Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde was created in 2010 as part of the project which has as its goal to research, preserve, present and popularize regional historical Avant-Gardes. The Institute brings together the work of the Virtual Museum of Avant-Garde and the Marinko Sudac Collection. The Institute for the Research of the Avant-Garde's task is to create the work and development strategy of the Museum of Avant-Garde, make projects which promote Avant-Garde art and publish materials on the topic.

=== Artist on Vacation ===
Since 2012, the Artist on Vacation project has gathered, hosted and presented to the public a number of internationally prestigious artists who belong to the period of historical Avant-gardes, as well as artists who continue the practice of radical art and further develop its aesthetics. In the summer months, Poreč becomes a vacation spot for international artists. In collaboration with Valamar Riviera d.d., the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection invite artists to spend a week at an exclusive hotel and vacation on the beautiful Istrian peninsula.

The project was created by Marinko Sudac as an extension of the activities of the Museum of Avant-Garde, the Institute for the Research of Avant-Garde and Marinko Sudac Collection. It complements the Collection's mission, and gives affirmation to the artists in the social, cultural and artistic contexts. The mission of the Artists on Vacation project is to show the various legacies of the original Avant-Garde movement that have developed in different countries and contexts.

The entire driving force behind our project is to present the participating artists to the Croatian public. The project is an effort to connect all the activities that aim to bring together the historical Avant-Gardes and present them to the public in a direct way, outside of an institutional environment. Artists get an opportunity to meet other artists, but also theorists, art historians, and museum professionals. This exchange of ideas and influences brings about personal and artistic developments and paves way to new collaborations and projects.  Every year, there is an exclusive one day exhibition organized during the Project.

Each year, at the end of the Project, an exhibition of works created during the Artist on Vacation project, as well as a presentation of the participating artists is organized at the Museum of Contemporary Art Zagreb. A catalogue of a year's project is produced. The catalogue contains all the information about the project, the participating artists, their stay at Poreč, their works etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.avantgarde-museum.com/en/museum/about-us/institute-for-the-research-of-the-avant-garde/|title=Avantgarde Museum|website=avantgarde-museum.com|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nadhi Karaiyinile''''' (English: On the river shore) is a [[Tamil films of 2003|2003]] [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] drama [[film]], written and directed by [[Ponvannan]]. The film, which had an initial release at international film festivals with the title ''Jameela'', stars [[Suvalakshmi]], [[Rajan P. Dev]] and [[Ramji (actor)|Ramji]] in the lead roles. The music for the film was composed by [[Sirpy]] and the film opened to positive reviews in November 2003, after several delays.

==Cast==

* [[R. C. Sakthi]]

==Production==
Ponvannan's second directorial venture, ''Jameela'' (2003), featuring [[Suvalakshmi]], [[Rajan P. Dev]] and [[Ramji (actor)|Ramji]], told the story of an ego clash between two men which ruins the life of an obedient woman. Ponvannan had been impressed with writer [[Sara Aboobacker]]'s novel and bought the script rights, before submitting his screenplay to [[National Film Development Corporation of India]] to finance the film. The agency agreed and ''Jameela'' was shot for seventeen days in [[Pondicherry]] at a cost of 35 lakh rupees.{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=429}}

==Release==
The film won positive reviews in screenings and was well received by critics, prompting it to be selected to be shown in the non-competitive category at the [[2002 Shanghai International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2002/08/23/stories/2002082301010200.htm |title=Tamil film in Chinese fest |publisher=The Hindu |date=2002-08-23 |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being censored in 2001, the film only had a theatrical release across India in November 2003 under the title ''Nadhi Karayinile'', after the distributor Viswas Sundar did not want the film to be classified as a "Muslim film".{{Sfn|Dhananjayan|2014|page=429}} The film did not perform well at the box office, but went on to win three [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|State film awards]] including the recognition as [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film Portraying Woman in Good Light|Best Film portraying Women in Good Light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/10733.html |title=Tamil Nadu announces film awards for three years |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2004-10-01 |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindu described Ponvannan's direction as an "absorbing presentation", adding "his sensitivity comes to the fore throughout the film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2003/11/28/stories/2003112801490201.htm |title=Nadhi Karaiyinilae |publisher=The Hindu |date=2003-11-28 |accessdate=2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was Suvalakshmi's last film she had worked before she left the film industry.

The '''North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop (NESW)''' is an [[artist collective]], or [[artist-run initiative]], centred on a co-operative shared studio in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], focused on "the creation and promotion of ambitious [[contemporary]] [[sculpture]] made using [[industrial engineering|industrial]] processes and materials".&lt;ref name="PS"&gt;[http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies "Profiles: Edmonton Art Institutions (Societies, Foundations, Associations etc.)", PrairieSeen, September 18, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010092410/http://prairieseen.tumblr.com/post/74426438934/profiles-edmonton-art-institutions-societies |date=October 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TI"&gt;[https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gec-travel-information/GTgJ2wIq5dY Travel Information: Artists' Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonculturalcapital.com/links.asp "Links to Arts, Cultural Listings and Information", Cultural Capital of Canada, Edmonton 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avenueedmonton.com/City-Life/Top-40-Under-40/Ryan-McCourt/ "Ryan McCourt: Top 40 Under 40", Avenue Edmonton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“War, Peace Among Themes of Sculpture Exhibition”, Gilbert Bouchard, Edmonton Journal, July 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;[http://spectatortribune.com/prairie-daily-winnipeg-architects-99-red-balloons-saskatchewan-pet-owners-take-diy-too-far-calgary-food-drive-and-edmontons-scrap-metal-sculptors/ "Prairie Daily: Winnipeg architect’s 99 red balloons, Saskatchewan pet owners take DIY too far, Calgary food drive, and Edmonton’s scrap metal sculptors," Chad Cawson, Spectator Tribune, November 2, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The NESW name makes a symbolic reference to the [[cardinal directions]] in allusion to the idea of boundless exploration.&lt;ref name="BIG2"&gt;"Big Spaces For Big Sculptures," Janice Ryan, Studio Inside, Edmonton Journal, November 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop was founded in 2002, with sculptors Mark Bellows, [[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], and [[Ryan McCourt]] as the resident artists. In its first year, the NESW produced four exhibitions in four different venues: "''Front Room Sculpture''" at [[Harcourt House, Edmonton|Harcourt House]]; "''North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop''" at Global Visions Film Festival; "''Desperate Measures''" with [[The Works Art &amp; Design Festival|The Works Society]]; and "''[[Big Things]]''" at the [[Royal Alberta Museum]].&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Bouchard, “Come to Expect ‘Big Things’”, Edmonton Journal, July 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Floren, “Big Impressions”, The Edmonton Sunday Sun, July 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAM"&gt;[http://www.royalalbertamuseum.ca/exhibits/past.cfm Past Exhibits, Royal Alberta Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures by the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop artists appeared in another 2002 Harcourt House exhibition: "Edmonton Sculpture: The Next Generation", an Edmonton sculpture survey show curated by Canadian artist, curator and critic [[Terry Fenton]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Winters, "Fitting into the Modernist Mould," SEE Magazine, Issue #455, August 12–21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying essay, Fenton singles out the NESW artists:

"''[[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], Mark Bellows, and [[Ryan McCourt]] share a studio, giving them the double advantage of being removed from the student environment while retaining continued access to one another for stimulation and criticism. This does not amount to their charting a common course. If anything, the shared studio has confirmed them in separate directions: the hothouse atmosphere appears to have stimulated both invention and individuality. Their work seems to be getting closer to the source of their inspiration, French's into the occupation of space by brute force, Bellows into a poetry of volume, McCourt into elegant profiles''".&lt;ref&gt;"Edmonton Sculpture: The Next Generation," Terry Fenton, Harcourt Expressed, Volume 12, Summer/Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ACSE RAM.jpg|thumb|The sculptures on display at the Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition at the Royal Alberta Museum in 2005.]]
The success of the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop's first [[Big Things]] exhibition&lt;ref&gt;Mike Berezowsky, “Sculpture Exhibit Gets a Big Response”, Edmonton Examiner, September 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; would lead to three more presentations in the series: Big Things 2 in 2003, Big Things 3 in 2004, and Big Things 4 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;“Bianca Khan's One-Tonne Challenge”, Gilbert Bouchard, Edmonton Journal, July 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, in celebration of Alberta's centennial year, and the Museum's new [[Royal Charter]] from [[Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref name="RAM" /&gt; the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented the Alberta Centennial Sculpture Exhibition at the newly named [[Royal Alberta Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Olenka Melnyk, “Big Sculpture, Bigger Worries Burden Artists”, Edmonton Journal, July 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Directions ==
Mark Bellows left the studio in 2005, while [[Robert Willms]] joined the NESW that same year.&lt;ref name="TI" /&gt; In 2007, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop moved into a large new facility, with 2100 square feet working space, concrete floors, 20-foot ceilings, and a 2,800-square-foot yard.&lt;ref name="ST" /&gt; As the Royal Alberta Museum grounds were unavailable to the group that year, the NESW exhibited "New Directions," a show of smaller works, at the Stollery Gallery in Edmonton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/whatson/story.html?id=a9396ebb-41b3-43e3-a425-564e244d4140 "Multiple Directions Merge In Single Exhibit”, Edmonton Journal, October 5, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon touring the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop in 2008, Edmonton arts writer Amy Fung called the studio "''essentially an artist’s [[wet dream]] in our space-deprived city.''" In her view, the NESW was "''certainly more impressive in size and facilities than existing local [[Artist run centre|ARCs]] and arts initiatives such as ArtsHabitat''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vueweekly.com/prairie_artsters_a_different_kind_of_arc/ "Prairie Artsters - A Different Kind of ARC", Amy Fung, Vue Weekly, July 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop presented "AUTOGRAPH: Sculpture and Drawing by Rob Willms",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=a89724b5-c211-4cdc-b1fd-fb1f549733a2 "Museums and Galleries", Edmonton Journal, March 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; the inaugural exhibition in Common Sense, their new gallery space; and "Peter Hide @ The RAM," an exhibition of major works by Hide on the [[Royal Alberta Museum]]'s outdoor [[sculpture]] patio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Iron-Bridge-Sculptors-Life-Peter/dp/1926710401 Iron Bridge: A sculptor's Life, Peter Hide", Piri Halasz, Nov 5 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Edmonton Journal]] profile on the NESW, their ground level studio at 10546 - 115th street has 2100 square feet of concrete floor space, 20-foot-high ceilings, and a ten-foot by fourteen-foot sliding door that leads to a 2800-square-foot storage yard. Resident sculptors in 2012 include [[Ryan McCourt]], Mark Bellows, [[Andrew French (sculptor)|Andrew French]], Stephen Pardy and [[Robert Willms]].

The '''''Oration on the Dignity of Man''''' (''De hominis dignitate'') is a famous [[public discourse]] composed in 1486 by [[Pico della Mirandola]], an Italian scholar and [[philosopher]] of the [[Renaissance]]. It remained unpublished until 1496.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pico-della-mirandola/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pico Project,'' a collaboration between [[University of Bologna]], Italy, and [[Brown University]], United States, dedicated to the ''Oration'', and others have called it the "Manifesto of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/pico/presentaz/eng.html|title=Introduction in English|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/11/14/pico-della-mirandola-oration-on-the-dignity-of-man-15th-c-ce/|title=Pico Della Mirandola: Oration On the Dignity Of Man (15th C. CE)|last=Brians|first=Paul|date=|website=|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pico, who belonged to the family that had long dwelt in the Castle of [[Mirandola]], left his share of the ancestral principality to his two brothers to devote himself wholly to study. In his fourteenth year, 1477, he went to Bologna accompanied by his mother to study canon law and fit himself for the ecclesiastical career. Following his mother's death in 1478, Pico in 1479 requested from the [[Federico I Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua|Marquess of Mantua]] a free passage to [[Ferrara]], where he would devote himself to the study of philosophy and theology. He spent the following seven years variously in Ferrara, [[Padua]], [[Florence]] and [[Paris]], studying Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic at the chief universities of Italy and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/pico/crono.html|title=Cronologia|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===The potential of human achievement===
Pico's ''Oration'' attempted to remap the human landscape to center all attention on human capacity and human perspective. Arriving in a place near Florence, he taught the amazing capacity of human achievement. "Pico himself had a massive intellect and studied everything there was to be studied in the university curriculum of the Renaissance; the ''Oration'' in part is meant to be a preface to a massive compendium of all the intellectual achievements of humanity, a compendium that never appeared because of Pico's early death."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Dignity of the liberal arts===
Pico della Mirandola intended to speak in front of an invited audience of scholars and clerics of the dignity of the liberal arts and about the glory of angels. Of these angels he spoke of three divisions in particular: the [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]], and [[Thrones]]. These are the highest three [[Christian angelic hierarchy|choirs]] in the angel hierarchy, each one embodying a different virtue. The Seraphim represent charity, and in order to obtain the status of Seraphim, Mirandola declares that one must "burn with love for the Creator". The Cherubim represent intelligence. This status is obtained through contemplation and meditation. Finally, Thrones represent justice, and this is obtained by being just in ruling over "inferior things". Of these three, the Thrones is the lowest, Cherubim the middle, and Seraphim the highest. In this speech, Mirandola emphasizes the Cherubim and that by embodying the values of the Cherub, one can be equally prepared for "the fire of the Seraphim and the judgement of the Thrones". This deviation into the hierarchy of angels makes sense when Pico della Mirandola makes his point that a philosopher "is a creature of [[Heaven]] and not of earth" because they are capable of obtaining any one of the statuses.&lt;ref&gt;http://bactra.org/Mirandola/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of human quest for knowledge===
In the ''Oration'', Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a Neoplatonic framework. He writes that after God had created all creatures, He conceived of the desire for another sentient being who would appreciate all His works, but there was no longer any room in the [[chain of being]]; all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain. Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God. When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The idea that men could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life. The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own [[free will]], whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change. He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant. Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.

===Introduction to Pico's 900 theses===
The ''Oration'' also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.calameo.com/read/001554655ffe07d58692b|title=Pico's 900 Theses|work=calameo.com|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined [[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Aristotelianism]], [[Hermeticism]] and [[Kabbalah]]. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics. Pico also argued in this oration that his youth should not discredit any of the content of his 900 theses (he was in his twenties).

Pico had "cosmic ambitions": in his letters and early texts, he hinted that debate of the 900 theses (the first printed book ever universally banned by the Church) might trigger Christ's Second Coming and the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syncretism in the West: Pico's 900 Theses (1486): The Evolution of Traditional Religious and Philosophical Systems|last=Farmer|first=Stephen A|publisher=ACMRS Publications; 1 edition|year=1998|isbn=0866982094|volume=Book 167|location=Tempe, Arizona|pages=39-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Copenhaver|first=Brian|title=Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/pico-della-mirandola/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] condemned the theses in general but declared the author to be free from censure. This was written in August 5, 1487 but it was not issued until the following December. In a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] dated August 27, 1489, Pico affirms among other things some of his thesis refer purely to profane matters and were never intended for general reading, but for private debate among the learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1883|title=An Early Humanist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FlDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company - The Riverside Press|volume=51|page=500-501|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mystical vocation of humanity===
In the ''Oration'' he writes that "human vocation is a mystical vocation that has to be realized following a three stage way, which comprehends necessarily moral transformation, intellectual research and final perfection in the identity with the absolute reality. This paradigm is universal, because it can be retraced in every tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Pier Cesare Bori. "[http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html The Italian Renaissance: An Unfinished Dawn?: Pico della Mirandola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229231307/http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html |date=2007-12-29 }}". Accessed December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pico defends philosophy===
Here Pico explains why he chose to become a philosopher. A paraphrase of paragraph 24:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
These are the reasons why I decided to study philosophy. And I'm not going to explain them to anyone except those who condemn philosophy. Philosophy is not something to be used scornfully or as insult, but for honor and glory. People are beginning to think wrongly in that philosophy should only be studied by very few, if any at all, as if it is something of little worth. We have reduced philosophy to only being useful when being used for profit. I say these things with regret and indignation for the philosophers who say it should not be pursued because it has no value, thus disqualifying themselves as philosophers. Since they are in it for their own personal gain, they miss the truth for its own sake. I'm going to say, not to brag, but I've never philosophized except for the sake of philosophy, and have never desired it for my own cultivation. I have been able to lose myself in philosophy and not be influenced by others who try to pull me away from it. Philosophy has taught me to rely on my own convictions rather than on the judgments of others and to concern myself less with whether I am well thought of than whether what I do or say is evil.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Delivery==

Pico was prevented from holding his Oration. It was penned as the opening speech for a public disputation of his 900 theses, planned for early 1487, but Pope Innocent VIII suspended the event and instead set up a commission to examine the theses for heresy. A presentation of the full text in English in front of a live audience read by Sebastian Michael took place at [[TU Wien]] (University of Technology Vienna) as part of the opening event of the first Sophistication Conference organised by the Department for Architecture Theory and Philosophy of Technics on 7 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.attp.tuwien.ac.at/interne-veranstaltungen/sophistication-conference|title=Conference: Sophistication: Rhetorical, Geometrical, and Computational "Articulation"|last=|first=|date=|website=ATTP TU Wien|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

POBA is a non-profit, online arts community, launched in July, 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodprogressive.com/poba-virtual-cultural-arts-center/ |title=POBA Virtual Cultural Arts Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; by The James Kirk Bernard Foundation (named after a young artist who died in 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/independentpress/index.ssf/2010/02/obituary_james_kirk_bernard_di.html |title=Obituaries: James Kirk Bernard dies at 22, lived his first 15 years in Summit|work=NJ.com| date=February 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
POBA's mission is to preserve, display, and provide resources for research, archiving, and appraising the creative legacies of 20th and 21st century artists who either died without their legacy being fully recognized, were not recognized for a specific medium, or whose work is not readily accessible elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/your-money/the-weighty-responsibility-of-inheriting-a-collection.html|title=The Weighty Responsibility of Inheriting a Collection, The New York Times (September 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Minsky, Digital Life after Death, "Provincetown Banner" (Thursday, Nov. 6, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

POBA offers membership to anyone who owns the rights to a deceased artist's legacy. Members can create portfolios on behalf of that artist to show the works in the appropriate digital format, for public display and private storage.

The name "POBA" derives from the Hindi word "[[phowa]]", which means the transformation of consciousness at death.

==Partners==

POBA has partnered with such leading institutions and galleries as the [[American Ballet Theatre]] and The Berta Walker Gallery, and has partnerships with the [[Provincetown Art Association and Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/72371/Online-exhibitions-spotlight-groundbreaking-artists-from-America-s-oldest-active-arts-colony |title=Online exhibitions spotlight groundbreaking artists from America's oldest active arts colony (January 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paddle8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanphotomag.com/photo-gallery/2014/12/newly-unearthed-collection-photos-20th-century-masters-to-be-auctioned-online?page=2 |title=Auction is the first in a new series launched by Paddle8 in partnership with POBA (December, 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, POBA launched Art Lives, an online project to digitize, curate, and display the work of artists of all genres lost to [[AIDS]] in the 1970s and 1980s, partnering with DIFFA (Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS), LifeBeat (Music Fights AIDS) and Visual AIDS for the initial portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-incredible-artists-who-lost-their-lives-to-hiv_us_565caea7e4b079b2818b45e2 |title=7 Incredible Artists Who Lost Their Lives To HIV (December, 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featured artists include [[Sylvester (singer)]], [[Mel Cheren]], artist and creator of [[West End Records]], and [[Patrick Kelly (fashion designer)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/12/01/poba_s_art_lives_preserves_the_work_of_artists_lost_to_hiv_aids.html |title=The Work of Artists Lost to AIDS Lives On (December, 2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pendilia''' (singular '''pendilium'''; from [[Latin]] ''pendulus'', hanging) or '''pendoulia''' (the Greek equivalent), are [[pendant]]s or dangling ornaments hanging from a piece of metalwork such as a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[votive crown]], [[crux gemmata]], or [[kamelaukion]], and are a feature of Early Medieval [[goldsmith]] work.  On crosses the pendilia may include the letters [[alpha and omega]], and on votive offerings, which were often designed to be hung over altars and where pendilia are at their largest and most spectacular, they may spell out whole words (see illustration).

The term is commonly used in [[coin collecting]]. Pendilia are depicted on coins as jewels or pearls hanging from the sides of the crown, and occur frequently on coins of [[Byzantine emperors]]. The pendilia which hung from the Emperors' crowns began with [[Marcian]]. Although the years saw the styles of crown change, the pendilia remained, at least through [[Manuel II Palaiologos]]. Surviving crowns with pendilia include the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] and many votive crowns of the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] from [[Visigothic]] Spain.

[[File:Perseo y Andrómeda, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|370px|''Perseus and Andromeda'' ]] 
'''''Perseus and Andromeda''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Titian]], now in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London. It was painted in 1554–56 as part of a series of mythological paintings called "''poesie''" ("poetry") intended for King [[Philip II of Spain]].  The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in this case Book IV, lines 663–752,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355-56&lt;/ref&gt; and all featured female nudes.

The painting is in oils on canvas, and measures 175 x 189.5 cm.  It was probably one already described as "damaged" in 1605, and has suffered subsequent damages, as well as apparently being cut down along all the sides. Scientific imaging techniques show an unusually large number of changes as the composition evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the hero [[Perseus]] flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him.  Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.&lt;ref name="I355"&gt;Ingamells, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is well-travelled; painted in [[Venice]], it was delivered in modern [[Belgium]], then went to Spain, Italy, England, and France before returning to England.

==Subject and sources==
[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Andromeda liberata da Perseo.jpg|thumb|''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], c. 1510, one of the few earlier easel paintings of the topic [[Uffizi]]]]
In Greek mythology, the kingdom of [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] was ruled by the beautiful but vain queen, [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiope]]; she maintained that her beauty, and that of her daughter Andromeda, was superior to that of the [[Nereids|sea nymphs]], who were the daughters of [[Poseidon]], the god of the sea. When the nymphs became aware of her claims, they protested to their father, who retaliated by calling up a [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] or sea monster to ravage the coastline of Ethiopia placing Cassiope's kingdom at risk. On the advice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Ammon, the Queen, together with her husband [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]], decided to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to the monster.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus, flying back from his killing of the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], kills the monster and rescues Andromeda, whom he then marries.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;

Titian follows Ovid fairly closely, although it is likely that his Latin was poor, and he mainly relied on somewhat simplified versions in Italian, of which there was a choice. This may explain some of the differences to the Latin original, although Titian may well just have interpreted the story freely.  In Ovid Andromeda's parents are nearby; here they are probably on the shore opposite, by a city. Andromeda stands amid seashells and [[coral]]. Coral is mentioned by Ovid, but as being formed from Medusa's locks at a later stage in the story.  Ovid describes Andromeda as looking like a statue, and having been crying; Titian's depiction matches both.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus had been given his curved sword by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and his shield by [[Minerva]].  Like Mercury, he wears winged boots, and also a winged helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Various visual sources have been suggested, both from the rather crude [[woodcut]] illustrations of various editions of Ovid, and specific classical [[relief]]s, as well as a well-known drawing by [[Michelangelo]] of the ''Risen Christ'' (British Museum).  The book illustrations "all show Perseus wearing a winged helmet like Mercury, for which there is no textual justification, and carrying a small baroque parade shield, features which Titian may later have remembered."&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355; [[:File:BM Wilde 54.jpg|The Michelangelo drawing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Poesie''==
[[File:After van Dyck Titian.jpg|thumb|Copy in the [[British Museum]] of the drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook, now [[Chatsworth House]], perhaps after a drawing by Titian.]]
The first two of the ''poesie'' series were ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' and ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'', delivered in 1553 and late 1554 respectively.  Both of these were repetitions with variations of compositions Titian had already painted in the previous decade for the [[Farnese family]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Venus and Adonis'' composition has an uncertain earlier history, for which see the article, or Penny, 280–284.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter from Titian to Philip accompanying the ''Venus and Adonis'', he noted that the pair offered contrasting poses, and promised "another different view" in both ''Perseus and Andromeda'' and a ''Jason and Medea'' he intended to produce.  These were to be the first original compositions in the series for Philip, but there is no trace of the ''Jason and Medea'', which was presumably abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356, 359 note 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'' is designed as a companion to ''Perseus and Andromeda''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of Perseus and Andromeda developed through several stages, which can be traced through x-rays and [[infra-red reflectography]], and a surviving drawing.  Some of the earlier elements can still be seen to the naked eye on close examination of the painting.  At first Andromeda was on the right, in a fairly similar pose, but leaning from left to right as in the final picture.  The arm to the left was raised above her head in a similar fashion, but the other arm more or less horizontal, and the head presumably looking to the centre.  There is a drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook (now [[Chatsworth House]]) recording such a figure, probably copying a lost drawing by Titian,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349, reproduced 352, 357&lt;/ref&gt; a rarity by this stage in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 204&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Veronese-persée-rennes.jpg|thumb|The painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] now in [[Rennes]], 1576–78, which is similar to the Titian when reversed]]
 
When Andromeda was moved to the left of the painting her pose was different from the final painting, more similar to the original one when she was on the right. There were several different positions, some taken no further than [[underdrawing]], for Perseus' limbs, sword and shield.  The monster originally rose higher out of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 352, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dissident view, Rearick sees the Wallace collection canvas as a second version, the original being the one delivered to Philip in 1556, and now lost, with Andromeda on the right. He sees a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] in [[Rennes]] as a paraphrase of this version.&lt;ref&gt;Rearick, 44–50, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, probably by 1558, Titian painted for Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] a ''[[St Margaret and the Dragon (Titian)|St Margaret and the Dragon]]'' (now Prado) which, with the removal of Perseus, more clothes, and a cross carried by [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], shows much the same situation, with a cliff, the sea, and a city across a bay.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 534-535&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Philip received the painting at [[Ghent]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in September 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356–357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1574 Titian had still not been paid, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and [[favourite]] [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]].  It appears to have left the Spanish royal collection before Philip's death in 1598 (the only ''poesie'' to do so), but was replaced by a careful copy, now in [[Gerona, Spain]].  It may have been given to Pérez, as other important paintings were.  This would have been before his drastic fall from favour in 1579.&lt;ref name="I357" &gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it may have been given to the family of the court sculptors [[Leone Leoni]] and his son Pompeo, also given paintings by Philip.  The Leoni family may have bought it when the collections of Pérez were dispersed.  There are records of paintings of the subject in the collections of Pérez in 1585–86 (described as "grande" or large), of Leon Bautista Leoni on his death in 1605 ("a damaged Andromeda by Titian") and of his father Pompeo Leoni on his death in 1608 (described as large, and by Titian).  All of these may refer to this painting, but this is not certain.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

The painting was certainly in the collection of [[Anthony van Dyck]], who may have acquired it from the Leoni family, who were based in [[Milan]], during his years in Italy from 1621 to 1627.  It was listed among his paintings on his death in London in 1641, and bought in 1646 by one of van Dyck's best customers, [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland]], together with Titian's ''[[Portrait of the Vendramin Family]]'' (now [[National Gallery]]).  Northumberland paid £200 for the pair, and a further £80 in 1656. However, it does not seem to have been owned by Northumberland for long, and was in France by 1654, and possibly by 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 220; Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1654 it was in the Paris house of the politician [[Louis Phélypeaux, seigneur de La Vrillière]], where it remained until 1717, sold with the house in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

It then joined the famous [[Orleans Collection]] of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Regent of France,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 461–468 for a general account of the collection&lt;/ref&gt; to be re-united with four others of Titian's ''poesie'', and two other versions by Titian of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]''.  By this time only Philip's versions of that and ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' remained in the Spanish royal collection, and are now in the [[Prado]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357; in 2013 it emerged that the Prado's ''Danaë'' was not in fact the one sent to Philip, though of very high quality.  See [[Danaë_(Titian_series)#Philip_II.27s_version.2C_and_the_Prado.27s|their article]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most of the rest of the Orleans Italian paintings, it moved to London where the collection was dispersed after the [[French Revolution]] in a complicated series of transactions,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 464–467&lt;/ref&gt; in some of which it was wrongly described as formerly in the collection of [[Charles I of England]].  In 1798 it was valued at 700 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] but failed to sell, selling for 310 gn. in 1800, and £362 in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358; see Penny, 341 for the seller in 1815, the son of Sir [[Gregory Page-Turner]], who was possibly the buyer in 1805.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was much less than the £2,500 gn the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]], one of the syndicate handling the sales, paid for each of [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] and  ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', other ''poesie''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 254&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bertelli Perseus.jpg|thumb|[[Engraving]] by [[Ferrando Bertelli]]]]
The 1815 sale was the last time the painting came to the market. It was bought by the Earl of Yarmouth, from 1822 [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford]], father of the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|4th Marquess]], the main collector forming the Wallace Collection. The 3rd Marquess contributed relatively few pictures to the Wallace Collection, and those were mostly portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 9, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was initially not regarded as one of the stars of the collection.  Between 1842 and about 1854 it was stored in the [[Pantechnicon van|Pantechnicon repository]] in London, before moving to [[Wallace_Collection#Building|Hertford House]], now home of the Wallace Collection, where it has remained. An 1870 inventory records it in the "Lumber Room" there, described as by [[Domenichino]], and Ingamells notes disapprovingly that "between 1876 and 1897 [it] hung unglazed over a bath in [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace's]] dressing room", before being correctly identified and rescued from the steam.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies and prints==
The painting was not copied by Titian or his workshop, as the first two ''poesie'' were, but later copies exist. When Philip II gave the painting away, a copy was made for the Spanish royal collection, which in 1882 was sent to the museum in [[Gerona, Spain]]. The [[Hermitage Museum]] has a copy that probably once belonged to Prince [[Eugene of Savoy]].  The [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]], France has a 17th-century copy once in the [[Palace of Versailles]], where it was recorded in 1683.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

An [[engraving]] by the Venetian [[Ferrando Bertelli]] probably dates to the 1550s and is a close rendering, though extending the composition on all sides except the left, possibly reflecting the original size of the painting, which has been cut down to an unknown extent. [[Giovanni Battista Fontana (painter)|Giovanni Battista Fontana]] (1524–1587) produced two prints, one dated 1564 and not very similar, the other closer to the Titian and undated.  Neither are exactly reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357–358&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations to Ovid from the late 16th century on often adopt aspects, or the general layout of the painting, without being copies.  The many paintings of the subject in later centuries tended to follow Titian's reduction of the subject to the two main figures and the monster, although not copying his composition. The subject became especially popular in the 19th century.

[[Image:Quartering_demo.svg|thumb|200px|Example of the simplest case of quartering two coats of arms]]
[[Image:Stowe_Armorial.jpg|thumb|200px|The 719 quarterings of [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|George, Marquess of Buckingham]]]]
'''Quartering''' in  is a method of joining several different [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] together in one [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] by dividing the shield into equal parts and placing different coats of arms in each division.
[[File:SalisarmsTWO.jpg|thumb|Simple quartering, crudely drawn. De Salis quartered with Fane.]]
[[File:Flag of Maryland.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[flag of Maryland]] has a quartering of the coats of arms of the Calvert and Crossland families]] Typically, a quartering consists of a division into four equal parts, two above and two below (''party per cross''). An example is the Sovereign Arms of the [[United Kingdom]], as used outside [[Scotland]], which consists of four quarterings, displaying the Arms of [[England]], Scotland and [[Ireland]], with the coat for England repeated at the end. (In the royal arms as used in Scotland, the Scottish quartering appears in the first and fourth quarters and the English one second.)
[[File:Coat of arms of the European Union.svg|thumb|right|200px|The coats of arms of the 28 [[Member States of the European Union|Member States]] of the modern [[European Union]] hypothetically arranged as quarterings in a traditional union shield.]]
However, in most traditions there is no limit on the number of divisions allowed, and the records of the [[College of Arms]] include a shield of 323 quarterings for the family of [[Lloyd of Stockton]]. These 323 quarterings include numerous repeated [[attributed arms]] assigned to Welsh chieftains from the 9th century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Neubecker 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of a shield of many quarterings is the coat of arms of the Powys-Lybbe family, which contains 64 quarterings. Different rules apply in [[Scottish heraldry]], and may well apply in other jurisdictions like [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]].

The arms of the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]] are arms of dominion, which join together the arms of the ex-kingdoms now part of her kingdom.  However, the vast majority of quarterly coats of arms display arms which are claimed by descent:  in other words, they join together coats of arms of the ancestors of the bearer of the arms.

Strict rules apply, both as to what arms may be displayed by way of quarterings, and the order in which they may be displayed.  Men and women are always entitled to display the arms of their paternal line but are not usually entitled to display by way of quartering the arms of families from whom there is descent only through a female line (for example, the arms of a mother or grandmother or great-grandmother).  An exception is made, however, if the female who breaks the male line of descent is a [[heraldic heiress]]—a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have died without issue.  Such a woman is entitled to transmit her father's arms to her own children, who add them as a quartering.  If her father was himself entitled to one or more quarterings, these will pass to his daughters' children as quarterings as well.  Quarterings are displayed in the order in which they are acquired by a family by marriage, starting with those acquired by the earliest marriage to bring in quarterings.  It is permissible to omit quarterings, but if a quartering was brought in by a later quartering, it is essential to show the whole chain of quarterings leading to the quartering displayed, or else to omit the chain altogether.

The larger the number of quarterings, the smaller the space available for each coat of arms, so that most families entitled to many quarterings make a selection of those they ordinarily use.  The [[Duke of Norfolk]], for example, uses only four quarterings, although he is entitled to many more. In Scotland in some cases the plain unquartered coat is the more prized, as entitlement to its use can indicate who is chief of the name and arms and holds the headship of a clan. For example, [[Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun|Flora Fraser, Lady Saltoun of Abernethy]] has arms as chief of [[Frasers of Philorth|Fraser]]—the plain coat of 'azure, three fraises argent'—and a 'private' quartered coat. The Powys-Lybbe family appear, likewise, to usually use only the quarterings of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]] and Lybbe.  However these are not true quarterings as the arms were changed in 1907 to be an impartible design of the two arms; the personal arms are precisely this design, with no quarterings despite its appearance. (If this were a quartering the following would apply: when only two different coats of arms are shown, each one is repeated twice in order to fill up the minimum number of four quarterings on such a display.)  Prior to the 1907 change, the family did quarter their arms with Lybbe but with the Powys arms in the top left quarter as these were the family arms; the new design has Lybbe in the top left as Lybbe is the last part of the name.

==Namesake==
Robert Grant or R.G. Smith contributed immeasurably to the preservation of the heritage and history of U.S. naval aviation through his 50-plus year career as an aeronautical engineer and as an accomplished artist.  The R.G. Smith Award for “excellence in naval aviation art” is bestowed by the [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] in his honor.

R.G. Smith graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Polytechnic College of Engineering in Oakland in 1934.  He was hired in 1936 as an engineer by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] Aircraft, then a subsidiary of [[Douglas Aircraft]], where he helped design naval aircraft such as the [[SBD Dauntless]], [[AD Skyraider]], [[F4D Skyray]], [[A-3 Skywarrior]], and the [[A-4 Skyhawk]].  

Later, he became the Douglas Company's full-time artist, spent time as a combat artist in [[Vietnam]], and was one of the five original founders of the American Society of Aviation Artists.  More than a million of his lithographs of commercial and military aircraft have been printed.

R.G. Smith died at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California]] on May 29, 2001 at the age of 87.

A selection of over 120 of his paintings and drawings, as well as a complete biography can be found in "R.G. Smith - The Man and his Art: An Autobiography".  Hardcover: 112 pages, Schiffer Publishing (February 1999), {{ISBN|0-7643-0755-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7643-0755-3}}.

R.G. Smith was designated Honorary [[Naval aviator|Naval Aviator]] Number 11 on May 8, 1973 by VADM William D. Houser, Deputey [[Chief of Naval Operations]] for Air Warfare.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/avh-1910/APP18.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rachel Khedoori''' (born 1964 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]) is a [[contemporary artist]] of [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] heritage based in Los Angeles and known primarily for her mixed use of sculpture, film and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/khedoori.htm|title=Toba Khedoori|website=www.lacan.com|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/vow/ULANFullDisplay?find=Khedoori&amp;role=&amp;nation=&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=500125340|title=ULAN Full Record Display (Getty Research)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Khedoori was born in Sydney and raised in Australia. She is the [[identical twin]] sister of the artist [[Toba Khedoori]],&lt;ref name="NYT Art in Review"&gt;Roberta Smith (March 05, 1999) [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/05/arts/art-in-review-rachel-khedoori.html "Art in Review; Rachel Khedoori"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the widow of artist [[Jason Rhoades]].&lt;ref name="Rhoades LA Times Obit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haithman|first1=Diane|title=OBITUARIES: Jason Rhoades, 41; Artist Combined Humor, Poignancy: [HOME EDITION]|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=August 3, 2006|page=B.13|ref=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/03/local/me-rhoades3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Russian Symphony Orchestra Society''' (also known simply as the '''Russian Symphony Orchestra''') was founded in {{start date|1903}} in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: Plans Outlined for the Coming Worcester Festival&amp;mdash;Russian Symphony Society Incorporated&amp;mdash;Notes Concerning Coming Events of Importance", ''New York Times'', 9 September 1903, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slatkin&gt;Leonard Slatkin, ''Conducting Business: Unveiling the Mystery Behind the Maestro'' (2012), Amadeus Press, p. 32. {{ISBN|1574672045}}. Accessed [https://books.google.com/books?id=K7os-1XoxAYC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false on Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Modest Altschuler]], and functioned for fifteen years.&lt;ref name=Slatkin/&gt;

[[Oscar Levant]] described the orchestra as having constituted "a school for [[concertmaster]]s"; among its members were [[Frederic Fradkin]] (concertmaster of the [[Boston Symphony]]), [[Maximilian Pilzer]] (concertmaster of the [[New York Philharmonic]]), [[Ilya Skolnik]] (concertmaster of the [[Detroit Symphony]]), and [[Louis Edlin]] (concertmaster of the [[National Orchestral Association]]).&lt;ref name=Levant&gt;Oscar Levant, ''A Smattering of Ignorance'' (1940), Doubleday, pp. 27&amp;ndash;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Film music conductors [[Nikolai Sokoloff]], [[Nathaniel Shilkret]]&lt;ref name=shilkret1&gt;Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed.

They performed the New York premieres of numerous pieces by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Alexander Scriabin]], including Stravinsky's first symphony (the [[Symphony in E-flat (Stravinsky)|Symphony in E-flat]]) and ''[[The Firebird]]''.&lt;ref name=Levant /&gt;

==History==

===The early years===
The orchestra's debut public performance was at [[Cooper Union]] Hall on January 7, 1904, and, according to [[Leonard Slatkin]], featured works by [[Mikhail Glinka]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], and the American premiere of Rachmaninoff's ''[[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]]''.&lt;ref name=Slatkin /&gt; However, the ''New York Times'' of January 3, 1904 lists the program as consisting of the Overture from Glinka's ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'', a baritone aria from [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]]'s ''[[Prince Igor]]'', an ''intermezzo'' from [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], a Russian dance by [[Eduard Nápravník]] and the symphonic suite ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]];&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Concerts&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 3 January 1904, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' of January 24 that same year mentions their second concert as including Wieniawski's ''Souvenir de Moscou''&lt;ref&gt;"Of Music and Musicians: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 24 January 1904, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewing a later concert in the series mentions a performance of "'The Cliff' by Rachmaninoff," presumably the same piece as ''The Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Stageland Jottings: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 29 January 1904, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1904&amp;ndash;1905 season, the orchestra, now expanded to 85 musicians,&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra, ''New York Times'', 20 November 1904, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; performed six concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]], featuring a works by a broad range of Russian composers,&lt;ref name="1905-11-05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Echoes from the World of Music: &amp;hellip;Russian Symphony Orchestra&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 16 October 1904, p. SMA6.&lt;/ref&gt; including a violin concerto by [[Julius Conus]].&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 30 October 1904, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' summarized the season as "resplendent with novelties,"&lt;ref name="1905-04-02"&gt;"The Russian Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 2 April 1905, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and praised their "enthusiasm"&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 25 December 1904, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "absorbing interest" of their selected material,&lt;ref name="1905-04-02" /&gt; but was critical of the technical quality of their performances, particularly in comparison with their initial series of concerts at Cooper Union.&lt;ref name="1905-04-02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 22 January 1905, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; That season, they were the first to use a [[celesta]] in concert performance in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 4 January 1905, p. X4.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many Russian pieces given their American premieres that season was Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'';&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 15 January 1905, p. SMA4.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth concert of the season consisted entirely of works that had never before been presented in New York: [[Vasily Kalinnikov]]'s first symphony, [[Anton Arensky]]'s suite "Silhouettes", and excerpts from [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[Khovanshchina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 19 February 1905, p. X3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year, their six Saturday night concerts at Carnegie Hall were supplemented by three "popular price" concerts there on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name="1905-10-05"&gt;"A Season of Great Musical Activity&amp;hellip; Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 5 October 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra formed a relationship with [[Vasily Safonov]].&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Concerts", ''New York Times'', 29 July 1905, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Rachmininoff was engaged as a guest conductor and piano soloist for concerts of his music performed on April 7&amp;ndash;8, 1906, and Safonov's former pupil, pianist [[Joseph Lhévinne]], was brought over to make his American debut;&lt;ref name="1905-10-05" /&gt; both were in their early thirties at the time, as was composer [[Vasily Zolotarev]], whose ''Rhapsodie Hébraïque'' was also performed that season at Safonov's suggestion. ''Rhapsodie hébraïque'', presented on the last two days of 1905, was based on [[Secular Jewish music|secular Jewish melodies]] that the ''Times'' characterized as "the musical equivalent of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes: Concerts, Recitals and Church Choir News", ''New York Times'' , 17 December 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt; Pianist [[Raoul Pugno]] also participated in the season as a soloist, playing Rachmaninoff's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|second piano concerto]].&lt;ref name="1905-10-05"&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 12 November 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes: New York's Musical Public Increasing Rapidly", ''New York Times'', 29 October 1905, p. X1&amp;ndash;X2.&lt;/ref&gt; Now expanded to 90 musicians, the orchestra was becoming an increasingly professional affair with, as the ''Times'' put it, "soloists of the first rank."&lt;ref name="1905-11-05"&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra, ''New York Times'', 5 November 1905, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of those soloists was [[Giuseppe Campanari]], a [[baritone]] associated with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. The chaos of the  [[Revolution of 1905]] prevented sending scores from Russia for the orchestra to accompany Campanari on arias from Tchaikovsky's ''[[Iolanta]]'' and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' (''Pique Dame''), and the performances were almost canceled. The only known copy of even the texts of the arias that could readily be found in New York was a German translation. The situation was finally rescued by "a little music store on [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]]" which had held the relevant scores in stock, unsold for about a decade after they had been purchased from a Russian tenor in need of cash.&lt;ref&gt;"East Side Junk Yields Music For Campanari", ''New York Times'', 25 December 1905, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pianist [[Josef Lhévinne]] likewise had an extremely difficult time escaping the turmoil of revolution in Moscow to come to New York to play with the Russian Symphony and others, facing danger from both the revolutionists and the government.&lt;ref&gt;"Lhevinne Risked Life In Flight From Moscow: Young Pianist Arrives with a Tale of Terrors in the City&amp;hellip;", ''New York Times'', 16 January 1906, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his troubles were compounded by an injury to a finger,&lt;ref&gt;"Lhevinne Hurt His Finger: Accident at the Piano Almost Prevented Him From Playing", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1906, p. X2.&lt;/ref&gt; his January 27, 1906 performance featured [[Anton Rubinstein]]'s Fifth Concerto, and drew a very favorably review from the ''Times''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Latest Russian Pianist: Josef Lhevinne Makes an Excellent Impression at His First Concert", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1906, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Music Society of America - 1906 ad.jpg|thumb|left]]
In late December 1905, Altschuler and others announced the formation of the New Music Society of America, soliciting "serious new work" from American composers, with the Russian Symphony functioning as the group's orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;"New Organization Will Have Aid of the Russian Symphony Society, ''New York Times'', 27 December 1905, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; A first Carnegie Hall concert originally scheduled for February 19 apparently never occurred, because the ''New York Times'' refers to a March 10 concert as the group's first; another concert took place April 2, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Music Makers", ''New York Times'', 7 January 1906, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-11"&gt;"Music by Americans: The First Concert of the New Music Society in Carnegie Hall", ''New York Times'', 11 March 1906, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent pieces at that first concert [[Edward MacDowell]]'s ''[[Indian Suite]]'' and ''Second Concerto'' (hardly "new": although only in his forties, MacDowell was already in his final illness at the time); the orchestra also performed [[Henry F. Gilbert]]'s ''Salammbô's Invocation to Tänith'' and [[Arthur Shepard]]'s ''Overture Joyeuse''.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-11"/&gt; The second concert featured violinist [[Maud Powell]] as a soloist; works included [[George Whitefield Chadwick]]'s ''Melpomene'' overture, the premiere of a violin concerto by [[Henry Holden Huss]], and premieres of pieces by [[David Stanley Smith (composer)|David Stanley Smith]] and [[Frederick Converse]].&lt;ref&gt;"Musical Notes", ''New York Times'', 25 March 1906, p. X4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"American Music Heard", ''New York Times'', 3 April 1906, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

That season, the March 17, 1906 concert featured the first American performance of the young [[Reinhold Glière]]'s ''Symphony No 1 in E-flat major, Op. 8'' (composed 1900) as well as American premieres of pieces by [[César Cui]] a Cossack dance by [[Alexander Serov]], who had died 35 years earlier in an era when Russian music had little currency in America, and 'a new concerto for violin, by Mlinarski," presumably the ''Concerto in D minor'' (composed c. 1897) by the [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Emil Młynarski]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 11 March 1906, p. X1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-18"&gt;"New Russian Works", ''New York Times'', 18 March 1906, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the unrest in Russia at that time prevented Rachmaninoff from visiting America, scuttling his planned April 7 performance.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-03-18" /&gt; Instead, violinist and composer [[Émile Sauret]] was featured, performing [[Antonín Dvořák]]'s ''[[Violin Concerto (Dvořák)|Violin Concerto in A Minor]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-04-01"&gt;"Russian Symphony Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 1 April 1906. p. X3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Emile Sauret Heard Again"", ''New York Times'', 8 April 1906. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The same concert included two pieces by composer [[Anton Arensky]], who had died on February 25.&lt;ref name="NYT-1906-04-01" /&gt;

===An established orchestra===
By the end of the 1906 season, the Russian Symphony Orchestra was an established part of the New York music scene. In all, the ''New York Times'' counted six New York premieres by the Russian Symphony Orchestra as such in 1906, and three more by the New Music Society.&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Music Makers", ''New York Times'', 22 April 1906. p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, the Society announced that Altschuler would be retained as Director for three more years, with Russian Ambassador Baron [[Roman Rosen]] continuing as honorary president.&lt;ref&gt;"Modest Altschuler Re-elected", ''New York Times'', 26 May 1906. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Looking forward to the 1906-1907 musical season, the ''Times'' counted them among the city's major orchestras, along with the [[New York Philharmonic]], [[New York Symphony Orchestra]], [[Peoples' Symphony Concerts]], and [[Sam Franko]]'s [[American Symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Aldrich, "In the World of Music: Prospects of the Season", ''New York Times'', 28 October 1906. p. X6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1906-7 season saw an appearance by pianist and composer [[Alexander Scriabin]] under the baton of his (and Altschuler's) conservatory teacher [[Vasily Safonov]]. An anonymous ''New York Times'' review praised Scriabin's playing, while finding him immature as a composer. The same reviewer panned [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ''Third Symphony'', which had its American premiere on this occasion: "[W]hat Russian music the conductor's of the more cosmopolitan orchestras have left for the Russians to put down on their programmes as given 'for the first time' may have been rejected rather than overlooked."&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Symphony: A Programme of New Works -- Alexander Scriabine Plays His Own Concerto", ''New York Times'', 21 December 1906, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently undaunted by that criticism, the orchestra announced two days later that its concert of January 17 would feature American premieres of Rachmaninoff's ''[[Spring (Rachmaninoff)|Spring]]'' cantata and [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Karelia Suite|Karelia]]'' overture,&lt;ref&gt;"Musical notes", ''New York Times'', 23 December 1906, p.X5.&lt;/ref&gt; though apparently Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Antar (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Antar]]'' was substituted for the Rachmininoff.&lt;ref name="times-1907-01-18"&gt;"New Russian Music", ''New York Times'', 18 January 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' doubled down in its criticism: "[M]any of the things by the Russian composers that we do not know seem upon presentation hardly worth knowing. … ''Antar'' … is no symphony by any recognized definition of the term… This would be nothing against the music if it could win acceptance for itself as music, which it did not last evening."&lt;ref name="times-1907-01-18"/&gt; While continuing its skepticism toward recent Russian music, the ''Times'' had high praise for soloist [[Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler]]'s February 7, 1907 performance of [[Anton Rubenstein]]'s already well-known  [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rubinstein)|D Minor Concerto (No. 4)]], though suggesting that the orchestra "show[ed] a lack of rehearsal with the pianist."&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Zeisler Wins Audience", ''New York Times'', 8 February 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth of six concerts that season on February 28, featuring a return by pianist Josef Lhévinne, consisted entirely of Russian pieces performed for the first time in America, although they were not recent works. The orchestral introduction of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'' and Rubinstein's ''Caprice Russe'' were both by composers who had died before the turn of the century. [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]]'s ''[[Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 2|Iveria Suite]]'' (1896) and [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 1 (Scriabin)|First Symphony]]'' (completed 1900), while also not particularly recent, were at least by then-living composers, and Scriabin was present for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;"A Russian Concert: Music for Orchestra and Piano Heard for the First Time", ''New York Times'', 1 March 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

That summer, Altschuler traveled to Europe to engage soloists for the 1907-1908 season,&lt;ref&gt;"Engages Russian Soloists: Modest Altschuler Tells His Plans For Next Season's Concerts", ''New York Times'', 19 July 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; which began with a special concert November 10 at their largest venue to date: accompanying violinist [[Jan Kubelik]] at the [[New York Hippodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vast Audience at Kubelik Recital", ''New York Times'', 11 November 1907, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; (A similar performance was given the following year, March 15, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;"Kubelik at the Hippodrome", 16 March 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;) Four days later they began their regular season at Carnegie Hall with Russian ambassador [[Roman Rosen|Baron Rosen]] in attendance, and with a program consisting largely of American premieres of Russian pieces: [[Alexander Glazunov]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Glazunov)|Symphony No. 8]]'', composed roughly two years earlier; arrangements of Russian folk songs by Glazunov, [[Anatoly Lyadov]], and Rimsky-Korsakov; and Mussorgsky's "[[Pictures at an Exhibition#No. 10 "The Great Gate of Kiev"|Great Gate of Kiev]]". The program also featured the American debut of young Russian violinist [[Lea Luboshutz]] (listed at the time as ''Laya Luboshiz''),&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Orchestra: A Concert of New Compositions in Carnegie Hall", ''New York Times'', 1 November 1907, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; who received eight curtain calls for her solo on Tchaikovsky's ''[[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Of Musical Interest", ''Brooklyn Life'', 23 November 1907, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not the only notable female soloist to play with the orchestra that season: on February 13, 1908, cellist [[May Muklé]] performed [[Karl Davydov]]'s ''Cello Concerto No. 2 in A minor''.&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony Concert", ''New York Times'', 14 February 1908, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broader recognition and touring===
1908 also brought unprecedented recognition from Russia itself. The tsar granted the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]] to orchestra president [[Frank Seymour Hastings]] in recognition of his promotion of Russian music in America.&lt;ref name=czar&gt;"Czar to Honor Musician", ''New York Times'', 5 June 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1908-1909, the orchestra reduced its Carnegie Hall season from six performances to four,&lt;ref name="1908 plans"&gt;"Russian Symphony's Plans", ''New York Times'', 17 September 1908, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; and began taking on other performance opportunities. At Carnegie Hall, they continued to present notable soloists: the debut of [[Mischa Elman]] (19 years old at the time&lt;ref&gt;"Mischa Elman Appears", ''New York Times'', 11 December 1908, p.8. ''The Times'' described him as "an artist already of remarkable powers of whom much that is interesting is to be expected."&lt;/ref&gt;), a return by Josef Lhévinne, and also an appearance by [[Alexander Petschnikoff]].&lt;ref name="1908 plans" /&gt; After a November 16, 1908 tryout in [[New Haven, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="New Haven"&gt;"Russian Music With Acting", ''New York Times'', 17 November 1908, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; on February 11, 1909, they collaborated with the [[Ben Greet]] Players on a Carnegie Hall performance of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' incorporating [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Mendelssohn]]'s incidental music,&lt;ref&gt;"Orchestra Aids Greet Players", ''New York Times'', 12 Feb 1909, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; a performance that was repeated at [[Lake George, New York|Lake George]] on August 30&lt;ref&gt;"Lake George: Sylvan Players Begin Dramatic Festival in Natural Amphitheatre", ''New York Times'', 29 August 1909, p.X3.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Carnegie Hall on New Year's Day 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Calendar of Concerts", ''New York Times'', 26 Dec 1909, p.SM13.&lt;/ref&gt; These performances constituted the first time Mendelssohn's music was performed in conjunction with the play in the United States.&lt;ref name="1908 plans" /&gt; The two groups collaborated further, including a 1910 production of Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Orchestra and Greet Players", ''New York Times'', 11 February 1910, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of performances in the 1910-1911 season which repeated these pieces and added ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', and ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref&gt;"Greet Players with Russian Orchestra", ''New York Times'', 27 November 1910, p. 9. The ''Times'' article doesn't elaborate on ''Sakuntala'': presumably one of numerous plays about [[Shakuntala]], a figure in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides a broader variety of New York performances, the orchestra toured extensively.&lt;ref name=Levant /&gt; Although they had already toured in December 1907, when the ''New York Times'' mentions them traveling to "Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Madison, Wis. and other cities," bringing along pianists [[Ernest Hutcheson]] and [[Ernest Schelling]],&lt;ref&gt;"Music Notes'', ''New York Times'', 8 December 1907, p. X2.&lt;/ref&gt; their 1908 touring plans extended as far as the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].&lt;ref name=czar/&gt; Their tours could involve large numbers of performances. For example, a newspaper from [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] shows the orchestra performing four separate concerts (at 2 p.m., 4 p.m., 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.) on a single Wednesday in September 1911. The programs were each entirely different, and the music ranged from [[Beethoven]] through [[Richard Wagner]], [[Verdi]] and [[Puccini]] to Sibelius and Scriabin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1126&amp;dat=19110906&amp;id=p59hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IGYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4773,4128233 Symphony Programs Cause Enthusiasm], ''The Gazette Times'' (Pittsburgh), 6 September 1911, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1910s===
[[File:MaudeAllanSalomeHead.jpg|thumb|right|Maud Allan as Salomé; in the New York performance, "the head itself was left to the imagination, but none of the caressing was."&lt;ref name="NYT-Salomé" /&gt;]]
The orchestra began the 1910s with a premiere of a different sort. After a January 1 Carnegie Hall reprise of their ''Midsummer Night'' collaboration with Ben Greet, on January 20 their second performance of the new decade introduced dancer [[Maud Allan]] to the New York audience. Although American-born, Allan had begun her dancing career in England and Europe, and this was her first American appearance. Like [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Loie Fuller]], Allan choreographed for herself, using existing classical pieces. On this occasion she danced a piece on [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] themes, using music from Anton Rubenstein, Mendelssohn, [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], and [[Edvard Grieg|Grieg]]. The performance alternated Allan's dances with straight orchestral performances.&lt;ref&gt;"Maud Allan in Greek Dances", ''New York Times'', 21 January 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; A concert a week later featured Rachmaninoff as a guest conductor for the American premiere of his ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and as a soloist on his ''[[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Rachmaninoff as Conductor", ''New York Times'', 28 January 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; Further performances with Allan followed, with the dancer performing her signature ''Visions of Salomé'', among other pieces.&lt;ref name="NYT-Salomé"&gt;"Maud Allan as Salome", ''New York Times'', 30 January 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Allan to Repeat Salome Dance", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display ad, ''New York Times'', 9 February 1910, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Musical World", ''New York Times'', 27 February 1910, p. SM15.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4, the orchestra played a benefit for Russian immigrants at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]], featuring several musical soloists as well as ballet dancers [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Mikhail Mordkin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Music Notes", ''New York Times'', 1 April 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pavlowa Dances for Charity", ''New York Times'', 5 April 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1910-1911 season featured five Carnegie Hall concerts interspersed with numerous out-of-town shows and followed by a 20-week national tour.&lt;ref&gt;"Plans for Russian Symphony Orchestra Season", ''New York Times'', 12 September 1910, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Musical notes", ''New York Times'', 18 September 1910, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Their New York season began November 17 with a concert that included a very different interpretation of Rachmaninoff's ''Symphony No. 2'', which they had premiered in 1901 and which had meanwhile become a "celebrated" and much-played work. After discussions with the composer, Altschuler had sped up the tempi and his reading of the piece had "radically changed". The concert also featured two American premieres of pieces by [[Anatoly Lyadov]]—''Kikimora'' and ''Volshebnoye ozero (The Enchanted Lake)'', both written in 1909—Tchaikovsky's ''1812 Overture'', and several songs sung by German baritone [[Alexander Heinemann]].&lt;ref&gt;"News of the Music World", ''New York Times'', 13 November 1910, p.X7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Rachmininoff Again", ''New York Times'', 18 November 1910, p.9. This is the source for the word "celebrated".&lt;/ref&gt; The December 1 concert featured the U.S. debut of Canadian-born violinist [[Kathleen Parlow]]; the ''New York Times'' reviewer described her performance of Tchaikovsky's ''[[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]]'' as a "remarkable achievement" and praised her "unexpected authority",&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-11-27"&gt;"The Russian Symphony", ''New York Times'', 27 November 1910, p.X7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-12-02"&gt;"Russian Symphony Concert", ''New York Times'', 2 December 1910, p.9. This article, the one that refers to her "remarkable achievement", erroneously refers to ''Katherine'' Parlow.&lt;/ref&gt; and would have equally high praise for her "consummate technical accuracy&amp;hellip;beauty of tone&amp;hellip;spirit&amp;hellip;[and]fire" when she returned to play [[Henryk Wieniawski]]'s ''[[Violin Concerto No. 2 (Wieniawski)|Violin Concerto No. 2]]'' the following February 2.&lt;ref name="NYT 1911-02-03"&gt;"Miss Parlow Applauded", ''The New York Times'', 3 February 1911, p. 9. With reference to the Kajanus, the cited source simply says ''Finnish Rhapsody''. Kajanus wrote two ''Finnish Rhapsodies'', No. 1 in D minor, Op. 5 (1881) and No. 2 in F major (1886); there is no indication of which was performed on this occasion. Also, the ''Times'' refers again to the Rachmaninoff piece as ''The Cliff'' rather than ''The Rock''.&lt;/ref&gt; The concert was also the American premier of Stravinsky's ''[[Feu d'artifice]]'' (''Fireworks'').&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-11-27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT 1910-12-02"/&gt; who had grown up largely in San Francisco and had become a professional musician in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.1-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Childhood and Education|publisher = Collections Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting four days later, they provided accompaniment for two-week run of [[Maurice Maeterlinck|Maeterlinck]]'s tragedy ''[[Mary Magdalene (Maeterlinck play)|Mary Magdalene]]'' at [[Century Theatre (New York City)|The New Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"'Mary Magdalene' for New Theatre", ''New York Times'', 25 November 1910, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Display ad, ''New York Times'', 5 December 1910, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the world premiere of that play, and the first U.S. performance of any Maeterlinck play.&lt;ref&gt;"Busy Nights for Playgoers", ''New York Times'', 4 December 1910, p.X1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 19, 1911 concert featured German-Polish pianist and composer [[Xaver Scharwenka]] as the soloist on his own ''Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor'', as well as the American premiere of the Introduction and Wedding Procession from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; the concert also featured Rimsky-Korsakov's ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)#Related works|Christmas Eve Suite]]'' and the American premiere of a waltz that Tchaikovsky had written for ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' but omitted from the final version, and closed with Tchaikovsky's ''[[Marche Slave]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Music Here and There", ''The New York Times'', 1 Jan 1911, p. X7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Untitled item after Richard Aldrich, "The Question of Singing Operatio Texts in English Aroused by Mme. Nordica's Offering of a Scene from 'Die Walkuere'", ''The New York Times'', 8 Jan 1911, p. XX7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Russian Symphony", ''The New York Times'', 15 Jan 1911, p. X10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Orchestra", ''The New York Times'', 20 Jan 1911, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The February 2 concert featured the American premiere of [[Robert Kajanus]]' ''Finnish Rhapsody'', a return of Rachmaninoff's ''The Rock'' (which they had played in their second concert ever), and the return of violinist Kathleen Parlow performing the abovementioned Wieniawski concerto.&lt;ref name="NYT 1911-02-03"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">'''Separated at birth''', usually phrased as a question, is a light-hearted media device for pointing out people who are unrelated but bear a notable facial resemblance, implying that they are twins who were separated soon after being born and presumably adopted by separate families.

The title "Separated at Birth?" was a trademark of Spy Publishing Partners, the publishers of the now defunct [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'']] magazine, a monthly publication that published satire, humor, and investigative journalism from 1986 to 1998. The magazine would pair two carefully selected photos of two unrelated famous persons and the juxtaposition would highlight their physical similarities to humorous effect.

There were several ''Separated at Birth?'' books issued around the same time, with whimsical comparisons such as [[Mick Jagger]] vs. [[Don Knotts]] as the fictional film character ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}

In its original sense, a '''shaggy dog story''' or '''yarn''' is an extremely long-winded [[anecdote]] characterized by extensive narration of typically [[Non sequitur (literary device)|irrelevant incidents]] and terminated by an [[Anti-climax (narrative)|anticlimax]] or a pointless punchline.

Shaggy dog stories play upon the audience's preconceptions of joke-telling. The audience listens to the story with certain expectations, which are either simply not met or met in some entirely unexpected manner.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|title=Jokes|page=8|author=Ted Cohen|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-11230-6|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lengthy shaggy dog story derives its humour from the fact that the joke-teller held the attention of the listeners for a long time (such jokes can take five minutes or more to tell) for no reason at all, as the end resolution is essentially meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How to be funny : an extremely silly guidebook|year=1978|author=Jovial Bob Stine|publisher= Dutton |isbn=0-525-32410-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of their delivery is reflected in the [[English language|English]] [[idiom]] ''[[wiktionary:spin a yarn|spin a yarn]]'', by way of [[analogy]] with the production of [[yarn]].

==Archetypal story==

The commonly believed [[archetype]] of the shaggy dog story is a story that concerns a [[wikt:shaggy|shaggy]] dog.  The story builds up, repeatedly emphasizing how shaggy the dog is. At the climax of the story, someone in the story reacts with, "That dog's not so shaggy." The expectations of the audience that have been built up by the presentation of the story, that the story will end with a punchline, are thus disappointed. Ted Cohen gives the following example of this story:&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

{{quote|A boy owned a dog that was uncommonly shaggy. Many people remarked upon its considerable shagginess.  When the boy learned that there are contests for shaggy dogs, he entered his dog. The dog won first prize for shagginess in both the local and the regional competitions.  The boy entered the dog in ever-larger contests, until finally he entered it in the world championship for shaggy dogs. When the judges had inspected all of the competing dogs, they remarked about the boy's dog: "He's not that shaggy."}}

However, authorities disagree as to whether this particular story is the archetype after which the category is named.  [[Eric Partridge]], for example, provides a very different story, as do William and Mary Morris in ''The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''.

According to Partridge and the Morrises, the archetypical shaggy dog story involves an advertisement placed in the ''Times'' announcing a search for a shaggy dog. In the Partridge story, an aristocratic family living in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]] is searching for a lost dog, and an American answers the advertisement with a shaggy dog that he has found and personally brought across the Atlantic, only to be received by the butler at the end of the story who takes one look at the dog and shuts the door in his face, saying, "But not so shaggy as ''that'', sir!" In the Morris story, the advertiser is organizing a competition to find the shaggiest dog in the world, and after a lengthy exposition of the search for such a dog, a winner is presented to the aristocratic instigator of the competition, who says, "I don't think he's so shaggy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secret of Humor|author=Leonard Feinberg|year=1978|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-6203-370-9|pages=181&amp;ndash;182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaggy Dog Story|work=World Wide Words|author=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-sha1.htm|date=19 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
===Mark Twain and the story of grandfather's old ram===
A typical shaggy dog story occurs in [[Mark Twain]]'s book about his travels west, ''[[Roughing It]]''. Twain's friends encourage him to go find a man called Jim Blaine when he is properly drunk, and ask him to tell "the stirring story about his grandfather's old ram."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/marktwain/learnmore/writings_story.html |title=The Story of Grandfather's Old Ram |publisher=pbs.org |accessdate=26 September 2013 |author=Twain, Mark |author-link=Samuel Clemons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twain, encouraged by his friends who have already heard the story, finally finds Blaine, an old silver miner, who sets out to tell Twain and his friends the tale. Blaine starts out with the ram ("There never was a bullier old ram than what he was"), and goes on for four more mostly dull but occasionally hilarious unparagraphed pages.

Along the way, Blaine tells many stories, each of which connects back to the one before by some tenuous thread, and none of which has to do with the old ram. Among these stories are: a tale of boiled missionaries; of a lady who borrows a false eye, a peg leg, and the wig of a coffin-salesman's wife; and a final tale of a man who gets caught in machinery at a carpet factory and whose "widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in&amp;nbsp;..." As Blaine tells the story of the carpet man's funeral, he begins to fall asleep, and Twain, looking around, sees his friends "suffocating with suppressed laughter." They now inform him that "at a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep [Blaine] from setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather's old ram — and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had heard him get, concerning it."

===Isaac Asimov and the story of the Shah Guido G. ===
In the collection of stories by [[Isaac Asimov]] titled ''[[Buy Jupiter and Other Stories]]'', is a story titled "[[Shah Guido G.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Asimov, Isaac |author-link=Isaac Asimov |title=Buy Jupiter and other stories'', |publisher=Fawcett Crest |location=New York, NY |year=1975 |pages=33–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his background notes, Asimov identifies the tale as a shaggy dog story, and explains that the title is a play on "shaggy dog".

==Examples in music==
* [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s classic anti-war story-song "[[Alice's Restaurant Massacree]]" is a shaggy dog story about the military draft, hippies, and improper disposal of garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Berman |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/booth-reviews/2010/11/song-of-the-day-alices-restaurant-massacree-by-arlo-guthrie/ |title=Song Of The Day – "Alice’s Restaurant Massacree" by Arlo Guthrie &amp;#124; Booth Reviews |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Bromberg]]'s version of "Bullfrog Blues" (on "[[How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?]]") is a rambling shaggy dog story performed as a [[talking blues]] song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Foss |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-latell-ya-play-til-vol-1-live-mw0000200090 |title=How Late'll Ya Play 'Til?, Vol. 1: Live - David Bromberg &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=stevenhartwriter |url=https://stevenhartsite.wordpress.com/2008/02/25/blue-monday-26/ |title=Blue Monday &amp;#124; STEVENHARTSITE |publisher=Stevenhartsite.wordpress.com |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]," the final track on his 1999 album ''[[Running with Scissors ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Running with Scissors]]'', is an over-eleven-minute digression from one of the first topics mentioned in the song, the narrator-protagonist's longstanding dislike of [[sauerkraut]].

'''Taylor Opera House''' was an [[opera]] house in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. It was the city's first theater, and was founded by [[John Taylor (Taylor Ham)|John Taylor]], creator of Pork Roll and one of Trenton's leading citizens.   The building first opened March 18, 1867 at 18 S. Broad Street.  A historical marker was placed on the site after its demolition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=3991 Historical Marker Database: Taylor Opera House]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater presented the major speakers and performers of the day, including [[Mark Twain]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], and [[George M. Cohan]], and played host to political conventions, Bible conferences, musical revues and local meetings and events.  It hosted the inaugurations of Governor [[George B. McClellan]] in 1877, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trentonhistory.org/Documents/Manuscript1900.htm Trenton Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Fairman Fielder|James F.

Accessed December 29, 2007. "At midnight to-morrow New Jersey will have a new Governor, James F. Fielder of Jersey City, but he will not take the oath of office until Tuesday at noon....

Accessed December 29, 2007. "Everything is ready for the inauguration here Tuesday of Walter E. Edge of Atlantic City, Republican, as Governor of New Jersey. The induction ceremonies will be held in the Taylor Opera House."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, it was converted into a movie and vaudeville palace known as '''Keith's Capitol Theatre'''; after later sales it was renamed the '''RKO International'''.

The theater was razed by its next door neighbor (the [[Trenton Saving Fund Society]]) to create a parking lot in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Modica, Glenn R.

'''''The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius''''' is an [[altarpiece]] by Italian artist [[Carlo Crivelli]] showing an artistic adaptation of the [[Annunciation]]. The altarpiece was painted for the [[Santissima Annunziata, Ascoli Piceno|Church of SS. Annunziata]] in the Italian town of [[Ascoli Piceno]], in the region of [[Marche]], to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by [[Pope Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-the-annunciation-with-saint-emidius|title=The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius|publisher=[[The National Gallery]]| accessdate =26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was removed to the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan in 1811, but passed to [[Auguste-Louis de Sivry]] in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century.  It has been housed in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]] since it was donated by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton]] in 1864.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;

[[File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|thumb|The Theatre is labelled in the top right of this London street map. [[:File:London map showing Shakespearean theatres.png|Enlarge]]]]
'''The Theatre''' was an [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan playhouse]] in [[Shoreditch]] (in Curtain Road, part of the modern [[London Borough of Hackney]]), just outside the [[City of London]]. It was the second permanent theatre ever built in [[England]], after the [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]], and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager [[James Burbage]], near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which employed [[Shakespeare]] as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the [[Globe Theatre]] on [[Bankside]].

==History==
The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.&lt;ref name=Ordish&gt;{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page=30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at [[Newington Butts]] near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.&lt;ref name=Ordish /&gt; The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one [[John Brayne]], (the owner of the Red Lion)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowsher|first1=Julian|last2=Miller|first2=Pat|title=The Rose and the Globe—Playhouses of Shakespeare's Bankside, Southwark|year=2010|publisher=Museum of London|isbn=978-1-901992-85-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on property that had originally been the grounds of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] [[Halliwell Priory]] (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575).&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burbage, James|volume=7|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the [[theatre]]. This area in the "suburbs of sin" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the [[Curtain Theatre]] was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district.&lt;ref&gt;Mullaney, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; "When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Herbert|title=Brayne and his other brother-in-law|url=http://galegroup.com|work=Shakespeare Studies|publisher=Literature Resource Center|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"&gt;Berry, Herbert. English Professional Theatre, 1530–1660. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.&lt;ref&gt;Mateer, David. "New Light on the Early History of the Theatre in Shoreditch [With Texts]." ''English Literary Renaissance'' 36.3 (2006): 335–375. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Burbage's son later claimed the Theatre as the first permanent playhouse in the London conurbation, it may not have been the first permanent theatre to serve Londoners.  The [[Newington Butts]] playhouse may have been built as early as 1575,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= English professional theatre, 1530–1660 | first1=Glynne William | last1=Gladstone Wickham| first2=Herbert | last2=Berry | first3=William | last3=Ingram | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-23012-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y82YJ1P5gksC&amp;pg=PA320 | page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; certainly actor Jerome Savage renewed a lease on the site on 25 March 1576, three weeks before Burbage's lease in Shoreditch.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London | first=William | last=Ingram | publisher = Cornell University Press | year=1992 | isbn=978-0-8014-2671-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0PqSqgTWVEC&amp;pg=PA164 | page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newington Butts was clearly established by Lady Day 1577,&lt;ref name=Ingram170&gt;Ingram (1992) p170&lt;/ref&gt; and Wickham ''et al.'' interpret the available documents as saying that Savage was adapting an existing building constructed by Richard Hicks rather than building from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Wickham ''et al'' (2000) p321&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of The Theatre was possibly adapted from the inn-yards that had served as playing spaces for actors and/or [[bear baiting]] pits. The building was a [[polygon]]al wooden building with three [[auditorium|galleries]] surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a [[thrust stage]]. The Theatre is said to have cost £700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a [[history of the English penny|penny]]. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron.  Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre’s appearance, but it has been described as an "amphitheater".&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

The Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for [[Leicester's Men]], the acting company of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the [[Admiral's Men]], of which James Burbage's son, [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] which was under the management of [[Philip Henslowe]].

In 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his  early plays had their première at The Theatre.  "At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces."&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt; Richard's most noted role is—which holds close to his namesake — his part as Richard in Shakespeare's [[Richard III]]. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt;

Towards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]]. The lease had been granted to [[Richard Burbage]] and his brother [[Cuthbert Burbage]] upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen "stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert."&lt;ref name="Stephen 1973"/&gt; The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:
&lt;poem&gt;...But see yonder,
One like the unfrequented Theatre
Walks in dark silence and vast solitude.&lt;ref&gt;''Skialetheia,'' [[Edward Guilpin]], 1598&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Brayne's widow, [[Margaret Brayne]], and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it—in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. "The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe." &lt;ref&gt;Capp, Bernard. "The Burbages At Law (Again)." Notes &amp; Queries 47.4 (2000): 433. Academic Search Complete. Web. 11 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Margaret Brayne's death there were still lawsuits that had not been settled, and in her last will and testament she left all of her prospective winnings to Robert Myles.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

Though Giles Allen was the landlord John Hyde legally owned the lease to the Theatre and would return the lease to Richard and Cuthbert Burbage and Margaret Brayne for the sum of £30.  Cuthbert then went to Walter Cope, a trusted business man, and had Cope ask Hyde if Cuthbert could outright pay for the lease and own it himself.  Cuthbert paid and outright owned the lease now, ultimately squeezing Margaret Brayne out of the business.  They justified this by stating that now that the lease was in Cuthbert’s name and no longer in James’ name John Brayne had no dealings with the Theatre and therefore neither did Margaret Brayne.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

This state of affairs forced the Burbage brothers to take drastic action to save their investment. In defiance of the landlord and with the help of their friend and financial backer William Smith, chief carpenter [[Peter Street (carpenter)|Peter Street]] and ten or twelve workmen, they dismantled the theatre on the night of 28 December 1598 and moved the structure piecemeal to Street's yard near to [[Bridewell]]. With the onset of more favourable weather in the following spring, the material was ferried over the [[River Thames|Thames]] to reconstruct it as [[Globe Theatre|The Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shapiro |first=James |authorlink=James S. Shapiro|coauthors= |title=1599—a year in the life of William Shakespeare |year=2005 |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-21480-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum 1987: 206–209&lt;/ref&gt;  Giles Allen then sued Peter Street in January 1599 for trespassing on the property of the Theatre, stating that Street had no right to dismantle the Theatre and move the supplies.  He also attempted to sue Cuthbert and Richard Burbage for trespassing.&lt;ref name="Berry, Herbert 1660"/&gt;

===Archaeological investigation===

== Building history ==
[[File:San Francisco Womens Building.jpg|left|thumb|The Women's Building in 1998/1999.]]

The San Francisco Women's Center began in 1973. By 1974, it hired its first full-time employee and had moved into a small storefront office. In 1976, its difficulty in locating a venue for the national conference on Violence Against Women it was organizing with other women's groups led it to search for a permanent space. Through 1978 and 1979, it raised funds to put down an initial $10,000 deposit, and then a $115,000 first payment towards the $535,000 purchase price of the building at 3543 18th Street.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt696nb1jq/entire_text/|title = Guide to the San Francisco Women's Building/Women's Centers Records, 1966, 1972-2001|date = 2002|accessdate = March 7, 2015|website = |publisher = Online Archive of California|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tracy Gary, one of the organizers of the Violence Against Women conference, and co-founder of the Women's Building, along with co-founder Marya Grambs and Women's Building staff member Carmen Vázquez, were interviewed in 1982 by Julia Randall for KPFA for the building's 3rd birthday.

In the first year of operation, the Women's Building was targeted by two attacks: an arson fire that caused $50,000 worth of damage,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and a pipe bomb set off on the front steps of the building.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1997, the Women's Building underwent a major renovation prompted by mandatory seismic retrofitting. In the course of that effort, it evicted the Dovre Club, a bar that had been in the corner of the building on 18th and Lapidge Streets since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/a-tale-of-two-bars/Content?oid=2133807&amp;showFullText=true|title = A Tale of Two Bars|last = Davis|first = Lisa|date = January 8, 1997|work = SF Weekly|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original owner of that bar had an oral agreement with the Women's Center that the bar could stay in place during his lifetime; after his death in 1997, the bar made an effort to stay in place but ultimately relocated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Mural ==
[[File:Women's Building - mural on side 2.JPG|thumb|Part of the mural on the side of the building, in 2015]]

Painted by seven [[women artists]] including, [[Juana Alicia]], [[Miranda Bergman]], [[Edythe Boone]], [[Susan Cervantes|Susan Kelk Cervantes]] (cofounder of [[Precita Eyes|Precita Eyes Muralists Association]]), Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez along with their helpers and volunteers in 1994, the mural titled ''MaestraPeace'' covers both the outside of The Women's Building as well as the interior entrance hall and stairway.&lt;ref name="Historical Sites"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Sites and Points of Interest in San Francisco|url=http://www.noehill.com/sf/landmarks/sf178.asp|publisher=NoeHill in San Francisco|accessdate=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It features images of feminine icons from history and fiction, and the names of more than 600 women written in calligraphy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://missionlocal.org/2012/09/painters-scale-womens-building-to-restore-the-maestrapeace-mural/|title = Painters Scale Women’s Building to Restore the “MaestraPeace” Mural|last = Hoke|first = Mateo|date = September 13, 2012|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the San Francisco Women's Center, "This spectacular mural is a culmination of a multi-cultural, multi-generation collaboration of seven women artists, and a colorful work of art that sings to our community." &lt;ref name="Women's Building"/&gt;

Many of the original artists returned to the building for an update in 2000, an expansion to the inside of the building in 2010, and a major $130,000 restoration in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.fogcityjournal.com/wordpress/4914/womens-strife-upheld-in-mural-restoration/|title = Women’s Strife Upheld in Mural Restoration|last = Hernandez|first = Peter|date = August 1, 2012|work = |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That last restoration included a treatment process designed to preserve the colors of the mural for another 100 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Tracking Down Maggie''''' is a 1994 [[documentary film]] by [[Nick Broomfield]] about former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. What begins as a genuine attempt to get an interview with the so-called 'Iron Lady' quickly turns into a game of cat-and-mouse in the [[United States]], with the [[filmmaker]] snubbed at every turn.

Aside from the comedy of Broomfield's repeatedly failing attempts to gain access, the film discusses the accusations that Thatcher's son, [[Mark Thatcher|Mark]], used his mother's connections to effect arms deals in [[Saudi Arabia]].

'''Verisimilitude''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɛr|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|ɪ|tj|uː|d}} is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a [[fiction|work of fiction]]. The word comes from {{lang-la|verum}} meaning truth and ''similis'' meaning similar.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Language philosopher [[Stephen Neale|Steve Neale]] distinguishes between two types: '''cultural verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and '''generic verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own [[list of fictional genres|genre]] (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the [[fictional universe]] of a [[musical theatre|musical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stuart |title=Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices |location=London |publisher=Sage in association with the Open University |year=1997 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAqycFD4PBsC |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original roots==

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of [[mimesis]], the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], it must have grounding in reality.

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the [[Middle Ages]] particularly in Italian [[heroic poetry]]. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, [[decorum]]: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Teskey |chapter=Renaissance Theory and Criticism |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |edition=Second |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness [[Suspension of disbelief|to suspend his/her disbelief]], a phrase used originally by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Ashley |title=What Makes a Good Novel |journal=The English Journal |volume=60 |issue=5 |year=1971 |pages=596–598 |jstor=813069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.

==Continued evolution==

The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist [[Pierre Nicolas Desmolets]]' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own [[internal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Sparshott |title=Truth in Fiction |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1967 |pages=3–7 |jstor=429239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ewlyn F. |last=Sterling |title=The Theory of Verisimilitude in the French Novel prior to 1830 |journal=The French Review |volume=40 |issue=5 |year=1967 |pages=613–619 |jstor=384665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern perspective==

During the rise of the [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.

The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mas'Ud |last=Zavarzadeh |title=The Semiotics of the Foreseen: Modes of Narrative in (Contemporary) Fiction |journal=Poetics Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=432–433 |jstor=1771956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{VG Industry}}
The '''video game industry''' is the [[economic sector]] involved in the [[Video game development|development]], marketing, and [[Video game monetization|monetization of video games]]. It encompasses dozens of [[job]] disciplines and its component parts employ thousands of people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Zackariasson, P. and Wilson, T.L. eds. (2012). ''The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future''. New York: Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The computer and video game industry has grown from focused markets to mainstream. They took in about [[United States dollar|US$]]9.5 billion in the US in 2007, 11.7 billion in 2008, and 25.1 billion in 2010 ([[Entertainment Software Association|ESA]] annual report).

Modern [[personal computer]]s owe many advancements and innovations to the game industry: [[sound card]]s, [[graphics card]]s and [[3D graphic accelerator]]s, faster [[CPU]]s, and dedicated co-processors like [[PhysX]] are a few of the more notable improvements.

[[Sound card]]s were developed for addition of digital-quality sound to games and only later improved for music and [[audiophile]]s.&lt;ref name="sndhist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alldidigames.com/video-games-industry-infographics/ | publisher=Didi Games | work=Research on Video Games | author=Bob Johnstone | title=Didi Games | accessdate=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, graphics cards were developed for more colors.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; Later, graphic cards were developed for [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs) and games; GUIs drove the need for high resolution, and games began using 3D acceleration.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; They also are one of the only pieces of hardware to allow multiple hookups (such as with [[Scan Line Interleave|SLI]] or [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]] graphics cards).&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt; CD- and DVD-ROMs were developed for mass distribution of media in general; however the ability to store more information on cheap easily distributable media was instrumental in driving their ever-higher speeds.&lt;ref name="sndhist"/&gt;

== Game industry value chain ==
Ben Sawyer of Digitalmill observes that the game industry [[value chain]] is made up of six connected and distinctive layers:
# Capital and publishing layer: involved in paying for development of new titles and seeking returns through licensing of the titles.
# Product and talent layer: includes [[Video game developer|developers]], [[video game designer|designers]] and [[game artist|artists]], who may be working under individual contracts or as part of in-house development teams.
# Production and tools layer: generates content [[game tool|production tools]], game development [[Game Middleware|middleware]], [[Game engine|customizable game engines]], and production management tools.
# Distribution layer: or the "[[video game publisher|publishing]]" industry, involved in generating and marketing catalogs of games for retail and online distribution.
# Hardware (or Virtual Machine or Software Platform) layer: or the providers of the underlying platform, which may be console-based, accessed through online media, or accessed through mobile devices such as [[smartphones]]. This layer now includes network infrastructure and non-hardware platforms such as virtual machines (e.g. Java or Flash), or software platforms such as browsers or even further Facebook, etc.
# End-users layer: or the users/players of the games.&lt;ref name="newmedia"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplines ==
The game industry employs those experienced in other traditional businesses, but some have experience tailored to the game industry. Some of the disciplines specific to the game industry include: [[game programmer]], [[game designer]], [[level designer]], [[game producer]], [[game artist]] and [[game tester]]. Most of these professionals are employed by [[video game developer]]s or [[video game publisher]]s. However, many [[hobby]]ists also produce computer games and sell them commercially.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Game developers and publishers sometimes employ those with extensive or long-term experience within the [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://uncommonculture.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2965/2526#36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–1960s ===

{{main|Early history of video games|Early mainframe games}}
Prior to the 1970s, there was no significant commercial aspect of the video game industry, but many advances in computing would set the stage for the birth of the industry.

Many early publicly-available interactive computer-based game machines used or other mechanisms to mimic a display; while technically not "video games", they had elements of interactivity between the player and the machine. Some examples of these included the 1940 "Nimatron", an electromagentic relay-based [[Nim]]-playing device designed by [[Edward Condon]] and built by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]],&lt;ref name="Priest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|title=The Priesthood At Play: Computer Games in the 1950s |work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-01-22|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172058/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/01/22/the-priesthood-at-play-computer-games-in-the-1950s/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bertie the Brain]]'', an arcade game of [[tic-tac-toe]], built by [[Josef Kates]] for the 1950 [[Canadian National Exhibition]],&lt;ref name="CNE"&gt;{{cite news|first=Marlene|last=Simmons|title=Bertie the Brain programmer heads science council |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rKYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pe0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=916,3790974&amp;dq=josef-kates&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=1975-10-09|page=17|accessdate=2015-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nimrod (computing)|Nimrod]] created by engineering firm [[Ferranti]] for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Replay: The History of Video Games]]|last=Donovan|first=Tristan|publisher=Yellow Ant|date=2010-04-20|isbn=978-0-9565072-0-4|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of [[cathode ray tube]]&amp;mdash;the core technology behind televisions&amp;mdash;created several of the first true video games. In 1947 Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann filed a patent for a "cathode ray tube amusement device". Their game, which uses a cathode ray tube hooked to an oscilloscope display, challenges players to fire a gun at target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofplay.org/about/icheg/video-game-history/timeline |title=Video Game History Timeline &amp;#124; The Strong |publisher=Museumofplay.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1950s and 1960s, with mainframe computers becoming available to campus colleges, students and others started to develop games that could be played at terminals that accessed the mainframe. One of the first known examples is ''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed by Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], and Wayne Wiitanen.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|title=One, Two, Three, Four I Declare a Space War|work=They Create Worlds|last=Smith|first=Alexander|date=2014-08-07|accessdate=2015-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172136/https://videogamehistorian.wordpress.com/2014/08/07/one-two-three-four-i-declare-a-space-war/|archivedate=2015-12-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of easy-to-program languages like [[BASIC]] for mainframes allowed for more simplistic games to be developed.

=== 1970s ===

However, both the arcade and home markets would be dominated by ''Pong'' clones, which flooded the market and led to the [[video game crash of 1977]].

The early part of the decade saw the rise of [[8-bit]] home computing, and [[Homebrew (video games)|home-made games]], especially in Europe (with the [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]) and Asia (with the [[NEC PC-8801|NEC PC-88]] and [[MSX]]). This time also saw the rise of [[video game journalism]], which was later expanded to include [[covermount]]ed cassettes and CDs.
In 1983, the [[North American video game crash of 1983|North American industry crashed]] due to the production of too many badly developed games (quantity over quality), resulting in the fall of the North American industry. The industry would eventually be revitalized by the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which resulted in the home console market being dominated by Japanese companies such as [[Nintendo]],&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt; while a professional European computer game industry also began taking shape with companies such as [[Ocean Software]] and [[Gremlin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ystop100.html|title=World of Spectrum - Archive - YS Top 100|work=worldofspectrum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the decade saw the rise of the [[Game Boy]] handheld system. In 1987, Nintendo lost a legal challenge against [[Blockbuster Entertainment]], which enabled games rentals in the same way as movies.

=== 1990s ===
[[File:PlayStation-SCPH-1000-with-Controller.png|thumb|right|The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] was the most popular gaming console of the fifth generation, which saw the common adoption of CD media.]]
{{see also|History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|History of video game consoles (sixth generation)}}

The 1990s saw advancements in game related technology. Among the significant advancements were:
* The widespread adoption of [[compact disc|CD]]-based storage and software distribution
* Widespread adoption of [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-based [[operating system]]s, such as the series of [[Amiga OS]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]]
* Advancement in 3D graphics technology, as [[Graphics processing unit|3D graphic cards]] became widely adopted, with [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] now the ''[[de facto]]'' standard for video game visual presentation
* Continuing advancement of [[CPU]] speed and sophistication
* Miniaturisation of hardware, and mobile phones, which enabled [[mobile gaming]]
* The emergence of the internet, which in the latter part of the decade enabled online co-operative play and [[competitive gaming]]

Aside from technology, in the early part of the decade, [[brand licensing|licensed]] games became more popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/896/896893p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Madden - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=August 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hurby |first=Patrick |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=100805/madden |title=ESPN - OTL: The Franchise - E-ticket |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did video game sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Rus |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/954/954426p2.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Street Fighter - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000s, the video game industry is a juggernaut of development; profit still drives technological advancement which is then used by other industry sectors. Technologies such as [[Smartphones]], [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] are major drivers for game hardware and gameplay development. Though maturing, the video game industry was still very volatile, with third-party video game developers quickly cropping up, and just as quickly, going out of business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Nevertheless, many [[casual game]]s and [[indie game]]s were developed and become popular and successful, such as ''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]'' and ''[[Limbo (video game)|Limbo]]''. Game development for mobile phones (such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices) and social networking sites emerged. For example, a [[Facebook]] game developer, [[Zynga]], has raised in excess of $300 million.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/15/zynga-takes-180-million-venture-round-cue-russian-mafia-jokes/ |title=Zynga Takes $180 Million Venture Round From DST, Others (Cue Russian Mafia Jokes) |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not the main driving force, [[independent video games|indie games]] continue to have a significant impact on the industry, with sales of some of these titles such as ''[[Spelunky]]'', ''[[Fez]]'', ''[[Don't Starve]]'', ''[[Castle Crashers]]'', and ''[[Minecraft]]'', exceeding millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] and over a million users.&lt;ref name="entrepreneurial-insights.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneurial-insights.com/gaming-industry-introduction/|title=The Gaming Industry – An Introduction|work=Entrepreneurial Insights}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable?|date=February 2017}} The 2010s have seen a larger shift to casual and [[mobile gaming]]; in 2016, the mobile gaming market is estimated to have taken $38 billion in revenues, compared to $6 billion for the console market and $33 billion for personal computing gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-24-welcome-to-the-new-era-games-as-media | title = Welcome to the New Era: Games as Media | first = Joost | last = van Dreunen | date = October 24, 2016 | accessdate = October 31, 2016 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Games centered on [[virtual reality]] and [[augmented reality]] equipment also arose during this decade.

== Economics ==
Early on, development costs were minimal, and video games could be quite profitable. Games developed by a single programmer, or by a small team of programmers and artists, could sell hundreds of thousands of copies each. Many of these games only took a few months to create, so developers could release multiple titles per year. Thus, publishers could often be generous with benefits, such as [[royalties]] on the games sold. Many early game publishers started from this economic climate, such as [[Origin Systems]], [[Sierra Entertainment]], [[Capcom]], [[Activision]] and [[Electronic Arts]].

As computing and graphics power increased, so too did the size of development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfishgames.com/blog/video-gaming-industry-numbers-by-region/|title=Top Gaming Studios, Schools &amp; Salaries|work=Big Fish Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite the growing popularity of [[Game Middleware|middleware]] and pre-built [[game engine]]s.  In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Superannuation|title=How Much Does It Cost To Make A Big Video Game?|url=http://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649|website=Kotaku|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game development team has to select a profitable and suitable method [[Video game monetization|to sell or earn money from]] the finished game. Traditionally, the game monetization method is to sell hard copies in retail store. Now some developers are turning to alternative production and distribution methods, such as [[digital distribution|online distribution]], to reduce costs and increase revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kain|first1=Erik|title=Why Digital Distribution Is The Future And GameStop Is Not: Taking The Long View On Used Games|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/05/30/why-digital-distribution-is-the-future-and-gamestop-is-not-taking-the-long-view-on-used-games/|website=Forbes|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the video game industry has a major impact on the economy through the sales of major systems and games such as ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', which took in over $650 [[United States dollar|USD]] million of sales in the game's first five days and which set a five-day global record for a movie, book or videogame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision "Call of Duty: Black Ops" sets record for Activision"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125022802/http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/278-call-of-duty-black-ops-sets-record-for-activision |date=January 25, 2011 }}.

The industry wide adoption of high-definition graphics during the seventh generation of consoles greatly increased development teams' sizes and reduced the number of [[Triple A (gaming)|high-budget, high-quality titles]] under development. In 2013 [[Richard Hilleman]] of Electronic Arts estimated that only 25 developers were working on such titles for the eighth console generation, compared to 125 at the same point in the seventh generation-console cycle seven or eight years earlier.&lt;ref name="vgchartz20130706"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vgchartz.com/article/251108/ea-aaa-development-in-decline/ | title=EA: AAA Development in Decline | work=VGChartz | date=July 6, 2013 | accessdate=July 8, 2013 | author=D'Angelo, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail ===

The games industry's shift from brick and mortar retail to digital downloads led to a severe sales decline at video game retailers such as [[GameStop]], following other media retailers superseded by Internet delivery, such as [[Blockbuster (company)|Blockbuster]], [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]], and [[Virgin Megastores]]. GameStop diversified its services by purchasing chains that repair wireless devices and expanding its trade-in program through which customers trade used games for credit towards new games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wingfield |first1=Nick |title=As Downloads Take Over, a Turning Point for the Video Game Industry |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2015-12-20 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/technology/as-downloads-take-over-a-turning-point-for-the-video-game-industry.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to produce its own merchandise and games. In Britain, the games retailer [[Game (retailer)|Game]] revamped its stores so customers would spend time playing games there. It built a gaming arena for events and tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=GAME launches Belong - is this the future of video games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-12-16 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-12-15-game-launches-belong-is-this-the-future-of-video-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift to digital marketplaces, especially for smartphones, led to an influx of inexpensive and disposable titles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Suellentrop |first1=Chris |last2=Totilo |first2=Stephen |title=Video Game Retail Sales Decline Despite New Hits |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-10-03 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/arts/video-games/video-game-retail-sales-decline-despite-new-hits.html |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lower engagement among gamers who otherwise purchased new games from retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=What's going wrong at UK games retail? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-21 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-21-whats-going-wrong-at-games-retail |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- more in this source --&gt; Customers also shifted away from the tradition of buying games on their first day of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dring |first1=Christopher |title=Is the industry's obsession with Day One coming to an end? |work=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2016-11-08 |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-07-is-the-industrys-obsession-with-day-one-coming-to-an-end |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publishers often funded trade-in deals to encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed about a third of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was about a third of the size of its new games business.{{r|Eurogamer: trade-in myths}} They figured that sites such as [[eBay]], which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parfitt |first1=Ben |title=Pre-owned price comparison site Trade In Detectives goes live |work=[[MCV UK]] |date=2013-08-07 |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/pre-owned-price-comparison-site-trade-in-detectives-goes-live/0119776 |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer: trade-in myths"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Purchese |first1=Robert |title=Myth-busting the murky world of video game trade-ins |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2013-12-18 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-12-03-myth-busting-the-murky-world-of-video-game-trade-ins |accessdate=2017-06-30 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Video game industry practices are similar to those of other entertainment industries (e.g., the [[recording industry|music recording industry]]), but the video game industry in particular has been accused of treating its development talent poorly. This promotes independent development, as developers leave to form new companies and projects. In some notable cases, these new companies grow large and impersonal, having adopted the business practices of their forebears, and ultimately perpetuate the cycle.

However, unlike the music industry, where modern technology has allowed a fully professional product to be created extremely inexpensively by an independent musician, modern games require increasing amounts of manpower and equipment. This dynamic makes [[video game publisher|publishers]], who fund the [[video game developer|developers]], much more important than in the music industry.

=== Breakaways ===
In the video game industry, it is common for developers to leave their current studio and start their own. A particularly famous case is the "original" independent developer [[Activision]], founded by former [[Atari]] developers. Activision grew to become the world's second largest game publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|title=Activision Aims for Sweet Spot|last=Wolverton|first=Troy|date=May 24, 2005|publisher=TheStreet.com|accessdate=March 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ffLSaAf0?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10224904/activision-aims-for-sweet-spot.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mean time, many of the original developers left to work on other projects. For example, founder [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] left Activision to start another video game development company, [[Accolade (company)|Accolade]] (now [[Atari]] née [[Infogrames]]).

Activision was popular among developers for giving them credit in the packaging and title screens for their games, while Atari disallowed this practice. As the video game industry took off in the mid-1980s, many developers faced the more distressing problem of working with fly-by-night or unscrupulous publishers that would either fold unexpectedly or run off with the game profits.

=== Piracy ===
The industry claims [[software piracy]] to be a big problem, and take measures to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valjalo |first=David |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware |title=3DS Will Fight Piracy With Firmware &amp;#124; Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN2nGrc6?url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/3ds-will-fight-piracy-firmware/ |archivedate=February 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Digital rights management]] have proved to be the most unpopular with gamers, as a measure to counter piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7972677.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; EA 'dumps DRM' for next Sims game |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most popular and effective strategy to counter piracy is to change the business model to [[Freemium]], where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from [[Cheating in video games|hacked]] (faked) transactions.

=== Creative control ===
On various Internet forums, some gamers have expressed disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers are more apt to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky but potentially lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between [[Recording Artists' Coalition|recording artists]] and [[RIAA|record labels]] in many ways. But unlike the [[music industry]], which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20021010.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 9.2% in the first half of 2002 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20031001.html|title=Global sales of recorded music down 10.9% in the first half of 2003 from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_news/20051003.html|title=Digital sales triple to 6% of industry retail revenues as global music market falls 1.9% (2005) from IFPI|work=ifpi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the video game industry continues to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2132172920070621|title=Video game industry growth still strong: study|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.

In the [[computer game]]s industry, it is easier to create a startup, resulting in many successful companies. The [[video game console|console]] games industry is a more closed one, and a game developer must have up to three licenses from the [[console manufacturer]]:
# A license to develop games for the console
# The publisher must have a license to publish games for the console
# A separate license for each game

In addition, the developer must usually buy development systems from the console manufacturer in order to even develop a game for consideration, as well as obtain concept approval for the game from the console manufacturer. Therefore, the developer normally has to have a publishing deal in place before starting development on a game project, but in order to secure a publishing deal, the developer must have a track record of console development, something which few startups will have.

=== Alternatives ===
An alternative method for publishing video games is to self-publish using the [[shareware]] or [[Open-source software|open source]] model over the [[Internet]].

=== Gaming conventions ===
[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The major annual gaming conventions include [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany), the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA),&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|title=E3 is Obsolete, But it Doesn't Matter|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2012/06/08/e3-is-obsolete-but-it-doesnt-matter/|publisher=Forbes|date=June 8, 2012|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Penny Arcade Expo]], and [[:Category:Video game conventions|others]].

[[Gaming convention]]s are an important showcase of the industry. The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] (Germany) is a major expo for video games. The [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]] (USA) is also of global importance, but is an event for industry insiders only.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

Other notable conventions and trade fairs include [[Tokyo Game Show]] (Japan), [[Brasil Game Show]] (Brazil), [[EB Games Expo]] (Australia), [[Russian Game Developers Conference|KRI]] (Russia), [[China Digital Entertainment Expo &amp; Conference|ChinaJoy]] (China) and the annual [[Game Developers Conference]]. Some publishers, developers and technology producers also have their own regular conventions, with [[BlizzCon]], [[QuakeCon]], [[Nvision]] and the [[X (Xbox show)|X shows]] being prominent examples.

=== Africa ===

Video gaming is still in its infancy throughout the African continent, but due to the continent's young population and increasing technological literacy, the sector is growing rapidly. African countries such as [[video gaming in South Africa|South Africa]], [[video gaming in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[video gaming in Kenya|Kenya]] have been making rapid advances in [[mobile gaming|mobile game development]], both within their country and internationally,&lt;ref name="Africa top 10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnewsafrica.com/2013/10/top-10-african-game-developers/|title=Top 10 African game developers|publisher=''[[IT News Africa]]''|last=Fripp|first=Charlie|date=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to limited funding and a market over-crowded with western games, success has thus far been minimal.&lt;ref name="Mail &amp; Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-02-things-africa-will-be-famous-for-in-the-next-10-15-years|title=Africa 2030, the next 25 years: From video games, eco-buildings, robotics, and cycling|publisher=''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] Africa''|last=Spooner|first=Samantha|date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, along with the ''[[Tom Clancy]]'' series have all been produced in Canada and have achieved worldwide success.

[[Germany]] has the largest video games market in Europe, with revenues of $4.1&amp;nbsp;billion forecast for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-100-countries-by-game-revenues/|title=Top 100 Countries By Game Revenues|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=newzoo.com|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual [[gamescom]] in [[Cologne]] is Europe's largest gaming expo.

One of the earliest internationally successful video game companies was [[Gütersloh]]-based [[Rainbow Arts]] (founded in 1984) who were responsible for publishing the popular ''[[Turrican]]'' series of games. The [[Anno (series)|Anno series]] and [[The Settlers|The Settlers series]] are globally popular strategy game franchises since the 1990s. The [[Gothic series]], [[SpellForce: The Order of Dawn|SpellForce]] and [[Risen (video game)|Risen]] are established RPG franchises. The [[X (game series)|X series]] by [[Egosoft]] is the best-selling space simulation. The [[FIFA Manager (video game series)|FIFA Manager series]] was also developed in Germany. The German action game [[Spec Ops: The Line]] (2012) was successful in the markets and received largely positive reviews. One of the most famed titles to come out of Germany is ''[[Far Cry]]'' (2004) by [[Frankfurt]]-based [[Crytek]], who also produced the topseller ''[[Crysis]]'' and its sequels later.

Other well-known current and former developers from Germany include [[Ascaron]], [[Blue Byte]], [[Deck13 Interactive|Deck13]], [[EA Phenomic|Phenomic]], [[Piranha Bytes]], [[Radon Labs|Radon]], [[Related Designs|Related]], [[Spellbound Entertainment|Spellbound]] and [[Yager Development]]. Publishers include [[Deep Silver]] ([[Koch Media]]), [[dtp entertainment]], [[Kalypso Media|Kalypso]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo Europe]]. [[Bigpoint Games]], [[Gameforge]], [[Goodgame Studios]] and [[Wooga]] are among the world's leading browser game and social network game developers/distributors.

=== Japan ===
{{main|Video gaming in Japan}}
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of [[Nintendo]] in [[Kyoto]], Japan, 2006.]]
The [[Japan]]ese video game industry is markedly different from the industry in North America, Europe and Australia.

&lt;!-- Generally, games have a greater [[market share]] of total entertainment in Japan than in the West.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} --&gt;
Japanese companies have created some of the largest and most lucrative titles ever made, such as the ''[[Mario]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Metal Gear]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of games.

&lt;!-- [[Video arcade|Video game arcades]] are still relatively popular in Japan; for every [[arcade game]] released in the US, nine are released in [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The history of the Japanese arcade is very significant in the story of the decline of the American arcade, and in the shape of [[game design]] in general. --&gt;
In recent years, [[video game console|consoles]] and arcade games have both been overtaken by downloadable [[free-to-play]] games on the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mobile game|mobile]] platforms.&lt;ref name=economist12&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan fights back|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21566696-two-japanese-firms-are-challenging-world-new-kind-video-game-japan-fights-back|publisher=The Economist|date=November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=capcom_marketdata&gt;{{cite web|title=Market Data|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/market.html|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The structure and culture of a Japanese game developer is different from a western one. Throughout the history of Japanese game design, many developers have seen fit to remain mostly anonymous, even using pseudonyms to a large degree in video game credits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Also, the division in labor for video game development is different. For example, Japanese game design teams had a dedicated [[game designer|designer]] (which they called a "director") much earlier than American design teams adopted the practice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}
Secondly, Japanese game designers throughout history generally had far more people working on a particular game than a comparable western design team. For example, ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1992), a Japanese title, had almost one artist working on every character in the game, plus two programmers and a musician, with the result being a team of twenty or more people.  ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' (1992), a comparable American title, was developed by four people: a [[game programmer|programmer]], an [[artist]], a [[musician]], and a background artist.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} --&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|UK]] industry is the third largest in the World in terms of developer success and sales of hardware and software by country alone but fourth behind Canada in terms of people employed.&lt;ref name="networkworld1"/&gt; The size of the UK game industry is comparable to its film or music industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-04-04-view-from-the-tower|title=The View From the Tower|publisher=gamesindustry.biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years some of the studios have become defunct or been purchased by larger companies such as ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' developer, [[Media Molecule]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/02/media-molecule-officially-joins-the-playstation-family/ |title=Media Molecule Officially Joins The PlayStation Family – PlayStation.Blog.Europe |publisher=Blog.eu.playstation.com |date=March 2, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Codemasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle |first=David |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/05/reliance-big-entertainment-acquires-50-stake-in-codemasters |title=Reliance Big Entertainment acquires 50% stake in Codemasters |publisher=Joystiq |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to some of the world's most successful video game franchises, such as ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', ''[[Fable (video game series)|Fable]]'', ''[[Colin McRae: Dirt|Colin McRae Dirt]]'' and ''[[Total War (series)|Total War]]''.

The country also went without tax relief until March 21, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Rik |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/44996/budget-2012-tax-relief-video-games |title=UK tax relief break |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate= March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the British government changed its mind on tax relief for UK developers, which without, meant most of the talented development within the UK may move overseas for more profit, along with parents of certain video game developers which would pay for having games developed in the UK. The industry trade body TIGA estimates that it will increase the games development sector's contribution to UK GDP by £283 million, generate £172 million in new and protected tax receipts to HM Treasury, and could cost just £96 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Post comment Name Email Address Comments |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |title=Game industry tax relief plans are shelved |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=June 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625151807/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-06/22/game-industry-tax-relief-plans-are-shelved |archivedate=June 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tax relief was introduced there was a fear that the UK games industry could fall behind other leading game industries around the world such as France and Canada, of which Canada overtook the UK in terms of job numbers in the industry in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Canada overtakes UK |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/34406/Canada-overtakes-UK-industry-workforce-tally |date=March 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
[[Magnavox]] is credited for releasing the first [[video game console]], the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. [[Activision]] was the first developer to create independent/third-party video games. Once the fastest-growing American company, [[Atari]] crashed in spectacular fashion, resulting in the [[North American video game crash of 1983]]. This resulted in the domination of the Japanese video game industry worldwide throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

====Companies====
The U.S. is home to major game development companies such as [[Activision Blizzard]] (''[[Call of Duty]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]''), [[Electronic Arts]] (''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]''), and [[Take-Two Interactive]] ([[Civilization (series)|Civilization]], [[NBA 2K (series)|''NBA 2K'' series]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]''). [[ZeniMax Media]] (''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'') is the world's largest privately held video game company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Zenimax+Claims+Carmack+Stole+Oculus+VR+Facebook+Barks+Back/article34869.htm|title=Zenimax Claims Carmack Stole Oculus VR, Facebook Barks Back|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niantic, Inc.|Niantic]] (''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'', ''[[Pokémon Go]]'') is a notable mobile game developer.

[[Valve Corporation]] operates [[Steam (software)|Steam]], the largest computer gaming platform, with an active user base (~125 million) that rivals the combined user bases of the current console generation (~150 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/|title=VGChartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not specifically focused on games, the largest mobile gaming platforms are operated by [[Google]] ([[Google Play]]), and [[Apple Inc.]] ([[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]), with the majority of mobile revenue coming from Asia.&lt;ref name=idcannie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-idc-portable-gaming-report-2013-q2/|author=App Annie, IDC|title=App Annie &amp; IDC Portable Gaming Report Q2 2013: iOS &amp; Google Play Game Revenue 4x Higher Than Gaming-Optimized Handhelds}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] operates [[Xbox]], the only major game console hardware franchise not controlled by a Japanese company. [[Sony]] established [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] in [[Silicon Valley]] to run [[PlayStation]], the world's largest and longest-running video game console franchise.&lt;ref name=wired-sie&gt;{{cite news|title=Sony Interactive Entertainment Merges PlayStation Biz Units|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/sony-interactive-entertainment/|accessdate=January 26, 2016|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intel]] and [[Nvidia]] are the largest makers of PC graphics chips. [[Advanced Micro Devices]] has become the most important console [[Microprocessor|processor]] vendor, with all three of the [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation home consoles]] using AMD [[graphics processing unit|GPU]]s, and two of them use AMD [[central processing unit|CPU]]s. Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony were not aware that they were all using AMD processors until all their consoles were announced,&lt;ref name=e12a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/amd-vp-saeid-moshkelani-interview/|work=[[Engadget]]|title=AMD's Saeid Moshkelani on building custom silicon for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Wii U |date=June 12, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Gorman}}&lt;/ref&gt; underscoring the secrecy found within the game industry. Notable game engine developers include [[Epic Games]] ([[Unreal Engine]]) and [[Unity Technologies]] ([[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]).

====Regions====
The [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is home to important video game conventions, such as [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), one of the largest video game industry-only events in the world, and [[Penny Arcade Expo]] (PAX West), the largest public video game convention in [[North America]]. The West Coast is also home to many of the major American video game industry companies, particularly the regions of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Seattle]]. Major game development regions outside of the West Coast include the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Texas]].

====People====
Over 150 million Americans play video games, with an average age of 35 and a gender breakdown of 59 percent male and 41 percent female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/industry-facts/|title=Industry Facts|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, and lean [[conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/article/new-study-finds-video-game-players-are-highly-engaged-politically/|title=New Study Finds Video Game Players Are Highly Engaged Politically|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important [[List of video game industry people|game development personalities]] were born in or moved to the United States. Notable developers include [[Ralph H. Baer]] ([[Magnavox Odyssey]], the "Father of Video Games"), [[Jonathan Blow]] (''[[Braid (video game)|Braid]]''), [[John D. Carmack]] (''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''), and [[Alexey Pajitnov]] (''[[Tetris]]''). [[Mario]] is named after [[Mario Segale]], a former landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]. Some [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] activists, including [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Anita Sarkeesian]], have met extreme resistance from the gaming public in response to the perceived politicizing of their art form.&lt;ref name=TC2&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/25/gamergate-an-issue-with-2-sides/ | title=#GamerGate – An Issue With Two Sides | author= Allum Bokhari | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate= September 27, 2014|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sports====
The United States recognizes [[eSports]] players as professional athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/07/14/the-u-s-now-recognizes-esports-players-as-professional-athletes/|title=The U.S. Now Recognizes eSports Players As Professional Athletes|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Gaming]] has eSports arenas and studios across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/23/major-league-gaming-announces-its-own-arena-in-columbus-ohio/|title=Major League Gaming announces its own arena in Columbus, Ohio|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Morris University]] has a [[League of Legends]] [[varsity team]], whose members are eligible for [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/219522/Illinois_university_makes_League_of_Legends_a_varsity_sport.php |title=Illinois university makes League of Legends a varsity sport|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trends ==
Players become fourth-party developers, allowing for more [[Open-source software|open source]] models of [[game design]], development and engineering. Players also create [[Mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods), which in some cases become just as popular as the original game for which they were created. An example of this is the game ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which began as a mod of the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and eventually became a very successful, published game in its own right.

While this "community of modifiers" may only add up to approximately 1% of a particular game's user base, the number of those involved will grow as more games offer modifying opportunities (such as, by releasing [[source code]]) and the video user base swells. According to Ben Sawyer, as many as 600,000 established online game community developers existed as of 2012. This effectively added a new component to the [[video game industry#Game industry value chain|game industry value chain]] and if it continues to mature, it will integrate itself into the overall industry.&lt;ref name="newmedia" /&gt;

The industry has seen a shift towards games with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] facilities. A larger percentage of games on all types of platforms include some type of competitive online multiplayer capability.

In addition, the industry is experiencing further significant change driven by convergence, with technology and player comfort being the two primary reasons for this wave of industry convergence. Video games and related content can now be accessed and played on a variety of media, including: cable television, dedicated consoles, handheld devices and smartphones, through social networking sites or through an ISP, through a game developer's website, and online through a game console and/or home or office personal computer. In fact, 12% of U.S. households already make regular use of game consoles for accessing video content provided by online services such as Hulu and Netflix. In 2012, for the first time, entertainment usage passed multiplayer game usage on Xbox, meaning that users spent more time with online video and music services and applications than playing multiplayer games. This rapid type of industry convergence has caused the distinction between video game console and personal computers to disappear. A game console with high-speed microprocessors attached to a television set is, for all intents and purposes, a computer and monitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|pages=220–221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this distinction has been diminished, players' willingness to play and access content on different platforms has increased. The growing video gamer demographic accounts for this trend, as former president of the Entertainment Software Association Douglas Lowenstein explained at the 10th E3 expo, "Looking ahead, a child born in 1995, E3's inaugural year, will be 19 years old in 2014. And according to Census Bureau data, by the year 2020, there will be 174 million Americans between the ages of 5 and 44. That's 174 million Americans who will have grown up with PlayStations, Xboxes, and GameCubes from their early childhood and teenage years...What this means is that the average gamer will be both older and, given their lifetime familiarity with playing interactive games, more sophisticated and discriminating about the games they play."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=221|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the increasing player willingness to play video games across a variety of media and different platforms can be seen in the rise of casual gaming on smartphones, tablets, and social networking sites as 92% of all smartphone and tablet owners play games at least once a week, 45% play daily, and industry estimates predict that, by 2016, one-third of all global mobile gaming revenue will come from tablets alone. Apple's App Store alone has more than 90,000 game apps, a growth of 1,400% since it went online. In addition, game revenues for iOS and Android mobile devices now exceed those of both Nintendo and Sony handheld gaming systems combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University|first=Stanley J. Baran, Bryant|title=Introduction to Mass Communication : Media Literacy and Culture|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-352621-8|page=222|edition=Eighth Edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William-Adolphe Bouguereau''' ({{IPA-fr|wijam.adɔlf buɡ(ə)ʁo}}; 30 November 1825 – 19 August 1905) was a French [[Academic art|academic painter]]. In his realistic genre paintings he used mythological themes, making modern interpretations of [[Classicism|classical]] subjects, with an emphasis on the female human body.&lt;ref name="wissman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissman |first=Fronia E. |title=Bouguereau |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=San Francisco |year=1996 |page=10 |isbn=978-0876545829}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his life he enjoyed significant popularity in France and the United States, was given numerous official honors, and received top prices for his work.&lt;ref name="glueck"&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |title=To Bouguereau, Art Was Strictly 'The Beautiful' |work=The New York Times |date=January 6, 1985 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/06/arts/art-view-to-bouguereau-art-was-strickly-the-beautiful.html |accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the quintessential salon painter of his generation, he was reviled by the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] avant-garde.&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt; By the early twentieth century, Bouguereau and his art fell out of favor with the public, due in part to changing tastes.&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt; In the 1980s, a revival of interest in [[figure painting]] led to a rediscovery of Bouguereau and his work.&lt;ref name="glueck"/&gt; Throughout the course of his life, Bouguereau executed 822 known finished paintings, although the whereabouts of many are [[Lost works|still unknown]].&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ross |first=Fred |title=William Bouguereau: Genius Reclaimed |work=Art Renewal |date= |url=http://www.artrenewal.org/articles/2000/Genuis_Reclaimed/genius1.php |accessdate=27 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918230217/http://www.artrenewal.org/articles/2000/Genuis_Reclaimed/genius1.php |archivedate=18 September 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Formative years===
William-Adolphe Bouguereau was born in [[La Rochelle]], France, on 30 November 1825, into a family of wine and olive oil merchants.&lt;ref name="wissman-11"&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The son of Théodore Bouguereau (born 1800) and Marie Bonnin (1804), known as Adeline, William was brought up a Catholic. He had an older brother, Alfred, and a younger sister, Marie (known as Hanna), who died when she was seven. The family moved to [[Saint-Martin-de-Ré]] in 1832. Another sibling was born in 1834, Kitty. At 12 the boy went to Mortagne to stay with his uncle Eugène, a priest, and developed a love of nature, religion and literature. In 1839 he was sent to study the priesthood at a Catholic college in Pons. Here he was taught to draw and paint by Louis Sage who had studied under [[Ingres]]. William reluctantly left his studies to return to his family, now residing in [[Bordeaux]]. Here the boy met a local artist, Charles Marionneau, and commenced at the Municipal School of Drawing and Painting in November, 1841. William also worked as a shop assistant, hand-colouring lithographs and making small paintings that were reproduced using [[chromolithography]]. He was soon the best pupil in his class and decided to become an artist in Paris. To fund the move, he sold portraits – 33 oils in three months. All were unsigned and only one has been traced. He arrived in Paris aged 20 in March 1846.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau, 1848, Égalité devant la mort, oil on canvas, 141 x 269 cm, Musée d'Orsay.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|''Égalité devant la mort'' (''Equality Before Death''), 1848, oil on canvas, 141 × 269 cm (55.5 × 105.9 in), [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris. ''Equality'' is Bouguereau's first major painting, produced after two years at the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris at the age of 23.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/egalite-devant-la-mort-21302.html ''Égalité devant la mort'' (''Equality before Death''), Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Bouguereau became a student at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="wissman-11"/&gt; To supplement his formal training in drawing, he attended anatomical dissections and studied historical costumes and archeology. He was admitted to the studio of [[François-Édouard Picot]], where he studied painting in the academic style. ''Dante and Virgil in Hell'' (1850) was an early example of his great, Neo-Classical works. Academic painting placed the highest status on historical and mythological subjects and Bouguereau won the coveted [[Prix de Rome]] at age 26 in 1850,&lt;ref name="andrews"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews |first=Gail |title=Birmingham Museum of Art: Guide to the Collection |publisher=D Giles Ltd |location=London |year=2011 |pages=222–223 |isbn=978-1904832775}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his ''Zenobia Found by Shepherds on the Banks of the Araxes''.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His reward was a three-year residence at the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome, Italy, where in addition to formal lessons he was able to study first-hand the Renaissance artists and their masterpieces, as well as Greek, Etruscan, and Roman antiquities.&lt;ref name="andrews"/&gt; He also studied classical literature, which influenced his subject choice for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="andrews"/&gt;

===Villa Medici, Rome 1851–1854===
In April 1848 the young artist entered the Prix de Rome contest. Soon after work began there were [[French Revolution of 1848|riots in Paris]] and Bouguereau enrolled in the National Guard. After an unsuccessful attempt to win the prize, he entered again in 1849. Following 106 days of competition he again failed to win. His third attempt commenced in April 1850 and five months later he heard he had won a joint first prize. Along with other category winners, William set off for Rome in December and finally arrived at the Villa Medici in January 1851. He explored the city, making sketches and watercolours as he went. He walked to Naples and on to Capri, Amalfi and Pompeii. Still based in Rome and working hard on course work there were more explorations of Italy in 1852. Although the artist bore a strong admiration for all traditional art, he particularly revered [[Greek sculpture]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]], [[Rubens]] and [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]. In April 1854 he left Rome and returned to La Rochelle.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouguereau, painting within the traditional academic style, exhibited at the annual exhibitions of the [[Paris Salon]] for his entire working life. An early reviewer stated, "M. Bouguereau has a natural instinct and knowledge of contour. The eurythmie of the human body preoccupies him, and in recalling the happy results which, in this genre, the ancients and the artists of the sixteenth century arrived at, one can only congratulate M. Bouguereau in attempting to follow in their footsteps ... Raphael was inspired by the ancients ... and no one accused him of not being original."&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raphael]] was a favourite of Bouguereau and he took this review as a high compliment. He had fulfilled one of the requirements of the [[Prix de Rome]] by completing an old-master copy of Raphael's ''The Triumph of Galatea''. In many of his works, he followed the same classical approach to composition, form, and subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bouguereau's graceful portraits of women were considered very charming, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness.

Although Bouguereau spent most of his life in Paris, he returned to La Rochelle again and again throughout his professional life. He was revered in the town of his birth, and undertook decorating commissions from local citizens. From the early 1870s William and his family spent every summer in La Rochelle. In 1882 he decided that rather than rent, he would purchase a house, as well as local farm buildings. By August 1882 the family's permanent summer base was on the rue Verdière. The artist would commence several paintings here and complete them in his Paris studio. He died in the town of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Wave (1896)-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.40|alt=|''The Wave'' (1896)]]
Bouguereau flourished after his Villa Medici residence. In 1854–55 he decorated a pavilion at the grand house of a cousin in Angoulins, including four large paintings of figures depicting the seasons. He was happy to undertake other commissions to pay off the debts accrued in Italy and to help his penniless mother. He decorated a mansion with nine large paintings of allegorical figures. In 1856 the Ministry of State for Fine Arts commissioned him to paint ''Emperor Napoleon III Visiting the Victims of the Tarascon Flood''. There were decorations for the chapel at Saint-Clotilde. On July 12, 1859 he was bestowed the Légion d'honneur. By this time William was turning away from history painting and lengthy commissions to work on more personal paintings, with realistic and rustic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1850s, he had made strong connections with art dealers, particularly [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] (later the champion of the Impressionists), who helped clients buy paintings from artists who exhibited at the [[Salon (art)|Salons]].&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to Paul Durand-Ruel, Bouguereau met [[Hugues Merle]], who later often was compared to Bouguereau. The Salons annually drew over 300,000 people, providing valuable exposure to exhibited artists.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Bouguereau's fame extended to England by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Three paintings were shown at the 1863 Salon and ''Holy Family'' was sold to Napoleon III, who presented it to his wife the Empress Eugénie, who hung it in her Tuileries apartment.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bather'' (1864), a shocking nude, was submitted to an exhibition in Ghent, Belgium. It was a spectacular success and purchased by the museum at great expense. At this time, William took on decorative work at the Grand Théâtre, Bordeaux, which lasted four years. In 1875, with assistants, he began work on a La Rochelle chapel ceiling, producing six paintings on copper over the next six years. Once installed in the city in summer 1875 he began ''Pietà'', one of his greatest religious paintings and shown at the 1876 Salon, in tribute to his son Georges. At the behest of William III of the Netherlands, Bouguereau went to the palace of Loo in May 1876. The king admired the artist and they spent intimate times together. In May 1878 the Paris Universal Exhibition opened to showcase French work. Bouguereau found and borrowed twelve of his paintings from their owners, including new work ''The Nymphaeum''.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Birth of Venus by William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1879).jpg|thumb|upright.0|alt=|[[The Birth of Venus (Bouguereau)|''The Birth of Venus'']] (1879)]]
Bouguereau was a staunch traditionalist whose [[Genre works|genre paintings]] and mythological themes were modern interpretations of Classical subjects, both pagan and Christian, with a concentration on the naked female form. The idealized world of his paintings brought to life goddesses, [[nymph]]s, bathers, shepherdesses, and madonnas in a way that appealed to wealthy art patrons of the era.

Bouguereau employed traditional methods of working up a painting, including detailed pencil studies and oil sketches, and his careful method resulted in a pleasing and accurate rendering of the human form. His painting of skin, hands, and feet was particularly admired.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used some of the religious and erotic symbolism of the Old Masters, such as the "broken pitcher" which connoted lost innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouguereau received many commissions to decorate private houses and public buildings, and, early on, this added to his prestige and fame. As was typical of such commissions, Bouguereau would sometimes paint in his own style, and at other times conform to an existing group style. He also made reductions of his public paintings for sale to patrons, of which ''The Annunciation'' (1888) is an example.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a successful portrait painter and many of his paintings of wealthy patrons remain in private hands.&lt;ref name="wssman-103"&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Académie Julian===
From the 1860s, Bouguereau was closely associated with the [[Académie Julian]] where he gave lessons and advice to art students, male and female, from around the world. During several decades he taught drawing and painting to hundreds, if not thousands, of students. Many of them managed to establish artistic careers in their own countries, sometimes following his academic style, and in other cases, rebelling against it, like [[Henri Matisse]]. He married his most famous pupil, [[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]], after the death of his first wife.

Bouguereau received many honors from the Academy: he became a Life Member in 1876; received the Grand Medal of Honour in 1885;&lt;ref name="Wissman 1996, p. 16"&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed Commander of the [[Legion of Honour|Legion of Honor]] in 1885; and was made Grand Officier of the Legion of Honour in 1905.&lt;ref name="Léonore"&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/leonore_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=NOM&amp;VALUE_1=BOUGUEREAU Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, Base Léonore, Archives Nationales]&lt;/ref&gt; He began to teach drawing at the [[Académie Julian]]&lt;ref name="ARLVAF"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artistic Relations: Literature and the Visual Arts in Nineteenth-century France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b6BgRGJO3KYC&amp;pg|volume=|first=Peter|last=Collier|first2=Robert|last2=Lethbridge|publisher=Yale University Press|location=London|year=1994|language=|page=50|isbn=9780300060096}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1875, a co-ed art institution independent of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], with no entrance exams and nominal fees.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wives and children===
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Portrait de Mademoiselle Elizabeth Gardner (1879).jpg|thumb|Portrait by Bouguereau of his wife [[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]]]]

In 1856, William began living with one of his models, Nelly Monchablon, a 19-year-old from [[Lisle-en-Rigault]]. Living together out of wedlock, the pair kept their liaison a secret. Their first child, Henriette, was born in April 1857. Georges was born January 1859. A third child, Jeanne, was born 25 December 1861. The couple married quietly (for many assumed they were already wed) on 24 May 1866. Eight days later, Jeanne died from [[tuberculosis]]. In mourning, the couple went to La Rochelle, and Bouguereau made a painting of her in 1868. A fourth child, Adolphe (known as Paul), was born in October 1868. Aged 15, Georges' health suffered, and his mother took him away from the bad air of Paris. He died, however, on June 19, 1875. Nelly had a fifth child in 1876, Maurice, but her health was declining and the doctors suspected that she had contracted tuberculosis. His wife died on 3 April 1877, and baby Maurice died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist planned to marry [[Elizabeth Jane Gardner]], a pupil whom he had known for ten years, but his mother was opposed to the idea. Soon after Nelly's death, she made William swear he would not remarry within her lifetime. After his mother's death, and after a nineteen-year engagement, William and Elizabeth married in Paris in June 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife continued to work as his private secretary and helped to organize the household staff. Tragically, his son Paul contracted tuberculosis in early 1899 and he, William, and his stepmother, went to [[Menton]] in the south. When the stay prolonged, William found a room in which to paint. Paul died at his father's house in April 1900 aged 32. William had outlived four of his five children. Elizabeth was with William to the end. She died in Paris in January 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homes===
When William arrived in Paris in March 1846 he resided at the Hotel Corneille at 5 rue Corneille. In 1855, after his stay in Rome, he lived at 27 rue de Fleurus, and the following year rented a fourth-floor studio at 3 rue Carnot near his apartment. In  the year of his marriage to Nelly, 1866, he bought a vast plot of land on the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs and an architect was commissioned to design a grand house with a top-floor studio. The family was installed in 1868, together with five servants and with his mother, Adeline, visiting daily. Bouguereau spent the rest of his life here and at La Rochelle.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years and death===

Bouguereau was an assiduous painter, often completing twenty or more easel paintings in a single year. Even during the twilight years of his life, he would rise at dawn to work on his paintings six days a week and would continue painting until nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the course of his lifetime, he is known to have painted at least 822 paintings. Many of these paintings have been lost.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt; Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: "Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come ... if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable."&lt;ref&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1905, Bouguereau's house and studio in Paris were burgled. On 19 August 19, 1905, Bouguereau died in La Rochelle at the age of 79 from heart disease. There was an outpouring of grief in the town of his birth. After a Mass at the cathedral, his body was placed on a train to Paris for a second ceremony. Bouguereau was laid to rest with Nelly and his children at the family vault at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own time, Bouguereau was considered to be one of the greatest painters in the world by the academic art community, and simultaneously he was reviled by the [[avant-garde]]. He also gained wide fame in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and in the United States, and commanded high prices.&lt;ref name="wssman-103"/&gt; His works often sold within days of completion. Some were viewed by international collectors and bought before work had even finished.&lt;ref&gt;Bartoli, Damien and Ross, Frederick C. ''William Bouguereau: His Life and Works'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouguereau’s career was close to a direct ascent with hardly a setback.&lt;ref name="wissman-9"&gt;Wissman 1996, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; To many, he epitomized taste and refinement, and a respect for tradition. To others, he was a competent technician stuck in the past. [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] and his associates used the term "Bouguereauté" in a derogatory manner to describe any artistic style reliant on "slick and artificial surfaces",&lt;ref name="wissman-9"/&gt; also known as a [[licked finish]]. In an 1872 letter, Degas wrote that he strove to emulate Bouguereau's ordered and productive working style, although with Degas' famous trenchant wit, and the aesthetic tendencies of the Impressionists, it is possible the statement was meant to be ironic.&lt;ref name="wssman-103"/&gt; [[Paul Gauguin]] loathed him, rating him a round zero in ''Racontars de Rapin'' and later describing in ''Avant et après (Intimate Journals)'' the single occasion when Bouguereau made him smile on coming across a couple of his paintings in an Arles' brothel, "where they belonged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertrand|first1=Anne|title=Gauguin le rapin : ""Racontars de rapin, suivi de Art de Papou &amp; chant de Rossignoou"" et ""La lutte pour les peintres""|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/1995/02/02/gauguin-le-rapin-racontars-de-rapin-suivi-de-art-de-papou-chant-de-rossignoou-et-la-lutte-pour-les-p_124875|website=liberation.fr|publisher=[[Libération]]|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|vEs3AQAAMAAJ|Intimate Journals|page=174|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouguereau's works were eagerly bought by American millionaires who considered him the most important French artist of that time.&lt;ref name="wssman-103"/&gt; But even during his lifetime there was critical dissent in assessing his work; the art historian [[Richard Muther (art historian)|Richard Muther]] wrote in 1894 that Bouguereau was a man "destitute of artistic feeling but possessing a cultured taste [who] reveals... in his feeble mawkishness, the fatal decline of the old schools of convention." In 1926, American art historian [[Frank Jewett Mather]] criticized the commercial intent of Bouguereau's work, writing that the artist "multiplied vague, pink effigies of nymphs, occasionally draped them, when they became saints and madonnas, painted on the great scale that dominates an exhibition, and has had his reward. I am convinced that the nude of Bouguereau was prearranged to meet the ideals of a New York stockbroker of the black walnut generation." Bouguereau confessed in 1891 that the direction of his mature work was largely a response to the marketplace: "What do you expect, you have to follow public taste, and the public only buys what it likes. That's why, with time, I changed my way of painting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnFUALV5xEoC&amp;pg=PA281|title=Marketing Modernism in Fin-de-siècle Europe|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1920, Bouguereau fell into disrepute, due in part to changing tastes.&lt;ref name="andrews"/&gt; Comparing his work to that of his [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] contemporaries, [[Kenneth Clark]] faulted Bouguereau's painting for "lubricity", and characterized such Salon art as superficial, employing the "convention of smoothed-out form and waxen surface."&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Kenneth. ''The Nude; A Study in Ideal Form'', 163–164. Princeton University Press, 1956. {{ISBN|0-691-01788-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[New York Cultural Center]] staged a show of Bouguereau's work partly as a curiosity, although curator [[Robert Isaacson]] had his eye on the long-term rehabilitation of Bouguereau's legacy and reputation.&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;I[[Robert Isaacson|saacson, Robert]]. ''William-Adolphe Bouguereau (catalogue)''. New York Cultural Center and Farleigh Dickinson, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the Borghi Gallery hosted a commercial show of 23 oil paintings and one drawing. In the same year a major exhibition was organized by the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] in Canada. The exhibition opened at the [[Petit Palais|Musée du Petit-Palais]], in Paris, traveled to The [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in Hartford, and concluded in Montréal. More recently, resurgence in the artist's popularity has been promoted by American collector Fred Ross, who owns a number of paintings by Bouguereau and features him on his website at [[Art Renewal Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/who-is-buying-all-those-bouguereaus/21771/|title=Who Is Buying All Those Bouguereaus?|work=nysun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/08/20/Gifted-artist-Bouguereau-s-work-controversial-more-than-a-century-after-his-death/stories/200708200191|title=Gifted artist? Bouguereau's work controversial more than a century after his death|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1975 prices for Bouguereau's works have climbed steadily, with major paintings selling at high prices: $1,500,000 in 1998 for ''[[:File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Leveil du coeur (1892).jpg|The Heart's Awakening]]'', $2,600,000 in 1999 for ''[[:File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - The Motherland (1883).jpg|The Motherland]]'' and ''Charity'' at auction in May 2000 for $3,500,000. Bouguereau's works are in many public collections.

''Notre Dame des Anges'' ("Our Lady of the Angels") was last shown publicly in the United States at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. In 2002 it was donated to the Daughters of Mary Mother of Our Savior, an order of nuns affiliated with [[Clarence Kelly]]'s Traditionalist Catholic Society of St. Pius V. In 2009 the nuns sold it to an art dealer for $450,000, who was able to sell it for more than $2&amp;nbsp;million. Kelly was subsequently found guilty by an Albany, New York jury of defaming the dealer in remarks made in a television interview.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abqjournal.com/79877/gallery-owner-didnt-cheat-nuns.html Oswald, Mark.

==Name==
[[Image:Bouguereau assinaturajpg.jpg|thumb|upright.0|Bouguereau's signature]]

Sources on his full name are contradictory: it is sometimes  given as ''William-Adolphe Bouguereau'' (composed name), ''William Adolphe Bouguereau'' (usual and civil-only names according to the French tradition), while in other occasions it appears as ''Adolphe William Bouguereau'' (with Adolphe as the usual name). However, the artist used to sign his works simply as William Bouguereau (hinting "William" was his given name, whatever the order), or more precisely as ''"W.Bouguereau.date"'' (French alphabet) and later as ''"W-BOVGVEREAV-date"'' (Latin alphabet).

A '''wimmelbilderbuch''' (German, literally "teeming picture book"), '''wimmelbook''', or '''hidden picture book''' is a type of large-format, wordless [[picture book]]. It is characterized by [[Book design#Page spread|full-spread]] drawings (sometimes across [[gatefold]] pages) depicting scenes richly detailed with humans, animals, and objects. Typically made for children, the drawings are filled with characters and items that may be discovered.

[[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and [[Hans Jurgen Press]] are regarded as the fathers of the format.  Contemporary Wimmelbook authors include [[Richard Scarry]], [[Ali Mitgutsch]], [[Rotraut Susanne Berner]], and [[:de:Eva Scherbarth|Eva Scherbarth]]. In the United Kingdom and the United States, Wimmelbooks gained popularity with the success of the ''[[Where's Wally?]]'' series by the British illustrator [[Martin Handford]].
