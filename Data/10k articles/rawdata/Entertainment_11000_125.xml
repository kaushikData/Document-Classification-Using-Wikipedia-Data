'''''10 Things I Hate About You''''' is a 1999 American teen [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Gil Junger]] and starring [[Julia Stiles]], [[Heath Ledger]], [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], and [[Larisa Oleynik]]. The screenplay, written by [[Karen McCullah]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]], is a loose modernization of [[William Shakespeare]]'s late-16th century comedy ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', retold in a late-1990s American [[high school]] setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca Stratford (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on [[dating]], attempts to get [[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat Stratford (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], with many scenes shot at [[Stadium High School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].

Released March 31, 1999, ''10 Things I Hate About You'' was number two at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, behind only ''[[The Matrix]]'', and was a moderate financial and critical success. It was a [[breakthrough role]] for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, the film was adapted into a [[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|television series of the same title]], which ran for twenty episodes and featured [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] reprising his role as the father, Walter Stratford, from the film.

==Plot==
Cameron James, a new student at Padua High School in the [[Seattle]] area, becomes instantly smitten with popular [[sophomore]] Bianca Stratford. [[Geek]]y Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish Kat, to date. Kat, a [[senior (education)|senior]], is accepted to [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] worrisome of [[teenage pregnancy]], will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.

When Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Cameron selects "bad boy" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.

At the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a [[musical ensemble|band]]. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.

Joey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the [[prom]] so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the [[marching band]], and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron has not asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter will not allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were [[freshman|freshmen]] and, succumbing to [[peer pressure]], had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.

All is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.

The next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 141]], Kat reads aloud a poem titled "10 Things I Hate About You", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.

==Production==
Many of the scenes were filmed on location at [[Stadium High School]] and at a house in the [[Proctor District]] of [[Tacoma, Washington]]. The prom sequence was shot over three days in Seattle.&lt;ref name="cinemareview"&gt;[http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=531 Write-up on CinemaReview.com]. Retrieved May 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume designer Kim Tillman designed original dresses for Larisa Oleynik and Julia Stiles as well as the period outfits for Susan May Pratt and David Krumholtz. Gabrielle Union's snakeskin prom dress is a [[Betsey Johnson]] design. [[Heath Ledger]] and [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]'s vintage tuxes came from Isadora's in Seattle.&lt;ref name="cinemareview"/&gt;

The primary [[tagline]] is an allusion to a poem written by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] from her [[Sonnets from the Portuguese]] collection. ("How do I loathe thee? Let me count the ways.") Another tagline is a spoof from Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' ("Romeo, Oh Romeo, Get Out Of My Face.") and another is a line from ''The Taming of the Shrew'' that is spoken in the film by Cameron ("I burn, I pine, I perish!"). The original script was finalized on November 12, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/10-Things-I-Hate-About-You.html |title=Internet Movie Script Database |publisher=Imsdb.com |date=November 12, 1997 |accessdate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In June 1999, the [[Scholastic Corporation]] published a [[novelization]] of the story, adapted by [[David Levithan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn= 0439087309 | title= 10 Things I Hate About You |publisher= [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]|location= New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is retold as it is in the film with each chapter written from the point of view of either Bianca, Cameron, Kat, Patrick, or Michael.

In October 2008, [[ABC Family]] ordered a [[pilot episode]] of ''[[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|10 Things I Hate About You]]'', a half-hour, single-camera comedy series based on the feature film of the same name. [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] is the only actor from the film to reprise his role in the television series. The director of the film, [[Gil Junger]], directed many of the episodes including the pilot while the film's music composer, Richard Gibbs, also returned to do the show's music. The series was adapted and produced by [[Carter Covington]].&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Hanh. "[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-pilots10thingsihateaboutyourubyandtherockits,0,2482981.story ABC Family Greenlights '10 Things I Hate,' 'Ruby' Pilots]." ''Zap2it.com''. October 8, 2008. Retrieved on October 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The show premiered on July 7, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ABC Family: 10 Things I Hate About You |url=http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/section_Shows+10-Things-I-Hate-About-You/page_Detail |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5heKgqMgR?url=http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/section_Shows+10-Things-I-Hate-About-You/page_Detail |archivedate=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=June 17, 2009 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted 20 episodes.

== References to Shakespeare ==

The film is a retelling of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] play ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' in an American high school setting. Screenwriters [[Karen McCullah]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]] also wrote the script for ''[[She's the Man]]'' (2006), a retelling of Shakespeare's play ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' set in an American college.

Kat and Bianca share the same names as the female leads in the original play. Their surname is [[Stratford Upon Avon|Stratford]], a nod to Shakespeare's birthplace. Patrick's surname [[Verona]] references the home of his relative character [[Petruchio]]. The characters attend [[Padua]] High School, named after where the play is set.

Cameron (Lucentio, who disguises himself as a tutor named Cambio) tutors [[Bianca Minola|Bianca]] in French and slips in a line from play while obsessing over her: ''"I burn, I pine, I perish"''. Patrick's character reflects the outlandish behavior of [[Petruchio]], and Michael coerces Patrick into the marching band incident with the words from [[Sonnet 56]]: ''"Sweet love, renew thy force"''. The physicality of Petruchio and Katherina is transformed into a playful paintball match; the prom substitutes for the Act V feast; Kat's poem replaces Katherina's famous Act V speech; and Joey Donner's wager over Bianca's virginity parallels the bet placed by Shakespeare's husbands regarding their partners' obedience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittman|first1=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">'''Antenarrative''' is the process by which [[Sensemaking|retrospective narrative]] is linked to [[living story]]. While aspects of this process have been studied by other disciplines under other names for centuries, the term "antenarrative", coined by [[David Boje]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Boje, D. M. (2001). Narrative methods for organizational &amp; communication research. Sage Publications Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; has four primary uses. The first two uses of antenarrative are as the before(ante)-narrative, existing as story is turned to narrative, and a bet (ante) narrative, placed in hopes that something will become a retrospective narrative. The other two uses are spiral and [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] antenarratives.

Research in the journal, [[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]], has recently found a number of nationally oriented antenarratives that are utilized in cross border mergers and acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Vaara, E., &amp; Tienari, J. (2011). On the narrative construction of multinational corporations: An antenarrative analysis of legitimation and resistance in a cross-border merger. Organization Science, 22(2), 370-390.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars that have utilized antenarrative include Barge 2004;&lt;ref&gt;Barge, J.K. (2004) Antenarrative and managerial practice. Communication Studies 55(1): 106-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Collins &amp; Rainwater, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, D. &amp; Rainwater, K. (2005). Managing change at Sears: a sideways look at a tale of corporate transformation. Journal of Organizational Change Management, Vol. 18, No. 1: 16-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Durant, Gardner &amp; Taylor, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;Durant, R.; Gardner, K.; &amp; Taylor, K. (2006). Indexical antenarratives as invitational rhetoric. Tamara Journal of Critical Organization Inquiry, Vol. 5 (3/4): 17-182.&lt;/ref&gt; Vickers, 2005;&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, M. H. (2005). Illness, work and organization: Postmodern perspectives, antenarratives and chaos narratives for the reinstatement of voice. Tamara: Journal of Critical Postmodern Organization Science, 3(2), pp. 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Yolles, 2007;&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M. (2007). The dynamics of narrative and antenarrative and their relation to story. Journal of Organizational Change Management. Vol. 20, No. 1: 74 – 94&lt;/ref&gt; Grow 2009.&lt;ref&gt;and Grow, J.M. (2009), The gender of branding: Antenarrative resistance in early Nike women’s advertising. Women’s Studies in Communication, 31/3, 310-343.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre/bet antenarratives==
The antenarrative is pre-narrative, a bet that a fragmented [[Polyphony (literature)|polyphonic]] story will make retrospective, narrative, sense in the future. In a recent description of the bet aspect of antenarrative [[Karl Weick]] has said "To talk about antenarrative as a bet is also to invoke an important structure in sense-making; namely, the presumption of logic (Meyer, 1956). ‘Without faith in the purpose- fulness of, and rationality of art, listeners would abandon their attempts to understand, to reconcile deviants to what has gone before or to look for their raison d’être in what is still to come’ (1956: 75).".&lt;ref&gt;Weick, K. E. (2012). Organized sensemaking: A commentary on processes of interpretive work. Human Relations, 65(1), 141-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Antenarratives serve a similar purpose. The process of moving from the nebulous and chaotic story to a narrative with a beginning middle and end is the antenarrative faith that story fragments will make retrospective sense some time in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-dictionary-of-qualitative-management-research/n9.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiral==
Spiral antenarrative goes beyond [[Linear system|linear]] and [[cybernetic]], closed signal loop, systems. Instead it utilizes the [[dialectic]] of [[Deviancy amplification spiral|deviation-amplification]] and [[Negative feedback|deviation counteraction]] to show dynamically changing meanings. This is where antenarrative participates with [[heteroglossia]]. As David Boje says "This is a connection between more immediate-emergence-sensemaking and a prospective-sensemaking that anticipated a possible future by enacting particular sorts of actions of caring and in-Being involved, for a while, iteratively."&lt;ref&gt;http://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/655/anteriority_and_antenarrative_spiral.html&lt;/ref&gt; Spirals are like circles except in that the variability of the trajectory is, itself, dissymetrical&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, G., &amp; Guattari, F. (1994). What is philosophy?, trans. H. Tomlinson and G. Burchell. Columbia University Press (New Yorkl. 1994. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning that, unlike cycles, that which is part of the new spiral may be made up of, and utilize things unrelated to, the previous iteration.

== Rhizomeatic assemblage ==
Rhizomeatic/assemblage antenarrative, is the antenarrative process that is not theoretically causal, but rather combinatorial. It builds on the theoretical tradition of [[Qualia#Erwin_Schr.C3.B6dinger|quallia]] which allows for assemblages of interacting processes. When a narrative is forming but still maintains a level of [[Karl_E._Weick#Sensemaking|ambiguity]] regarding the multiple linear potentials, all of which interact during the formation, then the antenarrative is rhizomatic. As David Boje has said: from a storytelling method standpoint, "an assemblage (rhizome) has visible runners and invisible roots that connect agents (usually people, but also animals, and the fire of the forge) with actants (usually material things, such as the iron, the carbon, the subatomic stuff).  Agents and actants, people and things, are networked together by their runners and rooting connectivity."&lt;ref&gt;http://business.nmsu.edu/~dboje/448/The%20Quantum%20Physics%20of%20Storytelling%20in%20book%20format%20Jan%202011%20Boje.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This shows a kind of rhizome-ontology that can be found amongst various actors and [[Actor–network_theory#The_actor-network|actants]].

'''''Black Mirror''''' is a 2017 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[King Art Games]] and published by [[THQ Nordic]]. The game is a reboot of ''[[The Black Mirror (video game)|The Black Mirror]]'' series, a trilogy of [[point-and-click]] games for [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Synposis==
The game features a new setting and cast of characters from the original title. Set in 1926, players control David Gordon, who travels from his home in the [[British Raj]] to his ancestral homeland of [[Scotland]], following the suicide of his estranged father, John Gordon. John was an avid enthusiast of [[Occultism]], and the final weeks leading to his death remain a mystery. Given these suspicious circumstances, David begins an investigation into the suicide of John.

==Gameplay==
Unlike the original trilogy, which was [[point-and-click]] in nature, ''Black Mirror'' is a more traditional [[Adventure game#Graphic adventure|graphic adventure]] title. Players are free to explore the mansion at will, interacting with various objects in the environment to collect items and solve puzzles. Various characters can be found within the mansion including members of the Gordon family and staff, who may have information that can aid the investigation.&lt;ref name="characters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Characters|url=https://blackmirror-game.com/characters/characters-overview/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=THQ Nordic|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story progresses, more areas of the Gordon's property become available. 

==Release==
The game was announced on August 16, 2017, with a trailer and November 28 release date being given.&lt;ref name="Announce"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coetsee |first1=Jordan |title=Black Mirror Announced For PS4 and Xbox One|url=http://gameranx.com/updates/id/115888/article/black-mirror-announced-for-ps4-and-xbox-one/|accessdate=15 July 2018|work=Game Ranx|date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title launched as intended on November 28 for [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].

'''''Buddy the Gob''''' is an American [[animation|animated]] [[short film]], produced and released by [[Warner Bros.]] on January 13, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard. ''Of Mice and Magic: a History of American Animated Cartoons''. Von Hoffmann Press, Inc., 1980. p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon, featuring [[Buddy (Looney Tunes)|Buddy]], the second star of the series. It was the first cartoon supervised by [[Friz Freleng]]; the musical score is by [[Norman Spencer (composer)|Norman Spencer]]. The theme music played at the beginning is "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean."

==Summary==
A great [[United States Navy|Navy]] gunboat sails toward the audience and fires her weapons; several other ships go on behind it. Buddy is a "gob", a [[sailor]] onboard one of the ships, and is excited to see that they have made port in [[China]]. Jumping from the side of his ship and into a [[rowboat]], Our Hero makes his way to land.

In the Chinese city, now, we see that a large woman carries her four children, attached by their hair to a pole straddled across her shoulders; Buddy turns a corner and sees an older gentleman expand and compress himself [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|vertically]] in order to read a poster on the side of a building; when the man has left, Buddy goes to read the message, which converts, for our benefit, into English: "Grand Celebration To-day: the 150th Birthday Anniversary of the Sacred [[Dragon]]: a beautiful girl will be sacrificed to the Dragon. Come one! Come all!" Leaping from [[straw hat]]-to-straw hat of five men arranged from back-to-front in ascending order of height, Buddy manages to see the grand celebration: a baton wielder bounces his belly; a [[drum]], held by two marchers, is host to six tiny people who jump upon it; in addition to [[trumpet]]ers and tiny men whose hats double as [[cymbals]], the procession happens to include a [[piano|pianist]]! One of the masked dancers in the parade is a caricature of [[Jimmy Durante]] (a favorite target of Warner Bros. cartoons of the time.)

Then we see the young girl to be sacrificed, in her cage, carried by two marchers; she begs for help and weeps. Buddy is not about to let the ritual occur. But when he attempts to enter the temple into which the girl has been taken, he is ejected from the very steps by spear, and thus caught on a wall by the seat of his pants. Once free, Our Hero hears the girl's screams from a window several stories above him. When his attempt at propelling himself to the window by means of the spear fails, Buddy simply picks up a piece of a gate and fires the spear-like points of it, as though they were arrows, at the wall of the prison-temple, thereby forming a series of steps up which he can easily walk to reach the girl's holding cell.

The girl's keeper locks her cuffs, swallows the key, and steps out of the room, leaving the girl to be terrified by the imprisoned, fire-breathing dragon across the room from her. Buddy enters, but can not seem to break the lock; so he knocks on the door, and stands aside, picking up a nearby barrel: the keeper steps inside, and Buddy slams the barrel over the villain's head and body, dazing him. A swift kick in the pants, and the jailer coughs up the key. The brave little sailor frees the girl, but no sooner does he that than the bars entrapping the dragon rise and free the beast. At Buddy's direction, the girl leaps from the window to a waiting [[pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] beneath: Buddy, after enduring the dragon's flame on his behind, follows. 

As the vehicle speedily makes away, a throng of angry, spear-wielding people notice that their sacrifice is escaping! When their rickshaw breaks upon hitting a rock, the driver himself becomes the escape vehicle, off of which Buddy and the girl get, preferring to run. They come to a bridge of wooden planks, suspended by ropes tied to stakes. Once on the bridge, Buddy, the rescued girl at his side, severs the ropes with a saw; the two run across as the bridge just as surely as it falls, plank-by-plank, behind them. From one side of the valley, the angry people helplessly protest the escape as Buddy and the girl tease their pursuers. One such pursuer hurls his spear all the way across; dodging this, the two continue to tease, but the spear, imbued with malevolent life, turns about and pricks Buddy's rear end before falling, lifeless, to the ground. A victorious but dazed Buddy stares into the camera as the cartoon ends.

==Footage reused==
The opening scene, in which the ship sails towards the camera and fires her guns, is recycled for a cinematic sequence in 1935's ''[[Buddy's Theatre#The film reels|Buddy's Theatre]]''.
Also the Mice play Yankee Doodle of the Drums was reused from ''[[It's Got Me Again!]]''.

'''''Burning Annie''''' is an American independent comedy film starring Gary Lundy, Sara Downing, Kim Murphy, Brian Klugman, Jay Paulson, Rini Bell, Todd Duffey, and Kathleen Rose Perkins. It is the directorial debut of Van Flesher.  The film was produced by Randy Mack of Armak Productions and in 2007 was distributed by [[Lightyear Entertainment]] via [[Warner Bros]]. In 2017 it was re-distributed by the filmmakers through [[Sundance Institute]]'s [[Sundance_Institute#Creative_Distribution_Initiative|Creative Distribution Initiative]].

==Plot==
A dysfunctional romantic comedy about Max, a college student in 1998 who's obsessed with [[Woody Allen]]'s film [[Annie Hall]].  He believes the film holds all the answers to life, including the futility of romance. Just as he begins to suspect the film might actually be ruining his life, he meets Julie, a young woman who might be the modern day equivalent of Annie Hall herself, and goes into a romantic tailspin.

'''Charles D'Almaine''' ({{IPAc-en|d|æ|l|m|eɪ|n}};&lt;ref name=walsh1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=Jim |date=November 1957 |title=Charles D'Almaine |journal=Hobbies |pages=34–37 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; June 13, 1871 – June 17, 1943) was a [[violin]]ist with the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]], and a [[chiropractor]], but best known today for his prolific activity as a pioneer recording artist.

==Biography==
Charles D'Almaine was born in [[Kingston upon Hull]] on June 13, 1871.&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Frank |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |pages=266–267 |isbn=9781135949495 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He grew up an orphan in the London area.  At some point he came to the United States and played first violin at the Grand Opera House in Chicago in the 1890s.

He married his second wife, Cornelia Helen (d. September 25, 1933, known as "Helen") on December 24, 1897.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;  After his marriage he stayed in Chicago a short time to teach violin students. In 1898 he relocated to [[New York City]], the only major recording center of the time.&lt;ref name=walsh2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh |first=Jim |date=December 1957 |title=Charles D'Almaine part II |journal=Hobbies |pages=34–36 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest violinists to make recordings, D'Almaine's first ("[[Il trovatore#Act 4: The Punishment|Miserere]]") was recorded in 1899 and released on Edison [[cylinder record|cylinder]] #7324.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;  He went to the Berliner Gramophone studios in January and February 1900, where at least 13 of his recordings were issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charosh |first=Paul |date=1995 |title=Berliner Gramophone Records: American Issues, 1892–1900 |location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-313-29217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a standing orchestra was established at the Edison studios, D'Almaine was made concertmaster.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;

Beginning his association with the Victor company in 1901,&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/3376/ |title=Charles D'Almaine |date= |website=National Jukebox |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; he eventually became concertmaster of the house unit, the Victor Orchestra.&lt;ref name= hoffman /&gt;  He also made recordings for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], where sometimes the pseudonym '''Charles Gordon''' was used.&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;  His musical duties outside the recording studio included positions at the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]].&lt;ref name=whitburn&gt;{{cite book |last= Whitburn|first=Joel |authorlink= Joel Whitburn|title=Pop Memories 1890–1954 |year=1986 |publisher=Record Research, Inc. |location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |isbn=0-89820-083-0 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to performing, he also made several violins.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;

In April 1914 he and his wife Helen enrolled at the [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]], where he obtained his Doctor of Chiropractic.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;  He made his final recordings for [[Pathé Records]].&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt;  He and his wife operated chiropractic practices in New York City and [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;

In addition to his medical duties, he continued his musical career.  He was second-violinist with the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] orchestra.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt; for the 1921–1922 season, and was employed there until the 1924–1925 season in the violin section.  He was released, having spent 17 years at the Met, when a new conductor brought in many new players he was familiar with.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;  D'Almaine spent the following summer season with the [[Arthur Pryor]] band.  His last professional musical activity was to tour with [[Harry Lauder]], after which he abandoned music to devote himself to his chiropractic practice.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt; On June 17, 1943 he died, childless,&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt; in Newark,&lt;ref name=hoffman /&gt; and was cremated.&lt;ref name=walsh1 /&gt;

==Style and recordings==
Many of D'Almaine's recordings used the [[Stroh violin]], and he was the first to record using that instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmes |first=Thom |date=2013 |title=The Routledge Guide to Music Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V2MAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292 |publisher=Routledge |page=292 |isbn=9781135477806}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to classical pieces and straight renditions of popular songs, his output of [[Old-time music|fiddle-tunes]] was significant to the genre,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Howard Wight |date=2013 |title=Play Me Something Quick and Devilish: Old-Time Fiddlers in Missouri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjMVg1eWTzcC&amp;pg=PA85 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |page=260 |isbn=9780826272935}}&lt;/ref&gt; often because of Edison's penchant for marketing to rural markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wondrich |first=David |date=2003 |title=Stomp and Swerve: American Music Gets Hot, 1843–1924 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T_ehSZc8mWkC&amp;pg=PA239 |publisher= Chicago Review Press|page=239 |isbn= 9781569764978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  D'Almaine was the fiddle player on [[Len Spencer]]'s immensely popular "[[The Arkansas Traveler (song)|Arkansas Traveler]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Steve|date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA656|publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=656 |isbn=9780810882966}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first to record "[[The Irish Washerwoman]]" (1904),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beisswenger |first1=Drew |last2=McCann |first2=Gordon |date=2011 |title=Ozarks Fiddle Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vm8OaHq_WcC&amp;pg=PA108 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |page=103 |isbn=9781610653190}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Flowers of Edinburgh]]" (1905),&lt;ref&gt;Beisswenger (2011), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Tom and Jerry (fiddle tune)|Tom and Jerry]]" (1905).&lt;ref&gt;Beisswenger (2011), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made novelty records such as "Donkey and Driver", which includes sound effects generated on his instrument.&lt;ref name=walsh2 /&gt;  As the violin soloist of choice for [[Victor Records]] and [[Edison Records]], D'Almaine's output was prolific.  His wide repertoire and varied duties demanded a formidable technique, which he rarely got to fully display; the most virtuosic of his "classical" recordings is probably his 1906 rendition of [[Jean-Delphin Alard]]'s "Brindisi-Valse" for violin and piano, opus 49 no. 16 (recorded with orchestral accompaniment and released as Victor 31542). He also recorded for [[Berliner Gramophone]], [[Columbia Records]], and other, smaller companies.&lt;ref name=loc /&gt;  Among his most popular recordings were "Shepherd's Dance", a 1902 release on [[cylinder record|cylinder]] for Edison, and "Medley of Old-Time Reels", a 1906 release on a 12-inch Victor disc.&lt;ref name=whitburn /&gt;

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!--

Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===

{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger.

In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages. This is one of... Golden Age (1938–1955)Superhero |publisher=Comics.ha.com |date=14 October 2005 |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003).

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Minnie the minx.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of ''[[Minnie the Minx]]'', a character from ''[[The Beano]]'', in Dundee, Scotland. Launched in 1938, ''The Beano'' is known for its anarchic humour, with ''[[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]]'' appearing on the cover.]]
The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html "Was Pixar's Inside Out inspired by The Beano?"] ''The Telegraph''. 27 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Dandy owner DC Thomson to end comic's printed edition |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-19284222 |date=16 August 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the enormous popularity of comics in [[British popular culture]] during this period, Anita O'Brien, director curator at London's Cartoon Museum, states:  “When comics like the Beano and Dandy were invented back in the 1930s - and through really to the 1950s and 60s - these comics were almost the only entertainment available to children."&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; The “world’s naughtiest schoolboy”, ''[[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]]'' was created in the 1950s, which saw sales for ''The Beano'' soar.&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"/&gt; He features in the cover of ''The Beano'', with the BBC referring to him as the “definitive naughty boy of the comic world.”&lt;ref name="Dennis at 60"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dennis the Menace at 60|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12770341|agency=BBC|date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and "darker and edgier" comic books and jump start the [[Modern Age of Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sequart.org/magazine/20743/1986-british-invasion-part-3-neil-gaiman-swamp-thing/ | title= The British Invasion, Part 3: Neil Gaiman &amp; Swamp Thing | author= Peter Sanderson | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= ''Sequart Organization''| accessdate=September 28, 2014 }} May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writers included [[Alan Moore]], famous for his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Marvelman]]'', and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/ Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics], by Douglas Wolk in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Gaiman]] with ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' mythos and ''[[Books of Magic]]''; [[Warren Ellis]], creator of ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''; and others such as [[Mark Millar]], creator of ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]''. The comic book series ''[[Hellblazer]]'', which is largely set in Britain and starring the magician [[John Constantine]], paved the way for British writers such as [[Jamie Delano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusComics/Hellblazers.html| title= The Writers of Hellblazer: Interviews with Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis | publisher= Tabula Rasa| accessdate=2014-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

On 19 March 2012, the British postal service, the [[Royal Mail]], released a set of stamps depicting British comic-book characters and series.&lt;ref name="Stamps"&gt;
{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17421394 |title=Beano's Dennis the Menace on Royal Mail comic stamps |publisher=BBC News |date= 19 March 2012|accessdate=19 March 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The collection featured ''[[The Beano]]'', ''[[The Dandy]]'', ''[[Eagle (comics)|Eagle]]'', ''[[The Topper (comics)|The Topper]]'', ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Bunty]]'', ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Twinkle (comics)|Twinkle]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.&lt;ref name="Stamps"/&gt;

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

===Czech comics===
{{Main|Čtyřlístek}}
''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guinness World Record ==
The largest comic book ever published was on the 5th of August 2018 in São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Corn Popper''' is a [[toy]] manufactured by [[Fisher-Price]] since 1957. Aimed at [[pre-school]]ers, when the Corn Popper is pushed or pulled, colored balls inside a [[plastic]] [[dome]] bounce and create a popping, bouncing noise.[[File:FisherPriceLogo.png|thumb|Fisher Price Logo]]

==History==
The Corn Popper was invented in 1957 by Arthur Holt, who died in April 1996, and sold to Fisher-Price for $50.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1043035 Inventor Arthur Holt Dies of Cancer at 74], [[NPR]] ''[[All Things Considered]]'', 9 April 1996, (retrieved 8 September 2010 from [[HighBeam Research]])&lt;/ref&gt; The Corn Popper is one of the most popular toys for young children in history, and was designed to help them learn to walk. It sends tiny, colorful, gumball size balls flying and hitting the plastic dome, to create its signature loud popping noise.&lt;ref name="Corn Popper"&gt;{{cite news|title=Corn Popper- History's Best Toys: All-Time 100 Greatest Toys|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2049243_2048654_2049240,00.html|publisher=Time|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distaff Day''', also called '''Roc Day''', is 7 January, the day after the feast of the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]]. It is also known as '''Saint Distaff's Day''', one of the many unofficial holidays in Catholic nations.

Many St. Distaff's Day gatherings are held, large and small, throughout local fiber community. The [[distaff]], or rock, used in spinning was the medieval symbol of women's work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.interweave.com/article/spinning/how-did-you-celebrate-st-distaffs-day/ How did you celebrate St. Distaff's Day?] Accessed 12 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In many European cultural traditions, women resumed their household work after the [[twelve days of Christmas]]. Women of all classes would spend their evenings spinning on the wheel. During the day, they would carry a drop spindle with them. Spinning was the only means of turning raw wool, cotton or flax into thread, which could then be woven into cloth.

Men have their own way of celebrating this occasion; this is done through Plough Monday. It is the first Monday after [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] where men are supposed to get back to work.

Every few years, Distaff Day and Plough Monday falls on the same day. Often the men and women would play pranks on each other during this celebration, as was written by [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]] in his poem "Saint Distaffs day, or the Morrow After Twelfth Day" which appears in his Hesperides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herrick.ncl.ac.uk/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425205111/http://herrick.ncl.ac.uk/ |archivedate=2007-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern craft groups have taken up the celebration of Distaff day as part of their new year celebrations.

Robert Herrick wrote a poem on the subject which was later adapted into a song.&lt;ref&gt;MacMahon, Desmond (1939) ''Nelson's New National and Folk Song Book; pt. II''. London: Thomas Nelson; pp. 136-37&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dračí historie''''' (English: '''Dragon History''') is a 1995 [[DOS]]-based [[adventure game]] developed in the [[Czech Republic]] by NoSense. The game was last updated in 2006.

== Production ==

=== Conception and design ===
Early development commenced in 1994, by a group called NoSense, consisting of students at [[Masaryk University]], in [[Brno]], Czech Republic. The team consisted of programmers Pavel Pospíšil, Lukáš Svoboda and Robert Špalek; graphic artists Jakub Dvorský, Pavel Jura and Jan Pokorný; and musician Radovan Kramář.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/|title=Dračí Historie|website=www.ucw.cz|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These students knew members of the small development team [[Pterodon (company)|Pterodon]], which had been responsible for ''[[Tajemství Oslího ostrova]]'', a noted success at the time. Hoping to outdo the Pterodon team, the team grew and eventually consisted of seven people. During 1994 and early 1995, NoSense focused on finding artists and writing a story. Active development began in mid-1995.&lt;ref name="Score 23"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview: NoSense|journal=Score|date=1 November 1995|volume=23|issue=11/1995|pages=10-11|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/mag/score-23/page/10/|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was designed to be a grotesque adventure with unbridled jokes, and contained forty locations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freegame.cz/hry-ke-stazeni/zdarma/adventury/draci-historie/13813|title=Dračí Historie|website=Freegame.cz|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release and aftermath ===
Published in Christmas 1995,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/historie-adventur-4-ceska-stopa-56482|title=Historie adventur #4: česká stopa - Games.cz|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the game sold 7000 copies, becoming one of the best selling Czech games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, it was the first-ever title to be released in the Czech Republic on CD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The CD version was the first Czech game to include amateur Czech dubbing, a breakthrough for the Czech game industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 11 years later, the game was made available under the [[GPL License]] and was free to download after this point.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NoSense followed the game with 1997's ''[[Asmodeus: Tajemný kraj Ruthaniolu|Asmodeus]]'', which was worked on by [[Jakub Dvorský]], who had also contributed to ''Dračí historie'' and later founded the Czech development company [[Amanita Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/ceske-a-slovenske-hry-pod-koly-casu-245471|title=České a slovenské hry pod koly času - Games.cz|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

11 years after the game's original release in 2006, the game was revisited for the first time, when Roberta Špalka cleaned it up ready for a remastered version which was released as freeware.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrej.cz/plne-hry-zdarma/adventura/2d-adventura/draci-historie/|title=Dračí Historie|website=Hrej.cz|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2009, Denis Kasak started to convert the game into C++ as part of the ScummVM project, during Google Summer of Code'09, under Špalka's leadership.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.root.cz/zpravicky/ceska-hra-draci-historie-pod-scummvm/|title=Česká hra Dračí Historie pod ScummVM - Root.cz|last=Krčmář|first=Petr|work=Root.cz|access-date=2018-07-16|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Kasak was paid he left the project for good, and Špalka was left to finish it off. In 2010 he cleaned the game scripts and graphics in order to make it easier to translate to other languages, while the English, German, and Polish versions were refined.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucw.cz/draci-historie/|title=Dračí Historie|website=www.ucw.cz|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and gameplay ==
The game centres around a teen dragon named Bert. He lives with his father Herbert and mother Berta. Bert's father leaves to look for treasure. Bert decides to find his father and bring him home.

== Critical reception ==
The game received mostly positive reviews from critics in 1995. The lowest rating was 60% from Score, while the highest was 92% from Riki.&lt;ref name="DJ OldGames"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dračí Historie|url=http://www.oldgames.sk/game/draci-historie/|website=www.oldgames.sk|accessdate=22 March 2018|language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review on Freegame.cz written in 2006 commented that the technical processing still held up.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Tiscali.cz said that while the game was disappointing, it was nevertheless a turning point for the Czech game scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gry Online felt the game was humorous and targeted at children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gry-online.pl/S016.asp?ID=1268|title=Smocze Historie (PC) {{!}} GRYOnline.pl|website=GRY-Online.pl|language=pl-PL|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Database-her.cz thoguht the title had pleasant cartoon graphics and humorous dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/draci-historie/|title=Dračí Historie – Databáze-her.cz|website=www.databaze-her.cz|language=cs|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Bonusweb gave the game a rating of 80%, commenting that it had lost virtually nothing of its attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plnehry.idnes.cz/draci-historie-puvodne-komercni-hra-nyni-zadarmo-fbm-/Clanek.aspx?c=A060624_071822_bw-plneHry-adventury_bw|title=Dračí Historie - původně komerční hra nyní zadarmo|date=2006-06-25|website=iDNES.cz|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; FreeHry.cz described it as a "true nostalgic memory of old good adventures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freehry.doupe.zive.cz/recenze/draci-historie-nostalgicka-vzpominka/|title=Dračí Historie: NOSTALGICKÁ VZPOMÍNKA - FreeHry.cz|last=xixáč|website=freehry.doupe.zive.cz|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Root.cz deemed it a blast from the past, yet still fun to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.root.cz/clanky/draci-historie-klasicka-adventura-i-pro-linux/|title=Dračí historie: klasická adventura i pro Linux - Root.cz|last=Krčmář|first=Petr|work=Root.cz|access-date=2018-07-16|language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game sold 7,000 copies in 1995, one of the best-selling Czech games at the time.&lt;ref name="CSHry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dračí historie|url=http://www.cshry.cz/hry/adventury/draci-historie/|website=www.cshry.cz|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1995-1999, approximately 10 to 15 thousand official copies were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/153275131472701/posts/160517184081829/|title=Dračí Historie|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

was an impresario whose nightclubs le Sept, Le Bronx and [[le Palace]], were the premier spots in Paris nightlife in the 1970s and early 1980s, celebrated in memoirs and songs like [[Amanda Lear]]'s 1979 song "Fashion Pack" which declared, "In Paris you got to be seen at Maxim's / The Palace / The 7 and then go Chez Regine." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bide-et-musique.com/song/3932.html Fashion Pack (Studio 54)] Anthony Monn - Amanda Lear.  Eurodisc / Ariola. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modest Beginnings==
Born May 1, 1935, Francis Paul Emaer grew up in Wattrelos near Lille in northern France. His father was a traveling salesman for the local spinning mills, and his untimely death left the family impoverished. 

At seventeen, he left his family and traveled North Africa and the French Riviera, before settling in Paris. By then, he had changed his name to the more elegant Fabrice, and worked as a stylist and make-up artist.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Alicia (2006). ''The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris''. New York: Little, Brown.  p. 120. {{ISBN|978-0-316-76801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koymasky, Matt &amp; Andrej, [http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioe1/emaer01.html Famous LGBT People: Fabrice Emaer] Retrieved on 2010-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

He opened his first club, "Le Pimm's Bar," in 1964. Le Pimm's evolved into the premier gay club on Saint-Anne Street, situated in the heart of the gay neighborhood near L'Opera that was packed with bars, bathhouses, and prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Lestrade, Didier. Mars 99 "[http://paris70.free.fr/comportement80.htm Palace - comportement 80"] Têtu Magazine. Retrieved on 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The clientele was almost exclusively gay men who were there to cruise.

==Prince of the Night==
He had different ideas in 1968 when he took over another place down the block at 7, Saint-Anne Street. The Sept (7) had a restaurant on the ground floor with a small dance floor in the basement which he decorated simply, with mirrors on the walls and a ceiling with multicolored lights that flashed with the music.

"...the greatest innovation of Le Sept was that it was defined by glamour, not homosexuality. Everyone came -- gay, straight, and the undecided. 'You didn't have to be rich, you didn't have to be famous,' says former Le Sept DJ [[Guy Cuevas]], 'you had to be beautiful.'" &lt;ref&gt;Drake, Alicia (2006). ''The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris''. New York: Little, Brown. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0-316-76801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emaer himself fit the bill. He was handsome and charming. When [[Guy Cuevas]] took over at the turntables, the Sept became the "epicenter of disco" &lt;ref&gt;Bacos, Bernard. "[http://paris70.free.fr/palace.htm Le Sept / Le Palace"] Le Paris branché des années 70. Retrieved on 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;, attracting all of Paris. Visitors might see [[Francis Bacon]], [[Nureyev]], [[Roland Barthes]], Bianca and [[Mick Jagger]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Hughes]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Kenzo Takada|Kenzo]].&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Alicia (2006). ''The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris''. New York: Little, Brown. p. 119. {{ISBN|978-0-316-76801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And after a visit to New York in 1977, Emaer returned with even greater ambitions—to create the Parisian answer to [[Studio 54]] which he found impressive and repulsive at the same time. "It is completely sterilized, a ghetto for model agencies and Régine's emirs...." He sneered at the clientele which was "totally clean, beautiful, they look like they are fed on best quality corn." &lt;ref&gt;Drake, Alicia (2006). ''The Beautiful Fall: Lagerfeld, Saint Laurent, and Glorious Excess in 1970s Paris''. New York: Little, Brown. p. 255. {{ISBN|978-0-316-76801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Palace Years==
Following the recommendation of then culture minister [[Michel Guy]], Emaer chose as his address the decrepit Palace Theater on rue Faubourg Montmartre which would allow him not just a huge [[disco]], but the accoutrements of a traditional theater space with stages and an enormous balcony.&lt;ref&gt;Balendras, Laurent. Nov 2008. "[http://labelenchanteur.blogspot.com/2008/11/cest-palace.html Ça, c’est Palace"] Labelenchanteur.blogspot.com. Retrieved on 2010-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the architecturally classified building, including the decor of the '30s, hired a huge team of party organizers and press people to promote the club, and brought [[Guy Cuevas]] as DJ from the Sept.

Again, he was met with success. The opening night, May 1, 1978, was packed. Clubgoers loved the music and Emaer's talent for creating a compelling crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Lestrade, Didier. Mars 99 "[http://paris70.free.fr/comportement80.htm Palace - comportement 80"] Têtu Magazine. Retrieved on 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt; At the entry, Emaer instructed [[Edwige]] and [[Paquita Paquin]] to choose an interesting mix of rich and poor, gay and straight, black and white, the bourgeois, even punk. Above all they looked for attitude and an interesting look.

The jetset followed Emaer from the Sept, along with thousands of others from Alain Pacadis of the newspaper Libération who frequently evoked [[le Palace]] and its regulars in his chronicles to young journalist [[Frédéric Mitterrand]], an unknown [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and the famous [[Paloma Picasso]] whose wedding celebration eventually became a Palace event.

Emaer's only misstep came in 1981 when he broke the taboo against meddling in French politics, and one night asked the crowd to vote for [[François Mitterrand]], who would become the first French President of the left in decades. 

Emaer had never hidden his political leanings. He was openly gay and at some point even described himself as a "homosexual militant" whose commercial activities helped to build a sense of community among French homosexuals. He offered a Sunday "Tea Dance" free for gay men, and used the theater's giant screen to call attention to Argentina's disappeared.

But Paquita Paquin in her memoir, "Twenty Years Without Sleeping," remembered that his direct call to vote for Mitterrand left many of the clubgoers appalled. A large number returned  their membership cards to "Privilege" the VIP lounge at the Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Paquin, Paquita (2005). ''Vingt ans sans dormir.'' Paris: Editions Denoël.  {{ISBN|978-2-207-25569-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That paired with the fading of disco, began to empty the club. By the time Emaer died of cancer two years later in 1983, Le Palace was struggling to fill its enormous dance floors.

==Epitaph==
Shortly before his death, Emaer commented, "I think that I have been rather successful in life. I am unhappy about only one thing: I have not earned any money..." &lt;ref&gt;Koymasky, Matt &amp; Andrej, [http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/bioe1/emaer01.html Famous LGBT People: Fabrice Emaer] Retrieved on 2010-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement rang true. While millions passed through his hands, Emaer regularly spent more than he pulled in, sinking millions in the renovation of the Palace, and spending tens of thousands on parties that were successes in terms of pleasure and attendance, but never quite returned their investments.

He is remembered, nevertheless, for creating these mythical clubs, especially [[le Palace]], which for its size and cultural impact continues to resonate in French society.&lt;ref&gt;Lestrade, Didier. Mars 99 "[http://paris70.free.fr/comportement80.htm Palace - comportement 80]" Têtu Magazine. Retrieved on 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Golden Awards''' (金视奖) was an award show presented by [[ntv7]] to recognise excellence in the production and performance of Malaysian Chinese television. The first awards show took place on 25 September 2010 at the [[Putrajaya International Convention Centre]] in [[Putrajaya]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntv7.com.my/goldenawards/images/goldenawards_logo.png ntv7.com.my]&lt;/ref&gt; and was hosted by Malaysian [[Cheryl Lee]] and Singaporean [[Bryan Wong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntv7.com.my/goldenawards/host-profile.asp ntv7.com.my]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 19 awards which will be presented at the first annual awards show. These awards are divided into three categories, namely Drama, non-Drama and Viewers' Choice.

The nominees for this awards show will be assessed by a judging panel consisting of experts within the Malaysian Chinese entertainment industry. All Malaysian Chinese television programmes qualify for nomination. Singapore-based Malaysian actors and actresses contracted to [[MediaCorp]] who have acted in co-productions are also eligible.

'''Home shopping''' is the electronic retailing and home [[shopping channel]]s industry, which includes such billion dollar television-based and e-commerce companies as [[Shop LC]], [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], [[The Jewellery Channel|TJC]], [[QVC]], [[eBay]], [[ShopHQ]], [[Buy.com]] and [[Amazon.com]], as well as traditional [[mail order]] and [[brick and mortar]] retailers as [[Hammacher Schlemmer]] and [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.]] Home shopping allows [[consumer]]s to shop for goods from the privacy of their own home, as opposed to traditional shopping, which requires one to visit brick and mortar [[Retailing|stores]] and [[shopping malls]].

There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from [[mail order|catalogs]]; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as [[periodical]]s, TV and radio); and [[online shopping]].

==History==
The possibility for merchants to show their goods through the world was the first usage of the "electroscope" (some kind of television apparatus) imagined by the author of the hoax published in the New York Sun, 30 March 1877.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.histv.net/electroscope-1878] "The Electroscope", ''The New York Sun'', 30 March 1877.&lt;/ref&gt;. First experiments appears in UK as soon as 1934. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.histv.net/le-monde-illustre] "La télévision permet d'acheter à distance", ''Le Monde illustré'', 17 novembre 1934 &lt;/ref&gt;

The home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when [[small market]] [[talk radio show]] host [[Bob Circosta]] was asked to sell [[avocado]]-[[green]]-colored [[can opener]]s live on the air by station owner [[Bud Paxson]], when an [[advertiser]] traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill.  Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first [[shopping channel]] on [[cable television]], later launching nationwide with the [[Home Shopping Network]] (rebranded as [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]]).  [[Bob Circosta]] was America's first ever TV [[home shopping host]],becoming one of the most instantly recognizable salesmen in the United States. Over the next three decades, Circosta sold over 75,000 different products on [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]], netted over 20,000 hours of live, on-air TV selling, and achieved personal product sales in excess of one billion dollars.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} (The story is disputed; there is some record of Paxson having unsuccessfully tried a similar format in 1969 on one of his earlier TV stations, [[WNYB|WNYP]] in [[Jamestown, New York]].)&lt;ref&gt;Fybush, Scott (January 12, 2015). [http://www.fybush.com/nerw-20150112/ Salary Controversy Ousts Public TV Exec]. ''NorthEast Radio Watch''. Retrieved January 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic television-based home shopping industry quickly became a major player in the retail industry. The two most successful shopping channels – [[Home Shopping Network|HSN]] and [[QVC]] – generate a combined total of over 10 billion dollars in sales every year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} And [[Jewelry Television]] is the largest gemstone retailer in the world. [4] Nigeria joins the league with the start of MoneyMart TV, Nigeria's first largest multi-retailer teleshopping mall broadcasting 24hours on satellite and terrestrial on AIT network, powered by Innovative Strategy International Limited owned by Will Dokpesi.

[[Amazon.com]] began as an online [[bookstore]] in 1994, created by [[Wall Street]] [[computer scientist]] [[Jeff Bezos]].  In addition to books, Amazon eventually added [[video games]], [[computer software]], [[electronics]], [[apparel]], and more to its sales repertoire.  The company now generates approximately eight-and-a-half billion dollars annually.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In Europe, more than 150 home shopping channels were identified in activity in February 2018 by the European Audiovisual Observatory. &lt;ref&gt; [http://mavise.obs.coe.int/channel?event=listing&amp;query_clauses={%22genre_id%22:%2212%22}] MAVISE database, European Audiovisual Observatory, retrieved 20 February 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct response==
[[Direct-response marketing]] is often considered to be a part of the home shopping/electronic retailing industry.  The [[Electronic Retailing Association]], when totaling the combined revenues from all the home shopping companies, estimates that in 2005, the industry generated over 320 billion dollars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}direct marketing is a marketing where buyers will give direct response to the sellers and seller will immediately take an order..

'''''I Come for to Sing''''' was a [[folk music]] [[revue]] performed by [[Chicago]] musicians and singers [[Win Stracke]], [[Big Bill Broonzy]] and [[Larry Lane]]. The program was narrated by [[Studs Terkel]]. ''I Come for to Sing'' ran successfully for more than ten years, touring colleges and clubs throughout the United States, with the bulk of the activity taking place in the Midwest. Most notably, the show ran for more than a year at the now defunct Chicago jazz club, [[The Blue Note (Chicago)|The Blue Note]].

In a 2007 article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Terkel remembered his years with ''I Come for to Sing'',

{{quote|In the late 1940s and early 50s, Win and I, plus Big Bill Broonzy and Larry Lane visited universities throughout the country. It was a program of folk songs  with different epochs. Win sang frontier ballads, Big Bill sang a black man's blues and Larry Lane sang Elizabethan ballads. I was the narrator. It was received with great amazement and enthusiasm. We often crossed paths with Pete Seeger and The Weavers, who were of course, masters of the milieu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-11-25/news/0711230245_1_folk-music-ballads-sang |title=Studs recalls how 1 man's dream became a reality |last=Terkel |first=Studs |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cast members rotated in and out over the years and included [[banjo]] player [[Fleming Brown]], [[pianist]] [[Chet Roble]] and other performers who happened to be available, but the format of the show remained constant. The narrator set the tone for the evening by reading some prose or poetry or adding commentary, and the musicians reflected on that theme by performing folk songs from different musical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/traditional-music/ency/s4.htm|title=Folk Encyclopedia, I come for to sing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is notable as the meeting place for the founders of the [[Old Town School of Folk Music]]. The Old Town School also published a folk magazine with the same name from 1975 to 1987.

'''Jiggle television''' is a term coined by [[NBC]] executive [[least objectionable program|Paul Klein]] to criticize [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television production and marketing strategy under [[Fred Silverman]].&lt;ref name="Jezierski" /&gt; Klein referred to ABC's programs as "[[pornography|porn]]" in order to tap into the 1970s [[moral panic]] and anxiety over the spread of pornography,&lt;ref name="Semonche" /&gt; using the [[neologism]] to describe the use of female television celebrities moving in loose clothing or [[underwear]] in a way in which their [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] could be seen to move, or "jiggle."&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991 |first=John |last=Algeo |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An American invention,&lt;ref name="point" /&gt; it was used to refer to programs such as ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Violent Femmes: Women As Spies in Popular Culture |first=Rosie |last=White |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' and ''[[Three's Company]]'',&lt;ref name="Semonche"&gt;Censoring Sex: A Historical Journey Through American Media.

The term was later taken to new extremes by the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s and early 2000s on such television shows as ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[She Spies]]'', and numerous [[USA Network]] series.

[[Image:Kick-to-kick.jpg|thumb|300px|The aftergame Kick-to-kick tradition at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is now a rare sight. Follows an AFL match between the Melbourne Demons and Port Adelaide Power, 16000 fans are let onto the turf.]]

'''Kick-to-kick''' is a [[pastime]] and well-known tradition of [[Australian rules football]] fans, and a recognised [[Australian slang|Australian term]] for kick and catch type games. In its "markers up" form, it is the usual casual version of Australian rules (similar to the relationship between [[backyard cricket|backyard/beach cricket]] and the established forms of [[cricket]]).

Although not a sport in itself, the term is used to describe a social exercise played in parks, fields, streets, back yards and also as a [[playground game]] that requires at least two people.&lt;ref name="Heavy"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=gPgQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=kick-to-kick&amp;pg=4324%2C1641558|title=Footy gets heavy, but the kick to kick lives on|last=Golightly|first=Earnest|date=3 April 1987|work=The Age|pages=1 &amp; 3|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kick-to-kick is used as a warm-up exercise of many Australian rules football clubs&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/Development/Coaching_Session_Activity_Plans.pdf AFL Auskick Manual]; AFL.com.au, p168&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the beginnings of many clubs in far-flung places. It has long been a [[pitch invasion]] tradition in the breaks immediately after official Australian rules football matches, although as professionalism in the [[Australian Football League]] increased, the practice was discontinued at most of AFL venues.&lt;ref name="SaturdayArvoFever "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/DiscoveryCentre/Infosheets/The-Melbourne-Story/Saturday-Arvo-Fever/|title=Saturday Arvo Fever|quote=It is only recently that crowds have been banned from running onto the field after a match for a game of kick-to-kick |accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal kick-to-kick==
The two players will space themselves about 15 metres or more apart and alternate kicking whilst the other [[mark (Australian football)|mark]]s.  Sometimes players will run and/or bounce when returning a long ball and experiment with different kicking styles, such as the [[drop punt]], [[torpedo punt]] or [[checkside punt]].  If goal posts are present, participants will often position themselves in front and behind the posts to practice scoring.  Kick-to-kick is often a family pastime and many footballers learned their skills in games of backyard kick-to-kick.  It has been suggested that informal kick-to-kick can assist in battling obesity in children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/08/1089000288503.html?from=storylhs Sports stars can help fight battle of bulge]; [[The Age]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
More formal kick-to-kick can involve multiple players, usually grouped in two bunches at either end for easier return of the ball, resulting in similar informal games, such as [[forcey backs]].  This type of play can include some play contesting, many Australian rules fans requiring a ''stepladder'' player to emulate the [[specky]] or spectacular mark seen on the football field,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goforyourlife.vic.gov.au/hav/articles.nsf/pages/Ball_or_outdoor_games?open#kick Ball or outdoor games]&lt;/ref&gt; often also heard crying out famous names of spectacular mark proponents such as ''[[Alex Jesaulenko|Jesaulenko]]'', ''[[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Ablett]]'' or ''[[Warwick Capper|Capper]]''.

==Origins of the pastime==
The ancient [[indigenous Australian]] game of [[Marn Grook]], which is believed by some to have influenced Australian rules football is similar in many ways to the modern varieties of the kick-to-kick pastime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/09/21/2039577.htm?section=australia Kids play kick to kick −1850s style] from abc.net.au&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Sean Fagan]] claims that the kick-to-kick tradition originates with rugby football in England, citing books from 1856 which make reference to the term "punt about", however although the sources mention kicking practice they do not indicate other participants catching or marking the ball or kicking it back.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rl1908.com/blog/kick-to-kick.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kick-to-kick type practice in other sports==
[[Rugby union]] and [[rugby league]] fans and players do not tend to participate in kick-to-kick as much as Australian rules football fans (primarily because kicking is a specialist technique in these sports; and because of variants of the codes that are playable on a small scale, such as [[touch football (rugby league)|touch football]]). [[Gaelic football]] and association football (soccer) fans also participate in a form of kick-to-kick with the round ball.

==References in popular culture==
Playing "Kick to kick football" is sometimes used by Australian rules fans as a derogatory term to describe uncontested, possession based style of play sometimes seen at the professional [[Australian Football League|AFL]] level, which many fans find boring and compare to non-contact sports such as basketball, and [[netball]].  This is because kick-to-kick does not generally involve any of the contesting found in an official game of Australian rules football, such as [[tackle (football move)|tackling]], [[bump (football)|bumping]], smothering (known as a "charge down" in rugby league), spoiling and other [[One percenter (Australian football)|one percenters]] which often result in more unpredictable change of possession.

Rock band [[TISM]] featured a song titled "'And The Ass Said to the Angel: "Wanna Play Kick To Kick?'" on the album [[Great Truckin' Songs of the Renaissance]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-ma-an11284770 Music Australia listing of Great truckin' songs of the Renaissance] by [[This Is Serious Mum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Leunig]] painted "Street Football" in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationaltreasures.nla.gov.au/index/Treasures/item/nla.int-ex4-s7 Michael Leunig’s Street Football]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastime inspired a short film named "Kick to Kick" by Tony McNamara in 2000.

[[Auskick]] in 2007 used the kick-to-kick tradition as part of their promotional television campaign, which shows kids from around the country kicking the football to each other to the tune of [[Gimme dat Thang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalwork.com.au/kick2kick/ NAB Auskick Kick2Kick promotion]&lt;/ref&gt;

| ShortSummary = After another "Humanoid Typhoon" incident, this time in Felnarl, Vash is tracked and captured by a group of thugs looking to collect the $$60 billion bounty on his head. He's also being tracked down by a pair of investigators, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson from the Bernardelli Insurance Society, and by a bounty hunter named Loose Ruth. Due to the inconsistency in rumors surrounding Vash The Stampede, the bounty hunters confuse each other for the Stampede, and Vash, Meryl, and Milly are able to escape. However, Meryl and Milly must go back, as their duty is to watch over Vash and make sure he doesn't cause any more damage that affects their company.

They stop by the Cesar Mansion to ask about the whereabouts of Vash the Stampede, where they discover that Vash is already there, acting as a bodyguard for Cliff Cesar, a man who has monopolozed and sells the water in town. Vash was hired to protect a young lady named Maryann, the granddaughter of a wealthy entrepreneur. After finding out that Cliff is being threatened by a blonde man with a large silver gun, Meryl and Milly decide to stay at the mansion to find out if the man is Vash. During their stay, it quickly becomes apparent that Maryann is not what she seems.

After disposing safely of the bandits who attacked him, the citizens of the city decide solemnly that they need the bounty to save their dying plant. The citizens themselves end up destroying most of the city in pursuit of Vash the Stampede and the $$60 billion on his head. They even hire the infamous father-and-son team of Professor and Gofsef Nebraska just to catch him, which only leads to more destruction. Meryl finally accepts (with great dismay) that the strange man they've been inadvertently following is the real Vash the Stampede.

===Theme songs===
; Opening : "H.T." written and arranged by [[Tsuneo Imahori]].
; Ending : "Wind Blows to the Future" (風は未来に吹く ''Kaze wa Mirai ni Fuku'') written, composed, arranged, and sung by [[Akima &amp; Neos]].
; Character development : "Sound Life" by Tsuneo Imahori - associated with the character of Rem, and by extension Vash's early life. It is a story of the development of a world, starting on the first evening and ending on the eighth morning (something like the Bible story of creation). The final verse of the song (in Japanese) is: ''Saa...atarashii sora ni subete wo shirushita kumikyoku ga hibiku'', which translates to "Well then...A song that has recorded everything echoes to the new sky." The song has been on the planet for as long as humans have.

==Games==
A video game, ''Trigun: The Planet Gunsmoke'', was announced in 2002 by [[Sega]], but little news has been heard since.

Canadian company [[Guardians of Order]] released a hardbound [[role-playing game]] (RPG) book in December 2003 based on the ''Trigun'' TV series. This was not a self-contained RPG rulebook, but worked with the company's [[Big Eyes, Small Mouth|BESM]] anime RPG rule set. The book contains summaries of all 26 episodes of the TV series, along with character profiles, animation model sheets, production sketches, and color images from the series.

'''''Little Nicky''''' is a 2000 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Steven Brill (director)|Steven Brill]]. It stars [[Adam Sandler]] as Nicky, one of [[Satan]]'s three sons as he attempts to save his father and prevent his brothers from taking over Earth.

The film was a financial failure and received negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The story revolves around a struggle to determine which of [[Satan]]'s three sons will succeed their father ([[Harvey Keitel]]) as ruler of [[Hell]]. Adrian ([[Rhys Ifans]]) is the most devious, Cassius ([[Tom Lister, Jr.|Tom "Tiny" Lister, Jr.]]) is the cruelest, and Nicky ([[Adam Sandler]]) is their father's favorite. Adrian and Cassius claim that Nicky's mother is a goat and torment him by [[Psychokinesis|controlling his body with their minds]]. Nicky has had a speech impediment and a disfigured jaw since Cassius hit him in the face with a shovel.

Having been the [[Prince of Darkness (Satan)|Prince of Darkness]] for ten thousand years, the [[Devil]] assembles his sons to decide which of them will succeed him; he tells them that they are not ready yet, having decided to keep his throne. Angered by this decision, Adrian and Cassius go to Earth to create a new Hell by possessing religious and political leaders in [[New York City]]. As they leave, they freeze the entrance to Hell, preventing more souls from entering and causing Satan's body to begin decomposing. To stop Adrian and Cassius, Satan sends Nicky to Earth with a silver flask that traps whoever drinks from it inside.

At first, Nicky has trouble staying alive on Earth. He is killed several times, landing in Hell and returning to New York each time.  While learning how to eat and sleep, he meets a talking bulldog named Mr. Beefy (voice of [[Robert Smigel]]), rents an apartment with an actor named Todd ([[Allen Covert]]), and falls in love with a design student named Valerie ([[Patricia Arquette]]).

Nicky's first encounter with his brothers occurs when Adrian sees him with Valerie, takes mental control of his body, and makes him scare her away. Then Nicky sees Cassius on television, possessing the referee of a [[Harlem Globetrotters|Globetrotters]] game. When he goes to the court and tricks Cassius into the flask, [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] John ([[Jonathan Loughran]]) and Peter ([[Peter Dante]]) are so thrilled with his performance that they become his devoted fans. That evening, Nicky tries to apologize to Valerie. The meeting goes badly at first, but she accepts him after he explains who he is and why he is on Earth.

The next day, Adrian possesses the Chief of the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] ([[Michael McKean]]) and accuses Nicky of [[mass murder]]. Not knowing what to do, Nicky has Todd kill him so he can go back to Hell and ask his father for advice, but his father has trouble hearing because his ears have fallen off, and his assistants are in a panic because the midnight deadline to capture Adrian and Cassius is only hours away. Back on Earth again, Nicky and his friends devise a plan to capture Adrian in a subway station, but Adrian discovers their trick. In the ensuing fight, Adrian grabs Valerie and dives onto the track as a train approaches, but Nicky throws her out of the way, leaving himself and Adrian to be killed by the train.

Arriving in Hell just minutes before midnight, Adrian begins the process of taking over Hell by pushing what remains of his father aside and sitting on the throne, rising to [[Central Park]], and starting a riotous party. Meanwhile, Nicky wakes up in [[Heaven]] as a reward for sacrificing himself and meets his mother ([[Reese Witherspoon]]), an angel who tells him he can defeat Adrian with the Inner Light he inherited from her. After she gives him a mysterious orb, he goes to Central Park. Adrian appears to win a pitched battle by locking Nicky in the flask and turning himself into a bat, but Nicky escapes from the flask. When he shatters the orb, [[Ozzy Osbourne]] appears, bites Adrian's head off, and spits it into the flask.

With his brothers captured, Nicky is ready to save his father. After he sins to make sure he goes to Hell, he and Valerie express their love for each other and she kills him. In Hell, Satan regains his body and recommends that Nicky go back to Earth. The film ends a year later, when Nicky and Valerie live in New York with their infant son.

'''Location scouting''' is a vital  process in the [[pre-production]] stage of [[filmmaking]] and [[commercial photography]].&lt;ref name="LongSchenk2002"&gt;{{cite book

'''Location scouts''' also look for generally spectacular or interesting locations beforehand, to have a database of locations in case of requests.&lt;ref name="Markow1999"&gt;{{cite book

Location scouts often negotiate legal access to filming locations.

== Location requirements ==
Suitability of a location to the task at hand takes into consideration many factors, including:
*overall [[aesthetic]]
*financial cost to [[Film production|production]]
*[[Logistics|logistic]] feasibility including but not limited to distance from base of operations or other locations scheduled
*availability of parking and facilities to keep crew and talent (principal [[actor]]s or models and [[Extra (actor)|extras]]) safe and dry at all times
*availability of electrical power or feasibility of bringing in generators for lights and electrical equipment.
*available light (indoors or outdoors) and weather conditions (outdoors)
*permission from and cooperation of location owner and neighbors, local government and law enforcement

==Work process==
Typically ideas for what a [[filming location]] should or could be are discussed between production department and locations department (it could be at this point that the locations department is actually created), then research is begun to actually find and document that location using location scout(s).
 
The location scouts and other Locations Department staff (see below), working under the supervision of the [[Location Manager]], generally strive to provide as many potentially useful/viable ideas and/or options as possible for review by production; often the Assistant Director, Production Manager and subsequently, the Director or even the Executive Producer in the case of narrative filmmaking.

Once a consensus on locations with the most potential is reached, arrangements are normally made for some of the heads of the other Production Departments to tour those location(s) to confirm suitability. This tour is commonly called a "tech scout", "[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=reconnoiter recce]" or "go-see".

During this time the Locations Department (most likely the Location Manager in situations requiring the most responsibility) will have contacted and begun negotiation with internal and external parties that may affect ability to film at the location. This is known as "clearing the location": investigating and confirming availability and fees to be paid to a location owner or agent, obtaining a certificate of [[insurance]], obtaining any needed [[Filming_Permit|film permits]] (may involve fees). Also, there might be distribution of "resident letters" or "filming notifications". These are notices to neighbors, advising them of intent to film in the area (often a local requirement). These steps result in "locking down": making sure that all details and existing or potential issues are addressed. While it is the Locations Department's job to anticipate and minimize problems associated with a location, it is also the Locations Department's duty to advise other Production Department heads of intractable problems that need consideration so contingencies can be planned. This may lead to a decision to use an alternate location. This might involve additional planning and budget allocation for additional location scouting.

==Change management==
Production events involving the Location Department and its personnel can occur very quickly and quite often, the requirements themselves, ''i.e.'', script rewrite(s), creative concept change(s), of a location itself can change [[on the fly]]. More often than not, multiple locations associated with multiple scenes in production are involved; under some circumstances, a busy and resourceful [[freelancer]] or Locations Department Staffer could be involved in multiple projects simultaneously.

==Problem solving==
Solving location problems can be challenging, requiring hard work for long hours, keen [[communication skills]], focus, ability to "think on one's feet" or "[[Human multitasking|multitasking]]", take action quickly and responsibly as well as using technical skills. Familiarity with local resources and a network of capable support are needed.

==Booking a site==
After completing all the steps above, if a location is still viable and available, it is confirmed (booked). Usually a contract is signed by all parties, and a property release is obtained: a written, signed permission from the property owner or agent allowing photography of and public depiction via media (''i.e.'', broadcast, video, film, print publication). 

Once a location is booked, there are very few reasons for filming to not commence as planned. At this point many man-hours of paid production work and considerable amounts of money for location fees and/or permits have been invested in the chosen location. A change of creative concept at this stage or glitch of any kind (such as property owner cancellation) is potentially costly, and legal action is a possible consequence. Also, if production misrepresents itself regarding its activities, intended use of the location, damages the property or negligently causes other problems for the property owner, the property owner may seek remedy in any of many forms available, including legal action.

==Consideration of weather==
Local weather conditions can figure heavily into a location's viability and affect many areas of production scheduling, so contingencies and alternate, budgetary-efficient plans should be made well in advance of any shoot day with a possibility to be affected by weather. A location with potential to be affected by weather should always be cleared and placed, in advance, with the property owner's understanding and consent "on weather hold" or under the condition that production will only confirm use of the location and commence photography pending viable weather conditions. The aim, in addition to the obvious goal of attaining the correct aesthetic for the shot in acceptable and safe working conditions is also geared toward providing greater flexibility of crew scheduling, equipment, vehicle, etc. rentals and other production aspects and minimize inconvenience to the owner and in the event of cancellation or postponement by production due to weather, eliminate or minimize cancellation fees as may be part of an agreement between production and the location.

==Locations for various media==
In addition to [[feature films]] and [[short films]], [[television commercials]] and [[television shows]], [[documentary films]], [[corporate]] [[video]], [[Printing|print]] [[advertising]] [[photography]], [[editorial]] [[photography]] and even [[event planning]] all have the possibility to employ location scouts to find and photograph locations for their productions. 

The methods employed are much the same as for feature film production, but the processes often differ in some ways:

Turn around times are generally shorter and the decision making is shared between production, the [[film director|director]]/[[photographer]] and the [[advertising agency]] or even the end client. A weekly broadcast television show may have significant deadline challenges for obvious reasons.

Often the decision makers are geographically dispersed, which may explain why commercial and print scouts have been early adopters of online presentations and other digital technologies.

== Additional duties ==
The Locations Department's duties  often extend beyond pre-production and into actual production as well as after filming at the location has completed; a Location Manager and/or other Locations Department members are often needed during actual shooting and at wrap to be a general point of internal contact for matters related to the Locations Department such as ensuring smooth crew movement to and from the location, answering locations-related questions/ solving misc problems as may arise, coordinating crowd control and as an external point of contact between production and such parties as perhaps the property owner, neighbors, local [http://afci.org film office]/government and law enforcement.

Locations Department personnel are always the last crew to leave a location and the credo is to leave the location in the same (if not better) condition than it was found.

==Job titles and job descriptions==
A film crew might have the following titled positions staffed in regard to the Locations Department. Many of the positions often "cross over" or a member of the department might "wear several hats":

;Location Manager
Oversees the Locations Department and its staff, typically reporting directly to the Production Manager and/or Assistant Director (or even Director and/or Executive Producer). Location Manager is responsible for final clearing (or guaranteeing permission to use) a location for filming and must often assist Production/Finance Dept(s) in maintaining budget management regarding actual location/permit fees as well as labor costs to production for himself and the Locations Department at large.

;Assistant Location Manager
Works with the Location Manager and the various departments in arranging technical scouts for the essential staff (grips, electric, camera, etc.) to see options which the Location Manager has selected for filming.  The Assistant Location Manager will be onset during the filming process to oversee the operation, whereas the Location Manager continues preproduction from elsewhere (generally an office) on the upcoming locations.  (Note: On most location-based television shows, there will be two Assistant Location Managers that alternate episodes, allowing one to prep an upcoming episode while the other is on set with the current one.)

;Location Scout
Does much of the actual research, footwork and photography to document location possibilities. Often the Location Manager will do some scouting themselves, as well as the Assistant Location Manager.

;Location Researcher/Coordinator
On a large film crew someone might be assigned exclusively to do research work for the Locations Department, freeing the Location Scout(s) to concentrate on photographing location possibilities or other tasks. This person's job might be to do internet or public library research and contact resources to assess said resource's interest in being involved in the film project and if such interest exists, the location researcher might be responsible for setting up an appointment for a location scout to go there.

;Location Assistant
Hired by the Location Manager to be on-set before, during, and after the filming process.  General responsibilities can include arriving first at the location to allow the set dressers into the set for preparation; maintaining the cleanliness of the location areas during filming (on larger budget projects this can include securing and supervising a contract clean-up crew or assigning such duties to a set PA); limiting the impact of a working production crew on the location grounds; fielding complaints from neighbors; and ultimately, at the end of the filming, managing on-set time and crew with regard to the closure of the location within contractually-permitted time constraints.  There are generally one to three assistants on a shoot at any given time.

;Location Production Assistant
This position exists generally on larger budget productions.  The Locations PA is the assistant who is almost never onset, but instead is always "prepping" a location or "wrapping" a location.  That is, when a location requires several days of set up and breakdown prior and following the day(s) of filming.

;Parking Coordinator
Typically hired by Location Manager on an as-need basis to supervise Parking Staff in order to secure and coordinate crew parking including equipment trucks and personal vehicles. Locations Department and Parking Department might work together with local law enforcement to coordinate traffic control if the scene being filmed involves roadway right-of-way in any way.

;Parking Staff
Parking Staff hang up the brightly colored signs that declare No Parking and then sit in their cars (with an orange cone on the top) to ensure that no one parks in the coned off areas.

;Waste Removal
Location Department's disposition is to be the last to depart a location upon wrap and to leave the location in exactly if not better condition as it existed upon arrival. A waste removal company might be hired on an as-need basis.

==Methods==
A location scout typically takes descriptive, [[panoramic photography|panoramic photographs]] or video of location possibilities. A good location scout will make  photos of a location possibility that reflect the aesthetic goals of the production and will also include visually descriptive utilitarian photography and information in his presentation, documenting much more than just what will potentially appear onscreen.

Additional descriptive information might include (as might be relevant):
*Reverse/alternate angle (photographing ''toward'' where camera might be), panoramic photography, to show space available for camera, lighting, video assist, hair and makeup (and clients on a commercial shoot)
*Geographic coordinates, compass directions, other map data as may be applicable
*Ambient lighting conditions at various times of day (or night), solar data, ''i.e.'', angle of sun at different times of day
*Photos of holding/staging areas and available parking and/or parking restriction signage
*Hand sketches of street/building layout(s), building/room floor plan(s), room or area dimension data
*Crew/vehicle access data, ''i.e.'', doorways, hallways, elevators, stairs, availability and information of personnel needed for access
*Notes regarding ambient sound conditions
*On the shoot day, if a set is to be "dressed" ([[Theatrical property|props]]/furniture added or (re)moved), Locations Department and/or Art Department/[[Property master|Property Master]] Staff/Prop Stylist will photograph the specific areas to be affected so as to assure that the location will be returned to its original state once filming is completed.

'''Nowcom''' ({{kosdaq|026330}}) founded in 1994, was a Korean IT Company. Effective 2011, this corporate entity changed its name to '''AfreecaTV Co., Ltd''' ({{kosdaq|067160}}) after the AfreecaTV Co.,Ltd-ZettaMedia split.

The first service of Nowcom in South Korea was ''Nownuri'' which is VT-based online BBS started in 1994 and currently they operate ''[[Afreeca]]'', ''[[TalesRunner]]'', ''O2Jam'' and ''[[ClubBox]]'' as well as ''Nownuri''.

Nowcom was merged by '''[[Wins Technet]]''', a listed IT company, at January 2008 and listed on [[KOSDAQ]] with its original name though and worked together for 3 years, but finally they have been separated again to two companies as they were. Nowcom is still listed on KOSDAQ.

On July 2011, Nowcom announced that its assets would be split into one publicly traded company and the other privately held company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zettamedia.co.kr/app/noticeView.php?b_no=5&amp;pageNo=1&lt;/ref&gt; Another firm known as '''ZettaMedia''' was also established at that date and is a new spin-off company created during the split.

On July 2011, Nowcom announced that, after concerns from business differences between AfreecaTV and ClubBox, Nowcom's assets would be split into one publicly traded company, one oriented towards webcasting and online game development, and the other privately held company towards contents, media,and web storage. The split formally took place on July, 2011; where the present Nowcom was renamed AfreecaTV Co., Ltd. and consists primarily of ''[[Afreeca]]'', ''[[TalesRunner]]'', and ''O2Jam'', while a new ZettaMedia was formed to take on ''[[Nownuri]]'', PDBox, and ''[[ClubBox]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ddaily.co.kr/news/news_view.php?uid=77943 |title=Nowcom Will Create "ZettaMedia" for Web Storage Business|publisher=Digital Daily|date=2011-05-13  |accessdate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''online deliberation''''' describes the emerging field of practice and research related to the design, implementation and study of [[Deliberation|deliberative]] processes that rely on the use of electronic [[information and communications technologies]] (ICT).

Online deliberation is a relatively new field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Todd |last2=Chandler |first2=Reid |editor-last= |editor-first= |title=Democracy in Motion |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2012 |pages=113 |chapter=Chapter 6: Online Deliberation Design |isbn=978-0-19-989928-9 |lastauthoramp=y |quote=Online deliberation is a relatively new field. Although the concept of public deliberation via electronic means was discussed as early as the 1970s,&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; and there was some early empirical work on deliberation online in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; studies of structured or public online deliberation appear to have begun with work by Stephen Coleman and colleagues,&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; Lincoln Dahlberg,&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and Vincent Price&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; around a decade ago. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online deliberation is very interdisciplinary, and includes practices such as [[online consultation]], [[e-participation]], [[E-government|e-governmen]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yildiz|first=Mete|title=E-government research: Reviewing the literature, limitations, and ways forward|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2007.01.002|journal=Government Information Quarterly|volume=24|issue=3|pages=646–665|doi=10.1016/j.giq.2007.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[E-government|t]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Daniel|last2=Gibbs|first2=Jennifer|date=2013-05-01|title=Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation?

Work in all these endeavors is tied together by the challenge of using electronic media in a way that deepens thinking and improves mutual understanding.

Open international conferences on online deliberation have been held at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 2003, [[Stanford University]] in 2005, and the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2008. The most recent conference was held at the [[University of Leeds]], June 30 – July 2, 2010.  Attendees of the 2005 conference voted to create an international society for online deliberation, but no formal organization has yet been established.  Other events of interest have been sponsored by the Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deliberative-democracy.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=279 Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Over the past few decades, scholars across research traditions and areas have commonly identified at least two aspects in their definitions of [[deliberation]]: (1) a form of communication characterized by "the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough group discussion";&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkhalter|first=Stephanie|last2=Gastil|first2=John|last3=Kelshaw|first3=Todd|date=2002-11-01|title=A Conceptual Definition and Theoretical Model of Public Deliberation in Small Face?to?Face Groups|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/12/4/398-422/4110430|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=398–422|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2002.tb00276.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (2) the idea that individuals involved in this process of communication carefully weigh arguments and reasons for and against some propositions posed by others in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gastil|first=John|date=2000|title=Is face-to-face citizen deliberation a luxury or a necessity?|url=|journal=Political Communication|volume=17|pages=357–361|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schudson|first=Michael|date=1997|title=Why conversation is not the soul of democracy|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15295039709367020|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|volume=14|pages=297–309|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be considered deliberative discussion, argue scholars, the communication and the involved interactants' behavior has to meet criteria established by the principles of political equality and egalitarian reciprocity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24067411|title=Democracy and deliberation : new directions for democratic reform|last=S.|first=Fishkin, James|date=1991|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300051636|location=New Haven|oclc=24067411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Habermas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18327374|title=The structural transformation of the public sphere : an inquiry into a category of bourgeois society|last=Jürgen,|first=Habermas,|isbn=9780262081801|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=18327374}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliberation is "an interchange of rational–critical arguments among a group of individuals, triggered by a common or public problem, whose main focus or topic of discussion is to find a solution acceptable to all who have a stake in the issue".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Halpern and Gibbs define deliberation as "a particular sort of discussion between at least two individuals in which (1) the form of communication emphasizes the use of logic and reasoning instead of power or coercion, (2) this reasoned engagement focuses on a social or political issue through which participants are able to identify solutions to a common problem, and (3) individuals are open to opinions and ideas expressed by others, and at the same time the communication between them is governed by rules of equality, symmetry and civility".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Stroud and colleagues noted that many definitions of deliberation "share the basic idea that deliberation involves people exchanging views on a matter of public importance in a respectful manner, reasoning through their claims, and listening to the perspectives of others".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Natalie Jomini|last2=Scacco|first2=Joshua M.|last3=Muddiman|first3=Ashley|last4=Curry|first4=Alexander L.|date=2015-03-01|title=Changing Deliberative Norms on News Organizations' Facebook Sites|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/2/188-203/4067559|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=188–203|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of the Internet and subsequently Web 2.0-based applications and especially [[social media]] have fostered discursive participation and deliberation online through [[computer-mediated communication]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Implications for democracy ==

=== Advantages ===
Political deliberation is critical to societal consensus-building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheufele|first=Dietram|last2=Nisbet|first2=Matthew|date=2002|title=Being a citizen online: New opportunities and dead ends|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1081180x0200700304|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|volume=7|pages=55–75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online deliberation can have positive implications for the democracy. Research has found that social media can enhance civic participation and democratic decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lerman|first=K.|date=November 2007|title=User Participation in Social Media: Digg Study|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4427583/|journal=2007 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conferences on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology - Workshops|pages=255–258|doi=10.1109/wi-iatw.2007.68|arxiv=0708.2414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=A.|date=January 2004|title=Characterizing e-participation in policy-making|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1265300/|journal=37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004. Proceedings of the|pages=10 pp.–|doi=10.1109/hicss.2004.1265300}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, online spaces allow for more equal and decentralized communication as numerous users from diverse backgrounds connect. Participants have equal opportunities to express opinions, raise questions, and exchange information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Davy|last2=Kies|first2=Raphaël|date=2005-09-01|title=Online Forums and Deliberative Democracy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500115|journal=Acta Politica|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=317–335|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500115|issn=0001-6810}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, online tools constitute a more favorable channel for users to engage in rational-critical debate than traditional synchronous channels because users are able to compose messages at their own pace and will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahlberg|first=Lincoln|date=2001-10-01|title=Computer-Mediated Communication and The Public Sphere: A Critical Analysis|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/4584246|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=0–0|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00137.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, the written and asynchronous features of online deliberation enable more reflexive, rational and argumentative conversations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444314861.ch8/summary|title=The Handbook of Internet Studies|last=Stromer-Galley|first=Jennifer|last2=Wichowski|first2=Alexis|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781444314861|editor-last=Consalvo|editor-first=Mia|pages=168–187|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444314861.ch8|editor-last2=Ess|editor-first2=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
Researchers have questioned the utility of online deliberation as an extension of the [[public sphere]], declining the idea that online deliberation is no less beneficial than face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Computer-mediated discourse is deemed impersonal, and is found to encourage [[online incivility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesler|first=Sara|last2=Siegel|first2=Jane|last3=McGuire|first3=Timothy W.|title=Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.39.10.1123|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=39|issue=10|pages=1123–1134|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.39.10.1123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, users who participate in online discussions about politics are found to make comments only in groups that agree with their own views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38879177|title=The web of politics : the internet's impact on the American political system|last=1955-|first=Davis, Richard,|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195114841|location=New York|oclc=38879177}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the possibility that online deliberation mainly promotes [[motivated reasoning]] and reinforces preexisting attitudes.

== Quality of Online Deliberation ==

=== Deliberative Norms ===
In the context of new media environment, researchers have evaluated the quality of online discourse based on criteria such as the presence of civility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2004|title=Democracy online: Civility, politeness, and the democratic potential of online political discussion groups|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=6|pages=259–283|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; relevance,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; genuine questions, and evidence to determine if the discourse meets the deliberative norms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruiz|first=Carlos|last2=Domingo|first2=David|last3=Lluís Micó|first3=Josep|last4=Díaz-Noci|first4=Javier|last5=Meso|first5=Koldo|last6=Masip|first6=Pere|date=2011|title=Public Sphere 2.0? The Democratic Qualities of Citizen Debates in Online Newspapers|url=|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|volume=16|pages=463–487|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors Influencing online deliberation ===
In the context of comments posted to online news sites, the presence of a recognizable journalist engaging with commenters has been found to be associated with improved quality of deliberation with reduced incivility and increased evidence-based discourse, as compared with when no one engages with commenters or when an unidentified staff member from the news organization engages with commenters.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Discussions surrounding news of health or abortion topics are more relevant but with fewer genuine questions posed than news of topics on education, crimes or guns, and economy. News of education topics has less uncivil and more relevant comments than the other news topics. People provide less evidence in their discourse when discussing news of economy topics as compared to the other news topics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Group size, volume of communication, interactivity between participants, message characteristics, and social media characteristics have also been found to impact online deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eveland|first=William P|last2=Hively|first2=Myiah Hutchens|date=2009-06-01|title=Political Discussion Frequency, Network Size, and "Heterogeneity" of Discussion as Predictors of Political Knowledge and Participation|url=https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/59/2/205-224/4098354|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=59|issue=2|pages=205–224|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01412.x|issn=0021-9916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Online Political Deliberation ==
Deliberation can be defined as being the "act of thinking about or discussing something and deciding carefully" by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. In an online political setting, however, it is more complicated than only reaching a decision. Members need to contribute material with an intent for it to be discussed and responded to by others. Participants of online deliberation need to diligently analyze, review, and present the sources of their findings before any decisions can be made. A consensus has to be reached among members of which material to use based on relevancy and quality, and ability to accurately resolve the issue of which they are trying to find a solution to.

Generally, participation in online deliberation forums has been low. This is an issue because representativity is poor and can be swayed towards meeting the wishes of those that participate, consisting of those who are well-educated, and so forth. There is also the possibility that the issues wouldn't even be considered if turnout remains so low. Low levels of influence not only repel legislative bodies, but also potential participants. However, large participation levels present the chance that members are beginning to solely chat on topics, not fully read and evaluate others' inputs. If a forum is deliberate and goal-oriented, and those who participate are forced to have to go through processes to get their opinions out, those who wish to simply chatter will be filtered out, and the forums will be left only with those seriously interested and involved in finding a solution, as explored by Cyril Velikanov in his "Mass Online Deliberation" paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velikanov|first=Cyril|title=Mass Online Deliberation|url=https://www.academia.edu/12031548/Mass_Online_Deliberation|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participatory Factors ===
Online deliberation Internet forums require participants to be able to work together comfortably in order to make the best possible deliberations. In order to do that, as Beth Noveck has put it, forums need to establish "physics" for groups, or rules and regulations have to follow in order for members to feel comfortable with one another.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wiki Government: How Technology Can Make Government Better, Democracy Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful|last=Noveck|first=Beth|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once comfort is achieved, the environment groups are now in are their "culture," and healthy conversations can now be made. Since participants do not communicate face-to-face, visual queues often make groups more self-aware. For instance, green and red lights can be implemented for when members speak, and therefore the group can visualize if a member isn't participating or involved, or if a member is ''too'' involved. This way, imbalances in groups can be avoided, such as gridlocked situations or communication flaws.

=== Work Management ===
Systems of "chunking work," or, members self-selecting roles to play in their groups, help to keep work high quality and manageable.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Collaboration becomes easier when people choose the way they want to work in whatever way suits them. When members select the method of working that is comfortable to them, they are more likely to remain interested in their subject and produce quality content for their group. If Internet forums can find a way to divide work in a way that members are most comfortable, their outcomes will be better produced.

=== Rating Systems ===
Rating systems are valuable to Internet forums because they police both participants and the content they produce to ensure quality material. If members can rate each other based on their collaboration or work produced, then they can more easily trust those who have high ratings to have quality product. The forums themselves can also see these ratings and be able to filter out inappropriate, irrelevant, or low-quality content. Members policing each other forces the members to be cautious and aware about the information they put out. Ratings help to regulate and organize the sites on a large scale, making it easier to sift through content even if there are large amounts of it.

[[Newspaper]]s, often published daily or weekly, are, strictly speaking, a separate category of [[Serial (publishing)|serial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_N.aspx?#newspaper |title=Newspaper |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=ABC-Clio |date= |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_S.aspx?#serial |title=Serial |work=ODLIS — Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science |publisher=ABC-Clio |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of periodicals are [[newsletter]]s, [[literary magazine]]s (literary journals), [[academic journal]]s (including [[scientific journal]]s), [[List of science magazines|science magazine]]s, [[yearbook]]s and [[comic book]]s.

==Volumes and issues==
These examples are typically published and referenced by [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] and issue. ''Volume'' typically refers to the number of years the publication has been circulated, and ''issue'' refers to how many times that periodical has been published during that year.  For example, the April 2011 publication of a monthly magazine first published in 2002 would be listed as, "volume 10, issue 4".  [[Roman numerals]] are sometimes used in reference to the volume number.

When [[Citation|citing]] a work in a periodical, there are standardized formats such as ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''. In the latest edition of this style, a work with volume number 17 and issue number 3 may be written as follows:

* James M. Heilman, and Andrew G. West. "Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language." ''Journal of Medical Internet Research'' 17, no. 3 (2015). doi:10.2196/jmir.4069.

==Popular and scholarly==
[[File:Cover of Science in School 32.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''Science in School'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cover of Science in School 32|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/ann15057a/|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Periodicals can be classified into two types: popular and scholarly. Popular periodicals are usually magazines (e.g., ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''). [[academic journal|Scholarly journal]]s are most commonly found in libraries and databases. Examples are ''[[The Journal of Psychology]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Social Work]]''.

[[Trade magazine]]s are also examples of periodicals. They are written for an audience of professionals in the world. As of the early 1990s, there were over 6,000 business, technical, academic, scientific, and trade publications in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last= Blake |author1-link= Gary Blake |first2= Robert W. |last2= Bly |author2-link= Robert W. Bly |last-author-amp= yes |title= The Elements of Technical Writing |page= 113. |location= New York |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]] |year= 1993 |isbn= 0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indefinite vs. part-publication==
These examples are related to the idea of an indefinitely continuing cycle of production and publication: magazines plan to continue publishing, not to stop after a predetermined number of editions. A novel, in contrast, might be published in monthly parts, a method revived after the success of ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bl.uk/collections/early/victorian/pu_novel.html |work= Aspects of the Victorian Book |title= The Novel |via= The British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is called '''part-publication''', particularly when each part is from a whole work, or a [[Serial (literature)|serial]], for example in [[comic book]]s. It flourished during the nineteenth century, for example with [[Abraham John Valpy]]'s ''Delphin Classics'', and was not restricted to [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Simon |last1= Eliot |first2= Jonathan |last2= Rose |last-author-amp=yes |title= A Companion to the History of the Book |year= 2007 |page= 297}}{{full citation needed|date= February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard numbers==
The [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN) is to serial publications (and by extension, periodicals) what the [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN) is to books: a standardized reference number.

==Distribution==
Postal services often carry periodicals at a preferential rate; for example, Second Class Mail in the United States only applies to publications issued at least quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.answers.com/topic/second-class-mail |title= Second Class Mail |work= Barron's Business Dictionary |via= Answers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pi Day''' is an annual celebration of the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}} (pi)]]. Pi Day is observed on [[March 14]] (3/14 in the ''month/day'' [[date format|format]]) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three [[Significant figures|significant digits]] of {{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/13/pi-day-celebration-maths-fans-language-memory-contests|title=Pi Day 2015: a sweet treat for maths fans|last=Bellos|first=Alex|website=theguardian.com|date=March 14, 2015|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/514543?programid=412 Program on Sveriges Radio – Swedish national radio company] Read March 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[United States House of Representatives]] supported the designation of Pi Day.&lt;ref name=HORRes&gt;United States.

'''Pi Approximation Day''' is observed on [[July 22]] (22/7 in the ''day/month'' format), since the [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] {{frac|22|7}} is a common [[Approximations of π|approximation of {{pi}}]], which is accurate to two decimal places and dates from [[Archimedes]].&lt;ref name=VerizonTodayInHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Pi Approximation Day is celebrated today.|url=http://www.thinkfinity.org/2010-07-22_pi-approximation-day|work=Today In History|publisher=Verizon Foundation|accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a [[non-binding resolution]] ([[wikisource:H. RES. 224 Supporting the designation of Pi Day, and for other purposes|111 H. Res. 224]]),&lt;ref name=HORRes /&gt; recognizing March 14, 2009 as National Pi Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The entire month of March 2014 (3/14) was observed by some as "Pi Month".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/article/science/its-not-just-pi-day-its-pi-month |title=It's Not Just Pi Day, It's Pi Month! |last=Main |first=Douglas |date=March 14, 2014 |publisher=Popular Science |access-date=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/events/1774 |title=Pi Month Celebration &amp; Circle of Discovery Award Presentation &amp;#124; College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences |publisher=Cmns.umd.edu |date=March 11, 2014 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as "Super Pi Day".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2015/03/14/happy-super-pi-day-heres-how-to-celebrate/&lt;/ref&gt; It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format.

== Observance ==
Pi Day has been observed in many ways, including eating [[pie]], [[pieing|throwing pies]] and discussing the significance of the number {{pi}}, due to a [[pun]] based on the words "pi" and "pie" being homophones in English ({{IPAc-en|pron|p|aɪ}}), and the coincidental circular nature of a pie.&lt;ref name=landau /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kionasmith/2018/03/14/wednesdays-google-doodle-celebrates-pi-day/|title=Wednesday's Google Doodle Celebrates Pi Day|first=K.N.|last=Smith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] has often mailed its [[College admissions in the United States#Application process|application decision letters]] to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17605924/  | title = Pi fans meet March 14 (3.14, get it?)  | first = Erin  | last = McClan  | publisher = [[msnbc.com]]  | date = March 14, 2007  | accessdate = January 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28&amp;nbsp;pm, which they have called "Tau Time", to honor the rival numbers pi and [[Tau (2π)|tau]] equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I have SMASHING news!|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/i-have-smashing-news|publisher=MIT Admissions|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=Matt|title=Pi Day, Tau Time|url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/pi-day-tau-time|publisher=MIT Admissions|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26 AM, following that year's "pi minute".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/keep-your-eyes-to-the-skies |title=Keep your eyes to the skies this Pi Day |publisher=MIT Admissions |language=en |access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 28 is "Two Pi Day", also known as "Tau Day". 2{{pi}}, also known by the Greek letter [[tau]] (τ) is a common multiple in mathematical formulae.

"'''Reach for the Stars'''", alternately subtitled "'''Mars Edition'''" and "'''NASA Edition'''", is a song written, produced and recorded by American recording artist [[will.i.am]] in commemoration of the landing of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] on the planet [[Mars]]. First released on August 28, 2012 as a promotional single, the song also appears on the deluxe edition of his fourth studio album ''[[willpower (will.i.am album)|#willpower]]'' (2013). "Reach for the Stars (Mars Edition)" became the first song in history to be broadcast from another planet, completing a journey of more than 300 million miles between Mars and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/29/us/mars-single/index.html?hpt=hp_c2 |title=Will.i.am premieres song -- from Mars |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=January 25, 2014 |last=Karimi |first=Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development ==
"Reach for the Stars" was written in February 2011, after NASA asked will.i.am to write and produce a song for the Curiosity rover's landing on Mars. The songwriter said that the experience with NASA administrator Charles Bolden discussing the possibility of broadcasting a song from Mars was "surreal". The song is part of NASA's educational outreach, with will.i.am stating that the song "aims to encourage youth to study science". Rather than produce a song via the computer, will.i.am stated that he wanted to show "human collaboration", which featured a 40-piece orchestra. He added that "people in my field aren't supposed to try and execute something classical, or orchestral, so I wanted to break that stigma, [and have something] that would be timeless and translated in different cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/william-to-debut-track-on-mars-using-speakers-of-the-curiosity-rover/story-e6frfn09-1226458672800 |title=Will.i.am track played on Mars using speakers from the Curiosity rover |work=news.com.au |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |date=August 29, 2012 |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sheesh! Cab, Bob?'''" is the sixth episode of the first season of the animated television series ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''. "Sheesh! Cab, Bob?" originally aired on the [[Fox network]] in the United States on March 6, 2011. The episode was written by Jon Schroeder and directed by Jennifer Coyle. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 4.91 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Kevin Kline]], [[Steve Agee]], [[Andy Kindler]], [[David Herman]], [[Jay Johnston]], [[Jack McBrayer]] and [[Oscar Nunez]].

==Plot==
Tina's 13th [[birthday]] is coming up, and Linda suggests to Bob that they should make it extra-special since she will become a [[teenager]]. Tina wants to have a [[party]] with a [[smoke machine]] and [[Pennon|streamers]] and invite people from her class and more. She also wants the [[party]] to have a romantic moment with classmate Jimmy Pesto Jr., the eldest son of Bob's business rival, nemesis, and owner of the restaurant across the street, Jimmy Pesto ([[Jay Johnston]]). Bob believes they can't afford what Tina wants, but Linda insists they must find a way. Bob asks the restaurant's [[landlord]] Mr. Fischoeder ([[Kevin Kline]]) for an extension on their rent. He refuses, instead offering Bob one of his side businesses so he can earn extra money as a [[Taxicab|taxi cab driver]].

Bob accepts the offer while Louise becomes Tina's [[kissing]] coordinator as a [[Gift#Occasions|birthday present]] to her to get ready for the expected kissing moment with Jimmy Jr. On the first night of his job, Bob starts to enjoy driving around the [[city]], even befriending three transgender [[prostitutes]]: Glitter ([[Steve Agee]]), Marbles ([[Jack McBrayer]]), and Cha-Cha ([[Oscar Nunez]]). Tina starts inviting classmates to her party, including Jimmy Jr., who needs permission from his father for the [[RSVP (invitations)|R.S.V.P.]]. Unfortunately, Jimmy Sr. forbids Jr. to come because of his rivalry with Bob, and Tina refuses to have a party without Jimmy Jr. Bob tries to talk sense into Jimmy Pesto, but Jimmy refuses unless Bob shaves his [[mustache]] and brings it to him as part of his collection. Tina disrespects him for his refusal to shave his mustache since he does not wants to negotiate with the Pesto family.

After a night out with the sex workers, Bob deliriously comes back to the restaurant (due to drinking [[alcohol]] and possibly taking [[crack cocaine|crack]]). Linda tells Bob that Tina agrees to attend the party, but only for a few minutes. Bob wakes up half an hour late for the party, and finds out it is not going well: the boys and girls aren't dancing, Gene in his role as the [[DJ]] and Mort working as the [[Illusionist|magician]] are appalling. Bob remembered that he invited not just his regular [[transgender]] customers but others, including Marshmallow ([[David Herman]]) and a [[homeless]] man. Tina is disappointed in Bob for what he's done, and refuses to talk to him. The [[trans women]] mention to Tina that Bob worked really hard for the party and remind her that she has a good father who worked two jobs to pay for her party. She apologizes to Bob for what she said to him and lets him know that he already made the party perfect, even without Jimmy Jr. present. However, Bob has already shaved his mustache off. The trans women recognize Jimmy Sr. as one of their dates, known as "Baby Num Num", a "[[Paraphilic infantilism|diaper]] lover." Bob brings the trans women over to Jimmy's restaurant to threaten him about his personal dates. He concedes with Bob's demands; Bob keeps his mustache hair, albeit in a plastic baggie, and Jimmy Jr. is allowed to attend the party. Jimmy Jr. comes to the party, and Tina is grateful to Bob for what he has done. Tina and Jimmy Jr. kiss under the party's [[disco ball]], with Louise's encouragement, and Gene plays the [[Thompson Twins]]' song, ''If You Were Here,'' creating a reference to the ending of the film ''[[Sixteen Candles]].'' The episode finishes with everyone enjoying the party.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcasting, "Sheesh! Cab, Bob?" was viewed by an estimated 4.91 million viewers and received a 2.7 rating/4% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, an improvement from last episode and became the highest rated episode of the season to be aired after the first two episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/03/08/sunday-final-ratings-secret-millionare-celebrity-apprentice-adjusted-up-brothers-sisters-bobs-burgers-cleveland-show-adjusted-down/85003/ |title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Secret Millionare,’ ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ Adjusted up ; ‘Brothers &amp; Sisters,’ ‘Bob’s Burgers,’ ‘Cleveland Show’ Adjusted Down |publisher=TVbytheNumbers.Zap2it.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A-, saying "As funny as the episode is, it's also genuinely sweet by the end, with Bob and Tina bonding over how much work he's done. Of course, that just makes his drunken bender with sex workers that much funnier, as well as Louise acting as Tina's kissing coordinator and sending her to boot camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaiser |first=Rowan |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/the-scorpions-talesheesh-cab-bobthe-hand-that-rock-52748 |title=Review: "The Scorpion's Tale"/"Sheesh!

'''Skweee''' is a musical style, with origin in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. Skweee combines simple [[synthpop|synth]]/[[chiptune]] leads and basslines with [[funk]], [[R&amp;B]] or [[Soul music|soul]]-like rhythms, overall rendering a stripped-down funky sound. The tracks are predominantly instrumental, though there are exceptions. The name Skweee was coined by [[Daniel Savio]], one of the originators of the emerging sound. The name refers to the use of analog synthesizers in the production process, where the aim is to ''"squeeze out"'' the most interesting sounds possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skweee.com/he-called-it-skweee |title=skweeelicious! » He Called It Skweee |publisher=Skweee.com |date=9 January 2009 |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007162522/http://skweee.com/he-called-it-skweee |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://skweee.com/spin_skweee_article.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/inside-skweee |title=Inside Skweee &amp;#124; Clash Music Exclusive Best of Clash |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=16 September 2008 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Producers can vary from high-profile to new talent from the Scandinavian [[electronica]] environment.

[http://skweee.com Skweeelicious], a blog dedicated to skweee, and community sites such as MySpace and [http://nationofskweee.com Nation of Skweee] have played a major role in the distribution of skweee music and public exposure of the genre.

The major outlets of skweee music are the Swedish record label [http://www.flogstadanshall.com/ Flogsta Danshall]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flogstadanshall.com |title=Flogsta Danshall |publisher=Flogsta Danshall |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/flogstadanshall |title=Flogsta Danshall &amp;#124; Free Music, Tour Dates, Photos, Videos |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Finnish record label [http://harmoenia.fi Harmönia].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fi |url=http://www.myspace.com/harmoenia |title=HARMÖNIA record label &amp;#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian [[Dødpop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NO |url=http://www.myspace.com/dodpop |title=dødpop &amp;#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian [http://ancientrobot.com Ancient Robot],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://ancientrobot.bandcamp.com/|title=Ancient Robot &amp;#124; |publisher=Bandcamp.com |accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Losonofono,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losonofono.bandcamp.com |title=losonofono |publisher=Losonofono.bandcamp.com |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Titched,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Un |url=http://www.myspace.com/titched |title=Titched &amp;#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Poisonous Gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=US |url=http://www.myspace.com/poisonousgases |title=POISONOUS GASES &amp;#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish Lo Fi Funk,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/lofifunk.records ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214135721/http://www.myspace.com/lofifunk.records |date=14 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish Mässy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maessy.com |title=Mässy Recordings, Helsinki Finland 2011.

The preferred media format of skweee enthusiasts is the 7" vinyl record. Early releases were exclusively released in this format. More recently, however, a series of 12" vinyl records, digital releases and CD compilations have been released through these outlets as well.

The increasing notability of the skweee genre has resulted in releases such as the Eero Johannes album on [[Planet Mu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planet-mu.com/artists/eerojohannes |title=Planet Mu Records |publisher=Planet-mu.com |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205000103/http://www.planet-mu.com/artists/eerojohannes |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2009/06/somewhere-nordic-skwee |title=Somewhere: Nordic Skweee |publisher=XLR8R |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Skweee Tooth compilation on Ramp Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=35181333&amp;blogId=491782603 |title=V/A – SKWEEE TOOTH CD &amp; 2xLP / OUT MONDAY 1st JUNE van RAMP Recordings op Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=18 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416224409/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=35181333&amp;blogId=491782603 |archivedate=16 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skweee and dubstep==
Skweee has, during late 2008 and early 2009, started to influence the sound of [[dubstep]]. A thread started on the [http://dubstepforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=40320 dubstepforum] made the scene aware of skweee. Producers such as [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Civil Music |url=http://civilmusic.com/buy/sing-what-you-want |title=Kotchy – Sing What You Want |publisher=Civil Music |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gemmy, [[Joker (Musician)|Joker]],&lt;ref name="discogs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Joker-5-Rustie-Play-Doe-Tempered/release/1522691 |title=Joker (5) &amp; Rustie – Play Doe / Tempered (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zomby, Rustie,&lt;ref name="discogs1"/&gt;  among others, have given their take on the sound, resulting in several releases on the boundary between skweee and dubstep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ralf Christensen |url=http://www.information.dk/186532 |title='Wonky' giver ny søgang i computeren |publisher=information.dk |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap between dubstep and skweee has been further bridged by artists such as DJ Pontificate and underground ambient artist Chohmo, as evidenced by the former's release "Skweeeal."

In U.S. [[broadcast law]], a '''special temporary authority''' ('''STA''') is a type of [[broadcast license]] which temporarily allows a broadcast station to operate outside of its normal technical or legal parameters. &lt;ref name="stafcc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency Antennas, Silent Stations, and Special Temporary Authority for the Broadcast Services|url=https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/special-temporary-authority|website=Federal Communications Commission|language=en|date=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) station [[database]] (CDBS), broadcast STA applications have a prefix of BSTA (general), BLSTA (legal), BESTA (engineering), or BLESTA (both). STAs can also be issued for other [[telecommunication]] services under FCC [[regulation]]. Often an STA is necessary due to an unforeseen event. A station operator must exhibit why the STA is necessary and serves the public good.

A common reason to apply for STA is an equipment failure. In case a station cannot use its licensed antenna or transmission system, it can immediately continue operations using any available antenna or operating parts of existing system, as long as an STA is filed for within 24 hours. An AM station may use a [[random wire antenna]] if necessary. AM stations operating directionally are limited to 25 percent of their licensed power if their directional array fails and they must operate non-directionally under STA. If a station is evicted from its transmitter site or must move for another reason, it may also continue operating from a temporary site under the same rules, as long as it does not change or increase its coverage area or plan to permanently broadcast from that site. These rules allow stations to resume broadcasting quickly in case of a [[state of disaster]].&lt;ref name="stafcc" /&gt;

A station may go silent entirely for up to ten days without notifying the FCC at all, and up to thirty days with only a letter of notification. A station that is or will be silent for longer than thirty days must apply for a "silent STA", which can be granted for up to six months.&lt;ref name="stafcc" /&gt; The FCC typically required that silence be for reasons beyond the operator's control, such as total equipment failure or loss of programming, and asked for plans to return the station to air. The commission has since started to grant silent STAs for financial reasons. Stations that are silent can also apply for an operational STA to resume broadcasting from a temporary facility, to avoid losing its license after one continuous year of silence. The one-year limit was written into the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] and cannot be overridden by the FCC due to extenuating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steps to Take When A Broadcast Station Goes Silent|url=https://www.broadcastlawblog.com/2009/01/articles/steps-to-take-when-a-broadcast-station-goes-silent/|website=Broadcast Law Blog|date=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This silent/operational STA process presents a loophole in that it can be used to work around the Telecommunications Act indefinitely, and such STAs are normally granted with little oversight. In January 2018, the FCC initiated a crackdown on stations that exploit the loophole. The first high-profile case was co-owned stations [[WBVA (AM)|WBVA]] in [[Bayside, Virginia Beach, Virgin|Bayside, Virginia]] and [[WVAB]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], whose 2017 license renewals were designated for a hearing. The stations have operated under a cycle of silent and operational STAs since 2008; they applied yearly to broadcast with 30 and 6 watts, respectively, from a temporary site for several weeks before going silent for the rest of the year. Station owner [[Birach Broadcasting Corporation]] has claimed it is stuck with the temporary facilities as it has been unable to get zoning approval for a new transmitter site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC’s Silent Station Crackdown Targets Virginia AMs.|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/fcc-s-silent-station-crackdown-targets-virginia-ams/article_9795caba-000e-11e8-81c1-fbf05ea20f2c.html|work=Insideradio.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An STA can also be used for special events as a [[Restricted Service Licence]] is in the [[U.K.]], however this is rare. A market has developed around proprietary devices that provide live audio or video to attendees of a conference or sporting event; these devices receive a signal from a low-powered television station operating under a temporary STA in VHF [[Band I]], which is largely no longer used for broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STA Washington, DC Facility Data [example]|url=https://fccdata.org/?appid=25076f9156578c3301569a55ad85198b&amp;facid=703507|website=FCCData}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''TOCA Race Driver 3''''' ('''''DTM Race Driver 3''''' in Germany, '''''V8 Supercars 3''''' in Australia, '''''TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge''''' in the PlayStation Portable version and '''''Race Driver: Create &amp; Race''''' in the Nintendo DS version) is a [[Racing video game]] developed and published by [[Codemasters]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]] and [[OS X]]. It is the sixth game in the [[TOCA (series)|''TOCA'' series]]. The game features several fully licensed championships, including the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] series and [[V8 Supercar]] championship. This is the last in the series to have TOCA in its title as following on from this TOCA was dropped in favour of just Race Driver.

It includes 120 Championships and 35 Types of Racing through the Championship in World Tour, Pro Career, and Free Race. Also it has Bonus Championships in different disciplines. They take place largely in the UK and Germany, though many more tracks are unlocked by winning cups in Pro Career, or by setting a lap time record on a course within Pro Career mode. Open wheel, GT, Oval racing, Rallying and Off-road racing were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour.

Online play allows 12 and 8 players on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, respectively. Currently, it is the only racing simulator for PlayStation 2 with an online racing mode. For the PC up to 12 players could race together with the built-in Gamespy Server or by using a LAN. When Gamespy closed in 2014 Online Multiplayer was subsequently made possible using the Free Tunngle Network. But the Tunngle Network was shutdown at 30.04.2018 due to pending requirements of the new European [[General Data Protection Regulation]]. However, Cross-Platform Online Racing was still possible in 2018 using the Openspy Server. The game received good reviews, frequently being compared favorably to ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]'' and ''[[Forza Motorsport]]'', in the aspects of cars on track, collision and wear damage. Custom tuning of suspension components for handling and gear ratios, and including braking ratio front to rear. A more through tuning setup for a race car was allowable more so then in a driving simulator like [[Gran Turismo 4]], since TOCA Race Driver 3 was a racing simulator.

The game features many real-life competitions, including British GT, DTM, IRL and V8 Supercars, as well as a Vintage series, other GT series, and Rally. The [[Williams FW27|Formula Williams FW27]] is the featured car of the Formula 1 series in the game.

'''''The Best Page in the Universe''''' is a [[personal web page|personal]] [[satire|satirical]] [[humor]] [[website]] created by [[Maddox (writer)|George Ouzounian]], better known as Maddox, of [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].
Launched in 1997 without any high expectations, the website became known by [[word of mouth]].

==History and status==
''The Best Page in the Universe'' originated from a text document that Maddox wrote in 1996&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/06/02/maddox_qa/ It's a man's world]." ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; aptly named "fifty things that piss me off!" He gave the list to several people on [[EFnet]]'s #coders, and the positive response led him to create the website.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

Maddox decided to name his site ''The Best Page in the Universe'' despite his knowledge that at the time 
[[Yahoo!]] blocked sites with the phrase "the best" in the title from inclusion in its search engine.&lt;ref name="million"&gt;Maddox. [http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=100million_stats "100 million faces rocked"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729091647/http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=100million_stats |date=2005-07-29 }}. ''The Best Page in the Universe''. March 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2009, [[Xmission.com]], an [[ISP]] which hosts ''The Best Page in the Universe'' among other Utah clients, had an [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] rank of about 16,000, declining to 77,000 by June 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/xmission.com XMission.com ranking on Alexa.com]&lt;/ref&gt;.  TheBestPageInTheUniverse.net, an alternate domain for Maddox's website, had an Alexa rank of about 33,000 in 2009, and 180,000 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/TheBestPageInTheUniverse.net Thebestpageintheuniverse.net's rating on Alexa.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox himself wrote an article in 2002 illustrating that despite all traffic being generated by word-of-mouth alone, his site was still ranked ahead of major corporations such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Pepsi]], who spend millions of dollars on advertising every year.

He launched a competition for people to send him cartoons about himself or his website, most of which are attacks about emails for "more updates."
Later, he parodied this himself by stating that now that he's finished with the comic book, he'd be able to "Not update the site more regularly."
Entries included a depiction of Maddox leaping out of a computer monitor and smashing two fans' faces together and a comic strip of a boy checking the website for new content only to find a cartoon of himself that he had posted ten seconds earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050325084450/http://maddox.xmission.com/c.cgi?u=book "Holy shit! I'm writing a book!"]. February 19, 2005. ''The Best Page in the Universe''. (Archive.org).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiyan, Randy. [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=weekly_sub1 "Week of 11/01/05"]. ''The Best Page in the Universe''. November 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horus. [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=weekly_sub5 "Weekly Submission"]. ''The Best Page in the Universe''. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and content==
''The Best Page in the Universe'''s layout was made sparse primarily to reduce bandwidth costs.
Maddox also stated the sparsity protested the many websites containing "fancy [[HTML]]" but lacking substantial content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=faq|title = The Best Page In The Universe: FAQ|website = www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net|access-date = 2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The page is headed with an image of Maddox's face superimposed over a bust of [[Che Guevara]].
In the image, Maddox is wearing a [[beret]] emblazoned with the [[Jolly Roger]], and an eye patch.
Maddox uses this image as a parody of the revolutionary icon.
Maddox says that Che Guevara is remembered as "Che the revolutionary," not "Che the [[pinko]]",&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;Maddox. [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=faq "The Best Page in the Universe: FAQ"]&lt;/ref&gt; and claims to be neither [[socialism|socialist]] nor [[communism|communist]].
Instead, he often proclaims himself to be a pirate, and typically portrays himself as such in his articles and artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=faq|title=The Best Page In The Universe: FAQ|website=www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maddox has compared reading black text on a white background to "staring at a light bulb."&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;
The site uses large, light-colored text on a black background to, in the stated opinion of Maddox, reduce strain on the eyes.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

The site contains advertisements only for itself: it sells merchandise, such as stickers and apparel, that bear phrases from its articles.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="store"&gt;{{cite web|author=Maddox|url=http://store.theworstpageintheuniverse.com/|title=The Best Store in the Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox chose to not use advertisements because he thought they could end up censoring him by dropping ads.&lt;ref&gt;Maddox. [http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=banners "Banners Blow!"] ''The Best Page in the Universe''. July 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Maddox's articles include MS Paint illustrations, with touch up done in Photoshop.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; Images include elderly people being fired into the [[Sun]], hippies being killed, and Maddox's testicles drawn larger than basketballs.
Maddox maintains a section in which he criticizes hate mail his website has generated. When posting his replies he breaks the e-mail down and ridicules points which use [[Fallacy|fallacious]] [[logic]] and also corrects grammatical or orthographical errors.
The site contains several "hidden pages", many of which are unfinished works or first drafts of articles that were moved around.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071109010354/http://www.maddoxaddicts.com/secrets.php "Maddox Addicts :: Secrets"]. Maddox Addicts&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trailblazer''' is an independent British publisher of travel, trekking and railway route-guides. Started by author [[Bryn Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owg.org.uk/profiles/brynthomas/index.html OWG profile: Bryn Thomas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094607/http://www.owg.org.uk/profiles/brynthomas/index.html |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was originally synonymous with the ''Trans Siberian Handbook'', which for years was the only guide to crossing Asia by rail and remains much respected.&lt;ref&gt;/http://www.seat61.com/Trans-Siberian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1873756704 Amazon.co.uk: Trans-Siberian Handbook (Trailblazeer): Books: Bryn Thomas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company now publishes guides to [[long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom]], and [[hiking]] and [[adventure tourism]] guides to destinations elsewhere.

__NOTOC__
"'''Twisted'''" is the 22nd episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the sixth episode in the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 2)|second season]].

==Plot==
''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]'' encounters a strange energy field during a surprise party on the holodeck for [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]]'s second birthday. Many members of the crew are at the party, including [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] and [[Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]], who is acting as their bartender. Eventually the ship becomes stuck in the field, causing the internal communications system on board ''Voyager'' to fail. Unable to communicate with [[Tuvok]], who is acting captain during the party, the crew end the party early and attempt to return to their posts, however the ship's layout has mysteriously changed and they are unable to find their way. The crew eventually become separated and hopelessly lost within the labyrinthine corridors. Meanwhile, The Doctor becomes unable to return himself to sickbay, and finds himself amorously pursued by the hologram Sandrine.

During the exploration, [[Neelix]] once more becomes jealous of [[Tom Paris]]'s relationship with Kes; he goes on to demand to know more about her friendships with other male officers. When she becomes angry and refuses to discuss her feelings with him, he goes to [[Chakotay]] for advice. Chakotay tells him that jealousy is natural, but that he must try to control himself for the sake of his relationship with Kes.

The crew, including Tuvok, who has left the bridge and become similarly lost, all find themselves back at the holodeck. They organize themselves in an attempt to reach crucial areas of the ship such as engineering and the bridge; [[B'Elanna Torres|B'Elanna]] and Paris are successful in reaching engineering, but when they try to transport to the bridge they find themselves back at the holodeck. Meanwhile, Janeway becomes delirious after coming into direct contact with the energy field, which is penetrating further into the ship, and is brought to the holodeck by [[Harry Kim (Star Trek)|Harry Kim]] in the hope that The Doctor can help her.

B'Elanna returns to Engineering and makes an attempt to stop the field with a ship-wide energy burst, but this only makes the field envelop the ship at an accelerated rate. With the holodeck as the last refuge, the crew gathers there, and Tuvok suggests that the most logical course of action is to simply do nothing, as any attempt to stop it has only made the situation worse, and they so far have no evidence that being engulfed by the field is fatal. They do as Tuvok suggests and neither the crew nor the ship is harmed by passing through the field. Janeway is returned to health and surmises that the energy field was somehow sentient and trying to communicate with them – her theory is backed by the fact that the entire ship's memory had been downloaded and that 20 billion gigaquads of data have been uploaded to ''Voyager''{{'}}s computer.

==Production==
"Twisted" was extensively rewritten prior to being shot, and was for a time rumored to be so bad that it would never be aired, based largely on comments that [[Robert Picardo]] made at several fan conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cinefantastique]], Vol. 27, No. 4/5, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The episode originally underran its time significantly, and several scenes had to be invented to extend its length, most significantly the subplot involving The Doctor being pursued by Sandrine.&lt;ref&gt;David McIntee (March 9, 2000) ''Delta Quadrant - The Unofficial Guide to Voyager'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0753504367}}, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Script writer [[Michael Piller]] went on to voice criticisms about Neelix's subplot in this episode; he felt that the character should not be constantly portrayed as a 'buffoon', and attempting to correct the issues that he saw and resolve the subplot in question with the following episode, [[Parturition (Star Trek: Voyager)|"Parturition"]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gross and Mark A. Altman (June 1996) ''Captains' Logs Supplemental - The Unauthorized Guide to the New Trek Voyages'', Little Brown &amp; Co., {{ISBN|0316883549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers [[Lance Parkin]] and Mark Jones complained that the massive data deposit of 20 billion gigaquads was never explained or referred to again, leading to frustration as to why it was ever mentioned in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Mark|last2=Parkin|first2=Lance|year=2003|title=Beyond the Final Frontier: An Unauthorised Review of the Trek Universe on Television and Film|publisher=Contender Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84357-080-6|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
TV.com lists "Twisted" with a rating of 7.9/10 as of 2018, based on 179 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/star-trek-voyager/twisted-10661/]&lt;/ref&gt; It had a Nielsen rating of 5.6 points when it was broadcast in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Voy/Ratings/ratings.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal Circulating Music Library''' was a music publishers' activity established in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1850s and 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;For a general history of Circulating Music Libraries see Alec Hyatt King,  'Music Circulating Libraries in Britain' in ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 119, No. 1620 (Feb., 1978), pp. 134-138.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s no significant such circulating libraries by music publishers survived, most probably due to reduced demand (the interested public would just buy the music they were interested in). In terms of the housed collections/music in such "libraries" run by publishers, it is probably fair to say that most was lost, with only some still being in music publisher's archives.

==Messrs. Schuermann &amp; Co.==
Messrs. Schuermann &amp; Co. were probably the first music publisher in the [[United Kingdom]] to start a ''Universal Circulating Music Library'' in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;See announcement in ''The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular'', Vol. 6, No. 139 (Feb. 15, 1855), p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement at the time stated: 
'Many of our readers will be glad to have their attention directed towards the very comprehensive Music Library which has been formed by Messrs. Schuermann &amp; Co., of 72, Newgate-street. The catalogue contains more than 42,042 separately numbered works, embracing almost every English and Foreign publication, under various headings and subdivisions.

Libraries of reference are of such absolute necessity to all students, especially to the musician, that several attempts have been made to satisfy the want; but most of these labor under the serious disadvantage of being confined to either one class of musical works, or—as in the case of the [[British Museum]]—of being available only to those who can go from home to study.

Messrs. Schuermann’s arrangements allow of a very liberal supply of works at the subscriber’s private residence, And the small annual cost would be well bestowed even by those who ultimately intend to purchase a private library for their own use, because it affords so complete an oppoortunity of examining the merits of a work previously to purchase. A very handsomely printed catalogue may be purchased at small cost; its perusal will fully prove the great outlay at which the proprietors have got together this collection.'&lt;ref&gt;Announcement in ''The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular'', Vol. 6, No. 139 (Feb. 15, 1855), p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novello, Ewer &amp; Co.==
The ''Universal Circulating Music Library'' provided by Novello, Ewer &amp; Co. dates back to 1867/68. The preface of the first catalogue states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Universal Circulating Music Library:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This Library, which was established, and has been most successfully carried on since 1859, by Messrs. Ewer and Co., has been purchased by Messr. Novello and Co., and will be continued by them under the style of Novello, Ewer and Co.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the works named in the Library Catalogue, the whole of the publications of Messr. Novello, Ewer and Co. will be available to Subscribers; and neither expense nor exertion will be spared to make the Library still more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Supplement is now added to the present Catalogue, which makes the collection the largest and most valuable ever offered to the public. All New Music (Foreign or English) of merit will be added to the Library as soon as published, and every endeavour will be made to supply the wants of Subscribers immediately on application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
August, 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of the Universal Circulating Music Library. [With a supplement.], London: Novello, Ewer &amp; Co., 1868[?], preface, not numbered&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The terms of subscription and the regulations of use are given on the next page.

The video game industry in Australia is worth $2.96 billion annually as of 2016, inclusive of traditional retail and digital sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/australian-video-game-industry-nudges-3-billion-for-2016|title=Australian Video Game Industry Nudges $3 Billion for 2016|last=Reilly|first=Luke|date=2017-02-27|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey completed in 2017 indicated that game development in Australia employed 928 people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igea.net/2018/01/australian-game-developers-march-generating-118-5m-spite-limited-recognition-support/|title=Australian Video Game Development Industry Snapshot, FY 2016-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal year 2016-17, revenue from Australian game developers was approximately $118.5 million, 80 percent of which was from overseas sales.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The industry body for video games in Australia is the [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://business.scoop.co.nz/2017/03/08/nz-video-games-industry-revenues-race-ahead-to-424m-in-2016/|title=Scoop Business » NZ video games industry revenues race ahead to $424M in 2016|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Game Developers Association of Australia supports video game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gdaa.com.au/about-us-2/|title=About Us – Game Developers' Association of Australia|website=www.gdaa.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game retailers in Australia include [[EB Games Australia|EB Games]] and [[Gametraders]]. Video games are also sold at department stores like [[Big W]] and [[Target Australia|Target]].

== History ==
[[Beam Software]] was one of the first Australian game development studios to achieve global success, with a [[text adventure]] adaption of [[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]] released in 1982 for the [[ZX Spectrum]]. The company went on to produce other successful titles including [[The Way of the Exploding Fist]] for [[Commodore 64]] in 1985 and [[Le Mans 24 Hours video games|Le Mans]] for the [[Dreamcast|SEGA Dreamcast]] in 2001. [[Ozisoft]], a major distributor of games, was established in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Jeffery E.|date=2008|title=History of Game Development in Australia|url=https://2015.acmi.net.au/media/2457231/games_history_australia.pdf|journal=Multimedia Victoria|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early game development studios in Australia include [[Strategic Studies Group|SSG]], who developed [[Reach for the Stars (video game)|Reach for the Stars]] in 1983, and [[Micro Forté]], founded by [[John De Margheriti]] in 1985.

[[John De Margheriti]] later established the [[Academy of Interactive Entertainment]] (AIE) in 1996 and founded the Game Developers Association of Australia (GDAA) in 1999. The first president of the GDAA was Adam Lancman, who had previously worked at [[Beam Software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://playitagainproject.org/creators/adam-lancman/|title=Adam Lancman {{!}} Play It Again|website=playitagainproject.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gameswizards|The Game Wizards]], an Australian video game retailer, was established in 1990. It was the first retailer to sell games online in Australia when it set up its website in 1997. In 2007, the company's 22 stores were acquired by [[Game (retailer)|GAME]] and re-branded. By 2009 GAME Australia had expanded to over 100 stores.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/a-history-of-game/096272|title=A history of GAME|work=MCV Pacific|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EB Games entered the market as a video game retailer in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/SearchRegisters.jspx?_adf.ctrl-state=z3rmle2wc_4|title=ASIC Company Search Results|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia (IEAA) was established&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/RegistrySearch/faces/landing/panelSearch.jspx?searchText=101586958&amp;searchType=OrgAndBusNm&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=158ae52j5f_15|title=Search Results – Organisations and Business Names|website=connectonline.asic.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[Trade association|industry association]] for publishers, distributors and marketers of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.igea.net/about/|title=About – IGEA|work=IGEA|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research report published by the association in 2005 found that the 76 per cent of households had a device for playing video games, 38 per cent of gamers were female and the average age of a gamer was 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Jeffery E.|date=2005|title=GamePlay Australia 2005|url=http://www.igea.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/GamePlay_Aust_2005.pdf|journal=Interactive Entertainment Association of Australia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IEAA was later renamed the [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]] (IGEA).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2005, the top three games by units sold were [[Gran Turismo 4]], [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas|GTA: San Andreas]] and [[Pokémon Emerald]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most popular game genres were [[Strategy video game|strategy]], [[Adventure game|adventure]] and [[Action game|action]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Team Bondi]], a Sydney-based [[Independent business|independent]] [[Third-party developer|third-party]] [[Video game developer|game developer]], was founded in 2003.&lt;ref name="FoundationDate"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Bramwell |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news190705bondips3 |title=Team Bondi's PS3 title named News – PlayStation 3 – Page 1 |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=19 July 2005 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio was responsible for the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] title ''[[L.A. Noire]]'', published by [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] video game developer and publisher [[Rockstar Games]] (also popular for the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series). ''L.A. Noire'' was both a critical and commercial success, with over 5 million sales. Despite this, Team Bondi was [[Liquidation|wound up]] on 5 October 2011.&lt;ref name="Edge_Oct_5"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nathan Brown |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/team-bondi-close |title=Team Bondi to close – Edge Magazine |publisher=Next-gen.biz |date= |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2015, a number of other large studios operating in Australia shut down including KMM Brisbane, [[Pandemic Studios]], [[Krome Studios]], [[THQ]], [[Visceral Games]] and [[2K Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/04/2k-australia-in-canberra-closes-its-doors/|title=2K Australia In Canberra Closes Its Doors|last=Serrels|first=Mark|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

During the same period, smaller game developers were having success with [[mobile game]]s. In 2010, [[Halfbrick Studios|Halfbrick]], a studio based in Brisbane, released [[Fruit Ninja]] which has since been downloaded over a billion times. Other notable mobile games developed in Australia include [[Crossy Road]] and [[Framed (video game)|Framed]]. In October 2015, half of the top 10 mobile games in the [[App store|App Store]] were Australian made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/the-long-and-narrow-road-to-the-app-store/7496908|title=Anything but Pokemon: The long and narrow road to the App Store|last=Purtill|first=James|date=2016-07-19|work=triple j|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EB Games held the first [[EB Games Expo|EB Expo]] video game convention at the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/eb-expo-kicks-off-tomorrow/086414|title=EB EXPO kicks off tomorrow!|work=MCV Pacific|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expo was attended by over 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/wrap-up-of-the-eb-expo/086565|title=Wrap up of the EB EXPO|last=|first=|date=|website=MCV Pacific|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expo moved to the [[Sydney Showground (Olympic Park)|Sydney Showground]] for 2012 and was held there annually until the expo returned to the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in 2017. 36,750 people attended the expo in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stateofplay.co.nz/sydneys-eb-expo-2015-breaks-last-years-attendance-record/|title=Sydney’s EB Expo 2015 breaks last year’s attendance record|date=2015-10-10|work=Vic B'Stard's State of Play|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[History of PAX|PAX Prime 2012]], it was announced that [[PAX (event)|PAX]] would expand internationally to Australia. [[PAX Australia]] was held for the first time in 2013 at the [[Melbourne Showgrounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/09/pax-australia-is-heading-to-melbourne/|title=PAX Australia Is Heading To Melbourne|last=Serrels|first=Mark|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual event remains the only PAX event held out side of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/gadgets-on-the-go/pax-australia-plays-its-cards-right-20161107-gsjkhm.html|title=PAX Australia plays its cards right|last=Turner|first=Adam|date=2016-11-07|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 2012 GAME, which had since downsized to 26 stores,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; went into administration and subsequently closed down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mcvpacific.com/news/read/pwc-talks-about-game-s-administration-process/095988|title=PwC talks about GAME's administration process|work=MCV Pacific|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digital Australia 2012 report, published by the IGEA, found that female participation in video gaming had risen to 48 per cent and the average age of an Australian video gamer had hit 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Jeffery E.|date=2012|title=Digital Australia 2012|url=http://www.igea.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DA12FinalLinkVideo.pdf|journal=Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional retail sales of video games in Australia during 2012 were $1.16 Billion; digital sales were estimated at $620 Million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/mediareleases/15759/video-games-industry-records-1161-billion-sales/|title=Video games industry records $1.161 billion sales in 2012 – Media Releases – Computerworld|website=Computerworld|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Australia was ranked 14th in the world in terms of gaming revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzoo.com/insights/infographics/australia-ranks-number-one-in-the-world-in-average-spend-on-ipad-games/|title=Australian games market: Infographic|date=December 5, 2013|website=Newzoo|publisher=Newzoo|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2015 the [[Australian Senate]] commenced an inquiry into the future of Australia's video game development industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Video_game_industry/Terms_of_Reference|title=Terms of Reference|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent report was tabled on 29 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Environment_and_Communications/Video_game_industry/Report|title=Report|last=7111;|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games can still be refused classification and banned from sale if they depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Guidelines/Pages/RC.aspx|title=RC {{!}} Australian Classification|website=www.classification.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable video games that have been refused classification since the introduction of an R18+ for video games include: [[Saints Row IV]], [[South Park: The Stick of Truth]], [[Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number]] and [[Outlast 2]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Material which is refused classification is put on the [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] list of prohibited items. Any copies of these games found at the border will be seized, and its recipient, depending on the number of copies being imported may receive up to AUD$110,000 in fines.&lt;ref name="Kozanecki"&gt;{{cite web|first=James|last=Kozanecki|date=2011-03-15|title=Aussie customs to seize Mortal Kombat imports|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6303984|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2011-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319160323/http://au.gamespot.com/pages/news/story.php?sid=6303984|archive-date=2011-03-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual is allowed to own, use, access or create Refused Classification items, including games (with the exception of Western Australia). But a Refused Classification rating means that the created item is illegal to sell within Australia.

[[File:Alaska Native dancer wearing kuspuk.jpg|thumb|250px|Yup'ik dancer from [[Inu-Yupiaq]] dance group performing in a kuspuk]]

'''Yup'ik dancing''' (or '''dance''') or '''Yuraq''', also '''Yuraqing''' ([[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Yup'ik]] ''yuraq'' {{IPA|/juʁaq/}} &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''yurak'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt;  ''yurat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) is a traditional [[Eskimo]] style [[dancing]] form usually performed to songs in Yup'ik, with dances choreographed for specific songs which the [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik people|Yup'ik]] people of southwestern [[Alaska]]. Also known as '''Cup'ik dance''' for the [[Chevak Cup’ik language|Chevak Cup'ik]] dialect speaking Eskimos of [[Chevak, Alaska|Chevak]] and '''Cup'ig dance''' for the [[Nunivak Cup'ig language|Nunivak Cup'ig]] dialect speaking Eskimos of [[Nunivak Island]]. Yup'ik dancing is set up in a very specific and cultural format. Typically, the men are in the front, kneeling and the women stand in the back. The drummers are in the very back of the dance group. Dance is the heart of Yup’ik spiritual and social life. Every song has a story behind it and some songs is either about hunting or berry picking. Some songs could be about sports or other things that don't really relate to hunting. Traditional dancing in the [[qasgiq]] is a communal activity in Yup’ik tradition. The [[Yup'ik masks|mask]] (''kegginaquq'') was a central element in Yup'ik ceremonial dancing.&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"&gt;[[Emily Johnson]] (1998), [http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/9.3/9-3Yupik_Johnson131-149.pdf “Yup'ik Dance: Old and New,”] ''The Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement'', Vol. 9, No. 3. pp. 131-149&lt;/ref&gt;

Eskimo dancing of their ancestors was [[Ban (law)|banned]] by [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]] in the late 19th century as ''primitive idolatry''. After a century, [[Cama-i]] dance festival is a cultural celebration that started in the mid 1980s with a goal to gather outlying village Eskimo dancers to share their music and dances. There are now many dance groups who perform Eskimo dances in Alaska. Most popular activity in the Yup'ik-speaking Eskimo area is rediscovered Yup'ik dancing.

==Eskimo dancing==
Both Yup'ik and [[Iñupiaq]] dancing are also known as '''Eskimo dancing''' or '''Eskimo dance''' in Alaska.

The most obvious ways in which the Eskimo dancing of northwestern Alaska (known as '''Iñupiaq style Eskimo dance''') differs from that of southwestern Alaska (known as '''Yup'ik style Eskimo dance''') are in: the beating of the frame-drum from below, rather than from above; the standing, rather than the kneeling, of the male dancers; the very small use of decorative dance fans (''de rigueur'' in the south); and the considerable musical ceremonialism that still survives (which never developed as much in the south and southwest of Alaska, although it certainly existed there).&lt;ref name="refThomasmusic"&gt;Thomas F. Johnston (1976), [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic29-1-7.pdf The Eskimo Songs of Northwestern Alaska]. ''Arctic'', Vol 29, No 1 (1976), pp. 7-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yuraryaraq==
''Yuraryaraq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''Yuraryarat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt; (lit. "way[s] of dancing") or ''Yupiit Yuraryarait'' (lit. "Yup'ik ways of dancing") embrace six fundamental key entities identified as ''ciuliat'' (ancestors), ''angalkuut'' (shamans), ''cauyaq'' (drum), ''yuaruciyaraq'' (song structures), ''yurarcuutet'' (regalia) and ''yurarvik'' (dance location).&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"&gt;Theresa Arevgaq John (2010). ''[http://ankn.uaf.edu/Curriculum/PhD_Projects/Arevgaq/Yuraryaraput_Kangiit-llu.pdf Yuraryararput Kangiit-llu: Our Ways of Dance and Their Meanings]''. University of Alaska Fairbanks. Fairbanks, Alaska.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancestor]]s (''ciuliaq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''ciuliat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;, ''ciuliaput'' "our ancestors") are regarded with respect and believed to be part of the living in Yup'ik  [[epistemology]].&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt;

The [[Angakkuq|shaman]] (''angalkuq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''angalkuk'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''angalkut'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) played a functional role in dance. The role of shaman as the primary leader, petitioner, and a trans-mediator between the human and non-human spiritual worlds in association with music, dance, and masks. The shaman’s professional responsibility was to enact ancient forms of prayers to request for the survival needs of the people. The specified masks depicted survival essentials requested in ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt; Shamans often carved the symbolic masks that were vital to many Yup'ik ceremonial dances and this masks represented spirits that the shaman saw during visions.&lt;ref name="Ahniemarie"&gt;Ahnie Marie Al'aq David Litecky (2011). [http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05102011-142458/unrestricted/Litecky_Ahnie_Thesis.pdf ''The Dwellers Between: Yup'ik Shamans and Cultural Change in Western Alaska''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223125104/http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05102011-142458/unrestricted/Litecky_Ahnie_Thesis.pdf |date=December 23, 2014 }}. The University of Montana&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nepcetat'' (powerful ceremonial masks) were empowered by shamans. Shamans wearing masks of bearded seal, moose, wolf, eagle, beaver, fish, and the north wind were accompanied with drums and music.&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt;

[[File:Drummer Nunivak Curtis LOC.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[Nunivak Cup’ig language|Nunivak Cup’ig]] playing a very large drum in 1927 by [[Edward S Curtis]].]]
The [[drum]] (''cauyaq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''cauyak'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''cauyat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) is only instrument in yuraryaraq. Drum that is accompanied with a [[drum stick]] (''cauyaun'', ''mumeq'', ''mengruq''). The drum is made with a round [[bentwood]] frame crafted with a designed handle. Traditionally, the [[drumskin]] (''eciq'' or ''cauyam ecia'') was made out of fine mammal stomach lining. The drum was to be treated with respect and used for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt; The Yup'ik calendar clearly marks the seasons and seasonal rounds of activity. The November (''Cauyarvik'' in Nelson Island dialect, ''Causarvik'' in Kotlik dialect, lit. "place for drumming”)  is the time for drumming.&lt;ref&gt;Nita Y. Rearden (2013), [http://www.alaskateacherresources.org/large_files/Calendar-12month-Yupik-byNitaRearden.pdf Calendar Sample of Kotlik]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Song structure (popular music)|song structures]] (''yuaruciyaraq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt;) in ceremonies are composed and choreographed differently. The ceremonies are accompanied with music and must adhere to specific composition formalities as practiced by Yup’ik ancestors. This musical forms of songs are warm-up chorus (''ayakata’aryaraq''), chorus (''agnera''), first verse (''apalluan ciuqlia''), voiceless motion (''cauyarialnguq''), second verse (''apalluan kinguqlia''), encore (''pamyua'').&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt;

[[File:Ceremonial mask wearer Nunivak Curtis LOC.JPG|thumb|250px|A man wearing a ceremonial [[Yup'ik masks|mask]] of the Nunivak Cup’ig style in 1927 by Edward S Curtis.]]

The dance [[regalia]] (''yurarcuun'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''yurarcuutek'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''yurarcuutet'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) includes ''qaliq'' (fancy fur parka), ''nasqurrun'' (wolf/wolverine/caribou beaded headdress), ''uyamik'' (beaded necklaces), ''tegumiak'' (finger mask or woven grass caribou dance fans), ''piluguuk'' (decorated boots), and ivory/beaded earrings. Men wear round wooden fans with waterfowl or owl feathers. Today, both female and male dancers wear designed [[qaspeq]] (hand-sewn calico pullover clothing).&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt;

Dance [[Yup'ik masks|mask]] (''kegginaquq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''kegginaquk'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''kegginaqut'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) was a central element in Yup'ik ceremonial dancing.

Dance fans or finger masks or maskettes (''tegumiaq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''tegumiak'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''tegumiat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;): Hand-held fans accentuate the fluid movements of a dancer’s arms. They were used in traditional winter ceremonies and continue as part of contemporary Yup’ik dance regalia. Men’s fans, like this pair, have feathers inserted into wooden hoops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaska.si.edu/record.asp?id=216 Alaska Native Collections : tegumiak “pair of dance fans”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance headdress (''nasqurrun'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''nasqurrutek'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''nasqurrutet'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;): Women wore similar headdresses, which remain a part of modern Yup’ik dance regalia for both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaska.si.edu/record.asp?id=220 Alaska Native Collections : nasqurrun “dance headdress”]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dance location (''yurarvik'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''yurarviik'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''yurarviit'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt; lit. "place for dancing”). The [[qasgiq]] is where people danced in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt; The qasgiq, was the community center for ceremonies and festivals which included singing, dancing, and storytelling.

==Types==
The '''Yuraq''' (''yuraq'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''yurak'' &lt;small&gt;dual&lt;/small&gt; ''yurat'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;) is use generic term for Yup'ik/Cup’ik regular dance. Also, yuraq is concerned with animal behaviour and hunting of animals, or with ridicule of individuals (ranging from affectionate teasing to punishing public embarrassment).&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt; But,  use for inherited dance is '''Yurapik''' or '''Yurapiaq''' (''yurapiaq ~ yurapik'' &lt;small&gt;sg&lt;/small&gt; ''yurapiit'' &lt;small&gt;pl&lt;/small&gt;, lit. "real dance") and yurapik long story dance performed by women,&lt;ref name="Agayuliyararpu"&gt;[[Ann Fienup-Riordan|Fienup-Riordan, Ann]] (1996). ''The Living Tradition of Yup'ik Masks: Agayuliyararput (Our Way of Making Prayer)''. Seattle, WA: University of Washington Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or is a dance style that relates to dance sequences that have no associated song [and] are owned by individuals and passed down through family lines.&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt;

Types of dances are ''nangercelluku'' (first dances), ''yagirat'' (motions dances), ''cukaqautet'' (fast beat dances), ''ciuqitet'' (contemporary dances), ''ingulautet'' (slow dances).&lt;ref name="Theresaarevgaq"/&gt; Rhythmic dances combined distinct gestures, story-telling, songs and the use of drums and masks. There were six styles of yuraq: ''arula'' dances consisting of yuraq, verse and chorus; ''yurapiat'' (storytelling dances); ''ingula'' dances, which were slow, oldstyle dances performed by women following berry harvests; ''pualla'' dances, primarily performed by men; ''yurat'' done to ''taitnauq'' songs; and ''telciqata'arcutet'', or proper entrance dances.&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"/&gt;

==Banning of dancing==
The reasons of the discrediting of traditional native dances are the effects of social changes that came about in the late 19th century as a result of [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], [[epidemics]], and [[Mission (Christianity)|missionary]] activity.&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"/&gt; Along with the expansion of Europeans and Americans into Alaska were accompanying hardships for the indigenous people: epidemic diseases, strong Christian missionary activities, and western educational policies such as English language-only rules.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Shaa Tlaa Williams (2005) {She is an [[ethnomusicologist]] from the [[Tlingit]] nation}. [http://www.nps.gov/akso/nature/science/ak_park_science/PDF/2005Vol4-1/williams.pdf To dance is to be: heritage preservation in the 21st century]. in ''Alaska Park Science'', Vol 4-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancestral Eskimo dancing and non-Christian [[Festival|festivities]], traditional ceremonies, and [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanistic]] rites were discouraged or even demonized and [[Ban (law)|banned]] by Christian missionaries in the late 19th century as ''primitive idolatry''. Shamanistic rituals are no longer practiced, although some elders have information about these rites. Song and dance have remained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaska.si.edu/culture_inupiaq.asp?subculture=Arctic%20Coast&amp;continue=1 Alaska Native Collections : Jana Harcharek, Iñupiaq]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moravian Church in North America|Moravian Church]] had banned dancing from the villages.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Lipka (1998) with Gerald V. Mohatt and the Ciulistet group. ''[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=o8alAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=%22Yup%27ik+dancing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2-4ns-O8Vl&amp;sig=KRI0aHgYXlIkDpglE_j41wSvYVI&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JBNVVMGMEc2S7Ab7tICQBw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Yup%27ik%20dancing%22&amp;f=false Transforming the Culture of Schools: Yup’ik Eskimo Examples]''&lt;/ref&gt; Yuraq dancing feasts between villages in the [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]] and  [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]] region were forbidden by [[Orthodox Church in America|Russian Orthodox]] priests as of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Kerry D. Feldman (1978), Occupancy and Use of Naknek Area From Late 19th Century. Unpublished Manuscript, on file Department of Anthropology, University of Alaska Anchorage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Kerry D (2001), [http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/anthropology/people/upload/King_Salmon.pdf “Ethnohistory and the IRA Tribal Status Application of King Salmon Natives, Alaska”], ''Alaska Journal of Anthropology'' 1 (1):100 –117.&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing as part of Yup'ik feasts no longer existed as [[Jesuit missionaries]] forbade it at the end of the 19th century. Many of these spiritual ceremonies, such as the ''Agayuyaraq'', an intervillage ceremony associated with the performance of masked dances usually at the end of the winter season, were abandoned.&lt;ref name="Nuttall2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|title=Encyclopedia of the Arctic: A-F|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcucDSk4w3YC&amp;pg=PA1461|accessdate=2014-04-11|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-57958-436-8|page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masked dances and the Kelek (masquerade) dances were among the first to be removed from Yup'ik practice. Because of their highly spiritual content, dances were considered dangerous by missionaries who called them "heathen idol worship, devil's frolic and black art".&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"/&gt;

==Dance festivals==
There are now many dance groups who perform Eskimo dances in Alaska. There are many performances and festivals, however, that are more traditional in their role. Masked dances especially have served as a strong reminder of the connection to the worlds of animals and spirits. Dances embody the Yup'ik conception of the world. The beliefs that stem from this conception are the models by which Yup'iks live. Today, a dance festival, both in preparation and the actual event, consumes an entire village with its significance, just as it did in pre-contact times.&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"/&gt;

The first Yup'ik [[dance festival]] is [[Yupiit Yuraryarait]] (lit. "Yup'ik ways of dancing") started in 1982 at [[St. Mary's, Alaska|St. Mary's]] (''Negeqliq''), fostering a revival of the traditions of the Yup’ik people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/552.html?tribe=Yup%27ik&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the survival of Yup’ik cultural heritage, the Negeqliq first brought together artists where traditional dancing was still practiced to participate in a festival designed to pass on dance traditions to younger generations. Nine villages in [[Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta]] came to that intervillage festival. The success of that event stimulated the creation of dance festivals throughout the lower Yukon River region.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Peterson (1996), ''[http://arts.gov/sites/default/files/Changing-Faces-of-Tradition.pdf The changing faces of tradition: a report on the golk and traditional arts in the United States]''. National Endowment for the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tim Troll (2008), [http://www.adn.com/article/20080511/remembering-man-who-helped-revive-yupik-dancing Remembering the man who helped revive Yup'ik dancing]. ''Alaska Dispatch News'', May 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The Yupiit Yuraryarait is a dance festival that is now held every three or four years.&lt;ref name="Emilyjohnson"/&gt;

The second Yup'ik dance festival is [[Cama-i]] (lit. "hello; greetings; pleased to meet you; good to see you again") started in 1984 in [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] (''Mamterilleq''). Traditional dancers from all over Alaska and beyond participate every March in the Cama-i dance festival. Bethel is unique in the region in having an astounding diversity of cultures, including a large contingent of Koreans. The Cama-i dance festival, an annual event in Bethel in the spring, hosts [[Alaska Native]] dancers from all over the state as well as [[Koreans|Korean]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] dancers, and dancers from other regions of the world and the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://camai.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delena Norris-Tull (1999 ).
