'''Alcatraz Citadel''', also known as '''Fort Alcatraz''',&lt;ref name="Champion2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Champion Jr.|first=Jerry Lewis |title=The Fading Voices of Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxH3-mB5rCcC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=27 January 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-1488-8|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the original military defense and prison on [[Alcatraz Island]], off the coast of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States. The citadel was built in 1859 as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] military defense, and began function as a war camp in 1861 and long-term [[military prison]] in 1868. During the [[American Civil War]], the citadel and its [[Artillery battery|batteries]] provided an important line of defense. The island continued to develop in the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1893, the first hospital on Alcatraz opened. A new upper prison was built in 1904, but after the citadel ceased function as a military defense in 1907 and the original citadel collapsed the following year, a $250,000 concrete military prison was erected between 1910 and 1912. In 1933–1934, this was modernized and became the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. It housed some of America's most dangerous criminals between 1934 and 1963.

==History==

===Early history===
Native Americans, known as [[Ohlone]] (A [[Miwok]] Indian word), were the earliest known inhabitants of the Alcatraz island before it attained its niche in history as the most secure prison for notorious criminals. Even though they avoided the island as they believed that evil spirits resided there due to the bad atmosphere they got from the place, they were using it for deporting their criminals under the tribal law to live on the island in isolation. They also gathered eggs of birds and marine food from the island. Even after the Spanish discovered the Island in 1759, and started spreading [[Christianity]], the natives who did not want to convert used the islands as their refuge.&lt;ref name=Legend&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatraz.html|title=The Long History of Alcatraz Island |publisher=Legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
However, the earliest recorded owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by [[Mexico|Mexican]] governor [[Pio Pico]] in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the baptismal name of [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]], co-owner of [[Rancho La Puente]] and personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as Military Governor of California, [[John C. Fremont]], champion of [[Manifest Destiny]] and leader of the [[Bear Flag Republic]], bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the [[United States government]] from Francis Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/expeditionsofjoh02fr/expeditionsofjoh02fr_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "The expeditions of John Charles Frémont"|volume=2 |editor=Mary Lee Spence &amp; Donald Jackson |publisher=University of Illinois Press |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sgha.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgha.net/articles/fh.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112162937/http://www.sgha.net/articles/fh.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2013 |title=Famous Hauntings |publisher=Southwest Ghost Hunters Association |date= |accessdate=5 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A530641 |title=h2g2 – Alcatraz, San Francisco, California, USA |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, President [[Millard Fillmore]] ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the [[Mexican–American War]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/alc.htm |title=Alcatraz-World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=National Park Service |date= |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fremont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Fremont nothing. Fremont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.&lt;ref name="sgha.net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nps.gov" /&gt;

Following the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] which ended the [[Mexican–American War]] (1848), and the onset of the [[California Gold Rush]] the following year, the [[U.S. Army]] began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to [[San Francisco Bay]]. In 1853, under the direction of [[Zealous B. Tower]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] began fortifying the island, work which continued, and the citadel was completed in 1859, on a budget of $87,689.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellman|first=Gregory L.|title=A History of Alcatraz Island:: 1853-2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1duAUPaHSgcC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=28 May 2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-5815-8|pages=12–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservancy1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=California Coastal Conservancy|title=San Francisco Bay Shoreline Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJwh6DQqojUC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=30 March 1995|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08878-8|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barter1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barter|first=James|title=Alcatraz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MIYBYBk6UEsC|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=September 1999|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=978-1-56006-596-8|pages=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in this direction, taken up in 1853, was the start of construction of a fortress or citadel at the top of sandstone rock outcrops. The island was encircled with steep walls built of stone and bricks abutting the rock faces, and buildings for accommodating defense personnel and offices and temporary launching jetty were also added. A lighthouse was built and 11 cannons were fixed. The main fortress took many years to build as the building material ([[granite]]) required for construction had to be imported from China.
[[File:Alcatraz light original2.jpg|thumb|left|Lighthouse and citadel building, c. 1893]]
Army engineer [[James B. McPherson]], later to become a prominent general during the Civil War, was one of the earliest commanders to serve on Alcatraz in 1858.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; The three-storied citadel took final shape by 1859 when gun positions, roads, guard houses and draw bridge over the moat (encircling the citadel) were all added. The citadel had housing capacity for 200 soldiers with food storage facility to last for four months in case of any long drawn attack.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt; In 1859, the coastal defense system became a reality and Captain [[Joseph Stewart (Alaska)|Joseph Stewart]] was commander of the island forces which included 86 men of Company H, Third U.S. Artillery, before departing from the island in 1861 on the outbreak of the Civil War.&lt;ref name=Legend /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wellman2008" /&gt; The military officers wore blue suits and white gloves.

{{confusing|date=November 2012|paragraph}}
In 1861, the citadel commenced function as a prison, with tiny new cells being added to the basement, and in 1867 was extended, becoming a long-term military prison in 1868.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; The citadel on Alcatraz was crucial to defense during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), having some 111 cannons encircling the island at peak,&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Donald|last2=Nadel|first2=Ira|title=Alcatraz: History and Design of a Landmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wfQWSJLKXdoC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-1-4521-0153-8|pages=6–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also used as a war camp.  During the Civil War, the defense establishment at Alcatraz Citadel had the onerous task to defuse the possibility of any local war between the Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supporters who were both part of the population of [[California]], and to protect [[San Francisco]]. Ammunition in the form of 10,000 [[muskets]] and 150,000 [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] was supplied to the fort, which made the Fort Alcatraz and the island most impregnable and thus leaving any plans of the Confederate soldiers of taking control of the San Francisco Bay and California State could be taken under its fold was thwarted.&lt;ref name=Legend/&gt; Alcatraz was officially designated as a military prison on August 27, 1861. In March 1863, when there was a threat that the San Francisco Bay would be captured by the Confederates, the [[schooner]], which was to carry out the operation set sail; the U.S. Navy prevented the schooner from moving out and captured the crew along with ammunition and 15 confederates who were hiding in the galleys of the ship. Consequent to this, the importance of Alcatraz increased, more and more confederates and civilians were arrested for reasons of treason and kept in the military prison, and to accommodate the increased number of prisoners, a temporary makeshift wooden prison was built in 1863 to the north of the guardhouse. In 1864, with civil war showing no signs of abating, fortifications were provided in the fort in the form of 15-inch [[Rodman cannons]] and more "bomb-proof barracks” built. At the time of end of the Civil War in 1865, there were more than one hundred cannons in the island, which were never put to any aggressive battle, but used only once to provide gun salute in honor of  President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at his official funeral procession held in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=prison&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatraz2.html|title= Alcatraz - Page 2|publisher= Legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AlcatrazIsland-1895.jpg|thumb|left|Alcatraz Island, 1895]]
As the civil war ended, the military prison housed Confederate sympathizers who celebrated Lincoln's death. During the [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]] that followed the civil war, Indians who went against the government were sent to the Alcatraz prison. On June 5, 1873, [[Paiute Tom]] was the first Native American who was imprisoned there on transfer from Camp McDermit in [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=prison/&gt; In the 1870s, Major [[George Mendell]] ordered the prisoners, aided by mules, to assist in changing the natural landscape of the island and creating a top level, dumping debris into the coves and bay.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; In 1882, the citadel was enlarged to provide more accommodation for the families of the military officers working on Alcatraz.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; Between 1873 and 1895, 32 Native Americans were imprisoned at the citadel on Alcatraz, including 19 [[Hopi]] men held in captivity there between January and August 1895 after being transferred from [[Fort Defiance (California)|Fort Defiance]].&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; The island continued to develop in the 1880s and in 1898 the population of Alcatraz increased dramatically from 26 to over 450 due to the Spanish–American War and placed a demand for new buildings.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; The original barracks evolved into [[Building 64]] in 1905. The first hospital on Alcatraz opened in 1893.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt;

As the number of prisoners to be housed in the citadel increased, more space was built in the form of the Upper Prison, which consisted of three wooden structures, each of two tiers, with the lower prison getting converted as a workshop. However, both Upper and Lower Prison cells, being made of wood, were frequently subject to fire hazards, and this led to change of the structural form of the barracks; concrete structures were built, replacing the wooden ones.&lt;ref name=troop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatraz3.html|title= Alcatraz - Page 3|publisher= Legendsofamerica.com|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
In 1904, an upper prison building was built at a higher level on the island and replaced the lower prison, with a capacity of 307 inmates.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt;

Alcatraz was renamed as the "Pacific Branch, U.S. Military Prison” in 1907, and as the importance of the Island citadel became less and less obvious due to modernization of the naval facilities, infantry soldiers were shifted and prison guards brought in their place.&lt;ref name=troop/&gt; It developed a reputation for its brutal methods of torturing prisoners,&lt;ref name="Peterson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Anna L.|title=Seeds of the Kingdom: Utopian Communities in the Americas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4ECYoSv1MUC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=17 November 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-518333-7|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing prisoners in pitch black cells for up two weeks.&lt;ref name="Wetzel2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wetzel|first=Charles|title=Mysteries Unwrapped: Haunted U.S.A.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQaIT95kSNcC&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=4 September 2012|date=7 October 2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4027-3735-0|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alcatraz citadel2.jpg|thumb|right|View of island and citadel in 1908]]
Alcatraz was barely affected by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] which devastated the city, and the prison population dramatically increased as prisoners were temporarily transferred to the island due to damage in the city.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; In 1907, Alcatraz Citadel ceased function as a military defense and became the Pacific Branch, U.S. Military Prison solely.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazer1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazer|first=Robert W.|title=Forts of the West: Military Forts and Presidios, and Posts Commonly Called Forts, West of the Mississippi River to 1898|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4GNSjwUnkmoC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=5 September 2012|date=15 April 1975|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-1250-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the original 1860s citadel collapsed in 1908, the Citadel was demolished in 1909 up to its basement over which the new prison was built by the military prisoners between 1909 and 1911 and named as “the Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks for the U.S. Army”,  which became popular as  "The Rock".&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/about/history/alcatraz.jsp|title= A Brief History of Alcatraz |publisher= Federal Bureau of Prisons|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prison was [[Alcatraz Cellhouse|entirely rebuilt in concrete]] in 1910-1912 under the command of Colonel [[Reuben Turner]] on a $250,000 budget on the site of the remains and short-lived upper prison building. Many of the former underground tunnels and chambers of the original fort remain today and are still accessible. This building was modernized in 1934 when it reopened as a federal penitentiary, the notorious Alcatraz prison which held America's most ruthless criminals until 1963.

During the [[World War I]], the citadel was used for incarcerating military prisoners as also German Prisoners of War, which necessitated building of a larger building structure by demolishing the old upper and lower prisons. A new cell house formed of four cell blocks with 600 cells was built, in 1912, which at that time was reported to be the largest reinforced concrete building in the world; the cells had toilet and electricity facilities.&lt;ref name=troop/&gt;

In the new established order, facilities for education and rehabilitation of prisoners with minimum offence were also introduced which resulted in many reformed prisoners getting back to the army. Even though the prison was a military establishment, it had its fair share of prison escapes. 29 escapes were reported involving 80 convicts out of which 62 were caught and tried while the rest of the prisoners were not traced. In the prison escape of November 28, 1918, there were four prisoners who escaped in rafts, and they were seen at Sutro Forest. However, only one was caught and the others escaped.&lt;ref name=troop/&gt;

Due to high costs of maintenance of the Alcatraz as a defense establishment, a well thought out plan was mooted to convert it into the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]]. Also during this period crime rate had escalated in the country due to the [[great depression]] with prohibition further exacerbating the situation resulting in mobsters and gangsters operating freely indulging in looting, violence and killings, with the law enforcing agencies failing to cope with the situation; prison escapes had become the order of the day. The suggestion to convert the Military Prison into a Federal Penitentiary was welcomed by the President [[Herbert Hoover]] and thus the maximum-security prison was created. The proposal for transfer of Alcatraz to the Bureau of Prisons was initiated in October 1933 and after a vigorous adaption from the military prison throughout 1934, it opened in August 1934, ending some eighty years of U.S. Army occupation. With this change of guard, 32 hardcore prisoners remained at Alcatraz while the rest were shifted to the prisons at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]], [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta]], [[Fort Jay]], [[New Jersey]] and several others.&lt;ref name=troop/&gt;

The main mode of transport accessing the island was the [[General McPherson (ship)|''General McPherson'']]. Upon embarking at the port, the main grounds would be reached by a "long dreary corridor" known as the [[sally port]] and a [[drawbridge]] surrounded by a dry [[moat]], {{convert|12|ft}} below.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barter1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"/&gt; It could hold up to 200 men during an emergency and enough supplies to last four months.&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"/&gt; Alcatraz Citadel consisted of a basement, which contained the kitchen, bakery, bedrooms, storerooms and jail cells, and two levels above ground which contained the military personnel quarters, servant quarters, parlors and a mess room.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; In-ground water tanks and water tanks were situated on the roof of the citadel. Other buildings included the Batteries of Rosecranz and Halleck in the north, the barracks building in the northeast, the Battery of McClellan and Fog Bell House in the south, the Battery of McPherson in the west and the Batteries of Stevens and Mansfield in the northwest and the lighthouse aside the main citadel.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; Battery McClellan was equipped with a 15-inch [[Rodman gun]] weighing over 25 tons, capable of launching a 330-pound explosive 4,680 yards when angled at 25 degrees.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; The [[Parade Grounds]] were located in the left centre.&lt;ref name="Wellman2008"/&gt; When the new concrete prison was built in 1910-2, iron staircases in the interior were retained from the old citadel and massive granite blocks originally used as gun mounts were reused as the wharf's bulkheads and retaining walls.&lt;ref name="MacDonaldNadel2012"/&gt;

'''Apuleius''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|p|j|ʊ|ˈ|l|iː|ə|s}}; also called '''Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis'''; c. 124 – c. 170 AD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30917/Lucius-Apuleius "Lucius Apuleius"]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Latin]]-language prose writer, [[Platonist]] philosopher and rhetorician.&lt;ref name="GTUApo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.georgetown.edu/jod/apuleius/|title=Apuleius, Apology|publisher=George Town University}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Numidians|Numidian]] who lived under the [[Roman Empire]]&lt;ref&gt;"''Berbers: ... The best known of them were the Roman author Apuleius, the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and St. Augustine''", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', Scholastic Library Publishing, 2005, v.3, p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; and was from [[Madauros]] (now [[M'Daourouch]], [[Algeria]]). He studied Platonism in [[Athens]], travelled to [[Roman Italy|Italy]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia Minor]], and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]], and was an initiate in several cults or [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]]. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty ''tour de force'' in his own defense before the [[proconsul]] and a court of magistrates convened in [[Sabratha]], near ancient [[Tripoli]], Libya. This is known as the ''Apologia''.

His most famous work is his [[ribaldry|bawdy]] [[picaresque novel]], the ''Metamorphoses'', otherwise known as ''[[The Golden Ass]]''. It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a [[donkey]].

== Life ==
[[File:Apuleius, Opera omnia, 1621 - BEIC 9468424.tiff|thumb|''Apuleii Opera omnia'' (1621)]]
Apuleius was born in Madauros, a ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' in [[Numidia]] on the [[North Africa]]n coast bordering [[Gaetuli]]a, and he described himself as "half-Numidian half-Gaetulian."&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Apology, 24"&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; Madaurus was the same ''colonia'' where [[Augustine of Hippo]] later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanized]] coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no ''[[praenomen]]'' is given in any ancient source;&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', page xi. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him ''Lucius'' from the name of the hero of his novel.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Haig Gaisser, (2008), ''The fortunes of Apuleius and the Golden Ass: a study in transmission and Reception'', page 69. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech (''Apology'') and his work ''[[Florida (Apuleius)|Florida]]'', which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.

His father was a provincial magistrate (''[[Duumviri|duumvir]]'')&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Apology, 24" /&gt; who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million [[sestertius|sesterces]] to his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 23&lt;/ref&gt; Apuleius studied with a master at [[Carthage]] (where he later settled) and later at [[Athens]], where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to [[Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'', 17.4&lt;/ref&gt; to study Latin [[rhetoric]] and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several [[Greco-Roman mysteries]], including the [[Dionysian Mysteries]].&lt;ref&gt;As he proudly claims in his ''Apologia''. (Winter, Thomas Nelson (2006) [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=classicsfacpub ''Apology as Prosecution: The Trial of Apuleius''])&lt;/ref&gt; He was a priest of [[Asclepius]]&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Florida'' 16.38 and 18.38&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, ''Epistle'' 138.19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sacerdos provinciae Africae'' (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Apology, 72"&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 72.&lt;/ref&gt; On his way there he was taken ill at the town of [[Oea]] (modern-day [[Tripoli]]) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens.&lt;ref name="Apuleius, Apology, 72" /&gt; The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent&amp;nbsp;– indeed encouragement&amp;nbsp;– Apuleius agreed to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 73&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 53, 66, 70, etc&lt;/ref&gt; The case was heard at [[Sabratha]], near Tripoli, c.&amp;nbsp;158&amp;nbsp;AD, before [[Claudius Maximus]], [[proconsul]] of [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 1, 59, 65&lt;/ref&gt; The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the ''Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)''.&lt;ref name="GTUApo" /&gt;

Apuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 75–76; Rebecca Flemming (1999), "''Quae corpore quaestum facit'': The Sexual Economy of Female Prostitution in the Roman Empire," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 89, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public to great reception; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honor by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, ''Apology'', 55, 73; ''Florida'', iii. n. 16; Augustine, ''Ep. '' v.&lt;/ref&gt;

The date, place and circumstances of Apuleius' death are not known.&lt;ref name="Gollnick2006"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1g9DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|title=The Religious Dreamworld of Apuleius’ Metamorphoses: Recovering a Forgotten Hermeneutic|last=Gollnick|first=James|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

=== ''The Golden Ass'' ===
{{Main article|The Golden Ass}}
''The Golden Ass'' (''Asinus Aureus'') or ''Metamorphoses'' is the only [[Latin language|Latin]] novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this [[frame story]] are found many [[story within a story|digressions]], the longest among them being the well-known tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

The ''Metamorphoses'' ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the [[mysteries of Isis|mystery cult of Isis]]; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]''. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the ''pastophoroi''&amp;nbsp;– a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Iles Johnson, Sarah, ''Mysteries'', in ''Ancient Religions'' pp. 104–5, The Belknap Press of Harvard University (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-674-02548-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adventures of the ass stand at the beginning of the [[picaresque novel]] tradition which eventually produced ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp 35&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Apologia ===
Apologia (''Apulei Platonici pro Se de Magia'') is the version of the defense presented in [[Sabratha]], in 158-159, before the proconsul [[Claudius Maximus]], by Apuleius accused of the crime of magic. Between the traditional exordium and peroratio, the argumentation is divided into three sections:
* in the first, the writer refutes the accusations leveled against his private life. He demonstrates that by marrying Pudentilla he had no interested motive and that he carries it away, intellectually and morally, on his opponents.
* The second tends to prove that his so-called "magical operations" were in fact indispensable scientific experiments for an imitator of aristotle and Hippocrates, or the religious acts of a Roman Platonist.
* The third recounts the events that have occurred in Oea since his arrival and pulverize the arguments against him.
The main interest of the Apology is historical: it offers a lot of information about its author, magic and life in Africa in the second century. But, it is not devoid of literary value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1989|title=Apulée|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopédie berbère]]|publisher=Edisud|url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2565|last=Cèbe|first=Jean-Pierre|date=|publication-place=Aix-en-Provence|volume=6 {{!}} Antilopes – Arzuges|pages=820-827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other works ===
His other works are:

* ''Florida''. A compilation of twenty-three extracts from his various speeches and lectures.
* ''De Platone et dogmate eius (On Plato and his Doctrine)''. An outline in two books of [[Plato]]'s physics and ethics, preceded by a life of Plato
* ''De Deo Socratis (On the God of Socrates)''. A work on the existence and nature of [[Daemon (classical mythology)|demons]], the intermediaries between gods and humans. This treatise was roughly attacked by Augustine of Hippo. It contains a passage comparing gods and kings which is the first recorded occurrence of the proverb "familiarity breeds contempt":&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=149 |title=Apuleius |author=S. J.

* ''On the Universe''. This Latin translation of the work ''[[On the Universe|De Mundo]]'' is probably by Apuleius.

Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of [[poetry]] and [[fiction]], as well as technical treatises on [[politics]], [[dendrology]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[natural history]], [[astronomy]], [[music]], and [[arithmetic]], and he translated Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Walsh, (1999) ''The Golden Ass'', pages xiv–xv. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spurious works ===
The extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius are:&lt;ref&gt;Mark P. O. Morford, (2002), ''The Roman philosophers'', page 227. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Peri Hermeneias'' (''On interpretation''). A brief Latin version of a guide to [[Aristotelian logic]].
* ''Asclepius''. A Latin paraphrase of a lost Greek dialogue (''The perfect discourse'') featuring [[Asclepius]] and [[Hermes Trismegistus]].

'''Archival informatics''' is the [[theory]] and [[:wikt:application|application]] of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] in and around the realm of [[archives]] and [[record keeping]].&lt;ref name="Archival Informatics Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archimuse.com/publishing/AMInewsletters/AMInewsletter1987_1-1.pdf |title=Archival Informatics Newsletter |author=[[David Bearman]]|publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] |year=1987 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it refers to the proper understanding and use of emerging technologies, techniques, and theories such as [[Computational linguistics|linguistic analysis]], [[heuristics]], and [[automation]] in the storage, manipulation and retrieval of archives and [[databases]].

An ''Archival Informatics Newsletter'' was started in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUQPAQAAMAAJ | title=Archival Informatics Newsletter | publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] | year=1987 | volume=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first use of ''informatics'' specifically within the field of [[archival science]] dates back to 1986 with the formation of [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] by [[David Bearman]].&lt;ref name="Archival Informatics Newsletter"/&gt; He indicated that he borrowed the term from the field of [[biomedicine]] where "the importance of information technologies (like computers), information techniques (like [[full-text]] retrieval or [[digitizing]] [[radiographic]] images) and information theories, especially those of linguistic analysis, [[artificial intelligence]], indexing and retrieval, are coming together in new ways of practicing medicine". The concept was critical to him because it illustrated a "system oriented view of the [[synergy|synergism]] of information based activities", rather than the more [[Parochialism|parochial]] view implied by confined subject names such as automation or computerization. Although it has been 21 years since this term has been introduced its usage is not common in [[literature]]; largely it is used in reference to Bearman’s creation, though exceptions do exist.&lt;ref name=AnneJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/agilliland/ |title=Anne J.

[[File:Le Louvre - Aile Richelieu.jpg|thumb|[[Louvre|The Louvre]] in [[Paris]], France, was the [[List of most visited art museums|most visited art museum]] in the world in 2017.]]
[[File:Gallery15Urlan.ogv|thumb|The [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC.]]

An '''art museum''' or '''art gallery''' is a building or space for the [[art exhibition|exhibition of art]], usually [[Visual arts|visual art]].
Museums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection. [[Painting]]s are the most commonly displayed [[Work of art|art objects]]; however, [[sculpture]]s, [[decorative arts]], furniture, textiles, [[costume]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[pastel]]s, [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], [[collage]]s, [[Printmaking|prints]], [[artist's book]]s, [[photograph]]s, and [[installation art]] are also regularly shown.&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:art gallery]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as [[performance art]]s, music concerts, or [[poetry]] readings.

== Types of galleries ==
[[File:The Gallery of Cornelis van der Geest.JPG|thumb|right|''The Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]]'', [[Willem van Haecht]], 1628. A private picture gallery as an early precursor of the modern museum.]]
The term relates to  '''public''' and '''private''' institutions. Public galleries are non-profit or public museums displaying selected art collections. Private galleries refer to commercial enterprises for [[trade|selling]] art. However, both types may host [[Travelling exhibition|traveling exhibits]] or temporary exhibitions including art borrowed from elsewhere.

In broad terms, in United States usage, the word ''gallery'' alone often implies a private gallery, while a public gallery is likely an ''art museum''. In British and Commonwealth usage, the word ''gallery'' alone implies a public gallery, which is distinguished from a ''private'' or ''commercial'' gallery, and the word ''museum'' alone is understood to refer to institutions holding collections of historic, archaeological or scientific [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]], rather than fine art.

=== Galleries in museums ===
The rooms in museums where art is displayed for the public are often referred to as galleries as well, with a room dedicated to [[Ancient Egypt]]ian art often being called the ''Egyptian Gallery'', for example.

=== Contemporary gallery ===
{{Main|Contemporary art gallery}}
The term [[contemporary art gallery]] refers to a private for-profit commercial gallery. These galleries are found clustered together in large urban centers. Smaller cities are home to at least one gallery, but they may also be found in towns or villages, and remote areas where artists congregate, ''e.g.'' the [[Taos art colony]] and [[St Ives, Cornwall]].

Contemporary art galleries are often open to the general public without charge; however, some are semi-private. They profit by taking a portion of art sales; twenty-five to fifty per cent is typical. There are also many non-profit or collective galleries. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo charge the artists a flat rate per day, though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Galleries often hang solo shows. [[Curator]]s often create group shows with a message about a certain theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries sometimes choose to represent exclusive artists, giving them opportunities for regular shows.

A gallery's definition can also include the [[artist cooperative]] or [[artist-run space]], which often (in North America and Western Europe) operates as a space with a more democratic mission and selection process. Such galleries have a board of directors and a volunteer or paid support staff who select and [[wiktionary:curate|curate]] shows by committee, or some kind of similar process to choose art often lacking commercial ends.

=== Vanity galleries ===
{{Main|Vanity gallery}}
A [[vanity gallery]] is an art gallery charging fees from artists to show their work, much like a [[vanity press]] does for authors. The shows lack legitimate curation and often include as many artists as possible. Most art professionals are able to identify them on an artist's resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=159&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=202 |title=Investing in Your Career, A Worthwhile Risk? |publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) |date= |accessdate=16 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722155934/http://www.nyfa.org/level4.asp?id=159&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=51&amp;tid=202 |archivedate=22 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University museums and galleries ===
[[File:TÜ kunstimuuseum, sinine saal.JPG|thumb|[[University of Tartu]] Art Museum is the oldest museum in [[Estonia]].]]
{{Main|University art museums and galleries in the United States}}
[[University art museums and galleries in the United States|University art museums and galleries]] constitute collections of art developed, owned, and maintained by all kinds of schools, community colleges, colleges, and universities. This phenomenon exists in the West and East, making it a global practice. Although overlooked, there are over 700 university art museums in the US alone. This number, compared to other kinds of art museums, makes university art museums perhaps the largest category of art museums in the country. While the first of these collections can be traced to learning collections developed in art academies in Western Europe, they are now associated with and housed in centers of higher education of all types.

== History ==
=== Private collections ===
Throughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by [[Religious organization|religious institutions]] and monarchs and been displayed in temples, churches, and [[palace]]s. Although these collections of art were private, they were often made available for viewing for a portion of the public. In [[Classical antiquity|classical times]], religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of [[engraved gem]]s (including [[Julius Caesar]]) and other precious objects often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items.

[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The art collection at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in [[France]] was periodically open for 'respectable' public viewing.]]
In [[Europe]], from the [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval period]] onwards, areas in royal palaces, [[castle]]s, and large [[English country house|country houses]] of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the [[Palace of Versailles]], entrance was restricted to people wearing the proper apparel – the appropriate accessories (silver [[shoe buckle]]s and a [[sword]]) could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display. Many of the grander [[English country house]]s could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with most of the paintings of the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]], which were housed in a wing of the [[Palais-Royal]] in Paris and could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy, the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the 18th century onwards, and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The [[Capitoline Museums]] began in 1471 with a donation of classical sculpture to the city of [[Rome]] by the [[Pope|Papacy]], while the [[Vatican Museums]], whose collections are still owned by the Pope, trace their foundation to 1506, when the recently discovered ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' was put on public display. A series of museums on different subjects were opened over subsequent centuries, and many of the buildings of the Vatican were purpose-built as galleries. An early royal treasury opened to the public was the [[Grünes Gewölbe]] of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] in the 1720s.

Privately established museums open to the public began to be established from the 17th century onwards, often based around a collection of the [[cabinet of curiosities]] type. The first such museum was the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], opened in 1683 to house and display the artefacts of [[Elias Ashmole]] that were given to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in a bequest.

=== Public galleries ===
[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|The [[British Museum]], established in 1753 at the [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] as one of the earliest national collections open to the public.]]
In the second half of the eighteenth century, many private collections of art were nationalised and opened to the public.

In 1753, the [[British Museum]] was established and the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|Old Royal Library collection]] of [[manuscript]]s and artwork was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP [[John Wilkes]] to buy the art collection of the then late Sir [[Robert Walpole]] who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in [[Europe]], and house it in a specially built wing of the [[British Museum]] for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsaritsa [[Catherine the Great]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and housed in the [[Hermitage Museum|State Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Moore|title=Sir Robert Walpole's pictures in Russia|work=Magazine Antiques|date=2 October 1996|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2|accessdate=14 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210082619/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n4_v150/ai_18850830/pg_2|archivedate=December 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bavarian royal collection (now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the [[House of Medici|Medici]] collection in [[Florence]] around 1789&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/database/museums/uffizi.html|title=Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as the [[Uffizi]] Gallery). The opening of the [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref name="Taylor1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1999|loc=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The building now occupied by the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] in [[Madrid]] was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in [[Vienna]], [[Munich]] and other capitals. In [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], however, the corresponding [[Royal Collection]] remained in the private hands of the monarch and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]], founded in 1814 and the [[National Gallery]] opened to the public a decade later in 1824.

== Visual art not shown in a gallery ==
Works on paper, such as [[drawing]]s, [[pastel]]s, [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], [[Printmaking|prints]], and [[photograph]]s are typically not permanently displayed for conservation reasons. Instead, public access to these materials is provided by a dedicated print study room located within the museum. [[Mural]]s generally remain where they have been painted, although many have been removed to galleries. Various forms of 20th-century art, such as [[land art]] and [[performance art]], also usually exist outside a gallery. [[Photograph]]ic records of these kinds of art are often shown in galleries, however. Most museum and large art galleries own more works than they have room to display. The rest are held in '''reserve collections''', on or off-site.

Similar to an art gallery is the [[sculpture garden]] (or "sculpture park"), which presents sculpture in an outdoor space. Sculpture installation has grown in popularity, whereby temporary sculptures are installed in open spaces during events like festivals.

== Architecture ==
The [[architecture|architectural]] form of the art gallery was established by Sir [[John Soane]] with his design for the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in 1817. This established the gallery as a series of interconnected rooms with largely uninterrupted wall spaces for hanging pictures and indirect lighting from [[window|skylights]] or [[roof lantern]]s.

The late 19th century saw a boom in the building of public art galleries in Europe and America, becoming an essential cultural feature of larger cities. More art galleries rose up alongside museums and public libraries as part of the municipal drive for literacy and public education.

In the middle and late twentieth century, earlier architectural styles employed for art museums (such as the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] or the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture]] of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum) succumbed to [[Modern architecture|modern styles]], such as [[Deconstructivism]]. Examples of this trend include the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]] by [[Shigeru Ban]], and the redesign of the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] by [[Mario Botta]]. Some critics{{which|date=June 2012}} argue these galleries defeat their purposes because their dramatic interior spaces distract the eye from the paintings they are supposed to exhibit.

== Cultural aspects ==
Many art museums throughout history have been designed with a cultural purpose or been subject to political intervention. In particular, national art galleries have been thought to incite feelings of [[nationalism]]. This has occurred in both democratic and non-democratic countries, although [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regimes have historically exercised more control over administration of art museums. [[Ludwig Justi]] was for example dismissed as director of the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] (Old National Gallery) in [[Berlin]] in 1933 by the new Nazi authorities for not being politically suitable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter-Klaus Schuster: Die Alte Nationalgalerie. DuMont, Köln 2003, {{ISBN|3-8321-7370-6}}.{{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate. Some see art museums is fundamentally elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift. [[John Cotton Dana]], an American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of the [[Newark Museum]], saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. In addition, Dana's conception of the perfect museum included a wider variety of objects than the traditional art museum, including industrial tools and handicrafts that encourage imagination in areas traditionally considered mundane. This view of the art museum envisions it as one well-suited to an industrial world, indeed enhancing it. Dana viewed paintings and sculptures as much less useful than industrial products, comparing the museum to a department store. In addition, he encouraged the active lending-out of a museum's collected objects in order to enhance education at schools and to aid in the cultural development of individual members of the community. Finally, Dana saw branch museums throughout a city as a good method of making sure that every citizen has access to its benefits. Dana's view of the ideal museum sought to invest a wider variety of people in it, and was self-consciously not elitist.&lt;ref&gt;John Cotton Dana, A plan for a new museum, the kind of museum it will profit a city to maintain (1920)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, a number of political theorists and social commentators have pointed to the political implications of art museums and social relations. [[Pierre Bourdieu]], for instance, argued that in spite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position. So called [[cultural capital]] is a major factor in social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job). The argument states that certain art museums are aimed at perpetuating aristocratic and upper class ideals of taste and excludes segments of society without the social opportunities to develop such interest. The fine arts thus perpetuate social inequality by creating divisions between different social groups. This argument also ties in with the Marxist theory of [[Deception|mystification]] and [[High culture|elite culture]].&lt;ref&gt;P., Bourdieu, Distinction (1979), translated into English by R., Nice (1984), {{ISBN|0-7100-9609-7}}. Especially chapter one "Aristochracy of Culture".&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, certain art galleries, such as the [[National Gallery]] in London and the [[Louvre]] in Paris are situated in buildings of considerable emotional impact. The [[Louvre]] in Paris is for instance located in the former Royal Castle of the [[Ancien Régime|ancient regime]], and is thus clearly designed with a political agenda. It has been argued that such buildings create feelings of subjugation and adds to the [[Deception|mystification]] of [[fine art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Palais-Royal des Orléans (1692–1793): Les travaux entrepris par le Régent'' at the Wayback Machine (archived 7 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online museums ==
=== Museums with major web presences ===

=== Online art collections ===
There are a number of online art catalogues and galleries that have been developed independently of the support of any individual museum. Many of these, like American Art Gallery, are attempts to develop galleries of artwork that are encyclopedic or historical in focus, while others are commercial efforts to sell the work of contemporary artists.

A limited number of such sites have independent importance in the art world. The large auction houses, such as [[Sotheby's]], [[Bonhams]], and [[Christie's]], maintain large online databases of art which they have auctioned or are auctioning. [[Bridgeman Art Library]] serves as a central source of reproductions of artwork, with access limited to museums, [[art dealer]]s, and other professionals or professional organizations.

==== Folksonomy ====
There are also online galleries that have been developed by a collaboration of museums and galleries that are more interested with the categorization of art. They are interested in the potential use of [[folksonomy]] within museums and the requirements for post-processing of terms that have been gathered, both to test their utility and to deploy them in useful ways.

The [[steve.museum]] is one example of a site that is experimenting with this collaborative philosophy. The participating institutions include the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]].

'''''Britain's Road to Socialism''''' is the programme of the [[Communist Party of Britain]], and is adhered to by the [[Young Communist League (Britain)|Young Communist League]] and the editors of the ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Morning Star]]'' newspaper.

It proposes that [[socialism]] can be achieved in Britain by the working class leading the other classes in a popular democratic anti-monopoly alliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Britain's Road to Socialism: Part 6 - The final piece |first= Gawain|last= Little|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/news/content/view/full/109181|newspaper=[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]|location=London|accessdate=16 March 2013|quote=Ultimately it will be for the working class and the popular antimonopoly alliance it has constructed to lead in both building and defending socialism in Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[state monopoly capitalism|monopoly capital]], and implementing a left-wing programme of socialist construction. Part of this strategy involves winning the labour movement with a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] position, through struggle in the existing democratic bodies of the working class, such as [[trades union]]s, [[Labour council|trades union councils]] and tenant's associations.

==History==
The publication of Communist Party programmes in Britain began in the 1920s with the release of ''Class against Class, the General Election Programme of the Communist Party of Great Britain''. This was published in 1929 by the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), the precursor to the Communist Party of Britain, for the general election of that year in which the party fielded 25 candidates.&lt;ref name=Lalkar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalkar.org/article/853/the-revolutionary-programmesof-british-communism|title=The revolutionary programmes of British Communism|date=January 2008|work=Lalkar|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent programme, titled ''For Soviet Britain'', was published for the party's 13th Congress in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=For Soviet Britain|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/britain/congresses/XIII/soviet_britain.htm|accessdate=16 March 2013|date=2 February 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed draft programme was issued in 1939 but the [[World War II|Second World War]] and its aftermath delayed the publication of an updated programme until the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Lalkar/&gt;

''For Soviet Britain'' was finally superseded in February 1951 when ''The British Road to Socialism'' was published, the original incarnation of today's ''Britain's Road to Socialism''. The first edition of the document received the personal approval of [[Joseph Stalin]] prior to publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=Vijay|title=The British Road to Socialism of 1951: A Programme of People’s Democracy|journal=Revolutionary Democracy|date=September 2007|volume=XIII|issue=2|url=http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv13n2/brs1951.htm|accessdate=25 April 2013|location=New Delhi|quote=the contribution of Stalin in the writing of the British Road to Socialism was the object of controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under its original name, it underwent revisions in 1952, 1958, 1968 and 1977.

When the CPGB's leadership abandoned ''The British Road to Socialism'' in 1985, elements in the party that remained loyal to the programme, including the then editorial board of ''The Morning Star'', split to form the Communist Party of Britain in 1988. The party published the 6th edition of ''The British Road to Socialism'' in 1989. Two subsequent editions have been produced with further revisions and a change of name to ''Britain's Road to Socialism''. The 7th edition was published in 2001 and the 8th edition in 2011.

'''British Museum''' was a station on the [[London Underground]], located in [[Holborn]], central London. It was latterly served by the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]] and took its name from the nearby [[British Museum]] in [[Great Russell Street]].

The station was opened by the [[Central London Railway]] in 1900. In 1933, with the expansion of [[Holborn tube station|Holborn station]], less than 100&amp;nbsp;yards away, British Museum station was permanently closed. It was subsequently utilised as a military office and command post, but in 1989 the surface building was demolished. A portion of the eastbound tunnel is used to store materials for track maintenance, visible from passing trains.

==History==
British Museum station was opened on 30 July 1900 by the [[Central London Railway]] (CLR; now the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]]), with its entrance located at No. 133, [[High Holborn]] (now a meeting venue), near the junction with New Oxford Street.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Douglas |title=The London Underground, A Diagrammatic History |year=1999 |publisher=Douglas Rose/Capital Transport |isbn=1-85414-219-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1906, [[Holborn tube station|Holborn station]] was opened by the [[Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway]] (GNP&amp;BR; now the [[Piccadilly line]]) less than 100 yards away. Despite being built and operated by separate companies, it was common for the underground railways to plan routes and locate stations so that interchanges could be easily formed between services. This had been done by other lines connecting with the CLR stations at [[Oxford Circus tube station|Oxford Circus]] and [[Tottenham Court Road tube station|Tottenham Court Road]], but an interchange station was not initially constructed between the GNP&amp;BR and the CLR because the tunnel alignment to British Museum station would not have been suitable for the GNP&amp;BR's route to its [[Aldwych tube station|Strand station]] (later renamed Aldwych). The junction between High Holborn and the newly constructed [[Kingsway, London|Kingsway]] was also a more prominent location for a station than that chosen by the CLR.
[[File:British museum tube stn map.png|thumb|left|British Museum station featured on an old version of the [[Tube map]]]]

The possibility of an underground passageway was initially mooted, but the idea suffered from the complexity of tunneling between the stations. Holborn station was, in any case, better situated than British Museum, as it had better tram connections (Holborn had [[Holborn tramway station|a stop]] on the now defunct [[Kingsway tramway subway]]). A proposal to enlarge the tunnels under High Holborn to create new platforms at Holborn station for the CLR and to abandon the British Museum station was originally included in a [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private bill]] submitted to parliament by the CLR in November 1913,&lt;ref name=gazette_01&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[World War I|First World War]] prevented any work taking place. The works were eventually carried out as part of the modernisation of Holborn station at the beginning of the 1930s when [[escalator]]s were installed in place of [[elevator|lift]]s. British Museum station was closed on 24 September 1933, with the new platforms at Holborn opening the following day.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

British Museum station was subsequently used up to the 1960s as a military administrative office and emergency command post, but the surface station building was demolished in 1989, and the platforms could no longer be accessed from street level. The platforms have since been removed, thus lowering the entire tunnel floor to track level. A portion of the eastbound tunnel is used by engineers to store materials for track maintenance, which can be seen from passing trains.

==In popular culture==
[[File:British Museum tube 2004 alt.jpg|thumb|The station in 2004]]

* In the [[Neil Gaiman]] novel ''[[Neverwhere (novel)|Neverwhere]]'' the main character, Richard Mayhew, a Londoner, protests that there is no British Museum station, only to be proved wrong when his train stops there.
* The station was mentioned in the 1972 horror film ''[[Death Line]]'', but contrary to popular belief, it is not the station portrayed in the film as being the home of a community of [[cannibal]]s descended from Victorian railway workers. The cannibals venture out at night to snatch travellers from the platforms of operating stations and take them back to their gruesome 'pantry' at an incomplete station.  [[Donald Pleasence]] stars as the investigating police inspector, and when finally cornered, one of the cannibals screams a corrupted form of "Mind the doors!", obviously having picked it up parrot-fashion from the guards on the Underground trains. The station in question is named simply 'Museum' and is clearly stated as being 'between' Holborn and British Museum stations in a conversation between Pleasance's character and a colleague. It is supposedly part of a completely separate line that was not completed owing to the construction company going [[bankrupt]]. Signs in the abandoned station also only state 'Museum' as the name.
* The station did feature in the [[Bulldog Drummond]] spin-off film ''[[Bulldog Jack]]'' as the location reached by a secret tunnel leading from the inside of a [[sarcophagus]] in the British Museum. The villain ([[Ralph Richardson]]) is finally cornered and forced into a sword duel on the disused platforms, which were a studio set. The station was renamed 'Bloomsbury' in the film.
* The station briefly featured in the computer game ''[[Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror]]'', in which [[Nico Collard]] escapes from the British Museum and finds the station. She then manages to stop the passing trains.  The station in the game, however, is depicted as having its exit actually inside the British Museum itself.  A station named 'Museum' also features in the earlier game ''[[Beneath a Steel Sky]]'', by the same company, but the apparent Australian setting for the latter game, as well as its proximity to a station named 'St. James' suggests this is actually the [[Museum railway station]] in Sydney.
* The station is reputed to be haunted by the ghost of the daughter of an [[Egyptian Pharaoh]] called [[Amen-ra]] which would appear and scream so loudly that the noise would carry down the tunnels to adjoining stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghost-story.co.uk/stories/londonundergoundghostsbritishmuseumstation.html|title=London Underground Ghosts - British Museum Station|publisher=www.ghost-story.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425151727/http://www.ghost-story.co.uk/stories/londonundergoundghostsbritishmuseumstation.html|archivedate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">In [[linguistic typology]], the '''case hierarchy''' is a particular order of cases where languages that lack a particular case are unlikely to have any of the cases listed after it in the hierarchy. Equivalently, languages that do have a particular case will usually have at least one case from each position on its left. It was developed by the Australian [[linguist]] [[Barry Blake]]. The hierarchy is as follows:

: [[Nominative case|nominative]] → [[Accusative case|accusative]] ''or'' [[Ergative case|ergative]] → [[Genitive case|genitive]] → [[Dative case|dative]] → [[Locative case|locative]] ''or'' [[Prepositional case|prepositional]] → [[Ablative case|ablative]] ''and/or'' [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] → ''others''.

This is only a general tendency, however. Many forms of [[Central German]] such as [[Colognian language|Colognian]] or [[Luxembourgish]] have a dative case but lack a genitive. In [[Irish language|Irish]] nouns, the nominative and accusative have fallen together, while the dative and locative cases have remained separate in some paradigms; Irish also has a genitive and vocative case. In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the accusative, genitive, and dative have merged to an oblique case, but the language still retains vocative, locative, and ablative cases. [[Old English]] had an instrumental case, but not a locative or prepositional.

Blake argues that it is "doubtful that the hierarchy can be extended much further", but does suggest that the most common cases not listed in the hierarchy are the [[Comitative case|comitative]], [[Purposive case|purposive]], [[Allative case|allative]], [[Perlative case|perlative]] and [[Comparative case|comparative]].

'''Christian nationalism''' is [[Christianity]]-affiliated [[religious nationalism]]. Christian nationalists focus primarily on internal politics, such as passing laws that reflect their view of Christianity and its role in political and social life. They are actively promoting religious (Christian) and nationalistic discourses in various fields of social life, from Politics and History, to Culture and Science. In Europe and the United States, Christian nationalism ranges from conservative to far right-wing.

Christian nationalistic movements often have complex leadership structure, depending on the nature of their relationship with local Church institutions. Some movements are more lay oriented, with symbolic clerical participation and indirect support of the local Church structures, and others are actually led or strongly influenced by local clergy. Involvement of clergy in various Christian nationalistic movements since the 19th century led to the development of particular form of Christian nationalism known as ''clerical nationalism'' (also known as clero-nationalism or clerico-nationalism). Some distinctive radicalized forms of clerical nationalism even led to the rise of [[clerical fascism]] on the far-right of the political spectrum in various European countries specially during the interwar period in the first half of 20th century.{{sfn|Feldman|Turda|Georgescu|2008|3, 60, 65-69, 222, 227-231}}

==Brazil==
{{see also|Patriota}}
In recent years there has been a growing sentiment of nationalism between both [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in [[Brazil]].
Politicians like [[Magno Malta]] and [[Jair Bolsonaro]], and political parties like [[Patriota]], until Jair Bolsonaro left the party, promote ultraconservative ideas, like rejection of [[LGBT]] rights, opposition to abortion, and anti-[[secularism]].
Most Christian nationalists in Brazil are in favor of [[ecumenism]], while attacking and rejecting contact with non-Christians, more specifically [[Muslim]]s and [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://noticias.gospelprime.com.br/sem-estado-laico-somos-cristao-jair-bolsonaro/|title="Sem essa de Estado laico, somos um Estado cristão", afirma Bolsonaro|date=10 February 2017|website=gospelprime.com.br|accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background of [[World War I]], German Christian nationalism was reflected by [[Lutheranism]], [[romanticism]], [[idealism]], and [[Immanence]].&lt;ref name="Hoover1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arlie J.

==Great Britain==
In the background of [[World War I]], British Christian nationalism was reflected by [[empiricism]], [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and [[individualism]].&lt;ref name="Hoover1989"/&gt;

==Lebanon==
The [[Lebanese Front]] was a coalition of mainly Christian parties in the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. In the 1980s, Christian nationalism was pursued by the Maronite community. The Maronites sought to create a Christian mini-state.&lt;ref name="Schulze1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsten E.

==Poland==
In [[Poland]], nationalism was always characterized by loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church.

Religious nationalism characterized by communal adherence to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and national Orthodox Churches is found in many states of [[Eastern Europe]] and in the [[Russian Federation]]. Many Russian [[Neo-Fascist]] and [[Neo-Nazi]] groups, such as the [[Russian National Unity]], call for an increased role for the Russian Orthodox Church.

The US movement was founded by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]]. It sold and distributed, ''inter alia'', ''[[The International Jew]]'', and subscribed to the antisemitic views embodied in ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' which it also published. Founded in 1942, with the purpose to preserve [[United States|America]] as a [[Christian]] nation being conscious of a highly organized campaign to substitute [[Jewish]] tradition for Christian tradition. Its purpose was also to oppose [[communism]], [[World government|one world government]] and immigration. It also aimed to fight [[Miscegenation|interracial relationships]] and all attempts to force the intermixture of the [[Black people|black]] and [[White people|white]] [[Race (biology)|races]]. It was effectively a political party, and promoted antisemitic and racist causes, particularly in St. Louis from the 1940s through the 1950s.

In [[computing]], a '''compound document''' is a document type typically produced using [[word processor|word processing]] software, and is a regular text document intermingled with non-text elements such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[picture]]s, [[digital video]]s, [[digital audio]], and other [[multimedia]] features. It can also be used to collect several documents into one.

Compound document [[technology|technologies]] are commonly utilized on top of a [[software componentry]] framework, but the idea of software componentry includes several other concepts apart from compound documents, and software components alone do not enable compound documents. Well-known technologies for compound documents include:
*[[ActiveX Document]]s
*[[Bonobo (GNOME)|Bonobo]] by [[Ximian]] (primarily used by [[GNOME]])
*[[KParts]] in [[KDE]]
*[[MODCA|Mixed Object Document Content Architecture]]
*[[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions]] (MIME)
*[[Object linking and embedding]] (OLE) by [[Microsoft]]; see [[Compound File Binary Format]]
*[[Open Document Architecture]] from [[ITU-T]] (not used)
*[[OpenDoc]] by [[Apple Computer]] (now defunct)
*[http://sourceforge.net/projects/verdantium Verdantium]
*[[XML]] and [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]] are encapsulation formats used for compound documents of all kinds

The first public implementation was on the [[Xerox Star]] [[workstation]], released in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">A "'''''development plan'''"'' is an aspect of [[town and country planning in the United Kingdom]] comprising a set of documents that set out the local authority's policies and proposals for the development and use of land in their area. The development plan guides and shapes day-to-day decisions as to whether or not [[planning permission]] should be granted, under the system known as ''[[Development control in the United Kingdom|development control]]'' or ''[[development management (Scotland)|development management]]'' in [[Scotland]]. In order to ensure that these decisions are rational and consistent, they must be considered against the development plan adopted by the authority, after public consultation and having proper regard for other material factors.

Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004( replacing Section 25 of [[Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997]] and Section 54A of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]]) requires that decisions made should be in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Although development plans do not have to be rigidly adhered to, they provide a firm basis for rational and consistent planning decisions.

==Context==
In England and Wales, the development plan may contain a number of documents:
[[County|Counties]] and most [[non-metropolitan district|non-metropolitan unitary districts]] are covered by [[structure plan]]s (in which the county, national park or [[unitary authority]] set out key strategic policies as a framework for local planning) and [[local plan]]s (in which [[Local government in the United Kingdom|district councils]] and [[national park authority|national park authorities]] set out more detailed policies to guide development in their areas, including proposals for specific sites). Structure plans may in some cases be prepared on a joint basis between two or more authorities (e.g. a county and a unitary authority or a national park).

County, national park and some unitary authorities also prepare [[minerals and waste local plans]] are also deemed to be local plans.

In London and the metropolitan areas, and in a few non-metropolitan unitary areas, authorities produce [[unitary development plan]]s (UDPs), which combine the functions of structure and local plans and include minerals and waste policies.

Local plans and UDPs identify particular areas as suitable for housing, industry, retail or other uses, and set out the policies which the authority proposes to apply in deciding whether or not development will be permitted. The preparation of Local Plans and UDPs gives the community the opportunity to influence the detailed policies and specific proposals for the future development and use of land in their area. Because the plan forms the statutory basis for planning decisions, local people are involved in its preparation.

In Scotland, following the passing of the [[Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006]], the development plan comprises Strategic Development Plans (covering a number of city areas/urban authorities), Local Development Plans and [[statutory]] Supplementary Guidance. National Park Authorities in Scotland also act a Planning Authority for the development of planning policy, and the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs and the Cairngorms National Park Local Plans also form part of the wider development plan.

In [[India]] Development Plan process is a provincial/state subject. There are various town planning authorities under each province/state that assess the growth of areas, identify suitable areas for housing, industry, public infrastructure and allocate budgets. Each of the metropolitan cities in India has an Agency which is responsible for Development Planning exercise of the cities. [[Mumbai]] city has [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority]] commonly known as ''MMRDA''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmrda.maharashtra.gov.in|title=MMRDA|publisher=MMRDA|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly there is Delhi Development Authority for [[Delhi]], [[Bangalore]] now called as Bengaluru has Bengaluru Development Authority, [[Kolkata]] has Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority and there is Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority for the south Indian city of [[Chennai]].

==Current practice==
The [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]] has introduced a number of additional documents that will eventually supersede those mentioned above.
These include:
*[[Development plan document]]s
*[[Regional Spatial Strategy]]

== '''''only also plan for document for loking indian resources'''''  ==
*[[Local plan]]

'''''Dinocochlea ingens''''' is a [[trace fossil]] specimen held in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] of London. It is a symmetrical [[helicospiral]] several metres in length that was famously unexplained until shown in 2009 to be a [[concretion]] formed around the burrow of a worm.&lt;ref name="Deposits"&gt;{{cite journal | title=''Dinocochlea'': the mysterious spiral of Hastings |author1=Taylor, P.D.  |author2=Sendino, C. | journal=Deposits |date=Autumn 2009 | issue=20 | pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Found in 1921 in the [[Wealden]] area of [[Sussex]] in England during construction of an [[arterial road]], ''Dinocochlea'' was originally presumed to be a fossilised [[gastropod shell]]. As such, it was given a Latin name that translates to "giant terrible snail" using the "dino-" prefix in a nod to ''[[Dinosaur]]'' ("terrible lizard") and refers to the nearby, [[paleontology|paleontologically]] significant, quarry that featured many dinosaur fossils, the "''[[Iguanodon]]'' [[Necropolis]]".&lt;ref name="Geological Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=4994768 | title=On ''Dinocochlea ingens'', n. gen. et sp., a gigantic Gastropod from the Wealden Beds near Hastings | author=Woodward, B. B. | journal=Geological Magazine | year=1922 | volume=59 | pages=242–247 | doi=10.1017/S0016756800109665}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name also gave rise to a second theory on the origin of the object - that it is a [[coprolite]] (fossilized animal dung). The gastropod theory is now considered incorrect on the basis that there were no shell traces, nor many of the features usually found in gastropod shells such as ridges, and coils tapering to a point. Furthermore, the size of ''Dinocochlea'' is much larger than any other gastropod living or extinct. The coprolite theory is also considered incorrect on the basis that partially digested organic material which would normally remain in the dung was not present. Also, whilst dung can be formed in a spiral (notably [[shark]]s due to their digestive system's [[spiral valve]]), the consistency of ''Dinocochlea'' makes this unlikely.

''Dinocochlea'' was donated to the British Museum (Natural History) (as it was known at the time, until the Natural History Museum's [[Natural History Museum, London#Separation from the British Museum|separation from the British Museum]]). However, in 1947 the [[Geologists' Association]] argued that the specimen was "...taken from the excavations without permission".&lt;ref name="Geological association"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.clarku.edu/~piltdown/map_prim_suspects/ABBOTT/Abbot_defense/5%261years.html | title=Fifty and One Years of the Geologists’ Association | accessdate=2011-01-05 | author=Kennard, A. S. | booktitle=Proceedings Geological Association | year=1947 | pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dinocochlea'' was featured in the final episode of the 2010 [[BBC]] series ''[[Museum of Life (documentary)|Museum of Life]]'' which documented the work of the Natural History Museum.&lt;ref name="Museum of Life"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/episode-six/index.html | title=Museum of Life | accessdate=2011-01-05 | year=2010 | publisher=The Natural History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fireworks of Glass Tower and Ceiling''''', also known as '''''Fireworks of Glass''''', is a blown glass sculpture installation in the permanent collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] located in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], United States of America. The tower sits on a glass base, a pergola ceiling, and rises through the center of the museum's spiraling ramp system. Created by [[Dale Chihuly]] in 2006, it is his largest permanently installed glass sculpture. Beneath the tower is an accompanying exhibit that describes the sculpture and the process by which it was made. The tower and pergola ceiling are two distinct accessioned objects in the Children's Museum's collection.&lt;ref name=TCMFOG/&gt;

==Description==
''Fireworks of Glass and Pergola Ceiling'' is a 43-foot tower composed of 3,200 pieces of red, yellow, and cobalt blue blown glass and a pergola ceiling made up of 1,600 pieces of multicolored glass. On the tower, two to four feet pieces of twisted glass are situated on a metal armature suspended by steel cables. The tower rests on a glass plate over a pergola ceiling filled with other pieces of glass. Each piece of glass was individually blown by a team of glassblowers based out of Chihuly's studio in [[Tacoma, Washington]].

The installation is made up of the main tower, which is composed of Horny and Gooseneck-shaped glass pieces, and the pergola ceiling, an area underneath the artwork that serves as the ceiling for the ''Fireworks of Glass'' exhibit in the lower level of the museum. The ceiling includes 1,600 pieces of glass in some of Chihuly's favourite shapes such as Putti, Seaforms, and Persians.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"/&gt; Other shapes represented in the ceiling are Gooseneck, Mexican hat, twisted horn, split leaf, sea tube, frog foot, starfish, and horn bale.&lt;ref name=DVD&gt;{{cite book|last=Museum of Glass.

===Exhibit===
An interactive exhibit is located on the lower level of the museum below the pergola ceiling where the tower rests. Visitors can sit on circular, rotating benches in order to look up at the pergola ceiling and observe the colours, shapes, and the light interacting with the glass. The exhibit includes hands-on elements that allow visitors to build towers using plastic pieces of coloured shapes. Computer kiosks walk the user through the glassblowing process.&lt;ref name=Exhibit&gt;{{cite web|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|title=Fireworks of Glass: The Exhibit|url=http://childrensmuseum.org/themuseum/fireworks_ofglass/exhibit.htm|work=childrensmuseum.org|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process===
{{Main|Glassblowing}}

==Acquisition==
After discussions with Children's Museum CEO Dr. Jeff Patchen in June 2001, Chihuly began sketching ideas for the tall, vertical space within the museum's ramp system. It took Chihuly and his team five years to plan and create ''Fireworks of Glass,''which was inspired by the idea of an upside down chandelier.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"/&gt; The sculpture cost a total of $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fireworks of Glass: The Art of Dale Chihuly|url=http://www.childrensmuseum.org/teachers/unitsofstudy/fireworks/uos_fireworksofglass.pdf|work=Unit of Study|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was unveiled on Saturday, 18 March 2006. Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson said of the installation, "This one of a kind work of art will serve as an icon for cultural tourism for our city."&lt;ref name="Press Release"/&gt;

===Installation===
Installation of the sculpture began in January 2006. Under the direction of Chihuly, a team of glassblowers created the 4,800 glass pieces in Tacoma, Washington before shipping them to Indianapolis in 350 cardboard boxes.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"/&gt; After completion of the glass base, three artists from Chihuly's team and six museum collections staff began carefully adding the glass pieces to the metal armature. A plastic tube was inserted into each piece of glass to protect it when placed on the armature and to hold it securely to the metal rods.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Label&gt;{{cite book|last=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|title=Interpretive label|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took 14 days for all 4,800 pieces of glass to be installed, 1,600 in the pergola ceiling and 3,200 in the tower.&lt;ref name="TCMFOG" /&gt; The team worked from the bottom of the tower to the top, using ladders and scaffolding as they went. They followed design plans created by Chihuly, but also had the freedom to make design decisions on site, depending on the surrounding museum environment.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, dust settles on the sculpture and dulls its color. Professionals come into the museum each month to dust the tower in order to restore it to its original color. Hanging from the ceiling, they are able to rappel down and reach every piece of glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiffer Named 'Official Cleaner of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis'|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1802383/swiffer_named_official_cleaner_of_the_childrens_museum_of_indianapolis/index.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum staff also clean the base and lower glass pieces on a weekly basis.&lt;ref name="Unit of Study" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Flores Historiarum''''' (Flowers of History) is the name of two different (though related) [[Latin]] [[chronicle]]s by [[English historians in the Middle Ages|medieval English historians]] that were created in the 13th century, associated originally with the [[St Albans Cathedral|Abbey of St Albans]].

== Wendover's ''Flores Historiarum'' ==
The first ''Flores Historiarum'' was created by St Albans writer, [[Roger of Wendover]], who carried his chronology from the creation up to 1235, the year before his death. Roger claims in his preface to have selected "from the books of catholic writers worthy of credit, just as flowers of various colours are gathered from various fields." Hence he also called his work ''Flores Historiarum''.  However, like most chronicles, it is now valued not so much for what was culled from previous writers, as for its full and lively narrative of contemporary events from 1215 to 1235,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/211/0919.html Volume I, Chapter IX, Section 19] of [[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the signing of [[Magna Carta]] by [[John of England|King John]] at [[Runnymede]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/runnymede.html Signing of Magna Carta, Runneymede, 1215]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has survived in one thirteenth-century manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] (Douce manuscript 207), a mutilated 14th century copy in the [[British Library]] ([[Cotton manuscript Otho]] B. v.), and in the version adapted by [[Matthew Paris]] which forms the first part of his ''[[Chronica Majora]]'' (ed. [[Henry Richards Luard]], [[Rolls Series]], seven volumes).

The sources brought together in the ''Flores'' include [[Bede]], [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], [[Sigebert of Gembloux]], [[Florence of Worcester]], [[Simeon of Durham]], [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], [[Robert de Monte]], [[William of Tyre]], [[Ralph de Diceto]], [[Benedictus Abbas]], [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Ralph of Coggeshall]] (to 1194).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Madden]] (1866), ''Historia Anglorum'', vol 3, [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisiens02parigoog#page/n32/mode/2up xxiii]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[F. M. Powicke]] (1906), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/549704?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103804285257 Roger of Wendover and the Coggeshall Chronicle], ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', '''21''' (82), pp. 286-296&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed list is given by Luard,&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Richards Luard]] (1872, 1874) ''Matthei Parisiensis Chronica Majora'', vol 1 p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien01pari#page/n45/mode/2up xxxiv] (to 1066) and vol. 2 p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien02pari#page/n23/mode/2up xiii] (to 1216)&lt;/ref&gt; who in his running text also marks up the apparent source of each section. From 1201 and through the reign of King John it draws on a source common between it and the ''Annales Sancti Edmundi'' later also used by [[John de Taxster]], and also some annals added to the St. Albans copy of Diceto.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan (1958), ''Matthew Paris'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n45/mode/2up 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

The date of creation of the earliest nucleus of the compilation has been disputed.  The manuscript in the Bodleian Library, written out ca. 1300, contains a marginal note against the annal for 1188 that reads "up to here in Abbot John's chronicle book".&lt;ref&gt;''"hic usque in lib. cronic. Johannis abbatis"''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Luard took this to mean that there had existed a core of the ''Flores'' going up to 1188, the creation of which had been supervised by [[John of Wallingford (d. 1214)|John of Wallingford]] at some point during his tenure as abbot of St Albans between 1195 and 1214.&lt;ref&gt;Luard (1874, 1880), ''Chronica Majora'', vol 2 pp.[https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien02pari#page/n21/mode/2up x-xii] and vol 7 pp [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien07pari#page/n15/mode/2up ix-xi]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, 1188 is also when the first manuscript of Matthew Paris's ''Chronica Majora'' concludes, with the end of the reign of Henry II, so an alternative view is that this may have been the chronicle book referred to, which may have been in the possession of a later Abbot John at the turn of the 14th century when the manuscript was written out.&lt;ref&gt;Madden (1866), ''Historia Anglorum'', vol 1, p [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisie01pari#page/n79/mode/2up/search/Johannis lxxi]; also Powicke (1944), Compilation of the ''Chronica Majora'', ''[[Proc. Brit. Acad.]]'' '''30''', 148–9, and Galbraith, ''Roger Wendover and Matthew Paris'', p. 16 and note 1.  Both cited by Vaughan (1958), ''Matthew Paris'', p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n43/mode/2up 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the text itself, some of the earlier parts of the work draw heavily on the ''[[Historia scholastica]]'' (ca. 1173) of [[Petrus Comestor]], a copy of which was not introduced into the monastery until John of Wallingford's abbacy.&lt;ref&gt;Luard (1872), ''Chronica Majora'', vol 1 p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien01pari#page/n43/mode/2up xxxii]; British Library, Royal MS 4 D VII ([http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=5946&amp;CollID=16&amp;NStart=40407 illustrated catalogue])&lt;/ref&gt; (Though Luard elsewhere notes some differences between the treatment of Comestor and that of some other writers).&lt;ref&gt;Luard (1872), ''Chronica Majora'', vol 1 p. [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisien01pari#page/n51/mode/2up xli]&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Diceto, which is used throughout the ''Flores'' but especially after 1066, was also not copied for the Abbey until 1204.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Liebermann]] (1888), in [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]] SS 28 pp.[http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000862_00015.html?sortIndex=010%3A050%3A0028%3A010%3A00%3A00 7-8], cited in Vaughan, ''Matthew Paris'', p.[https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n43/mode/2up 22]; British Library, Royal MS 13 E VI ([https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=5569&amp;CollID=16&amp;NStart=130506 Illustrated catalogue])&lt;/ref&gt; In its final form the annal for 1179 contains a reference to the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran|Lateran Council]] of 1215,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Madden]] (1866), ''Historia Anglorum'', vol 3, [https://archive.org/stream/matthiparisiens02parigoog#page/n32/mode/2up xxiii]&lt;/ref&gt; and Vaughan finds that all of the extant manuscripts ultimately descend from a common ancestral exemplar that can be no earlier than 1228.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, ''Matthew Paris'', p.[https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n49/mode/2up 28]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vaughan does not rule out the possibility that there might have been some earlier compilation used by Wendover,&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, ''Matthew Paris'', p.[https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n43/mode/2up 23]&lt;/ref&gt; and finds some evidence for such a compilation, extending perhaps to 1066.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, ''Matthew Paris'', pp.[https://archive.org/stream/matthewparis012094mbp#page/n117/mode/2up 96–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paris's ''Flores Historiarum'', and its continuation ==
The second and more widely distributed ''Flores Historiarum'' runs from the creation to 1326 (although some of the earlier manuscripts end at 1306). It was compiled by various persons and quickly acquired contemporary popularity, for it was continued by many hands in many manuscript traditions. Among twenty&lt;ref&gt;According to Reginald L. Poole, reviewing Luard's 1890 edition in ''The English Historical Review'' '''7''' (January 1892):146-150) p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; surviving manuscripts are those compiled at [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet Holme]], Norfolk, continued at [[Tintern Abbey]] (Royal Mss 14.c.6); at [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]] ([[Cottonian Claudius]] E 8); [[Rochester Cathedral|Rochester]] ([[Cottonian Nero]] D 2); [[St Paul's Cathedral, London|St Paul's, London]] (Lambeth Mss 1106); [[Southwark Cathedral|St Mary's, Southwark]] ([[Bodleian Library]], Rawlinson Mss B 177); and at [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's, Canterbury]] (Harleian Mss 641).&lt;ref&gt;According to Luard.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written originally at [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] and later at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The earliest manuscript, the basis for all the various continuations, was conserved in [[Chetham's Library]], Manchester.  This manuscript was carried down to 1265, with brief notes and emendations in the hand of [[Matthew Paris]]. A continuation carried the chronicle down to 1306; the continuation from 1306 to 1325/26 was compiled at Westminster by [[Robert of Reading]] (d. 1325) and another Westminster monk.

The second ''Flores Historiarum'' was for many years attributed to a "[[Matthew of Westminster]]" who [[Henry Richards Luard]] demonstrated was actually [[Matthew Paris]].

The Flores Historiarum is markedly opposed to [[Robert the Bruce]]. According to the chronicle after Bruce had had himself crowned king of Scots in the spring of 1306, Lady Elisabeth Bruce tells her husband:  "I reckon that you are a summer king; perhaps you won't be a winter one".&lt;ref&gt;John McKinnell ''Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend'' 1843840421-p 69  2005 "According to the Flores Historiarum, these were the words of Lady Elisabeth Bruce to her husband Robert after he had had himself crowned king of Scots in the spring of 1306, as part of his campaign to wrest control of ... ... The implication is of a battle between the 'kings' of Summer and Winter43 in which the 'Summer King' is killed, and also that his consort is hostile to him. We have already seen both features in. 19 Ed. Ill, 130; for other 'summer kings', see E. K. Chambers...&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FORTUNE Battle of the Corporate Bands''' is an annual music competition for amateur company-sponsored bands in the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]].  Created in 2001, the contest's proceeds benefit the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, OH]], which also serves as the location for the final round of the competition.  The FORTUNE Battle of the Corporate Bands is presented through a partnership with FORTUNE magazine and the Rock Hall, and is sponsored by the [[NAMM]] Foundation (National Association of Music Merchants), [[Gibson Guitars]], [[Marshall Fridge]] and [[Fender Premium Audio]].

The competition is sometimes billed as a "celebration of musicians with day jobs".&lt;ref name="2005results" /&gt;  As of 2013, a requirement is that all participants must be employees of the submitting company.

== Contest origin and purpose ==
The Battle of the Corporate Bands was developed as a joint effort between FORTUNE Magazine and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum to enhance the Museum's profile in the business community.  The two executives most responsible for its creation were Kip Meyer, Director of Integrated Programs for FORTUNE and FORTUNE Small Business magazines, and Steve Dobo, Director of Sponsorships and Promotions at the Rock Hall of Fame.

The competition serves multiple purposes.  First, it serves as a fundraiser for the Museum's Educational Fund.  In the 2007 contest, each entrant submitted a $200 entry fee, and each finalist's company donated $7,300 to take part in the final round.  The Museum also earns contributions from the competition's corporate sponsors and from ticket sales.

The contest also provides increased exposure to the companies which sponsor the bands, via the media attention generated by the contest, and via recaps of the contest that appear in FORTUNE magazine.

== Contest format==
The contest entry process begins early in the year, when bands submit a three-song CD to a panel of judges, typically due in late April.  During the first three years of the contest, this panel selected the eight national finalists.  For every year since then, the judging panel selects 18 US bands to participate in one of three qualifying US regional "Battles" which are held in the summer.  Locations for the US regional contests vary from year to year—the 2007 regionals were held in [[Nashville, TN]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Austin, TX]].  In 2008 a European regional was added for the first time, in [[London]], UK.  Six bands from around Europe are selected for the European regional.

At each regional event, each of the six bands performs a 20-minute set.  The judges then choose two finalists from each US regional, plus the one winner of the European regional.  After all of the regionals have been completed, the judges choose an additional one or two bands as "wild card" finalists, typically making eight finalists in all.

In some years, a finalist is included from Australia.  Since 2004, [[Telstra]], an Australian telecommunications and information services company, has sponsored their own national competition, called ROCKINC.  The winner of ROCKINC is automatically entitled to a spot in the FORTUNE competition final.

On the day of the finals, held at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in October, each band performs a 30-minute non-judged showcase for the public during the day.  That evening, each band plays a 15-minute set for a panel of music industry judges.  The judges will then select a winner, dubbed "The Best Corporate Band in America" for that year, along with 2nd and 3rd-place winners.

==Contest awards==
Members of the winning band receive an expenses-paid trip to the annual [[NAMM Show]], where they will be a featured performer.  In 2007, Continental Airlines also awarded two airline tickets for each member of the winning band.  The band also has its name and photo displayed at the Rock Hall of Fame for one year as part of a permanent exhibit honoring the event.  The winning band also receives a "gold record" trophy, along with varsity jackets embroidered with their band's name and the contest logo. First-place bands are not allowed to enter the competition again.

Awards are also given to individuals for Best Guitarist, Best Bass Player, Best Keyboardist, Best Vocalist, Best Horn and Best Drummer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">In '''''Fuel Retailers Association of SA v Motor Industry Bargaining Council''''', an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[labour law]], the Fuel Retailers Association (FRA) tried more than once to join a bargaining council, but because the council took the view that the FRA was not sufficiently representative to meet the requirements of the [[constitution]], the application was refused. The Labour Court held that, when considering whether or not to order the admission of the new member, it had to consider the following:

* whether the party seeking admission falls within the registered scope of the council;
* the representivity of the council;
* whether it is sufficiently representative;
* stability in the industry; and
* the reasons advanced by the parties for objecting to the admission.

Other relevant factors include

* other advantages to the industry;
* whether the admission would promote orderly [[collective bargaining]]; and
* the extent to which the applicant party may disrupt the working of the bargaining council.

The Labour Court also considered any possible contribution to the organisational [[diversity (business)|diversity]] of the council within its sector and area, the threshold for admission and other requirements of the constitution of the bargaining council.

The court concluded that the FRA should be admitted as a new member, and made an [[Court order|order]] to that effect.

'''''Ganlu Zishu''''' ({{zh|干祿字書}} "Character Book for Seeking an Official Emolument") is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[orthography]] dictionary of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. The first surviving orthographical dictionary for the [[regular script]], it was authored by Yan Yuansun (顏元孫), a descendant of the famous scholar [[Yan Shigu]]. It is roughly based on Yan Shigu's work ''Ziyang'' (字樣 "Character Samples"), now surviving only in fragments. It was meant to be an official guide for the use of those who took the [[Imperial examination]], thus the title "Ganlu", an allusion to the ''[[Analects]]'' (2:18).

The work comprises about 800 [[Chinese character|character]]s (excluding variants). The characters are collated by [[tone name|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]] (approximately those used in ''[[Qieyun]]''). The variants of a character are divided into three types: the "standard" (正 ''zheng''), the "acceptable" (通 ''tong'') and the "vulgar" (俗 ''su''). Not every character has all the three types of variant. The examinees were supposed to use the "standard" form of a character.

The text was carved on stone with the calligraphy of [[Yan Zhenqing]], nephew of Yan Yuansun. The stone has worn out, though.

}}

The '''''Gesta principum Polonorum''''' ({{lang-en|Deeds of the Princes of the Poles}}) is a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] ''gesta'', or deeds narrative, concerned with Duke [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]], his ancestors, and the Polish principality during and before his reign. Probably completed between 1112 and 1118, the extant text is present in three manuscripts with two distinct traditions. Its author, though anonymous, is traditionally called [[Gallus Anonymous|Gallus]] (a name which means "Irish") probably a non-Pole connected with the [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|monastery of Saint-Gilles]] or elsewhere in [[western Europe]].

The book is one of the earliest written documents on the history of [[Poland]], but also gives a unique Eastern European perspective on the general history of Europe, supplementing what has been handed down by Western and Southern European historians. It pre-dates the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' and the next major source on early history of Poland, the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae]]'', by roughly a century.

==Title==
[[File:Prima Pagina Chronicae Galli Anonymi Polona.jpg|thumb|418x418px|Beginning of ''Gesta principum Polonorum'' (Codex Zamoyscianus held at the [[National Library of Poland]]).]]
The title intended for or originally given to the work is not clear. In the initial [[Manuscript capital|capital]] of the text in the Zamoyski Codex, a [[rubric]] styles the work the ''Cronica Polonorum'', while in the same manuscript the [[Proem|preface]] of Book I opens with ''Incipiunt Cronice et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum'' ("[Here] begins the chronicles and deeds of the dukes or princes of the Poles").&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxiv; p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incipit]] for Book II entitles the work ''Liber Tertii Bolezlaui'' ("Book of Bolesław III"), and that for Book III ''Liber de Gestis Boleslaui III'' ("Book of the Deeds of Bolesław III").&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. 116, 210&lt;/ref&gt; These however are not reliable as such things are often added later.&lt;ref name="GPP-xxiV"/&gt;

The latest editors and only English translators of the text style it ''Gesta principum Polonorum'' ("the deeds of the princes of the Poles"), primarily to acknowledge its faith with the ''gesta'' genre (and the likely authenticity of this part of the title) and to avoid confusion with the later work known as the ''[[Chronica principum Poloniae]]'' ("chronicle of the princes of Poland").&lt;ref name=GPP-xivn&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxiv, &amp; n. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
{{main|Gallus Anonymous}}
The author of the ''Gesta'' is unknown, but is referred to by historigraphic convention as "Gallus", a Latin word for a "person from France or Gaul" (though also, potentially, a forename). The only source for ''Gallus''' existence comes not from the text but rather from a note made by historian and [[Bishop of Warmia]] [[Martin Kromer]] (1512&amp;ndash;89) in the margin of folio 119 of the "Heilsberg manuscript".&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', pp. 2&amp;ndash;3, n. 3; Knoll and Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. xxiv&amp;ndash;v&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known why Bishop Kromer called the author ''Gallus''.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxv&gt;Knoll and Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gottfried Lengnich's printed edition, Lengnich named the author as "Martin Gallus" based on a misreading of [[Jan Długosz]], where Gallus was conflated with [[Martin of Opava]].&lt;ref name=GPP-xxv/&gt; Martin Gallus became the standard name in German scholarship for some time to come, though this identification is now rejected by most historians.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxv/&gt; Historian [[Maximilian Gumplowicz]] identified the author as Baldwin Gallus,&lt;ref&gt;Glumpowicz, ''Bischof Balduin'', passim&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly [[Bishop of Kruszwica]], though likewise this theory has failed to gain general acceptance.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxv/&gt;

There have been frequent attempts to identify Gallus' origins from clues in the text . Marian Plezia and Pierre David both argued that Gallus came from [[Provence]] in what is now southern France, and was closely connected with the Benedictine [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|monastery of Saint-Gilles]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', p. 3, n. 5 for references&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian, Karol Maleczyński, argued that the evidence suggests a connection with [[Flanders]],&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', p. 3, n. 6 for references&lt;/ref&gt; while Danuta Borawska and Tomasz Jasiński have argued based on stylistic evidence that he was connected with [[Venice]] and that he authored an anonymous ''translatio'' of St Nicholas.&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', p. 3, n. 7 for detail and references&lt;/ref&gt; Marian Plezia argued in 1984 that his writing style suggests an education in one of the schools of central France, likely [[Tours]] or [[Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', p. 3, n. 8 for reference; Plezia, "Nowe Studia", pp. 111&amp;ndash;20&lt;/ref&gt;

Plezia and others further argue that Gallus' extensive knowledge of Hungary testify to connections there, postulating a connection to the Benedictine monastery of [[Somogyvár]] in Hungary, a daughter-house of St Gilles'.&lt;ref&gt;Dalewski, ''Ritual and Politics'', pp. 3&amp;ndash;4, n. 9 for references&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have been closely connected to the Awdańcy clan, a kindred of Norse or Rus origin who had been successful under Boleslaw II, and who had been exiled to Hungary but returned to prominence in Polish affairs during the reign of Boleslaw III.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxxii&amp;ndash;xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt; As he stated that "the city of Gniezno ... means "nest" in Slavic", it is thought that the author may have known the language of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. 16, n. 2&lt;/ref&gt; All that is certain is that he was a monk and a non-Slav living in Poland, perhaps on a Polish [[benefice]].&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, "On Not Eating Polish Bread in Vain", pp. 275&amp;ndash;89; Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
Generally, it is thought that the original text was composed at some point between 1112 and 1117.&lt;ref&gt;Tymowski, "Oral Tradition", p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; The dedicatory letter on the preface of the ''Gesta'' fixes completion of the origin text between 1112 and 1118.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxxi&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; The last event mentioned in the work is the pilgrimage of Boleslaw III to [[Székesfehérvár]] in Hungary, which occurred in either 1112 or 1113.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxxi/&gt; The work was almost certainly completed before the revolt of [[Skarbimir]] in 1117–18.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxxi/&gt; There is some evidence that several interpolations were added subsequently. For instance, there is reference to the descendants of Duke [[Swietobor I, Duke of Pomerania|Swietobor of Pomerania]] (ii.29).&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxxi, n. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts and prints==
The ''Gesta'' is not extant in the original, but instead survives in three different manuscripts representing two different traditions. The Codex Zamoyscianus (Z) and Codex Czartoryscianus (S) represent the first, and earliest documented tradition, the latter being derived from the former. The Heilsberg codex, though later and surviving in less detail, is an independent witness to the text and constitutes the second distinct tradition.

===Codex Zamoyscianus===
The earliest version lies in the manuscript known as the ''Codex Zamoyscianus'' or ''Zamoyski Codex''.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xx&lt;/ref&gt; This was written down in the late 14th-century, probably in [[Kraków]] between 1380 and 1392.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; It was located in the library of the Łaski family until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; Thereabouts Sandivogius (Sędziwój) of Czechłoj (d. 1476), a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Gniezno Cathedral]] and friend of the historian [[Jan Długosz]], came into possession of it.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; It was later in the library of the [[count]]s of [[Zamość]], but is now in the [[National Library in Warsaw]]  as ''Ms. BOZ cim. 28''.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt;

===Codex Czartoryscianus===
A second version of the ''Gesta'' lies in the ''Codex Czartoryscianus'', also called the ''Sędziwój Codex''.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; Between 1434 and 1439 Sandivogius of Czechło had a second copy made for him, produced from the version in the ''Codex Zamoyscianus''.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; As it is a direct copy, its usefulness is limited in reconstructing the original text.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; This version currently lies in the [[Czartoryski Museum]] of Kraków, ''Ms. 1310'', fols. 242&amp;ndash;307.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt;

===Heilsberg Codex===
The third and latest witness to the text is the version in the so-called Heilsberg Codex.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; This version was written down between 1469 and 1471, based on an earlier version.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; The latter had been written at Kraków around 1330, was in [[Łekno]] monastery (Greater Poland) in 1378, and had been transferred to the monastery at [[Trzemeszno]] before coming into the hands of [[Martin Kromer]], Bishop of Warmia (1579&amp;ndash;1589).&lt;ref name=GPP-xxxxi&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. xx&amp;ndash;xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the mid-16th century and the 18th century, the manuscript was located in the German-speaking Prussian town of Heilsberg (today the Polish town of [[Lidzbark Warmiński]]), hence the name.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt; Unlike the version in the ''Codex Czartoryscianus'', this is an independent witness to the original text.  It is currently in the National Library in Warsaw as ''Ms. 8006'', fols. 119&amp;ndash;247.&lt;ref name=GPP-xx/&gt;

The Heilsberg text omits large sections of text present in the other two manuscripts, for instance omitting several chapters like 27 and 28 in Book I.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxi&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed editions==
The text of the ''Gesta'' was printed for the first time in 1749, when an edition based on the Heilsberg Codex was published by [[Gottfried Lengnich]], reprinted two decades later by Laurence Mizler de Kolof, and has since been printed in many editions.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxii&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Wincenty Bandtkie, who also used Heilsberg, was the first to utilise the Codex Zamoyscianus tradition.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxii/&gt; As the Heilsberg Codex was "lost" between the 1830s and the 1890s, texts in this period make no original use of it.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxii/&gt; Finkel &amp; Kętrzyński's 1898 edition likewise makes no use of Heilsberg.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxiii&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Krzyżanowski produced the first facsimile in the 1940s, while in the 1950s Karol Maleczyński's edition was the first to collate all three manuscripts.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxiii/&gt;

The text has been fully translated several times. It was translated into Polish by Roman Grodescki by 1923, though this was not published until 1965.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxiV&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', p. xxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a Russian translation in 1961, a German translation in 1978 and an English translation in 2003.&lt;ref name=GPP-xxiV/&gt;

==The narrative==
The work begins with an address and dedication to [[Martin of Gniezno|Martin]], [[Archbishop of Gniezno]], and to the bishops of Poland's regions, Simon ([[Bishop of Plock]], c. 1102&amp;ndash;29), Paul ([[Bishop of Poznań]], 1098&amp;ndash;c. 1112), Maurus ([[Bishop of Kraków]], 1110&amp;ndash;18) and Zyroslaw ([[Bishop of Wroclaw]], 1112&amp;ndash;20).&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. 2&amp;ndash;3, and ns. 2&amp;ndash;4&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Bisson argued that the text was primarily written in the ''[[gesta (genre)|gesta]]'' [[genre]] of Latin literature as a celebration of Duke [[Boleslaw III Wrymouth]], defending his actions and legimizing his dynasty (compare the near-contemporary ''Deeds of Louis the Fat'').&lt;ref&gt;See Bisson, "On Not Eating Polish Bread in Vain", pp. 275&amp;ndash;89&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is divided into three books, focused on genealogy, politics and warfare. Book one, of 31 chapters, treats the deeds of the ancestors of Boleslaw III (beginning with the legendary [[Piast the Wheelwright]]), and their wars against the Germans and Slavic peoples such as the [[Rus' people|Rus]], the [[Bohemians]], the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|Pomeranians]] and the [[Mazovia]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. 3&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt; The first Book claims to rely on oral tradition, and is largely legendary in character until the reign of [[Mieszko I]].&lt;ref&gt;Tymowski, "Oral Tradition", pp. 243&amp;ndash;45&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier material tells of the rises of the Piasts from peasants to ruler, a tale common in early Slavonic folk-myth.&lt;ref&gt;Tymowski, "Oral Tradition", pp. 251&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;

Book two, of 50 chapters, traces the birth of Boleslaw, his boyhood deeds and documents the wars waged by himself and "count palatine" Skarbimir against the Pomeranians.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. 117&amp;ndash;209&lt;/ref&gt; Book three, of 26 chapters, continues the story of the wars waged by Boleslaw and the Poles against the Pomeranians, the war against the German emperor [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Heinrich V]] and the Bohemians, and against the Baltic [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].&lt;ref&gt;Knoll &amp; Schaer (eds.), ''Gesta Principum Polonorum'', pp. 211&amp;ndash;87&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many stories of '''ghosts in Spanish-speaking cultures'''. The Spanish language is second only in number of native speakers to [[Mandarin Chinese]], the tongue of over 360 million people. Ghost stories exist throughout Spanish-speaking America and in Spain.

== Argentina ==
In the Pampas, and particularly in [[Carro Quemado]], the ghost of a colonel on horseback galloping in search of his soldiers killed by the Indians appears from time to time.

In a dwelling in [[Neuquén]] in the [[Patagonia]] region of Argentina, there are sudden strange fires that the fire department is unable to explain, and in which some have seen ghost appearances.

In the city of [[Buenos Aires]] is said that in the church "St. Felicitas", located between Finch Street and Isabel La Católica, you can spot the ghost of [[Felicitas Guerrero]] and that if a tissue is left in the church at night, the next day it appears bathed with tears.

== Mexico ==
{{main|Ghosts in Mexican culture}}
There is extensive and varied belief in ghosts in Mexican culture. The modern state of Mexico before the Spanish conquest was inhabited by diverse peoples such as the Maya and Aztec, and their beliefs have survived and evolved, combined with the beliefs of the Spanish colonists. The Day of the Dead incorporates pre-Columbian beliefs with Christian elements. Mexican literature and movies include many stories of ghosts interacting with the living.

== Peru ==
Ghosts that appear on the second floor of Casa Matusita in downtown [[Lima]], at the intersection of Avenues Spain and Garcilaso de la Vega, seem to be particularly intense, including poltergeists and apparitions, and it is said that the Argentine comedian Humberto Vera Vilchez was driven mad there. The legend is that a man lived in this house who mistreated his two servants. One day, when he offered a lunch to some guests, the servants decided to get revenge and put a substance in food, not to kill his boss, but to cause mental disorders. After serving and while awaiting results of their macabre plan, they suddenly heard noises and screams coming from the room and came back. The picture was terrifying: mangled bodies everywhere, blood on the walls, on the table, on the ground, all the guests, including his boss, had found a tragic death, violent and terrifying. The curious thing about this house is that the paranormal events happen on the second floor and therefore the first floor is rented. It is said that no one can spend five minutes there.

The Castillo Real Felipe is located in the city of [[El Callao]] port of the capital Lima.
Among other legends are that the ghost of an eighteenth-century viceroy appears every night on the stairs and rooms of the castle dungeons, leading many soldiers. Also, chilling screams are heard in the dungeons.

The Galician [[Santa Compaña]] Guestier Asturian or Estadea, Estantiga or phantom Castilian is an ancient procession of candle-lit ghosts that gives very bad luck and portends death, like the [[banshee]] in [[Ireland]].

La Velilla bell has long sounded in [[Aragon]] with nobody touching it to warn of the deaths and deaths of notable people, kings, emperors and so on. Father [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro]] attempted to rationalize the fact without getting much clearer.

The House of Seven Chimneys of Madrid is haunted by the ghost of a young bride who died of sorrow when her husband, a young captain, died in the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of San Quentin]]. In the same place his father committed suicide by hanging himself in one of the beams of the mansion. It is said that she was the mistress of the king, who sent her husband into battle to die, and subsequently the father imprisoned the young woman to commit incest. A [[White Lady (ghost)|white lady]] appears bearing a torch on certain nights. There is also talk of a girl married to a rich old man who was stabbed to death in his basement.

On the island of [[Tenerife]] lies the ''Lercaro Palace'', now the [[Museum of the History of Tenerife]], located in the city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]]. In this mansion legend appears the ghost of [[Catalina Lercaro]], who according to legend committed suicide by throwing herself into a well of her mansion when she was forced to marry a man she did not love. It is one of the most famous ghost stories in Spain.

On [[Monasterio de Madrid]] street there is an antiquarian shop, "El baúl del monje", in a house where a lawyer was killed earlier in a violent fire. When renovations were undertaken in 1998 of the most violent [[poltergeist]] episodes occurred to have been documented in Spain: lamps  moved, objects and statues moved and collided, doors slammed, there were strange noises, furniture was placed in the corridor to block passage, and out of circulation coins, buttons, broken glass and chunks of charred wood fell from the roof. Electromagnetic distortions cancelled the Earth's magnetic field, bringing it to zero.

Perhaps the first documented case of poltergeists in Spain was in 1724, when the doctor and writer [[Diego de Torres Villarroel]] went called to the house of the Countess of Arcos, located on Fuencarral to witness a paranormal phenomenon. He himself wrote in his life: "I can assure that for fifteen nights I was sleepless and restless, I heard horrible noises ... so out of natural order, such as the pictures being taken down without falling from the nail or the ring, locked doors being opened, plates rolling  without breaking ..." All the servants had locked themselves away from fear of suffering from the phenomena, which consisted of repeated blows and movements of objects. The poet watched the fall of several tables in a room. He could not find the source of these sounds, although it was clear that this was not a joke.

The [[Conde Estruch]] is a Spanish-Catalan version of Count Dracula, but since the [[Castillo de Llers]] was destroyed in the Civil War, he has nowhere to appear.

[[Sevilla]] is a city with a rich history that also has quite a few ghosts. The best documented is that of Sister Ursula, a nun of the Order of Charity who appears in the Hospital of the Five Wounds, a Renaissance building which now houses the Parliament of Andalusia. Wander through the corridors of the building and frequent sick room and the old sacristy. The Diputación de Sevilla ghosts wander the corridors of the old barracks. No one dares to walk along the Green Street last Friday night of each month, where there is a narrow passage from the old Jewish quarter. There is also a gentleman in a cloak and ruff inhabiting the high street pharmacy Franks.

On the palace of the Plaza de Santa Eulalia in [[Murcia]] a woman appears every night on the roof screaming terrible cries. In the eleventh century, the Saavedra family lived in the palace and the wife of one of the aristocrats was unfaithful.

On the [[Castillo de la Concepción]] in [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] a woman appears at night who was sandwiched between the walls. Cries are in the drains of the municipal library Sewer in the evenings. The building was headquarters of the [[Inquisition]] in the eighteenth century.

In the former tuberculosis sanatorium in [[Sierra Espuña]], closed in 1962, the ghost of a woman appears and Poltergeist phenomena occur such as windows and doors closing suddenly.

In the palace of the Servants of Jesus Street (Murcia), a nobleman beheaded a novice whom he loved. Since then, strange phenomena occur.

In the [[Murcia]] coast several ghosts have been seen, such as a Russian princess who was killed by the owner of the [[Isla del Barón]], or the ghost ship that according to the fishermen have seen in the early hours of the Virgin.

The Cornudilla is a ghost town that belongs to the town of Requena, very close to the villages of Marcos and Ruices. During the fifties there was a lot of paranormal activity there, especially in The House of Noise, of which now only some walls are left standing.

In the pub "El Granero" in the city of [[Granada]] a monk named Lorenzo appears. It is in part of the [[Palacio de Abrantes]], which was built in the sixteenth century.

== Venezuela ==
The Silbón (Warbler) according to legend is the ghost of a young man who killed his father to eat his offal, and is therefore doomed to wander like a lost soul forever carrying a bag filled with his family's bones. The ghost was named for its distinctive whistle, an omen of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |language=Spanish

 |accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A version of the legend in the eastern plains of Colombia says the Silbón is a lost soul of a womanizer who died alone and abandoned and seeks company. Another version says he chases pregnant women, delivering a long, sharp whistle that creates an intense cold that enters through the ears and freezes people. When the whistle is sharp a woman will die, but if it is blurred, a man dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Icones Plantarum''''' is an extensive series of published volumes of [[botanical illustration]], initiated by Sir [[William Jackson Hooker]]. The Latin name of the work means "Illustrations of Plants". The illustrations are drawn from herbarium specimens of Hooker's herbarium, and subsequently the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|herbarium of Kew Gardens]]. Hooker was the author of the first ten volumes, produced 1837-1854. His son, Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], was responsible for Volumes XI-XIX (most of Series III). [[Daniel Oliver]] was the editor of Volumes XX-XXIV. His successor was [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer]]. The series now comprises forty volumes.

'''Jean Paul Getty''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|ɛ|t|i}}; December 15, 1892 – June 6, 1976), known widely as J. Paul Getty, was a [[British American]] petrol-industrialist,&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite web|first=Alden|last=Whitman|author-link=Alden Whitman|title=J.

Despite his vast wealth, Getty was famously [[Frugality|frugal]], notably [[John Paul Getty III#Kidnapping|negotiating his grandson's Italian kidnapping ransom]] in 1973.

Getty was an avid collector of [[art]] and [[antiquities]]; his collection formed the basis of the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], and over $661 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|0.661|1976|r=1}} billion in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) of his estate was left to the museum after his death.&lt;ref name=Lenzner/&gt; He established the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]] in 1953. The trust is the world's wealthiest art institution, and operates the J. Paul Getty Museum Complexes: The [[Getty Center]], The [[Getty Villa]] and the [[Getty Foundation]], the [[Getty Research Institute]], and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Wyatt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/arts/design/30gett.html|title=Getty Fees and Budget Reassessed|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=March 30, 2018|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Getty was born into an Irish-Scots family in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to Sarah Catherine McPherson (Risher) and [[George Getty]], who was an attorney in the [[insurance]] industry. Paul was raised to be a [[Methodist]] by his parents, his father was a devout [[Christian Scientist]] and both were strict [[teetotalers]]. In 1903, when Paul was 10 years old, George Getty travelled to [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma|Bartlesville]], [[Oklahoma]], and bought the [[mineral rights]] for 1,100 acres of land. Within a few years Getty had established wells on the land which were producing 100,000 barrels of [[crude oil]] a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As newly-minted millionaires, the family moved to [[Los Angeles]] to escape the harsh Minnesota winters. At age 14 Paul attended [[Harvard Military School]] for a year, followed by [[John H. Francis Polytechnic High School|Polytechnic High School]], where he was given the nickname "Dictionary Getty" because of his love of reading.&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"&gt;{{cite article| url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1215.html| title=J. Paul Getty Dead at 83; Amassed Billions from Oil| author=Alden Whitman| publisher=New York Times| date=1976-06-06| access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became fluent in [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] - over the course of his business life he would also become conversational in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. A love of the [[Classics]] also led him to acquire reading proficiency in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Southern California]], then at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but left both before obtaining a degree. Enamored with Europe after travelling abroad with his parents in 1910, on November 28, 1912, Paul enrolled at the [[University of Oxford]]. A [[letter of introduction]] by then-[[President of the United States]] [[William Howard Taft]] enabled him to gain independent instruction from tutors at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]. Although he did not belong to Magdalen, he claimed that the aristocratic students "accepted me as one of their own", and he would fondly boast of the friends he made, including [[Edward VIII]], the future [[King of the United Kingdom]] and [[Emperor of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson|title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City| p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his degree in Economics and Political Science in 1914, then spent months travelling throughout Europe and [[Egypt]], before meeting his parents in [[Paris]] and returning with them to America in June 1914.

==Career==
In the autumn of 1914, George Getty gave his son $10,000 to invest in expanding the family's oil field holdings in Oklahoma. The first lot he bought, the Nancy Taylor No. 1 Oil Well Site near [[Haskell, Oklahoma]], was crucial to his early financial success. It struck oil in August 1915 and by the next summer the 40% net production royalty he accrued from it had made him a millionaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Getty returned to business in Oklahoma. During the 1920s, he added about $3 million to his already sizable estate. His succession of marriages and divorces (three during the 1920s, five throughout his life) so distressed his father, however, that J. Paul inherited a mere $500,000 (approximately ${{Inflation|US|.5|1930|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) of the $10 million fortune (approximately ${{Inflation|US|10|1930|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) his father George had left at the time of his death in 1930. He was left with one-third of the stock from George Getty Inc., while his mother received the other two thirds, giving her a controlling interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, his mother convinced him to contribute to the establishment of a $3.368 million (about $62.5 million in 2018) [[investment trust]], called the Sarah C. Getty Trust, to ensure that the family's ever-growing wealth could be channeled into a tax-free, secure income for future generations of the Getty family. The trust enabled J. Paul to have easy access to ready capital, which at the time he was funneling into the purchase of [[Tidewater Petroleum]] stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=63–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shrewdly investing his resources during the [[Great Depression]], Getty acquired [[Pacific Western Oil|Pacific Western Oil Corporation]], and he began the acquisition (completed in 1953) of the Mission Corporation, which included [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater Oil]] and [[Skelly Oil]]. In 1967 the billionaire merged these holdings into Getty Oil.

Beginning in 1949, Getty paid [[Ibn Saud]] $9.5 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|9.5|1949|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) in cash and $1 million a year for a 60-year concession to a tract of barren land near the border of [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. No oil had ever been discovered there, and none appeared until four years had passed, and $30 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|30|1953|r=2}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) had been spent. From 1953 onward, Getty's gamble produced {{convert|16000000|oilbbl}} a year, which contributed greatly to the fortune responsible for making him one of the richest people in the world.

Getty increased the family wealth, learning to speak Arabic, which enabled his unparalleled expansion into the [[Middle East]]. Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses, including Getty Oil. Associates identified his overall wealth at between $2 billion and $4 billion. It didn't come easily, perhaps inspiring Getty's widely quoted remark—"The meek shall inherit the earth, but not its mineral rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thoughts.forbes.com/thoughts/business-j-paul-getty-the-meek-shall "Thoughts On The Business Of Life"] at [[Forbes magazine|''Forbes'']]&lt;/ref&gt; J. Paul Getty was an owner of [[Getty Oil]], Getty Inc., George F. Getty Inc., Pacific Western Oil Corporation, Mission Corporation, Mission Development Company, [[Tidewater Oil]], [[Skelly Oil]], Mexican Seaboard Oil, Petroleum Corporation of America, [[Spartan Aircraft Company]], Spartan Cafeteria Company, Minnehoma Insurance Company, Minnehoma Financial Company, [[Pierre Hotel]] at Fifth Avenue and East 61st Street (NYC), Pierre Marques Hotel at Revolcadero Beach near Acapulco, Mexico, a 15th-century palace and nearby castle at Ladispoli on the coast northwest of Rome, a Malibu ranch home and [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]], a 72-room mansion near [[Guildford, Surrey]], 35 miles from London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Clyde H.|last=Farnsworth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/30/surrey-estate-seat-of-getty-empire.html|title=Surrey Estate Seat of Getty Empire|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 30, 1964|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved to [[the United Kingdom|Britain]] in the 1950s and became a prominent [[Anglophile|admirer]] of England, its people, and its culture. He lived and worked at his 16th-century [[Tudor period|Tudor]] estate, [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]]; the traditional country house became the centre of Getty Oil and his associated companies and he used the estate to entertain his British and Arabian friends (including the [[Rothschild banking family of England|British Rothschild family]] and numerous rulers of Middle Eastern countries). Getty lived the rest of his life in England, dying of [[heart failure]] at the age of 83 on June 6, 1976.

===Art collection===
Getty's first forays into collecting began in the late 1930s, when he took inspiration from the collection of 18th-century French paintings and furniture owned by the landlord of his New York City penthouse, Mrs. Amy Guest, a relation of [[Sir Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fell in love with 18th-century France and began buying furniture from the period at knock-down prices because of the still-depressed art market. He wrote several books on collecting: ''Europe and the 18th Century'' (1949), ''Collector's Choice: The Chronicle of an Artistic Odyssey through Europe'' (1955) and ''The Joys of Collecting'' (1965). The overwhelming goal in his collecting was to buy items at a bargain which would offer a sure return on his investment. His stinginess limited the range of his collecting because he refused to pay full-price: his companion in later life, Penelope Kitson, would comment that "Paul was really too mean ever to allow himself to buy a great painting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, at the time of his death he owned more than 600 items valued at over $4 million (approximately $17.5 million in 2018 USD), including paintings by [[Rubens]], [[Titian]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], [[Renoir]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Degas]], and [[Monet]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; During the 1950s, Getty's interests shifted to [[Greco-Roman]] sculpture, which led to the building of the [[Getty Villa]] in the 1970s to house the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These items were transferred to the [[Getty Museum]] and the Getty Villa in Los Angeles after his death.

==Marriages, divorces and children==
Getty was a notorious womanizer from the time of his youth, something which horrified his conservative Christian parents. His lawyer Robin Lund once said that "Paul could hardly ever say 'no' to a woman, or 'yes' to a man." &lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/fx-trust-john-paul-getty-girlfriends|title= Yes, J.

In late 1917 he agreed to a settlement of $10,000, upon which she left town with the baby and was never heard of again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Pearson| title=Painfully Rich| year=1995| publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|location=New York City|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-23/books/bk-5461_1_j-paul-getty| title=The Great Getty : THE LIFE AND LOVES OF J.

Because he was in the midst of his divorce from Adolphine, the couple had to wait two years before they married. He was largely absent during their marriage, staying for long stretches of time in Europe. In 1936 she sued him for divorce, alleging emotional abuse and neglect. She also described an incident while the two were abroad in [[Italy]], in which she claimed Getty had forced her to climb to view the crater of [[Mount Vesuvius]] while she was heavily pregnant with their first son.&lt;ref name="autogenerated71"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided in her favor and she was awarded $2,500 per month [[alimony]] plus $1,000 each in [[child support]] for her sons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated71"/&gt;

Timmy died at age 12, and Getty, living in England apart from his wife and son back in the U.S., did not attend the funeral.

==Kidnapping of grandson John Paul Getty III==
{{Main|John Paul Getty III}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:As I See It.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''As I See It'', Getty's autobiography{{deletable image-caption|Wednesday, 21 February 2018|PROD}}]] --&gt;
On July 10, 1973, in Rome, [['Ndrangheta]] kidnappers abducted Getty's 16-year-old grandson, [[John Paul Getty III]], and demanded by telephone a $17 million payment (approximately [[United States dollar|$]]{{Inflation|US|17|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) for the young man's safe return. However, "the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather."&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1427781/Sir-Paul-Getty.html|title=Sir Paul Getty (obituary)|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|location=London, England|date=April 17, 2003|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Paul Getty Jr.]] asked his father for the money, but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1386478.stm|title=Profile: Sir John Paul Getty II|publisher=BBC News|location=London, England|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike.&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit/&gt; The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid $3.2 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|3.2|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}): "This is Paul's ear. If we don't get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits."&lt;ref name=TelegraphPaulObit/&gt;

When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to $3 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|3|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}), Getty senior agreed to pay no more than $2.2 million (approximately ${{Inflation|US|2.2|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) – the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining $800,000 (approximately ${{Inflation|US|.8|1973|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a [[Lauria]] filling station, in the [[province of Potenza]], shortly after the ransom was paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ilpost.it/2013/07/10/paul-getty/2/|work=[[Il Post]]|title=Il rapimento di Paul Getty|language= it|date= July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but, it is claimed, Getty refused to come to the phone.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Bruce|last=Weber|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/europe/08gettyobit.html |title=J. Paul Getty III, 54, Dies; Had Ear Cut Off by Captors|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=February 7, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011, at the age of 54.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added:

{{quote|The second reason for my refusal was much broader-based. I contend that acceding to the demands of criminals and terrorists merely guarantees the continuing increase and spread of lawlessness, violence and such outrages as terror-bombings, "skyjackings" and the slaughter of hostages that plague our present-day world. (Getty, 1976, p. 139).}}

==Reputation for frugality==
Many anecdotal stories exist of Getty's reputed thriftiness and parsimony, which struck observers as comical, even perverse, because of his extreme wealth.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"&gt;{{cite article| first=Elana| last=Nicolaou| url=//www.refinery29.com/2018/03/194296/was-jp-getty-cheap-refused-paying-ransom-trust-drama?bucketed=true| title=Was J Paul Getty Really THAT Cheap?| publisher=[[Refinery29|Refinery29.com]]|location=New York City| date=March 25, 2018| access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most widely known examples are his reluctance to pay his grandson's $17 million Italian kidnapping ransom, and the notorious pay-phone which he had installed at Sutton Place. A darker incident was his fifth wife's claim that Getty had scolded her for spending too much on their terminally ill son's medical treatment, though he was worth tens of millions of dollars at the time.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt; He was well known for bargaining on almost everything to obtain a rock-bottom price, including suites at luxury hotels and virtually all purchases like art work and real estate. Sutton Place, for instance, a 72-room mansion, was purchased from [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland]] in 1959 for the extremely low price of ₤60,000, about half of what the Duke had paid when he bought it 40 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*His secretary claimed that Getty did his own laundry by hand, because he didn't want to pay for his clothes to be laundered, and when his shirts would become frayed at the cuffs, he would simply trim off the frayed part instead of purchasing new shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first=Debbie|last=Jackson|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/throwback-tulsa-billionaire-j-paul-getty-got-his-start-in/article_52fe4523-5205-5022-b612-c053c31312b4.html| title=Throwback Tulsa: Billionaire J. Paul Getty got his start in Tulsa | work=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=BH Media|location=Tulsa, Oklahoma|date=December 10, 2017| access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Re-using stationery was another obsession of Getty's. He had a habit of writing responses to letters on the margins or back sides and mailing them back, rather than use a new sheet of paper. He also carefully saved and re-used [[manila envelope]]s, rubber bands, and other office supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=69, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*When Getty took a group of friends to a dog show in London, he made them walk around the block for 10 minutes until the tickets became half-priced at 5 pm, because he didn't want to pay the full 5 [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]] per head (about ₤12/$17 in 2018).&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt;  
*His decision to move to Sutton Place was made in part because the [[cost of living]] was cheaper than in [[London]], where he had resided at the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz]]. He once boasted to American columnist [[Art Buchwald]] that it cost 10 cents for a [[rum and coke]] at Sutton Place, whereas at the Ritz it was over a dollar.&lt;ref name="Refinery29.com"/&gt;

Author [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]] attributed part of this extreme penny-pinching to the [[Methodist]] sensibility of Getty's upbringing, which emphasized modest living and personal economy. His business-like attention to the bottom-line was also a major factor: "He would allow himself no self-indulgence in the purchase of a place to live, a work of art, even a piece of furniture, unless he could convince himself that it would appreciate in value."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty himself claimed that his frugality towards others was a response to people taking advantage of him and not paying their fair share: "It's not the money I object to, it's the principle of the thing that bothers me ..."&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt;

===Coin-box telephone===
Getty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place, helping to seal his reputation as a miser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/all-the-money-in-the-world-j-paul-getty|title=The Enigma of J. Paul Getty, the One-Time Richest Man in the World|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=December 22, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty placed dial-locks on all the regular telephones, limiting their use to authorized staff, and the coin-box telephone was installed for others. In his autobiography, he described his reasons:

{{quote|Now, for months after [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]] was purchased, great numbers of people came in and out of the house. Some were visiting businessmen. Others were artisans or workmen engaged in renovation and refurbishing. Still others were tradesmen making deliveries of merchandise. Suddenly, the Sutton Place telephone bills began to soar. The reason was obvious. Each of the regular telephones in the house has direct access to outside lines and thus to long-distance and even overseas operators. All sorts of people were making the best of a rare opportunity. They were picking up Sutton Place phones and placing calls to girlfriends in [[Geneva]] or [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and to aunts, uncles and third cousins twice-removed in [[Caracas]] and [[Cape Town]]. The costs of their friendly chats were, of course, charged to the Sutton Place bill.&lt;ref&gt;Getty, 1976, pg.319&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When speaking in a televised interview with [[Alan Whicker]] in February 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Solitary Billionaire J. Paul Getty|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nw1t5 |work=Talk at the BBC|publisher=BBC |accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getty said that he thought guests would want to use a payphone.&lt;ref&gt;''Talk at the BBC'', BBC Four, April 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 months, Getty explained, "The in-and-out traffic flow at Sutton subsided. Management and operation of the house settled into a reasonable routine. With that, the pay-telephone [was] removed, and the dial-locks were taken off the telephones in the house."&lt;ref&gt;Getty, 1976, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years &amp; death==
On June 30, 1960, Getty threw a 21st birthday party for a relation of his friend, the [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|16th Duke of Norfolk]], which served as a housewarming party for the newly-purchased Sutton Place.&lt;ref name="autogenerated119"&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,200 guests consisting of the cream of British society were invited. Party goers were irritated by Getty's stinginess, such as not providing cigarettes and relegating everyone to using [[creosote]] [[portable toilet]]s outside. At about 10pm the party descended into pandemonium as [[party crasher]]s arrived from London, swelling the already overcrowded halls, causing an estimated ₤20,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="autogenerated119"/&gt; A valuable silver [[ewer]] by the 18th century [[silversmith]] [[Paul de Lamerie]] was stolen, but returned anonymously when the London newspapers began covering the theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-wild-was-j-paul-gettys-notorious-british-party| title=How Wild Was J. Paul Getty's Notorious British Party?| author=Anthony Haden-Guest| publisher=The Daily Beast| date=2015-09-27| access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the event made the newly-arrived Getty the object of ridicule, and he never threw another large party again.

Getty remained an inveterate hard worker, boasting at age 74 that he often worked 16 to 18 hours per day overseeing his operations across the world.&lt;ref name="nytimes1976"/&gt; The Arab-Israeli [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 caused a worldwide oil shortage for years to come. In this period, the value of Getty Oil shares quadrupled, with Getty enjoying personal earnings of $25.8 million in 1975 (appr. $120 million in 2018 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Painfully Rich| author=John Pearson| year=1995| publisher=Harper Collins| p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His insatiable appetite for women and sex also continued well into his 80s. He used an experimental drug, "H3", to maintain his potency.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; Getty met the English interior designer Penelope Kitson in the 1950s and entrusted her with decorating his homes and the public rooms of the [[oil tanker]]s he was launching. From 1960 she resided in a cottage on the grounds of Sutton Place, and, though she did not have a sexual relationship with him, Getty held her in high respect and trust. Other mistresses who resided at Sutton Place included the married Mary Teissier, a distant cousin of the last [[Tsar of Russia]], [[Lady Ursula d'Abo]], who had close connections to the British Royal Family, and [[Nicaragua]]n-born Rosabella Burch.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of Getty's domestic arrangement that: "[Getty] ended his life with a collection of desperately hopeful women, all living together in his Tudor mansion in England, none of them aware that his favorite pastime was rewriting his will, changing his insultingly small bequests: $209 a month to one, $1,167 to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|first=Jane|last=O'Reilly|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/isn-t-it-funny-what-money-can-do.html| title=Isn't It Funny What Money Can Do?| work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only Penelope Kitson received a handsome bequest upon Getty's death: 5,000 Getty Oil shares (appr. $826,500 in 1976), which doubled in value during the 1980s, and a $1,167 monthly income.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

Getty died June 6, 1976, in [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]] near [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He was buried in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles County, California at the [[Getty Villa]].

== Media portrayals ==
The 2017 film ''[[All the Money in the World]]''{{spaced ndash}}directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and adapted from the book ''Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty'' by [[John Pearson (author)|John Pearson]]{{spaced ndash}}is a dramatisation of the abduction of Getty's grandson. [[Kevin Spacey]] originally portrayed Getty. However, after multiple [[Kevin Spacey#Sexual misconduct allegations|sexual assault allegations]] against the actor, his scenes were cut and re-shot with [[Christopher Plummer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/ridley-scott-reveals-how-kevin-spacey-was-erased-all-money-world-1068755|title= Ridley Scott Reveals How Kevin Spacey Was Erased From 'All the Money in the World'|last= Giardina|first=Carolyn|date=December 18, 2017|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/oscar-nominations-2018-complete-list-nominees-1067893 |title=Oscars: 'Shape of Water' Leads With 13 Noms |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 23, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often called ''yuandang'' (原檔 original archives).

It covers official Manchu documents from the 3rd month of the 35th year of the [[Wanli Emperor of China|Wanli Emperor]] (1607) to the 12th month of the 1st year of [[Hong Taiji|Chongde]] (1636).{{fact|date=February 2014}} Archives are mostly written in the script without dots and circles. Although [[Dahai]] is said to have invented the script with dots and circles in 1632, subsequent archives occasionally, but not always, add dots and circles. Standard Manchu required time to establish.

''Jiu Manzhou Dang'' was discovered in 1931, a month after the discovery of the [[Beijing]] edition of ''Manwen Laodang''.{{fact|date=February 2014}} Three more volumes were found in 1935. It was moved from place to place due to long-running wars and was finally carried to Taiwan by the [[Kuomintang]]. The study on original archives was started in 1960s. The National Palace Museum published the copy under the name ''Jiu Manzhou Dang'' in 1969.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

'''''Life 102: What to Do When Your Guru Sues You''''' is a book by [[Peter McWilliams]]. Couched in the tone of the author's ''[[Life 101]]'' self-help books, it levels a series of allegations against [[John-Roger]] (Roger Delano Hinkins), founder of the [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]] (MSIA) and [[Insight Seminars]].

These allegations caused the book, [[self-published]] in 1994 under McWilliams' Prelude Press imprint, to itself become the subject of litigation for [[libel]]. Remaining copies were withdrawn from sale. The volume discusses in detail McWilliams's own experiences over a 15-year period:

{{quote|As much as we like to think that we are independent-minded, free-willed, autonomous individuals, the fact remains that some part of us is still susceptible to programming.

Programming can happen to anyone. Intelligence, education, common sense, belief, or convictions offer little protection. All it takes is ''repetition'' (the slow route) or ''vulnerability'' (the fast route) and, eventually, we're hooked. Master programmers - from cult leaders to cigarette companies to government agencies - do both, as often as possible, whether you like it or not.

Ironically, ''the more immune to programming you think you are, the more susceptible you become.''&lt;ref name="life102"&gt;Peter McWilliams, ''Life 102: What to Do When Your Guru Sues You'' (Prelude Press: Los Angeles, 1994). {{ISBN|0-931580-34-X}}., pp 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

McWilliams describes his struggle with [[depression (mood)|depression]], and claims that Hinkins promised him "spiritual healing" in exchange for crediting "John-Roger" as co-author of a series of self-improvement manuals which later made the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-seller lists]].
 
Hinkins sued McWiliams for libel, and in due course obtained full rights to ''Life 102''. The volume has been [[out-of-print book|out of print]] ever since. When the book later appeared on another website without permission, McWilliams sent a notarized letter requesting the site owner remove it:

{{quote|[T]he content of the book is no longer one with which I would like to have my name associated. [...] When I left MSIA, I thought it was John-Roger who deceived me, so my anger poured out, rather lavishly, on him. In fact, the larger deception was that there is a God at all, and for that I have a lot more people and institutions to blame than John-Roger [...] As "religious leaders" go, John-Roger is on the benign side. As I see it, the Pope, for example, is far, far more dangerous.}}

McWilliams died in June 2000.

'''''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''''' is a 1975 British independent [[slapstick]] [[comedy film]]&lt;!-- Do not alter genre without discussion. --&gt; concerning the [[Arthurian legend]], written and performed by the [[Monty Python]] comedy group of [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Terry Gilliam]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]], and directed by Gilliam and Jones.{{refn|group=n|name="Directors"|Though the [[opening credits]] comedically identify the directors as "40 Specially Trained Ecuadorian Mountain Llamas, 6 Venezuelan Red Llamas, 142 Mexican Whooping Llamas, 14 North Chilean Guanacos (Closely Related to the Llama), Reg Llama of Brixton, 76000 Battery Llamas From 'Llama-Fresh' Farms Ltd.

In contrast to the group's first film, ''[[And Now for Something Completely Different]]'', a compilation of [[sketch comedy|sketches]] from the first two television series, ''Holy Grail'' draws on new material, parodying the legend of [[King Arthur]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]]. 30 years later, Idle used the film as the basis for the musical ''[[Spamalot]]''.

''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' grossed more than any British film exhibited in the US in 1975. In the US, it was selected as the second best comedy of all time in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] special ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]''. In the UK, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine ranked it the fifth greatest comedy film of all time; a similar poll of [[Channel 4]] viewers placed it sixth (2000).&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/948331.stm "Life of Brian tops comedy poll"].

==Plot==
In 932 AD, [[King Arthur]] and his squire, Patsy, travel throughout [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] searching for men to join the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Arthur recruits [[Bedivere|Sir Bedevere the Wise]], [[Lancelot|Sir Lancelot the Brave]], [[Galahad|Sir Galahad the Pure]], Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and Sir Not-Appearing-in-this-Film, along with their squires and Robin's troubadours. Arthur leads the men to [[Camelot]], but decides it is "a silly place" and sets off elsewhere. As they turn away, [[God]] (an image of [[W. G. Grace]]) speaks to them and gives Arthur the task of finding the [[Holy Grail]].

Arthur and his men search the land for clues to the Grail. They come to a castle occupied by French soldiers who claim to have the Grail and insult the Englishmen. Arthur and his men come up with a plan to sneak in using a [[Trojan Horse|Trojan Rabbit]], but they mishandle its execution and are forced away. Arthur decides that the knights should go their separate ways to search for clues to the Grail's whereabouts. A modern-day historian being filmed for a documentary describing the Arthurian legends is abruptly killed by a knight on horseback, triggering a modern-day police investigation.

On the knights' travels, Arthur and Bedevere attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded [[Knights Who Say Ni]]. Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Giant by running away while the heads are arguing. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle [[Anthrax]], populated by 160 women, but to his chagrin is "rescued" by Lancelot. Lancelot, after finding a note from Swamp Castle believed to be from a lady being forced to marry against her will, rushes to the castle and kills nearly the entire wedding party, only to discover that the note was sent by an effeminate prince.

Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by Brother Maynard and monk followers. They meet Tim the [[Magician (fantasy)|Enchanter]], who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written, but it is guarded by the deadly [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]]. After the Rabbit kills several of the knights, Arthur uses the Holy [[grenade|Hand Grenade]] of [[Antioch]], provided by Maynard, to destroy the creature. Inside, they find the inscription from [[Joseph of Arimathea]], directing them to the Castle of Aarrgh. After evading a giant monster, they arrive at the Bridge of Death and must answer three questions from the bridge-keeper to pass. Lancelot answers first and correctly, and passes on. Robin and Galahad fail to answer correctly and are thrown over the bridge; then Arthur tricks the bridge-keeper, allowing him and Bedevere to pass.

When Arthur and Bedevere reach the bridge's end, they cannot find Lancelot, unaware he was arrested by the modern-day policemen investigating the historian's death. Arthur and Bedevere find the Castle of Aarrgh, but it is occupied by the French. They amass a large army of knights to assault the castle, when suddenly a large police force shows up, arrests Arthur and Bedevere for the historian's death, and shuts down the film's production.

==Production==
===Development===
[[File:Galahad grail.jpg|300px|thumb|The legend of the [[Holy Grail]] provided a unifying motif for the film.]]
Fifteen months before the [[BBC]] visited the set in May 1974,{{sfn|Palin|2006|p=174}} the [[Monty Python]] troupe assembled the first version of the screenplay.&lt;ref name="BBCLocation"&gt;{{cite AV media|author=Monty Python troupe |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; When half of the resulting material was set in the [[Middle Ages]], and half was set in the present day, the group opted to focus on the Middle Ages, revolving on the legend of the [[Holy Grail]]. By the fourth or fifth version of their screenplay, the story was complete, and the cast joked the fact that the Grail was never retrieved would be "a big let-down ... a great anti-climax".&lt;ref name="BBCLocation"/&gt; [[Graham Chapman]] said a challenge was incorporating scenes that did not fit the Holy Grail motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Chapman |first=Graham |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Terry Gilliam]] nor [[Terry Jones]] had directed a film before, and described it as a learning experience in which they would learn to make a film by making an entire full-length film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Gilliam |first1=Terry |last2=Jones |first2=Terry |chapter=BBC Film Night: Monty Python &amp; the Holy Grail Location Report |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cast humorously described the novice directing style as employing the level of mutual disrespect always found in Monty Python's work.&lt;ref name="BBCLocation"/&gt;

The film’s initial budget of approximately £200,000 was raised by convincing 10 separate investors to contribute £20,000 apiece. Three of those investors were the rock bands [[Pink Floyd]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], who were persuaded to help fund the film by Tony Stratton-Smith, head of Charisma Records (the record label that released Python’s early comedy albums).&lt;ref name="Mental Floss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/65207/15-facts-about-monty-python-and-holy-grail|title=15 Facts about Monty Python and the Holy Grail|first=Sean|last=Hutchinson|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Terry Gilliam, the Pythons turned to rock stars like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and [[Elton John]] for finance as the studios refused to fund the film and rock stars saw it as "a good tax write-off" due to UK [[income tax]] being "as high as 90%" at the time.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian 090302"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/09/features.phelimoneill|title=Snake Charmer-Monty Python And The Holy Grail was Terry Gilliam's first film as a director. Here he remembers how he taught the nation to laugh at castles|first=Phelim|last=O'Neill|date=9 March 2002|accessdate=19 February 2018|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|quote=There was no studio interference because there was no studio; none of them would give us any money. This was at the time income tax was running as high as 90%, so we turned to rock stars for finance. Elton John, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, they all had money, they knew our work and we seemed a good tax write-off. Except, of course we weren't. It was like [[The Producers (1967 film)|The Producers]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' was mostly shot on location in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukonscreen.com/egjcibb-Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail-%281975%29.html |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail filming locations |publisher=Ukonscreen.com |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly around [[Doune Castle]], [[Glen Coe]], and the privately owned [[Castle Stalker]].{{sfn|Li|2011}} The many castles seen throughout the film were mainly either Doune Castle shot from different angles or [[hanging miniature]]s.&lt;ref name="QuestLocation"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Jones |first=Terry |chapter=The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several exceptions to this: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film is [[Kidwelly Castle]] in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during "Tale of Sir Lancelot" is [[Bodiam Castle]] in East Sussex;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jun/02/guardianspecial4.guardianspecial2 |title=Bodiam Castle, East Sussex |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=18 April 2013 |location=London |date=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; all subsequent shots of the exterior and interior of those scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. Production designer Julian Doyle recounted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Doyle |first=Julian |chapter=The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry Jones later recalled the crew had selected more castles around Scotland for locations, but during the two weeks prior to [[principal photography]], the Scottish Department of the Environment declined permission for use of the castles in its jurisdiction, for fear of damage.&lt;ref name="QuestLocation"/&gt;

At the start of "The Tale of Sir Robin", there is a slow camera zoom in on rocky scenery (that in the voice over is described as "the dark forest of Ewing"). This is actually a still photograph of the Gorge at [[Mount Buffalo National Park]] in Victoria, Australia. Doyle stated in 2000 during an interview with ''[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/mpholygrail/article5.html|title=Never have so few suffered for the enjoyment of so many: the making of Monty Python And The Holy Grail|date=October 2000|at=via [[Angelfire.com]] (convenience link)|magazine=[[Hotdog (magazine)|Hotdog]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was a still image filmed with candles underneath the frame (to give a heat haze). This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.
 
On the DVD audio commentary, Cleese described challenges shooting and editing Castle Anthrax in "The Tale of Sir Galahad", with what he felt the most comedic [[take]] being unused because an anachronistic coat was visible in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Cleese |first=John |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; Castle Anthrax was also shot in one part of Doune, where costume designer Hazel Pethig advised against [[Nudity in film|nudity]], dressing the girls in [[Shift (clothing)|shifts]].&lt;ref name="QuestLocation"/&gt;

In the scene where the knights were combatting the [[Rabbit of Caerbannog]], a real white rabbit was used, switched with [[puppet]]s for its killings.&lt;ref name="GilliamJones"&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Gilliam |first1=Terry |last2=Jones |first2=Terry |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail commentary |date=2001 |publisher=Columbia Tristar |medium=DVD }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was covered with red liquid to simulate blood, though the rabbit's owner did not want the animal dirty and was kept unaware. The liquid was difficult to remove from the fur.&lt;ref name="GilliamJones"/&gt; He also stated that he thought that, had they been more experienced in filmmaking, the crew would have just purchased a rabbit instead. Otherwise, the rabbit himself was unharmed. Also, the rabbit-bite effects were done by special puppetry by both Gilliam and SFX technician John Horton.

As chronicled in ''The Life of Python'', ''The First 20 Years of Monty Python'', and ''The Pythons' Autobiography'', it was revealed that Chapman was suffering from [[acrophobia]], trembling, and bouts of forgetfulness during filming. These were the results of Chapman's long-standing alcohol addiction, and he decided from that moment on to remain "on an even keel" while the production continued. Nearly three years after ''Holy Grail'', Chapman vowed to quit drinking altogether (which he successfully achieved in December 1977).

Originally the knight characters were going to ride real horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided that their characters would mime horse-riding while their [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] trotted behind them banging [[coconut]] shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned [[Foley (filmmaking)|sound effect]] used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering. This was later referred to in the German release of the film, which translated the title as ''Die Ritter der Kokosnuß''.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

The opening credits of the film feature pseudo-[[Swedish language|Swedish]] subtitles, which soon turn into an appeal to visit Sweden and see the country's [[moose]]. The subtitles are soon stopped, but moose references continue throughout the actual credits until the credits are stopped again and restarted in a different visual style and with references to [[llama]]s, animals often mentioned in ''Flying Circus''. The subtitles were written by Michael Palin as a way to "entertain the 'captive' audience" at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mindhole Blowers: 20 Facts About Monty Python and the Holy Grail That Might Make You Say "Ni!"|url=http://www.pajiba.com/seriously_random_lists/mindhole-blowers-20-facts-about-monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-that-might-make-you-say-ni.php|website=pajiba.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film had its television premiere 25 February 1977 on the ''[[CBS Late Movie]]''.{{sfn|McCall|2013}} Reportedly, the Pythons were displeased to discover a number of edits were done by the network to reduce use of [[profanity]] and the showing of blood.

==Reaction and legacy==
Contemporary reviews were mixed. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in a favorable review that the film had "some low spots," but had gags which were "nonstop, occasionally inspired and should not be divulged, though it's not giving away too much to say that I particularly liked a sequence in which the knights, to gain access to an enemy castle, come up with the idea of building a Trojan rabbit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Canby |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Canby |date=April 28, 1975 |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was also positive, writing that the film, "like [[Mad (magazine)|Mad]] comics, is not certain to please every taste. But its youthful exuberance and its rousing zaniness are hard not to like. As a matter of fact, the sense of fun is dangerously contagious."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Champlin|Champlin, Charles]] (July 23, 1975). "'Monty Python Opens at Plaza". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penelope Gilliatt]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called the film "often recklessly funny and sometimes a matter of comic genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilliatt |first=Penelope |authorlink=Penelope Gilliatt |date=May 5, 1975 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the storyline was "basically an excuse for set pieces, some amusing, others overdone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 19, 1975  |title=Film Reviews: Monty Python And The Holy Grail |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he felt "it contained about 10 very funny moments and 70 minutes of silence. Too many of the jokes took too long to set up, a trait shared by both '[[Blazing Saddles]]' and '[[Young Frankenstein]].' I guess I prefer Monty Python in chunks, in its original, television revue format."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Siskel|Siskel, Gene]] (June 9, 1975). "Now comes King Arthur to cut 'em off at the pass". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 3, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the film "a fitfully amusing spoof of the Arthurian legends" but "rather poky" in tempo, citing the running gag of Swedish subtitles in the opening credits as an example of how the Pythons "don't know when to let go of any ''shtik''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnold |first=Gary |date=July 17, 1975 |title=...Python's Arthurian Knights |journal=[[The Washington Post]] |page=C1, C11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoff Brown of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote in a mixed review that "the team's visual buffooneries and verbal rigamaroles (some good, some bad, but mostly indifferent) are piled on top of each other with no attention to judicious timing or structure, and a form which began as a jaunty assault on the well-made revue sketch and an ingenious misuse of television's fragmented style of presentation, threatens to become as unyielding and unfruitful as the conventions it originally attacked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brown |first=Geoff |date=April 1975 |title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |page=85 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's reputation grew over time. In 2000, readers of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine voted ''Holy Grail'' the fifth greatest comedy film of all time.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; The next Python film, ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'', was ranked first.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt; A similar poll of [[Channel 4]] viewers in 2005 placed ''Holy Grail'' in sixth (with ''Life of Brian'' again topping the list).

[[File:Azariaspamalot.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Hank Azaria]] in a production of ''[[Spamalot]]''.]]
In 2005, the film spawned a [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical smash hit spinoff, ''[[Spamalot]]''. Written primarily by Idle, the show has more of an overarching plot and leaves out certain portions of the movie due to difficulties in rendering certain effects on stage. Nonetheless, many of the jokes from the film are present in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGuigan|first=Cathleen|title=A Very Swordid Affair|journal=Newsweek|date=24 January 2005|volume=145|issue=4|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] prime-time special, ''[[Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time]]'', counted down the best films chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by ABC and ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]''. ''Holy Grail'' was selected as the second best comedy after ''[[Airplane!]]''.

In 2013, the Pythons lost a legal case to [[Mark Forstater]], the film's producer, over royalties for the derivative work, ''[[Spamalot]]''. They owed a combined £800,000 in legal fees and back royalties to Forstater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=John Cleese: Monty Python reunion is happening because of my £800,000 legal bill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/john-cleese-monty-python-reunion-3591253 |quote=Last July, the Pythons lost a royalties case to Mark Forstater, who produced 1975 film Monty Python And The Holy Grail. ... |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=28 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate   = 30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help cover the cost of these royalties and fees, the group arranged and performed in a stage show, ''[[Monty Python Live (mostly)]]'', held at [[The O2 (London)|The O2 arena]] in [[London]] in July 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">The [[Open Archives Initiative]] '''Object Reuse and Exchange''' (OAI-ORE) defines standards for the description and exchange of aggregations of [[web resource]]s. The OAI-ORE specification implements the '''ORE Model''' which introduces the [[resource map]] (ReM) that makes it possible to associate an identity with aggregations of resources and make assertions about their structure and semantics.

These aggregations (sometimes called ''[[compound digital object]]s'' or ''compound information objects'') may combine distributed resources together, and with multiple media types including text, images, data, and video. The goal of OAI-ORE is to expose the rich content in aggregations to applications that support authoring, deposit, exchange, [[Information visualization|visualization]], reuse, and [[digital preservation|preservation]].

The [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] funded two years of work on the OAI-ORE project in 2006-2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/MellonProposalwithoutbudget.pdf Andrew Mellon Foundation: Repositories Interoperability Framework: Augmenting Interoperability across Scholarly Repositories]&lt;/ref&gt; Version 1.0 of the specification was released on 17 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;"Open Archives Initiative Announces Production Release of Object Reuse and Exchange Specifications." [http://www.openarchives.org/ore/documents/ore-production-press-release.pdf OAI-ORE Production Release Press Release]. 17-Oct-2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
The ORE standard is concerned with the description of aggregations of web resources. It defines 4 entities:
* the Aggregation itself, identified by its [[URI]] but without any corresponding concrete resource. It is a conceptual resource. Being uniquely identified it can enter into relationships with other resources, in particular aggregations of aggregation become possible.
* the Aggregated Resource: any resource part of an aggregation, identified by its URI
* the Resource Map: a resource describing an aggregation based on a set of assertions. A mandatory assertion indicates which aggregation the Resource Map itself is describing. Other assertions indicate the aggregated resource(s). Certain metadata are mandatory as well, such as the map creator. [[Dublin Core]] terms are used for this purpose.
* the proxy: a virtual resource acting as a proxy for a certain aggregated resource in the context of a certain aggregation. Its use is optional. A so-called lineage relationship can be established between proxy resources to trace the origin of an aggregated resource from another aggregation.

The standard accounts for the possible redundant description of the same aggregation and defines the notion of authoritative Resource Map. It also consider the notions of similar aggregations and of type of aggregated resources.

The standard is open in the sense that a Resource Map may include any additional assertions about resources.

Finally, the ORE standard builds upon the ''Cool URIs ''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris Cool URIs for the Semantic Web ] (W3C Interest Group Note)&lt;/ref&gt; guideline, which discussed two strategies for not confusing a thing and some representation of it.

'''Pablita Abeyta''' (''Ta-Nez-Bah'', [[Navajo language|Navajo]], born July 20, 1953) was a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] sculptor and activist from [[New Mexico]], [[United States]]. She was the oldest daughter of artist [[Narciso Abeyta]].

==Early life==
Pablita Abeyta was born in [[Gallup, New Mexico]] in 1953. Both her parents were artists; her father was [[Narciso Abeyta]]. Abeyta was one of seven children. Each child had an artistic skill, ranging from [[weaving]] to sculpture to painting. Each child was given a Navajo middle name, with the goal of keeping the children connected to their Native American heritage. Her Navajo name, "Ta-Nez-Bah," translates as "One Who Completes a Circle."&lt;ref name="BatailleLisa2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gretchen M. Bataille|author2=Laurie Lisa|title=Native American women: a biographical dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=83LZvjUSPr0C|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=12 June 2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-93020-8|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Activism===
Abeyta earned her [[Master of Public Affairs]] from the [[University of New Mexico]] in 1983. After earning her degree, she became a [[lobbyist]] for the [[Navajo Nation]] [[Washington, D.C.]] office. As a lobbyist for the Navajo, she coordinated a national effort to secure the passing of amendments related to Native peoples such as the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], [[Clean Water Act]], and the [[Superfund]] act. From 1986 to 1988, Abeyta was a [[legislative assistant]] for [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]]. She left Campbell's office in 1988 to join the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In 1991, she became a [[United States Congress|congressional liaison]] for the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] (NMAI).&lt;ref name="BatailleLisa2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Coody Cooper|title=Spirited encounters: American Indians protest museum policies and practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jiWSAHvKN14C&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=2 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-1089-2|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; At NMAI she monitored the planned museum's funding and participated in obtaining funding for the museum. She had also worked in developing proposals related to the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|cultural repatriation]]. She had also served as the special assistant to the director of the museum.&lt;ref name="BatailleLisa2001"/&gt;

===Art===
As an artist, Abeyta created sculptures that are described as "smooth, round and sensuous." Her work is held in the collections of numerous private and public collections, including those of [[John McCain]], [[Daniel Inouye]], NMAI&lt;ref name="SIRIS1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=Ceramic and Turquoise Sculpture, (sculpture). | work=Art Inventories Catalog | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=Y3281581V3791.3534&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!368466~!0&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Abeyta,+Pablita&amp;index=.AW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1| accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIRIS2"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2001 | title=Navajo Sisters, (sculpture).

==History==
Following the Turko-Persian [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavid]] conquest of [[South Asia]], the speech based in [[Delhi]]'s [[Khariboli dialect]] and other dialects of [[South Asia]] received a large influx of [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] and [[Arabic]] vocabulary. The subsequent Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]] gave way for a further continuation of this. The basis in general for the introduction of Persian language into the subcontinent was set, from its earliest days, by various Persianized Central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;Sigfried J. de Laet. [https://books.google.com/books?id=PvlthkbFU1UC&amp;pg=PA734&amp;dq=persian+language+in+anatolia&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIs-fO2_aRxgIVygYsCh2NJgBM#v=onepage&amp;q=persian%20language%20in%20anatolia&amp;f=false ''History of Humanity: From the seventh to the sixteenth century''] UNESCO, 1994. {{ISBN|9231028138}} p 734&lt;/ref&gt; 

This [[lexicon|lexically]] diverse register of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], emerged in the northern subcontinent, was commonly called ''Zaban-e Urdu-e Mualla'' ('language of the exalted city') and eventually replaced [[Persian language|Persian]], the court language, and its name was shortened to just "Urdu". It grew from the interaction of [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Muslim]] soldiers and the native peoples.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kachru|first=Yamuna|title=Hindi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ooH5VfLTQEQC&amp;pg=PA2|year=2006|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3812-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Persian influence from the state, the Persian [[Nastaʿlīq script]] was adopted, with additional figures added to accommodate the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[Phonetics|phonetic]] system.

Unlike Persian, which is an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]], Urdu is a variant of an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]], Hindustani, written in the [[Urdu alphabet|Perso-Arabic]] script, and contains literary conventions and specialized vocabulary largely from Persian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some grammatical elements peculiar to Persian, such as the enclitic [[ezāfe]] and the use of [[Pen name#Persian and Urdu poetry|pen-names]], were readily absorbed into Urdu literature both in the religious and secular spheres.

Modern Persian has three major variants: [[Western Persian]] (spoken primarily in [[Iran]], known by its [[Persian people|native speakers]] as "Farsi", the literal Persian word for itself), [[Dari language|Dari]] (spoken as a [[lingua franca]] by a large majority of [[Afghans]]) and [[Tajiki language|Tajik]] (spoken by the [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi, Abdolazim. "Comparative phonetic study of frequently used words in Iranian Farsi versus Tajik Farsi." Journal of American Science 8.4 (2012): 6-16.&lt;/ref&gt; These variants are almost entirely [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with one another.

Likewise, Urdu is a major variant of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], the other major variant being [[Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;Malik, Muhammad G., Christian Boitet, and Pushpak Bhattacharyya. "Hindi Urdu machine transliteration using finite-state transducers." Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics-Volume 1. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hindi and Urdu are almost entirely mutually intelligible with one another,&lt;ref&gt;Bradby, Hannah. "Translating culture and language: a research note on multilingual settings." Sociology of Health &amp; Illness 24.6 (2002): 842-855.&lt;/ref&gt; but have somewhat distinct vocabulary and minor terminological differences. Another major difference is their writing systems are entirely different, with Hindi using [[Devanagari]] and Urdu using the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script. 

Hindustani gained distinction in literary and cultural spheres in South Asia because of its role as a [[lingua franca]] in the subcontinent as a result of the large number of speakers the language has, both as a first and second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2006/munshis96677/munshis96677.pdf|title=Jammu and Kashmir Burushaski: Language, Language contact and change|work=Sadaf Munshi, Doctor of Philosophy, University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent cross-over writer was [[Amir Khusrow]], whose Persian and Urdu couplets are to this day read in [[South Asia]]. [[Muhammad Iqbal]] was also a prominent South Asian writer who wrote in Persian and Urdu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1388">'''''R v Mavros'''''&lt;ref&gt;1921 AD 19.&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in [[South African law]]. It was heard in the Appellate Division in [[Bloemfontein]] in November 1920. Innes CJ, Solomon JA and Juta JA were the presiding officers.

== Facts ==
The term "arson" in South African practice is used to denote the corresponding, but somewhat wider, crime of ''brandstichting'', which is committed by a man who sets fire to his own house wrongfully, maliciously and with intent to injure or defraud another person. Mavros in the present case had been convicted of the crime of arson, in that he had wrongfully and maliciously set alight his own store with intent to burn it and defraud a certain insurance company of the money for which it had insured the store and its goods.

== Judgment ==
Departing from the decision in ''[[R v Enslin]]''&lt;ref&gt;2 AC 69.&lt;/ref&gt; the court held, on a point of law reserved, that the facts as alleged constituted the crime charged.

In legal terminology, a '''rescript''' is a document that is issued not on the initiative of the author, but in response (it literally means 'written back') to a specific demand made by its addressee. It does not apply to more general legislation.

==Overview==
The word originated from the Roman imperial court, which often issued rescripts, in many cases prompted by its many governors and other officials. Some important early legal collections were composed entirely of rescripts, for instance the [[Codex Hermogenianus]], published around AD 300.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex Hermogenianus" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 474. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main field of application is the papal [[Roman Curia]], which adopted many Roman administrative terms and practices.

Rescripts may take various forms, from a formal document of an established type, such as a [[Papal Bull]], to the forwarding of the demand with a simple mention by way of decision, something like "rejected" or "awarded", either to the party concerned or to the competent executive office to be carried out.

By analogy it is also applied to similar procedures in other contexts, such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan]]ese imperial courts, or even prior to the Roman empire. Two well-known examples of Japanese Imperial rescripts were [[Emperor Hirohito]]'s 1945 [[Gyokuon-hōsō|Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War]] written in response to the [[Potsdam Declaration]] and his 1946 [[Humanity Declaration]] written in response to a request by General [[Douglas MacArthur]].

==Papal rescripts==
{{canon law}}
{{main article|Papal rescripts}}
{{See also|Canon law (Catholic Church)}}

Papal rescripts concern the granting of favours or the administration of justice under [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]].  In [[Roman Catholicism]] rescripts are responses in writing by the [[pope]] or a [[Congregation (Roman Curia)|Congregation]] of the [[Roman Curia]] to queries or petitions of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Papal Rescripts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French legal system==
In [[France]], people have the possibility to ask an administration for a ''rescrit'' (rescript), which means that they will present to the competent administration a circumstanced particular case, and obtain a formal answer (the ''rescrit'') by the administration explaining how the law will be applied to the submitted particular case. The rescript is binding for the administration, and may be used before a court of law to exonerate the person who asked for the rescript in case of prosecution. In [[English common law]] such a [[hypothetical]] process is not allowed, and cases must be determined on fact.

==U.S. legal system==
The [[Massachusetts]] appellate courts issue rescripts to the lower courts. These are the equivalent of mandates in federal appellate practice.&lt;ref&gt;Mass. R. App. P. 1(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samaritan woman at the well''' is a figure from the [[Gospel of John]], in {{bibleverse||John|4:4–26|NIV}}. In [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholicism|Eastern Catholic]] traditions, she is venerated as a saint with the name [[List of names for the biblical nameless#Samaritan woman at the well|Photine]]  (also Photini, Photina, meaning "the luminous one" from φως, "light").

==Biblical account==
[[File:St Photina.jpg|thumb|Eastern Orthodox icon of Saint Photine meeting Christ]]
The woman appears in [[John 4]]:4–42:

{{quote|But he had to go through [[Samaria]]. So he came to a Samaritan city called [[Sychar]], near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired out by his journey, was sitting by the well. It was about noon.

A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink." (His disciples had gone to the city to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samaria?" (Jews do not share things in common with Samaritans.) Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, 'Give me a drink', you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water." The woman said to him, "Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?" Jesus said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but those who drink of the water that I will give them will never be thirsty. The water that I will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life." The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water."

Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come back." The woman answered him, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You are right in saying, 'I have no husband'; for you have had five husbands, and the man you are now living with is not your husband. What you have said is true!" The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem." Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth." The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who is called Christ). "When he comes, he will proclaim all things to us." Jesus said to her, "I am he, the one who is speaking to you."&lt;ref name="biblegateway"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4%3A4-26&amp;version=NRSVA|publisher=biblegateway.com|title=John 4:4–26 NRSVA - But he had to go through Samaria.

B. Eerdmans Publishing |page=534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both communities share the [[Pentateuch]], although crucially the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] locates the holy mountain at [[Mount Gerizim]] rather than at [[Mount Zion]], as this incident acknowledges at John 4:20.

The Gospel of John, like the Gospel of Luke, is favourable to the Samaritans throughout, and, while the Matthaean Gospel quotes Jesus at one early phase in his ministry telling his followers to not at that time evangelize any of the cities of the Samaritans,&lt;ref name=Samkutty85&gt;V. J. Samkutty, ''The Samaritan Mission in Acts'' (Continuum, 2006), page 85.&lt;/ref&gt; this restriction had clearly been reversed later by the time of Matthew 28:19. Scholars differ as to whether the Samaritan references in the New Testament are historical. One view is that the historical Jesus had no contact with Samaritans; another is that the accounts go back to Jesus himself. Note that in Acts 1:8, Jesus promises the apostles that they will be witnesses to the Samaritans.&lt;ref name=Samkutty100&gt;V. J. Samkutty, ''The Samaritan Mission in Acts'' (Continuum, 2006), pages 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Scholars have noted that this story appears to be modelled on a standard [[betrothal]] scene from Hebrew scripture, particularly that of [[Jacob]] in Genesis 29.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Quast, Reading the Gospel of John: An Introduction (Paulist Press, 1991) page 29.&lt;/ref&gt; This convention, which would have been familiar to Jewish readers, following on from an earlier scene in which [[John the Baptist]] compares his relationship to Jesus with that of the friend of a bridegroom.&lt;ref name="Lincoln 2005 170–1"/&gt;

This [[Gospel]] episode is referred to as "a [[paradigm]] for our engagement with truth", in the [[Roman Curia]] book ''[[A Christian reflection on the New Age]]'', as the dialogue says: "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know" and offers an example of "Jesus Christ the bearer of the water of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_new-age_en.html |title=Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life: A Christian reflection on the "New Age" |last1=Pontifical Council for Culture |authorlink1=Pontifical Council for Culture |last2=Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue |authorlink2=Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue |publisher=Internet Office of the Holy See |location=Vatican City |date=2 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passages that comprise [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#4:10|John 4:10–26]] are sometimes referred to as the [[Water of Life (Christianity)|Water of Life Discourse]], which forms a complement to the [[Bread of Life Discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tWR8DJ6C8KsC&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Barrett |first=C.

In Eastern Christian tradition, the woman's name at the time of her meeting Jesus is unknown, though she was later christened "Photina". She is celebrated as a saint of renown. As further recounted in {{Bibleverse|John|4:28-30|NKJV}} and {{Bibleverse|John|4:39-42|NKJV}}, she was quick to spread the news of her meeting with Jesus, and through this many came to believe in him. Her continuing witness is said to have brought so many to the Christian faith that she is described as "[[equal-to-apostles|equal to the apostles]]". Eventually, having drawn the attention of [[Nero|Emperor Nero]], she was brought before him to answer for her faith, suffering many tortures and dying a martyr after being thrown down a dry well. She is remembered on the Sunday four weeks after [[Easter|Pascha]], which is known as "the Sunday of the Samaritan Woman".

In [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]], Mexico, a celebration of the Samaritan woman takes place on the fourth Friday of [[Lent]]. The custom of the day involves churches, schools, and businesses giving away fruit drinks to passers-by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viveoaxaca.org/2011/04/la-samaritana-2011-en-oaxaca.html |title=La Samaritana 2011 en Oaxaca |language=Spanish |publisher=Vive Oaxaca |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Song Yingxing''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 宋應星; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 宋应星; [[Wade Giles]]: '''Sung Ying-Hsing'''; 1587-1666 AD)  was a Chinese scientist and encyclopedist who lived during the late [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644). He was the author of ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'', an [[encyclopedia]] that covered a wide variety of technical subjects, including the use of [[gunpowder]] weapons.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 36"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Britain|British]] [[sinologist]] and historian [[Joseph Needham]] called Song Yingxing "The [[Diderot]] of China."&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 102"&gt;Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Song Yingxing was born in [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichun]] of [[Jiangxi]] in 1587 to a gentry family of reduced circumstances, he participated in the [[imperial examination]]s, and passed the provincial test in 1615, at the age of 28.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt; He achieved only modest wealth and influence during his life. However, he was repeatedly unsuccessful in the metropolitan examination.  Song sat for the test five times, the last being in 1631 at the age of 44.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;  After this last failure, he held a series of minor positions in provincial government.  The works for which Song is known today all date from 1636 to 1637.  The repeated trips to the capital to participate in the metropolitan examination likely provided him with the broad base of knowledge demonstrated in the works.  Song retired from public life in 1644, after the fall of the Ming dynasty.&lt;ref name="Cullen"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Cullen, Christopher| title=The Science/Technology Interface in Seventeenth-Century China: Song Yingxing 宋 應 星 on "qi" 氣 and the "wu xing" 五 行| journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London| year=1990| volume=53| issue=2| pages=295–318 | doi=10.1017/S0041977X00026100| jstor=619236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written works ==

=== Encyclopedias ===
{{Main|Tiangong Kaiwu}}

Although Song Yingxing's encyclopedia was a significant publication for his age, there had been a long tradition in the history of [[Chinese literature]] in creating large encyclopedic works. For example, the ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]'' compiled much earlier in the 10th and 11th centuries (and all four combined, were much more extensive in size than his work). Just a few decades before Yingxing's work, there was also the Ming Dynasty encyclopedia of the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', written in 1607 and published in 1609. Song Yingxing's famous work was the ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'', or ''The Exploitation of the Works of Nature'', published in May 1637 with funding provided by Song's patron Tu Shaokui.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 36"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{wdl|3021}} |author=Song, Yingxing |date=1637 |title=The Exploitation of the Works of Nature (Tiangong Kaiwu) |work=[[World Digital Library]] |language=Chinese |location=Jiangxi Sheng, China |accessdate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;Song, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' is an encyclopedia covering a wide range of technical issues, including the use of various gunpowder weapons. Copies of the book were very scarce in China during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) (due to the government's establishment of [[monopolies]] over certain industries described in the book), but original copies of the book were preserved in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 172"/&gt;

As the historian Joseph Needham points out, the vast amount of accurately drawn illustrations in this encyclopedia dwarfed the amount provided in previous Chinese encyclopedias, making it a valuable written work in the history of Chinese literature.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 172"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 172.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the Tiangong Kaiwu broke from Chinese tradition by rarely referencing previous written work.  It is instead written in a style strongly suggestive of first-hand experience.  In the preface to the work, Song attributed this deviation from tradition to his poverty and low standing.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;

=== Cosmology ===
Song Yingxing also published two scientific tractates that outline his cosmological views.  In these, he discusses the concepts of ''[[qi]]'' and ''xing'' (形).  Qi has been described in many different ways by Chinese philosophers.  To Song, it is a type of all-permeating vapor from which solid objects (''xing'') are formed.  These solid objects eventually return to the state of ''qi'', which itself eventually returns to the great void.  Some objects, such as the sun and the moon, remain in ''qi'' form indefinitely, while objects like stones are eternally ''xing''.  Some objects, like water and fire, are intermediary between the two forms.&lt;ref name="Cullen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">'''Subject access''' refers to the methods and systems by which books, [[Academic journal|journals]], and other [[document]]s are accessed in a  given [[bibliographic database]] (e.g. a [[library classification|library classification system]]). The single records in a bibliographic file is structured in fields and each field can be searchable and combined with other fields. Such searchable data from fields of records are termed '''access points'''. Some of these access points contain information such as author name, number of pages, language of publication, name of publisher etc. These are in library jargon termed "descriptive data". Other kinds of access points contain information such as title words, classification codes, indexing terms etc. They are termed '''subject access points'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hjorland|first=Birger|title=Subject access points|url=http://www.iva.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/concepts/subject_access_points.htm|accessdate=20 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531001950/http://www.iva.dk/bh/lifeboat_ko/CONCEPTS/subject_access_points.htm|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a subject access point is defined as any access point useful for subject searching. There is no precise border between descriptive access points and subject access points. In theory any access point may hypothetically be used for subject searching.

The [[law]] in the UK on [[food labelling]] is multifaceted and is spread over many reforms and [[Acts of Parliament|parliamentary acts]], making the subject complex. It must comply with the relevant rules in the [[European Union]], for which the main law relating to food labelling is [[Regulation (EU) 1169/2011]].

There are general rules applying to any food product:
* '''Name''' – It must inform the customer the nature of the product. It may also be necessary to attach a description to the product name. However, there are certain generic names which must be only used for their conventional uses. Muesli, Coffee, and prawns are among those exceptions.
* '''Ingredients''' – All [[ingredients]] of the food must be stated under the heading 'Ingredients' and must be stated in descending order of weight when present at more than 2% in the product. Ingredients making up less than two percent may be declared in any order at the end of the declaration. Moreover, certain ingredients, such as [[preservatives]], must be identified as such by the label 'Preservatives', a specific name, e.g. "sodium nitrite", and the corresponding European registration number colloquially known as an "[[E number]]", e.g. "[[Sodium nitrite|E250]]". When ingredients are themselves made of a number of sub-ingredients (e.g., mayonnaise), these must be declared as well in the ingredient declaration. If ingredients or additives contain one of the listed 14 EU allergens, these must be explicitly named in the list. For example: 'Preservative: E220 (Sulphites)'.
* '''Nutritional Information'''– Although it is not a legal requirement to declare [[Nutritional information]] on the product, if the manufacturer makes claims that the product is 'Low in Sugar', it must be supported with nutritional information (normally in tabulated form). However, as a rule, it is recommended to declare nutritional information as consumers, more than ever, are investigating this information before making a purchase. Moreover, there are two European nutritional labelling standards which must be adhered to if nutritional information is shown.
* '''Medicinal or Nutritional Claims''' – Medicinal and Nutritional claims are tightly regulated. Some are only allowed under certain conditions, while others are not authorized at all. For example, presenting claims the food product can treat, prevent, cure diseases or other 'adverse conditions' are prohibited. While claiming the food is reduced in fat or rich in vitamins require the food to meet compulsory standards and grades. In addition, the terms must be used in a form specified in regulations.
* '''Date Tagging''' – There are two types of date tagging:
** '''Use by Date''' – '[[Use by date]]' must be followed by a day and/or month which the product must be consumed by. This is to be applied on perishable foods that usually would be kept cold: fish, meat, dairy products, and 'ready to eat' salads.
** '''Best Before Date''' – '[[Best before date]] is used as an indicator of when the product will begin to degrade from optimal quality; this includes when the food becomes stale, begins to taste 'off' or decays, rots, or goes mouldy. There are also regulations on which type of best before date must be applied:
*** Best before + Day for foods with a shelf life of up to 3 months.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*** Best before end + Month for foods with more than a 3-month shelf life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
*** Best before end + Year for food with more than an 18-month shelf life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
* '''Storage Conditions''' – If there are any particular storage conditions for the product to maintain its shelf life, these must be pointed out. However, as a rule, it is recommended to always describe the necessary storage conditions for a food product.
* '''Business Name and Address''' – In addition to the business name and address, it is necessary to indicate the manufacturer or packager if independent to the main business and the seller is established within the [[European Union]].
* '''Place of Origin''' – The food is required to specify its place of origin, especially if the name or trademark is misleading. An example of this is if the product is called 'English Brie Cheese' when it is produced in France.
* '''Instruction for Use''' – This is only necessary if it is not obvious how to use or prepare the product, in which case the consumer's own initiative must be used.
* '''Presentation''' – The label must be legible and easy to read. Also, it must be written in English but, the manufacturer may also include other languages.
* '''Batch identifier''', such as '''[[Lot number|Lot Mark]]''' or '''Batch Code''' – It must be possible to identify individual batches with a lot mark or batch code. The code must be prefixed with the letter 'L' if it can not be distinguish from other codes however, the date mark can be used as a lot mark.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Manufacturers must bear in mind that the smaller the size of a batch, the smaller financial consequences in the case of a product recall.
* '''Sectioning''' – All of the following must be in the same field of vision:
**Product name
**Date mark
**[[estimated sign|Estimated]] net weight or quantity
**Alcohol strength (if applicable).
* '''Standard specification''' - Indicate the level of the standard compliances which the product are manufactured and packaging are completed against and the specification limits if the standard is not publicly available, especially for those of:
** Microbial limits
** Heavy metal limits
** The limits of pesticide residuals
** The limits of [[preservatives]], artificial [[Flavor enhancer|flavouring]] and [[food colouring|colouring]], etc.
* '''Food additives''' - The items should be presented by their approved names (i.e. domestically), functional classes, and numbers of International Numbering System (INS) or equivalent.&lt;ref name=lgfa&gt;{{cite web

* '''Allergens''' -  Certain common [[allergen]]s must be declared explicitly in the ingredient declaration and a summary list of allergens may be added nearby for added clarity for the consumer. These include allergens present in the actual recipe's ingredients, but also those from additives and processing aids when residues may be present in the product. There are fourteen sources of allergens that need to be mentioned when they or their derivatives are present in a product:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/publication/allergenlabelguidance09.pdf|title=Guidance on Allergen and Miscellaneous Labelling Provisions|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Victor Ewings Negus''', MS, [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] (6 February 1887 – 15 July 1974) was a British surgeon who specialised in [[laryngology]] and also made fundamental contributions to [[comparative anatomy]] with his work on the structure and evolution of the [[larynx]]. He was born and educated in London, studying at [[King's College School]], then [[King's College London]], followed by [[King's College Hospital]]. The final years of his medical training were interrupted by the [[First World War]], during which he served with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. After the war, he qualified as a surgeon and studied with laryngologists in France and the USA before resuming his career at King's College Hospital where he became a junior surgeon in 1924.

In the 1920s, Negus worked on aspects of both throat surgery and the anatomy of the larynx, the latter work contributing to his degree of [[Master of Surgery]] (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for [[laryngoscope]]s, [[bronchoscope]]s, [[oesophagoscope]]s, an operating table, and [[tracheotomy]] equipment. His major publications were ''The Mechanism of the Larynx'' (1929) and his work on the clinical text ''Diseases of the Nose and Throat'', starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a [[consultant (medicine)|consulting surgeon]] in 1946.

Negus was one of the founders of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to establish his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed [[National Health Service]]. He was a member of numerous international and national [[otolaryngology]] organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the [[paranasal sinuses]], and played a key role in rebuilding and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists.

Negus, who married in 1929 and had two sons, retired in 1952, though he continued to publish on comparative anatomy and the history of medicine. His honours before and after retirement included the Fellowship of King's College, London (1945), an honorary degree (1950), the [[Lister Medal]] (1954), a knighthood (1956), honorary fellowships of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] (1949) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (1958), and the Honorary Gold Medal of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] (1969). He died in Hindhead, Surrey, aged 87 in 1974.

Negus served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC) with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] for the first 18 months of the war.&lt;ref name="TheTimesObit"/&gt; He initially deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches on the front line with a machine-gun battalion at the [[First Battle of Ypres]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; The effects of explosives during this period left him with [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name="TheTimesObit"/&gt; This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt; In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]] (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the [[Mesopotamia Campaign]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; As one of those who had deployed to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the [[Mons Star]].

==Surgical career and family==
[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|right|The structure of the larynx, in which Negus specialised]]
Following his discharge from the army, Negus, again with the advice and guidance of St Clair Thomson, resumed his studies and preparations for a career in throat surgery.&lt;ref name="TheTimesObit"/&gt; By 1921 he had graduated [[MB BS]] (London) [Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery] and by 1922 he had taken the surgical exams for the [[FRCS]] (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons) qualification.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; To gain further experience, he spent periods of time abroad studying with renowned laryngologists: firstly with Emil Moure and [[Georges Portmann]] in Bordeaux, France; and secondly with [[Chevalier Jackson]] in Philadelphia, USA.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt; On his return to London, he became clinical assistant to St Clair Thomson at King's College Hospital.&lt;ref name="TheTimesObit"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Clinical Assistant was one of the formal grades or ranks that existed in UK hospital medicine at the time.

At this point, still early in his surgical career, Negus took a different approach to that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years.&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bateman |first1=Geoffrey Hirst |date=October 1974 |title=In memoriam.

In parallel with his career as a throat surgeon at a teaching hospital, Negus become a leading expert on the [[comparative anatomy]] of first the [[larynx]] and then the nose and the [[paranasal sinuses]]. This strand of his professional life started with the research he carried out in his thirties in the 1920s that eventually led to his degree of [[Master of Surgery]] (MS), awarded by the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="TheTimesObit"/&gt; This work started as early as 1921 in the laboratories of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], whose museum housed the collections of animal specimens gathered by the anatomist [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]]. Working on these specimens, and adding to them with others supplied by the [[Zoological Society of London]], Negus carried out meticulous dissections that enabled him to trace the stages of evolution and development of the larynx across a wide variety of animals.&lt;ref name="Harrison1995"/&gt; Part of this research was submitted as his thesis, and the excellence of the work was recognised by the award of a Gold Medal with his MS degree in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1924 |title=Back matter |journal=The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology |volume=39 |issue=10 |pages=b1–b5 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=746880&amp;fulltextType=XX&amp;fileId=S0022215100026578 |doi=10.1017/s0022215100026578}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, Negus gave the Arris and Gale Lecture on 28 April 1924 at the Royal College of Surgeons, with his talk titled "On the Mechanism of the Larynx".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Negus |first1=Victor Ewings |date=17 May 1924 |title=On the Mechanism of the Larynx |journal=The Lancet |volume=203 |issue=5255 |pages=987–993 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673601666625 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(01)66662-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further recognition of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925,&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt; followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925–7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=18 May 1928 |title=Scientific Notes and News |journal=Science |volume=67 |issue=1742 |pages=505–508 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/67/1742/505.full.pdf |format=pdf| quote=The John Hunter Medal in bronze, with the triennial prize of £50, has been awarded by the Royal College of Surgeons of England to Victor Ewings Negus, for his investigations into the comparative anatomy and physiology of the larynx and the bronchi in their relation to surgery. |doi=10.1126/science.67.1742.505|bibcode = 1928Sci....67..505. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in ''The Mechanism of the Larynx'' (1929),&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt; a "classic piece of research"&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt; still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as "the standard reference book"&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt; on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt; Another lecture resulting from this work was given under the auspices of the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British laryngologist [[Felix Semon]] (1849–1921). This talk was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] under the title "Observations on Semon's Law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Negus |first1=Victor Ewings |year=1931 |title=Observations on Semon's Law |journal=The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–30 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=754668 |doi=10.1017/s0022215100035635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These earlier works were followed after the Second World War by the publication of ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx'' (1949).&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt; This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=13 May 1950 |title=The Larynx |journal=British Medical Journal | last=Wood Jones| first=Frederic| authorlink=Frederic Wood Jones| volume=1 |issue=4662 |pages=1120–1121 |pmc=2037684 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4662.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study the function of the nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell ([[olfaction]]) and the role of the nose in [[respiratory tract|respiration]]. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (paranasal sinuses) prepared by the Hungarian laryngologist [[Adolf Onodi]] (1857–1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900. Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 1962 |title=To Acknowledge a Generous and Welcome Gift from Sir Victor Negus |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=267–268 |pmc=2413452 |pmid=19310349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was covered in Negus's Hunterian Lecture, delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title "Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Negus |first1=Victor Ewings |date=September 1954 |title=Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=141–173 |pmc=2377799 |pmid=13198060}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed four years later by the publication of ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses'' (1958).&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt; Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952, both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the [[Middlesex Hospital]].&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt; Negus's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 [[Lister Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1954 |title=Lister Medal |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=173 |pmc=2377793 |quote=...in recognition of Mr. Negus's services to the advancement of knowledge in the surgery of the nose and throat by means of his researches into the comparative anatomy and physiology of the larynx and paranasal sinuses. |pmid=19309991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons.

==Societies and administration==
[[File:Royal College of Surgeons of England 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Royal College of Surgeons of England, at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], London]]
As one of the leading practitioners in his speciality, Negus served in many roles in its organisation and administration at both a national and international level. In particular, he worked closely with the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the body responsible for the accreditation and representation of surgeons practising in England and Wales, and also the organisation that supported him in his researches in comparative anatomy. The Royal College of Surgeons is located in London, and from 1939 to 1941 he was President of its Listerian Society.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt;

In 1942, Negus was President of the Section of Laryngology at the Royal Society of Medicine.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; When Negus had been training as a surgeon, laryngology, rhinology and otology had been part of general surgery, but this was changing with the advent of ENT (ear, nose and throat) medicine as a combined and specialised discipline. Negus and colleagues attempted to set up the necessary structure within the Royal Society of Medicine to represent their profession as an emerging speciality, but the regulations in place would not allow the type of organisation they had planned. This led them, in 1943, to found the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists which would be able to represent ENT surgeons through the Royal College of Surgeons.&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|More details of the founding of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists (BAO) were published in an announcement made in October 1943 in ''The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology'' by one of the co-founders Frank Cunliffe Ormerod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormerod |first=Frank Cunliffe |date=October 1943| title=British Association of Otolaryngologists |journal=The Journal of Laryngology &amp; Otology |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=436–437 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=762500 |doi=10.1017/s0022215100011476}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation subsequently became the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists – Head and Neck Surgeons (BAO-HNS), which since 2008 has been ENT•UK, which formed as a merger between BAO-HNS and the British Academic Conference in Otolaryngology (BACO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.entuk.org.uk/about/| title=About ENT•UK| publisher=ENT•UK British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists – Head and Neck Surgeons| accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For more on the early history of the organisation founded by Negus and colleagues, see ''The Role of the British Association of Otolaryngologists (BAOL) in the Development of Otolaryngology in Great Britain from 1943–1968'' (Neil Francis Weir, University of London, 2008).|group="n"}} Following the war, Negus was co-opted to the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1947, and was the first to represent otolaryngology at that level. He was also a member of the college's Court of Examiners, and worked to set up the first examination in otorhinolaryngology that could be taken for the FRCS diploma.&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt; This reorganisation was taking place against a background of immense change in how medicine was practised in the UK, due to the advent of the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Negus's colleague, Geoffrey Bateman, writing in 1974, credits him with having the foresight to represent the interests of otolaryngology and see it established as a major speciality in its own right within the NHS.&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt;

Negus became President of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists in 1951, and this was one of a number of presidencies he held, including that of the Thoracic Society (1949–50) and the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt; The latter was a large event that took place in London over a week in July 1949. It was held in the Great Hall of King's College, London, and was attended by over 700 otolaryngology specialists from 39 countries. The patron was [[King George VI]] and the congress was opened by the [[Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark|Duchess of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Ear, Nose, And Throat Research Opening of Congress |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=19 July 1949 |page_number= 3 |issue= 51437|column= G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negus was President and host for the 1954 annual meeting of the Collegium Oto-rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum (CORLAS), held in London from 29 August to 1 September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huizinga |first=Eelco |year=1954 |title=Ordinary Meeting of the Collegium O.R.L.A.S., London, 29 August–1 September 1954 |journal=Acta Oto-laryngologica |volume=44 |issue=5–6 |pages=389–392 |doi=10.3109/00016485409127646}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the treasurer of CORLAS from 1936 to 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.corlas.org/History.htm| title=History| publisher=Collegium Oto-rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum| accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negus was also associated with, and gave talks to, numerous medical societies in the UK and abroad, with his connections ranging from honorary fellowships to corresponding and honorary memberships. These foreign societies included the [[American Broncho-Esophagological Association]], and the countries included Sweden, Denmark, Canada, the USA, Austria, France, Italy, Hungary, and Turkey.&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The entry for Negus in ''Who Was Who'' includes a listing of these societies.&lt;ref name="WhoWasWho"/&gt;|group="n"}} Bateman opined in his obituary of Negus that it seemed unlikely that any other British ENT surgeon "has been honoured by so many societies".&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt;

Following his retirement, Negus continued his involvement with the Royal College of Surgeons, becoming a trustee (and later chairman of the trustees) of the Hunterian Collection, the same collection that included the specimens that had underpinned his research some thirty years earlier.&lt;ref name="BMJObit"/&gt; He also published books on the history of the college and its collections: ''The History of the Trustees of the Hunterian Collection'' (1965); and ''The Artistic Possessions at the Royal College of Surgeons of England'' (1968).&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AnnalsObit"/&gt;

==Honours, awards and legacy==

On 13 February 1969, Negus and two others (Sir [[Geoffrey Keynes]] and Sir [[Stanford Cade]]) were presented with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art."&lt;ref name="HonGoldMedal"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1969  |title=Award of the Honorary Medal of the College |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=169–171 |pmc=2387590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medal was presented by Sir [[Hedley Atkins]], the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: "Sir Victor Negus is perhaps the most distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member.

Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on.
