'''Anti-literacy laws''' were in force in many [[Slavery in the United States|slave states]] before and during the [[American Civil War]], affecting slaves, freedmen, and in some cases all people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1862/june/slaves-read-write.htm |title=Illegal to Teach Slaves to Read and Write |work=Harper's Weekly |date=June 21, 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt; These largely came into force following abolitionist [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]]'s 1829 publication of ''Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World'', which openly advocated rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Finkelman, Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619-1895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass, Oxford University Press, USA, Apr 6, 2006, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] of 1831. The Southern white public was already fearful because of the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1804 and the [[Denmark Vesey]] revolt of 1822.{{Citation needed|reason=Need a source for the entire white public being fearful following the mentioned revolutions.|date=September 2018}}

William M. Banks wrote, in ''Black Intellectuals'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Literacy also threatened the control and surveillance network for slaves in the South. Concern about runaways prompted slaveholders to require passes for all slaves traveling unaccompanied off the plantation. Literate slaves, however, could forge the necessary papers and escape to the North (few white patrollers could read well enough to verify the documents). Many slaves who learned to write did indeed achieve freedom by this method. The wanted posters for runaways often mentioned whether the escapee could write."&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banks|first1=William M.|title=Black Intellectuals: Race and Responsibility in American Life|date=1996|publisher=W. W. Norton|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/blackintellectuals.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==State anti-literacy laws==
"With the exception of Maryland and Kentucky, every Southern state absolutely prohibited the education of slaves," Angela Davis wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Angela Y.|title=Women, Race, and Class|date=1981|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1829 and 1834 Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North and South Carolina and Virginia all passed anti-literacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Pawley, Reading Places: Literacy, Democracy, and the Public Library in Cold War America,   Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina prohibited teaching slaves to read and write, punishable by a fine of 100 pounds and six months in prison, via an amendment to its 1739 Negro Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slave Codes (20 November 2016)|url=https://www.boundless.com/u-s-history/textbooks/boundless-u-s-history-textbook/slavery-in-the-antebellum-u-s-1820-1840-16/slavery-in-the-u-s-122/slave-codes-653-10159/|website=Boundless U.S. History|publisher=Boundless U.S. History|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A website titled "Fight Municipal Court Abuse (court.rchp.com) includes the following in its list of significant anti-black laws: 
* 1819, Missouri: Prohibited assembling or teaching slaves to read or write
* 1829, Georgia: Prohibited teaching blacks to read, punished by fine and imprisonment
* 1832, Alabama and Virginia: Prohibited whites from teaching blacks to read or write, punished by fines and floggings
* 1833, Georgia: Prohibited blacks from working in reading or writing jobs (via an employment law), and prohibited teaching blacks, punished by fines and whippings (via an anti-literacy law)
* 1847, Missouri: Prohibited teaching blacks to read or write&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://court.rchp.com/history/truth-of-how-slavery-started-the-black-slave-trade-and-racism|website=Fight Municipal Court Abuse|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century Virginia law specified: "[E]very assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or writing, or in the night time for any purpose, shall be an unlawful assembly. Any justice may issue his warrant to any office or other person, requiring him to enter any place where such assemblage may be, and seize any negro therein; and he, or any other justice, may order such negro to be punished with stripes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=“Offences against public policy," Title 54, Chapter 198; “Assembling of negroes. Trading by free negroes,” Section 31; in The Code of Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1BRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA747&amp;lpg=PA747|date=1849|publisher=William F. Ritchie|location=Richmond|page=747|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In North Carolina, black people who disobeyed the law were sentenced to whipping while whites received a fine and/or jail time.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Digital History, http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newnation/4384&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws restricting the education of black students were not limited to the South. In 1833, after black and white abolitionists founded a boarding school for African-American girls in [[Canterbury, Connecticut]], the state legislature outlawed the instruction of 'colored students who were not inhabitants of the state', and the school was burned down shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Andrea Williams, [[Self-Taught: African American Education in Slavery and Freedom]], Univ of North Carolina Press, Nov 20, 2009, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==

Educators in [[Southern United States|the South]] found ways to both circumvent and challenge the law. [[John Berry Meachum]], for example, moved his school out of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] when that state passed an anti-literacy law in 1847, and re-established it as the [[Floating Freedom School]] on a [[steamship]] on the [[Mississippi River]], which was beyond the reach of Missouri state law.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W.Tabscott John Berry Meachum Defied The Law to Educate Blacks, St. Louis Beacon, August 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After she was arrested, tried, and served a month in prison for educating free black children in Norfolk, Virginia, [[Margaret Crittendon Douglass|Margaret Crittendon Douglas]] wrote a book on her experiences, which helped draw national attention to the anti-literacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass, Margaret, Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman Who Was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, John P. Jewett and Co., 1854&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...Some slaveholders tolerated slave literacy. Others ignored the statutes for economic reasons, realizing that literate slaves could handle record-keeping and business transactions, and thus increase the profits and leisure time of the [[planter class]]. The prohibitions were also ignored by pious masters who wanted their slaves to read the Bible. There are also numerous accounts of planter children enjoying "playing school" and teaching their slave playmates the rudiments of literacy."&lt;ref name="banks"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Arya Vedic School''' is a [[private school]] in Ngara, a suburb of [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolskenya.net/index.php/Arya-Vedic-School.html "Arya Vedic School "], Schools.Kenya.net, ''retrieved 20 July 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by the [[Arya Samaj]] in 1980. The school has remained at the forefront of academic excellence throughout the year teaching students discipline and respect. As part of its participation in the International General Certificate for Secondary Education, the school participates in the annual Edexcel final examinations which are held between June and August every year in which the senior-most class takes part. As of 2012, the senior-most class at the primary level also take part in a similar examination. 

==School organisation==
Arya Vedic consists of a nursery, primary and secondary sections. The primary section consists of classes 1 through to 6 (class 6 being the class that participates in the primary final examinations), while the secondary section consists of classes 7 through to 11 (class 11 being the class that participates in the secondary final examinations). It follows the [[International General Certificate of Secondary Education]] curriculum in the primary and secondary sections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privateschools.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=126 "IGCSE/INTERNATIONAL SCHOOLS"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401203740/http://www.privateschools.co.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=126 |date=April 1, 2010 }}, Private Schools, ''retrieved 20 July 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school has a '[[house system]]', where students are categorized into four houses which compete against each other in various events that are held throughout the academic year such as the annual General Quiz and the annual Sport's Day. Each house is named after a prominent figure in history. The four houses are the Blue, Yellow, Green and Red houses.

-Green House is called Mandela House named after former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]].
-Blue House is called Mother Teresa House named after the Roman Catholic nun [[Mother Teresa]].
-Yellow House is called Marie Curie House named after famous physicist [[Marie Curie]].
-Red House is called Martin Luther House named after African-American activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]

==School Location==
The school is located within an urban setting in the bustling city of Nairobi. It is readily accessible from all parts of the city, and is well connected to local public transport.

The '''Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy''' is a non-profit organisation, based in Florida, that seeks to improve [[family literacy|literacy]] in the United States through programs directed towards preschool children and parental literacy.&lt;ref name=bbushwebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbarabush.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BBF-FactSheet-final-3-2014.pdf|title=Fact sheet|date = March 2014|accessdate = 3 March 2015|publisher=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
During [[Barbara Bush]]'s time as [[Wife of the Vice President of the United States|Second Lady]], while her husband was [[Vice President of the United States]], she took an interest in literacy issues, prompted by her son Neil's diagnosis with [[dyslexia]]. She subsequently began working with several different literacy organizations and spent much time researching and learning about the factors that contributed to illiteracy&amp;mdash;she believed [[homelessness]] was also connected to illiteracy.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 she wrote a children's book about her family told from the point of view of her dog C. Fred entitled ''C. Fred's Story'', and donated all proceeds to literacy charities.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; When her husband became [[President of the United States|President]] her most public cause was family literacy. She called it "the most important issue we have".&lt;ref name="WhiteHouseBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obamawhitehouse.archive.gov/about/first_ladies/barbarabush/ |title=White House biography of Barbara Bush |publisher=White House |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303162751/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first_ladies/barbarabush/ |archivedate=March 3, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barbara Bush stated her dedication to eliminating the generational cycle of illiteracy in America by supporting programs where parents and their young children are able to learn together.  During the early 1980s, statistics showed that 35 million adults in the United States could not read above the eighth-grade level and that 23 million were not able to read beyond a fourth-grade level. She appeared on the [[Oprah Winfrey Show]] to discuss the situation and spoke regularly on Mrs. Bush's Story Time, a national radio program that stressed the importance of reading aloud to children.&lt;ref name="FL bio"&gt;{{cite web

Barbara Bush became involved with literacy organizations, served on literacy committees and chaired reading organizations. Eventually, she helped develop the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation formed in 1989 with a stated aim of getting low-income parents reading, creating positive examples for their children. The foundation aimed to help young parents pass their high school [[General Educational Development|general educational development]] tests via literacy programs.&lt;ref name=USAtoday20140305 /&gt; It was first announced at a luncheon in March 1989. Barbara Bush was to be the foundation's honorary chairman, and [[Joan Abrahamson]] the chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barbara Bush Begins Family Literacy Foundation|date=9 March 1989|last=Lawrence|first=Jill|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Barbara-Bush-Begins-Family-Literacy-Foundation/id-b05aab315186222e89eeab031ef38194|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some funding came from a book, credited to the Bushes' dog Millie but ghostwritten by Barbara Bush, ''[[Millie's Book]]: As Dictated to Barbara Bush''. The book reached #1 on the ''New York Times'' bestseller nonfiction list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=September 30, 1990 Non-Fiction|url=http://www.hawes.com/1990/1990-09-30.pdf|work=The New York Times Best Seller List|publisher=Hawes|accessdate=15 March 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book earned $1.1 Million of royalties to July 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royalties from 'Millie's Book' Top $1 Million|publisher=Associated Press|date=10 July 1991|accessdate=8 March 2015|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Royalties-from-Millie-s-Book-Top-$1-Million/id-e3ea5499dbcaee0396cf8768c96f112c}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the after-tax royalties were donated to the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Millie's Book' Makes First Lady the Big Breadwinner|last=Hunt|first=Terrance|date=16 April 1992|accessdate=8 March 2015|publisher=Associated Press|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1992/-Millie-s-Book-Makes-First-Lady-the-Big-Breadwinner/id-40dedba6c83622b623dc03dd37450906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management and Activities==
Barbara Bush chaired the foundation until 2012. From then her children [[Jeb Bush]] and [[Doro Bush Koch]] served as co-chairs.&lt;ref name=USAtoday20140305&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush foundation celebrates 25 years of family literacy|last=Bello|first=Marisol|date=5 March 2014|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/05/barbara-bush-foundation-25-years-anniversary/6084981/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeb Bush resigned in 2015, leaving Doro Bush Koch as the honorary chairman, though Barbara Bush remained active in the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/jeb-bush-resigns-boards-article-1.2062765|last=Larson|first=Leslie|accessdate=12 February 2015|work=New York Daily News|date=1 January 2015|title=Jeb Bush resigns from corporate, nonprofit boards to start 2015 afresh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the foundation ran 1500 literacy programs spread across in all US states.&lt;ref name=USAtoday20140305 /&gt; The foundation's stated mission is "to make literacy a core value in every home in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Palm Beach Illustrated|last=Pfaff|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.palmbeachillustrated.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.details&amp;ArticleId=4275|accessdate=12 February 2015|title=Doro Bush Koch's Love for Literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as a public charitable organization under [[501(c) organization|Section 501(c)(3)]] of the Internal Revenue Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helpthemread.org/share/|title=Share the Love of Reading|publisher=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the organization announced a new partnership with Talk With Me Baby, a Georgia-based organization that the Foundation helped launch nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barbara-bush-foundation-for-family-literacy-partners-with-talk-with-me-baby-to-expand-language-nutrition-resources-nationwide-300328703.html|title=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy Partners with Talk With Me Baby to Expand "Language Nutrition" Resources Nationwide|last=Literacy|first=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The partnership was announced at a White House Summit on Behavioral Science Insights, along with the development of an online toolkit.  The Foundation aimed for the toolkit to be used by any care providers, from parents to nurses to teachers, to engage children and work with them in the first three years of their lives to develop language, literacy and social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barbara-bush-foundation-for-family-literacy-partners-with-talk-with-me-baby-to-expand-language-nutrition-resources-nationwide-300328703.html|title=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy Partners with Talk With Me Baby to Expand "Language Nutrition" Resources Nationwide|last=Literacy|first=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, the Foundation announced the creation of Voices for Literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barbara-bush-foundation-for-family-literacy-joins-voices-for-literacy-300406247.html|title=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy Joins Voices for Literacy|last=Literacy|first=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four other organizations will join with the Foundation with a commitment to improve the lives of both children and adults through literacy.  The other organizations have varied backgrounds and areas of expertise, allowing Voices for Literacy to reach and connect with many different groups.  The other organizations are: the Coalition on Adult Basic Education, [[Digital Promise]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], and [[Reading Is Fundamental|Reading is Fundamental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/barbara-bush-foundation-for-family-literacy-joins-voices-for-literacy-300406247.html|title=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy Joins Voices for Literacy|last=Literacy|first=Barbara Bush Foundation for Family|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups began their efforts with the "Leave Your Mark for Literacy" campaign, which involved an interactive online map tool.

'''Camfed''' (also known as the '''Campaign for Female Education''') is an international [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]], [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1993 whose mission is to eradicate [[poverty in Africa]] through the education of girls and the empowerment of young women. Camfed programs operate in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Malawi]]. 

== History ==

Camfed was founded in 1993 by [[Ann Cotton]] to support girls to go to school who would otherwise be denied an education because of poverty. The idea for Camfed came from after a research trip to Zimbabwe in which she came to believe that the low enrollment of females in school was due to poverty that did not allow them to cover the school fees. &lt;ref name= cotton&gt; https://camfed.org/about/team/#ann-cotton &lt;/ref&gt; It began with support for 32 girls to attend secondary school in two rural districts of Zimbabwe. By 2017, Camfed had supported more than 1.5 million children through education in a network of 5,500 schools &lt;ref&gt;https://camfedorg2015.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/files/Camfed_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ghana]], [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].

Anticipating the need for post-school economic opportunities for young people in marginalized rural communities, the Camfed Alumnae Association&lt;ref&gt;https://camfed.org/why-girls-education/leaders-of-change/&lt;/ref&gt; (CAMA) was established in 1998 to connect young female school leavers and offer pathways to post-secondary school opportunities. CAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. By 2017, CAMA had a membership of 84,675&lt;ref&gt;https://camfedorg2015.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/files/Camfed_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; young women, among them now teachers, business leaders, government officials, health professionals and entrepreneurs. A hallmark of Camfed is the activism and philanthropy of its alumnae network, who are actively raising and administering funds to support the next generation of children in school. 

Camfed is overseen by an Executive Team of Directors from all Camfed offices led by its CEO, Lucy Lake, who joined Camfed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://camfed.org/about/team/#lucy-lake&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Work ==
Camfed focuses on rural areas of [[Africa]] where poverty is widespread, and girls and young women face massive exclusion from education and the opportunities that are afforded by education. Camfed works to build around girls a supportive environment in which they can attend, and succeed, at primary and secondary school, and progress into young adulthood with opportunities that include professional training, higher education and job creation.

Camfed provides aid by paying for school fees, providing school uniforms, books, and sanitary protection. They also work with the school by training teachers to be mentors. &lt;ref&gt; https://camfed.org/our-impact/camfed-model/] &lt;/ref&gt;
 
===CAMA===

CAMA, the Camfed Alumnae Association, is the alumnae association for Camfed graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://camfed.org/why-girls-education/leaders-of-change/ "CAMA alumnae: Young women leading change"], Camfed.&lt;/ref&gt; 

CAMA provides a structure through which its members can develop their activism and leadership. This is referred to as the 'CAMA Multiplier Effect', where these young women graduates are now leading the movement for girls' education in their communities. The ability of CAMA members to lead and implement such long lasting change comes from their lived experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/fiona-mavhinga-/this-malala-day-as-the-gl_b_17449456.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Learner Guide Program===

The Learner Guide program was started and is run by women in the Camfed alumnae association CAMA network who volunteer in local schools to deliver a tailored curriculum encompassing leadership, health, learning and life skills to their younger peers.&lt;ref&gt;https://camfed.org/our-impact/learner-guide-program/&lt;/ref&gt; 

This is a two part project that concurrently addresses equal access to quality education for children and the post-secondary school transition period for young women.&lt;ref&gt;https://ssir.org/articles/entry/how_can_we_leapfrog_educational_outcomes&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the Learner Guide Program offers a training program for young women to become Learner Guides, opening up post-secondary opportunities, providing transferable skills training, and work experience. Secondly, Learner Guides deliver a tailored program that supports marginalized children through their education, alongside the standard school curriculum. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2016/05/21/how-some-of-the-poorest-girls-in-the-world-get-exactly-the-education-they-need/#3095b51244cd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camfed and the Sustainable Development Goals==

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]], a set of universal goals aimed to tackle [[poverty]], [[Social inequality|inequality]], [[discrimination]] and [[climate change]] across the world, came into action on the 1st January 2016. As part of the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]], these goals are designed to mobilize global efforts to transform the world in fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/&lt;/ref&gt;

Camfed is contributing directly to progress with SDG4: Quality Education. In addition, through the sustainable and scalable programs&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/education-plus-development/2016/11/22/ensuring-millions-of-children-have-the-opportunity-to-learn/&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by Camfed in educating girls, and supporting young women through their transition into secure livelihoods,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/devinthorpe/2014/09/16/how-many-girls-can-one-woman-teach-youd-be-surprised/#1c61b0e93707&lt;/ref&gt; Camfed’s work contributes to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals including Goal 1: Poverty, Goal 3: Good Health, Goal 5: Gender Equality, Goal 13: Climate Action, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3821">The '''Certificate of Mastery''' (CIM) was created by report "America's Choice: High Skills or Low Wages". The CIM has been called an outcome-based education diploma as it would be either be necessary to receive or replace the [[high school diploma]], and was characteristic of education reform legislation in many states such as [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].

The report called for the nation's workforce for the challenges of a new world economic order. The Report of the Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, published in June 1990 by the [[National Center on Education and the Economy]] (NCEE), led by [[Marc Tucker]]. This document is significant as it was the basis for the education reform laws, standards and assessment systems created by many states and the [[federal government of the United States |federal government]] in the 1990s in the United States. It codified the principles of [[outcomes-based education]] reform, which later became [[standards-based education reform]].

== Recommendations ==

From the report:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A new educational performance standard should be set for all students, to be met by age sixteen. This standard should be established nationally and benchmarked to the highest in the world. Students passing a series of performance- based assessments that incorporate the standard would be awarded a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This certificate would qualify the student to choose among going to work, entering a college preparatory program, or studying for a Technical and Professional Certificate, which would be explicitly tied to advanced job requirements. These standards would not be intended as sorting mechanisms, but would allow multiple opportunities for success; the goal would simply be to ensure achievement of high performance standards for the great majority of the nation's workforce.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
== Legacy ==

The NCEE eventually signed contracts with districts and states covering over half of public school children, including [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning|WASL]] and [[Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System|MCAS]]. 

== Abandonment ==

The formal terms and contractual agreements have been abandoned as no states or districts are still contracted to the NCEE, and legislation in states such as Washington have discarded the term "Certificate of Initial Mastery" or its minor variations. 

They have been effectively replaced by the [[No Child Left Behind]], and tying the high school diploma to [[standards based test]] inspired by outcome-based education. Passing a test at the age of 16 was patterned  after the European practice of ending the education of the non-college bound at 16 followed by an apprenticeship period, and this is why all states are using tests given at the 10th grade, even though US high schools don't
graduate until the end of 12th grade.

== The New Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce ==

The NCEE published a new study in December 2006, also co-authored by Marc Tucker which is essentially an updated version of the America's Choice report. The term "Certificate of Initial Mastery" is abandoned, but the report "Tough Choices or Tough Times" still advocates a test given at age 16 which would end high school education, followed by enrollment in [[community college]] or university prep courses.

{{Use British English|date=August 2016}}
'''Challenging behaviour''' also known as '''behaviours which challenge''', is defined as "culturally abnormal [[behaviour]](s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical [[safety]] of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities". "Ordinarily we would expect the person to have shown the pattern of behaviour that presents such a challenge to services for a considerable period of time.  Severely challenging behaviour is not a transient phenomenon."&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, E. 1995.{{full|date=November 2012}} cited in {{cite book |first1=Eric |last1=Emerson |year=2001 |chapter=Challenging behaviour |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxCoJkKlCygC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Challenging Behaviour: Analysis and Intervention in People with Severe Learning Disabilities |page=3 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-79444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenging behaviour is most often, though not exclusively exhibited by individuals with learning [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], individuals with [[dementia]] or other mental health needs, such as [[stroke]]s or [[Acquired brain injury|acquired brain injuries]], individuals with [[psychosis]] and by [[children]], although such behaviours can be displayed by any person.

==Types==
Common types of challenging behaviour include [[self-injurious behaviour]] (such as hitting, headbutting, biting, scratching), [[aggressive behaviour]] (such as hitting others, headbutting, shouting, swearing, screaming, scratching others, spitting, biting, punching, kicking), inappropriate [[human sexual behavior|sexualised behaviour]] (such as [[public masturbation]] or groping), behaviour directed at [[property damage|property]] (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviours (such as repetitive rocking or [[echolalia]]).

==Misuse==
The term "challenging behaviour" has become subject to widespread misuse, most often as a euphemism for violent or aggressive behaviour.  In educational settings it is often used to refer to acts of disobedience, defiance, or other non-compliance with authority.  This is not what the term was originally intended to refer to.  Increasingly professional groups are adopting alternative terms for example "behaviour of concern".&lt;ref&gt;Chan, J. et al 2012. Is it time to drop the term ‘challenging behaviour’? {{cite web|url=http://www.drjeffreychan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Chan-et-al_BoC_LDP-journal_June2012-1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210171200/http://www.drjeffreychan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Chan-et-al_BoC_LDP-journal_June2012-1.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Challenging behaviour may be caused by many kinds of factors, including: 
*biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation)
*social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs)
*environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities)
*psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) 
Challenging behaviour may also simply be a means of [[communication]]. A lot of the time, challenging behaviour is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviours to achieve the same aims. Behaviour analysts have focused on a developmental model of challenging behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Henry S. |last1=Roane |first2=Joel E. |last2=Ringdahl |first3=Timothy R. |last3=Vollmer |first4=Ernest L. |last4=Whitmarsh |first5=Bethany A. |last5=Marcus |year=2007 |title=A Preliminary Description of the Occurrence of Proto-injurious Behavior in Typically Developing Children |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=334–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience and research suggests that what professionals call "challenging behaviour" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that services or others create around people with developmental disabilities, and a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of services or others to listen for what kind of life makes most sense to the person, especially where services or others create lifestyles and relationships that are centred on what suits them or the service and its staff rather than what suits the person. 

Challenging behaviour can often be viewed as a ‘behavioural equivalent’ of a mental health problem. However, research evidence indicates that challenging behaviours and mental health problems are relatively independent conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2009.10.009 |title=Challenging behavior and co-morbid psychopathology in adults with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders |year=2010 |last1=McCarthy |first1=Jane |last2=Hemmings |first2=Colin |last3=Kravariti |first3=Eugenia |last4=Dworzynski |first4=Katharina |last5=Holt |first5=Geraldine |last6=Bouras |first6=Nick |last7=Tsakanikos |first7=Elias |journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=362–6 |pmid=19954927}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common principle in [[behaviour management]] is looking for the message an individual is communicating through their challenging behaviour: "All behaviour has meaning". This is a core in the [[functional analysis (psychology)|functional analysis]] process.

Children communicate through their behaviour, especially those who have not acquired language and vocabulary skills to tell the adult what the problem is.

In adults with developmental disabilities certain types of challenging behaviour can predict contact with police and hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.004 |title=Psychometric properties of the Disability Assessment Schedule (DAS) for behavior problems: An independent investigation |year=2011 |last1=Tsakanikos |first1=Elias |last2=Underwood |first2=Lisa |last3=Sturmey |first3=Peter |last4=Bouras |first4=Nick |last5=McCarthy |first5=Jane |journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=653–8 |pmid=21208774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour response cycle==
Challenging behaviours may be viewed as occurring in a cycle:
* Trigger
* Escalation
* Crisis
* Recovery

Analysis of this cycle provides a foundation for using a variety of strategies to minimise the triggers of challenging behaviour, teach more appropriate behaviours in response to these triggers, or provide consequences to the challenging behaviour that will encourage a more appropriate response. Behavioural strategies such as [[Applied Behaviour Analysis]], [[operant conditioning]] and [[positive behaviour support]] use similar approaches to analysing and responding to challenging behaviours. Recently, Eidetic Model of Growth (EMG) has been used with promising results. {{cn|date=November 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8765">The '''Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program''' is a [[United States Department of State]] [[United States Cultural Exchange Programs|cultural and educational exchange]] program which offers approximately 600 students from the [[United States]] the opportunity to participate in an intensive language study abroad. This nationally competitive program funds students who study one of the 15 critical need foreign languages, and is part of the [[National Security Language Initiative]]. The 15 critical languages include [[Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Hindi]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu]]. With an acceptance rate of less than 10%, the Critical Language Scholarship is one of the most competitive scholarships in the U.S. and the most prestigious language programs for U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name="2012 CLS Participants Selected"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 CLS Participants Selected|url=http://newsletter.clscholarship.org/2012/02/2012-cls-participants-selected.html|publisher=Critical Language Scholarship Blog|accessdate=21 April 2013|date=March 13, 2012|quote=Congratulations to the 631 students who were selected to receive the 2012 Critical Language Scholarship award! ...Over 5,200 students applied for the award, which places CLS among some of the most competitive scholarship competitions in the United States.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627154106/http://newsletter.clscholarship.org/2012/02/2012-cls-participants-selected.html|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsletter.clscholarship.org/2011/03/cls-updates-2011-program-recipients.html|publisher=Critical Language Scholarship Blog|title=CLS Updates: 2011 Program Recipients Selected|quote=Congratulations to the 575 students who were selected to receive the summer 2011 CLS award!

==Program administration==
The program is administered by [http://www.americancouncils.org/index.php American Councils for International Education] with awards approved by the [http://exchanges.state.gov/ U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs].

==Eligibility requirements==
Applicants to the program must be U.S. citizens enrolled in a U.S. degree-granting program at the undergraduate or graduate level at the time of application. Undergraduate students must have completed at least one year of general college course-work by the start date of the program. Other requirements are that the applicants should be in acceptable mental and physical health for which persons granted the scholarship are usually required to submit a satisfactory Medical Information Form and Physician’s Statement. The minimum age is 18 by the beginning of the CLS Program in the particular year.

The scholarship is open to students in all disciplines, including business, engineering, law, medicine, sciences, and humanities. There is also no discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, or disability in choosing awardees.

==Language levels and prerequisites==
[[File:CLS Host Countries.png|thumb|Host countries and territories of the CLS Institutes from 2006-2016.]]

===Beginning, intermediate or advanced level===
*[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]
*[[Bengali language|Bangla/Bengali]]
*[[Hindi]]
*[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]
*[[Korean language|Korean]]
*[[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]
*[[Swahili language|Swahili]]

*[[Arabic]]
*[[Persian language|Persian]]
*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]

===Intermediate or advanced level===
*[[Chinese language|Chinese]]
*[[Japanese language|Japanese]]
*[[Russian language|Russian]]

The equivalent of 1 year of college-level language study entails but is not limited to: 1 summer of intensive language study, 2 semesters of study (audited or for credit), or 1 year of private tutoring. A typical academic year is 9 months (36 weeks). A typical language course is 3–5 hours per week or 108–180 hours per academic year of language instruction. Applicants who have completed the CLS Program may count each summer of participation as one year of language study. Applicants must choose to apply for only one language offered by the CLS Program.

==Selection process==
Award recipients will be selected on the basis of merit with consideration for: Academic record and potential to succeed in a rigorous academic setting; Ability to adapt to a different cultural environment; Diversity; Plan for continuation of study of the language; and Plan to use the language in future career.&lt;ref&gt;Although the exact number are not given, the acceptance rate for the program overall is generally less than 10% with only 631 of more than 5200 applicants receiving the scholarship in 2012 and 575 in 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; http://www.clscholarship.org/index.php?p=news/2015/sayyestocls&lt;ref name="2012 CLS Participants Selected"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Critical Language Scholarship Blog"/&gt;
All applicants are initially read by two outside academic readers, and the top applications are reviewed by panels of academics and experts in the area and language.  Applicants recommended for selection are forwarded to the [[U.S. Department of State]] for final approval. After notification, selected participants will be required to complete a language evaluation. Selected applicants will be assigned to a CLS institute site by mid to late April based on language evaluation results along with information provided in the online application.

== Program details ==
The program begins with a two-day pre-departure orientation in [[Washington, D.C.]] Immediately following the orientation program, students are flown to their respective locations where they delve into the intensive language programs. The program itself involves approximately 20 hours a week of formal language instruction. In addition, CLS participants engage in a variety of language enhancement activities, including conversation partners, guest lectures, film viewings, host family visits (some sites), and cultural excursions. Some institutes require students to take a language pledge, which requires students to speak in the target language at designated times. Upon completing the program, students are asked to provide feedback and participate in post-program language testing.

==Grant benefits==
All CLS Program costs are covered for participants including: travel to and from the student's U.S. home city and program location, a mandatory [[Washington, D.C.]], pre-departure orientation, applicable visa fees, room, board, group-based intensive language instruction, program-sponsored travel within country, and all entrance fees for CLS Program cultural enhancement activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5386">{{For|the 1988 report|Delors Commission}}
The '''Delors Report''' was a report created by the [[Delors Commission]] in 1996. It proposed an integrated vision of [[education]] based on two key concepts, ‘learning throughout life’ and the four pillars of learning, to know, to do, to be and to live together. It was not in itself a blueprint for educational reform, but rather a basis for reflection and debate about what choices should be made in formulating [[Policy|policies]]. The report argued that choices about education were determined by choices about what kind of society we wished to live in. Beyond education’s immediate functionality, it considered the formation of the whole person to be an essential part of education’s purpose. The Delors Report was aligned closely with the moral and intellectual principles that underpin UNESCO, and therefore its analysis and recommendations were more humanistic and less instrumental and market-driven than other education reform studies of the time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Cairo/images/RethinkingEducation.pdf|title = Rethinking Education, towards a Global Commons Good?|last =|first =|publisher = UNESCO|year =|isbn = 978-92-3-100088-1|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Power|first = C.N|year = 1997|title = Learning: a means or an end?

The Delors Report identified a number of tensions generated by [[Technology|technological]], [[Economy|economic]] and [[social change]]. They included tensions between the global and the local; the universal and the particular; tradition and modernity; the spiritual and the material; long term and short term considerations; the need for competition and the ideal of equality of opportunity; and the expansion of knowledge and our capacity to assimilate it. These seven tensions remain useful perspectives from which to view the current dynamics of social transformation. Some are taking on new meaning, with fresh tensions emerging. These include patterns of economic growth characterized by rising vulnerability, growing inequality, increased ecological stress, and rising intolerance and violence. Finally, while there has been progress in human rights, implementation of norms often remains a challenge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The Four Pillars of Education ==
One of the most influential concepts of the 1996 Delors Report was that of the four pillars of learning. Formal education, the report argued, tends to emphasize certain types of knowledge to the detriment of others that are essential to sustaining human development.
# Learning to know – a broad general knowledge with the opportunity to work in depth on a small number of subjects. 
# Learning to do – to acquire not only occupational skills but also the competence to deal with many situations and to work in teams. 
# Learning to be – to develop one’s personality and to be able to act with growing autonomy, judgment and personal responsibility. 
# Learning to live together – by developing an understanding of other people and an appreciation of interdependence.
The idea of the integrated approach to education reflected in the four pillars of learning has had significant influence on policy debates, teacher training and curriculum development in a range of countries worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is important to note that the four pillars of learning were envisaged against the backdrop of the notion of ‘[[lifelong learning]]’, itself an adaptation of the concept of ‘lifelong education’ as initially conceptualized in the 1972 Faure publication ''Learning to Be''.&lt;ref&gt;Tawil, S. and Cougoureux, M. 2013.

'''Diversity University''' was the first [[MOO]] dedicated specifically for education.&lt;ref name="du-home" /&gt; Like other [[MUD]]s, it was an online realm that allowed people to interact in real time by connecting to a central server, assuming a virtual identity within that realm, "teleporting" (in other words, transporting your character) or "walking" to virtual rooms, and holding text-based conversations with others who had entered the same virtual room. The MOO server kept track of which characters were in each virtual "room," so that the comments of each character would be sent back to the computers of every other person whose character was "in" the same virtual "room." What distinguished Diversity University from other MOOs was its central structuring metaphor as a virtual university campus, as well as its pioneering use for actual online classes.

== History and purpose ==

Diversity University was created in summer 1993 by its founder (and original "arch-wizard"), Jeanne McWhorter, then a sociology graduate student at the University of Houston.&lt;ref name="carton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eduvr" /&gt; In an interview with a reporter, she described her initial purpose in creating the online educational environment: "It all began when I got interested in getting social workers online. ... Social workers all tend to be computerphobes — part of it is that we have it in our mind that computers dehumanize. I think computers do anything but — I think people are much more open and willing to talk about themselves when they're online."&lt;ref name="quittner" /&gt; Josh Quittner continues, "McWhorter figured that Diversity University would be a way to attract educators and students to computing as a communications medium."&lt;ref name="quittner" /&gt;

The overarching idea was a virtual, online university space, allowing teachers and students to interact in real time. Diversity University was originally hosted on a server at [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], although it moved to two other server environments during its life, since it often struggled for financial support and institutional backing. Its final homes were [[Marshall University]] and the University of Wisconsin - Parkside.&lt;ref name="du-home" /&gt;

Diversity University did not charge any hosting fees to faculty members and other educators who brought classes onto the MOO. Because the text-based interface required minimal computing resources for people to access the MOO, Diversity University espoused an egalitarian mission, which they articulated on their website: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mission of Diversity University is to develop, support and maintain creative and innovative environments and tools for teaching, learning and research through the Internet and other distributed computing systems, and to guide and educate people in the use of these and other tools, to foster collaboration in a synergistic climate, and to explore and utilize applications of emerging technology to these ends in a manner friendly to people who are disabled, geographically isolated or technologically limited".&lt;ref name="du-mission" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Structure ==

Although MOOs are virtual spaces — basically computer objects in a database — they are usually organized around a central spatial metaphor. For Diversity University that metaphor was a physical university campus, with buildings that represented the subject fields of the participants, along with other types of buildings that you might find on a typical university campus. In his master's thesis on "Design in Virtual Environments Using Architectural Metaphor," Dace A. Campbell used Diversity University's campus as an example of virtual architecture; one can see DU's "campus" structure as Figure 1.3 in that thesis.&lt;ref name="campbell-map" /&gt;

Guests who connected to Diversity University landed in a "room" in the "Student Union," in a kind of orientation space, while registered characters would land in whatever "room" was their virtual home in that environment. Once in a room, characters could use commands to navigate around the virtual space. For example, they could type "out" to exit from the room to an adjoining room or hallway, and they could use the cardinal directions (n, s, e, w) to "move" in those directions from room to room, building to street, street to connected street, and also into other virtual buildings on the campus. When creating "rooms," therefore, people who had building rights on the MOO were encouraged to use the appropriate version of the command (@dig) so that they would create not a free-floating, unconnected room, but a room that was joined to another room (or hallway), in the appropriate virtual building, allowing users to "walk" around the MOO. Other commands, ranging from basic to advanced, were also supported.&lt;ref name="du-commands-basic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="du-commands-advanced" /&gt;

Because the overarching structure was metaphorical, characters and guests on the MOO had the "magical" ability to "teleport" (or jump) from a room in one virtual building to another room "somewhere else" by using commands such as @go (to go to a room by its object number or name) and @join (to join another character in a room). Rooms could be open or locked, to allow (or prevent) people from joining other characters in that virtual space. Programmers on the MOO could create "virtual objects" that had the ability to move characters from room to room, such as virtual cars, a magical tour globe&lt;ref name="du-globe" /&gt; that provided a guided tour of English-related rooms in the environment (programmed by one of Diversity University's "wizards," Ulf Kastner), and a Points of Interest Board&lt;ref name="du-board" /&gt; that served as a kind of portal to every site listed on the board, among others. Many of these features have been incorporated into newer, three-dimensional versions of [[MUVE|Multi-User Virtual Environments]], such as [[Second Life]].

== Sample educational projects ==

Josh Quittner's March 1994 article about Diversity University described one of the first uses of DU as a space to hold actual university classes. In spring 1994, Leslie Harris (then an assistant professor at [[Susquehanna University]]) and Cynthia Wambeam (working as a composition instructor at the [[University of Wyoming]]) paired their English composition classes and held inter-class discussions of shared readings in Diversity University. Because the MOO environment was text-based, it offered students practice in articulating ideas in writing, which was reinforced in an inter-class [[LISTSERV]]. Harris and Wambeam discussed their experience and its effect on student writing skills in an article in ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081109025638/http://www.bgsu.edu/cconline/home.htm Computers and Composition]''.&lt;ref name="harris-wambeam" /&gt;

Because the MOO created a virtual reality by describing its environment, it provided an excellent space for reenactments of literary texts, in which visitors can be "immersed" in the world of the novel or fictional work. One such project was a recreation of Dante's ''Inferno'' (the first book of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]''), also by students in courses taught by Leslie Harris. Students recreated some of the circles of Hell within the MOO, populated with virtual robots that could interact with one another and with visitors to the site. Since the rooms were interconnected, visitors could go down from level to level, experiencing parts of Dante and Virgil's journey.&lt;ref name="harris-comp" /&gt; The fifth circle of hell was depicted virtually by students in Professor Harris' course.&lt;ref name="jisc" /&gt;

Two similar projects on Diversity University were an interactive version of ''[[The Waste Land]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]], with rooms in the MOO world reflecting sections of Eliot's poem, and a "MOO Bedford" created by R. J. LaRoe that allowed visitors to the MOO to explore the world of [[Moby-Dick]].&lt;ref name="laroe" /&gt; Many English-related educational projects existed on the MOO.&lt;ref name="du-board" /&gt;

Educators in other fields brought students to Diversity University, taking advantage of the close fit between [[Constructivist teaching methods]] and the MOO environment. For example, Professor Tom Danford of [[West Virginia Northern Community College]] taught a microbiology course in the MOO. As Dick Banks explains, "The constructivist assignments [in Professor Danford's microbiology course] include a student [[microscope slide]] set, an instructional object of some sort, and participation in a group project. The group projects are separate rooms, each devoted to a specific disease or pathogen. Students were divided into three member groups and the disease/organism was assigned in the beginning of the semester. At the end of the term, each group will present its room and contents to the class."&lt;ref name="banks" /&gt;

When you visit a room in a MOO, you see its description as you enter and you can create virtual objects in a room that themselves can be described. In a room that is supposed to represent a bacterium or other pathogen, students need to describe the features of the room in very specific detail, so that the room is scientifically accurate.  The students are thus learning in a creative way the structure of the organism they are studying, while indirectly teaching that structure to anyone who visits the room and more directly to their fellow students in the course.

A team run by [[w:Marcus Birkenkrahe|Marcus Speh]] ran a course on "Object-oriented programming using C++". This course had about 80 registrants and ran over about 8 weeks. Its value was recognised by a "Best of the Web" award in [[w:World Wide Web Conference 1|WWW1]] in 1994 [http://botw.org/1994/awards/educate.html]

Another notable project on DU was the Librarians' Online Support Team (LOST),&lt;ref name="lost" /&gt; led by Isabel Danforth, which held professional development workshops within the MOO environment for librarians who were trying to understand the growing significance of the Internet to librarianship. In an announcement for one of those workshops, Danforth explained the purpose of the group and the significance of Diversity University as a platform for such collaborations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Librarian's On-Line Support Team (L.O.S.T.) is an organization that is coordinated by a steering committee consisting of academic, research, public, and K-12 librarians from wide-spread locations. The group provides space for librarians, many of whom are being thrust into cyberspace with minimal training and support, to get both formal and informal instruction and mentoring. Librarians with various levels of background can meet to share ideas and experiences informally. The group is currently based at the virtual campus of Diversity University, a cyberspace location that offers both real-time and delayed interaction via computer and currently supports over 4,000 educators and students world-wide. Information about L.O.S.T. and its programs can be found at: http://admin.gnacademy.org:8001/~lost&lt;ref name="danforth" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

LOST epitomized Diversity University's ability to foster collaboration among educators, which was one of McWhorter's original purposes in creating the environment. Other initiatives included an online biology conference held simultaneously on Diversity University MOO and BioMOO, and a bilingual recreation of El Paso and Ciudad Juárez within the MOO environment, demonstrating the usefulness of the environment for foreign language education. Realizing the special importance of the immersive experience of visiting a MOO, foreign-language educators created other MOO spaces entirely in those target languages.&lt;ref name="edumoo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eslmoo" /&gt;

== Educational tools in the MOO ==

Because faculty members at universities were holding class sessions on DU MOO, the MOO wizards developed objects that provided some typical classroom capabilities. For example, faculty members on the MOO could use a "Generic Slide Projector" to "project" a series of text "slides" to everyone in the room, which allowed faculty members to give "pre-recorded" instructions to students, without having to type those instructions on the spot. An object called a $note (basically, a kind of text file) could be created to work like a blackboard. When students entered a room (for example, a separate room for small-group discussions), students could "read" the blackboard, which would give them questions to discuss or instructions on what to do during the class time. If faculty members wanted to record the discussions that took place in a room, they could use a "Generic Recording Device" to create a transcript of the session, for later review.&lt;ref name="du-classrooms" /&gt;

Although similar tools have now been incorporated into [[learning management system]]s, [[MUVE|Multi-User Virtual Environments]], and other programs for [[Web conferencing|online conferencing]], some of those tools were subject to the criticisms leveled by Tari Fanderclai, who asserted that faculty using new pedagogical environments like a MOO should adapt their teaching techniques to take advantage of the special possibilities of the MOO, rather than trying to make a MOO more like a traditional classroom.&lt;ref name="fanderclai" /&gt;

The online teaching tools did help faculty members conduct their classes in the decentralized and potentially chaotic MOO world, and they reveal as well the power and flexibility of the [[object-oriented programming]] environment. Faculty members did not need to possess programming skills to create objects in the MOO world that performed significant functions. If they wanted an object on which they could write notes, comparable to a course blackboard, they could create an object of that class, which would inherit all the features of the parent object.&lt;ref name="du-blackboard" /&gt; If they wanted a Generic Recording Device to record the student discussions that went on in the room, they could issue a relatively simple command (for example, @create #2978 named MyRecorder), which would create for them an object with those desired features.&lt;ref name="du-record" /&gt; Faculty pioneers using the MOO could create lists of MOO help sheets — for example, MOO Help and Policy Texts,&lt;ref name="du-help" /&gt; and the Composition in Cyberspace Project&lt;ref name="du-cybercomp" /&gt; — making it easier for other faculty to use the environment. That cooperative spirit of users helping one another out — the recognition that "everyone was once a newbie [that is, a new user of the technology]" — informed Diversity University MOO. Its shared, collaborative, highly social environment made it an early example (along with other MOOs) of a [[Social network service]], with a kind of [[network effect]] that resembled later [[Web 2.0]] environments.

== Closing ==
Diversity University shut down in 2006.&lt;ref name="wood" /&gt; Its domain name, &lt;code&gt;du.org&lt;/code&gt;, was allowed to expire on October 26, 2006.&lt;ref name="netsol-dom" /&gt;

'''Donald Carl Johanson''' (born June 28, 1943) is an American [[paleoanthropologist]]. He is known for discovering – with [[Yves Coppens]] and [[Maurice Taieb]] – the fossil of a female [[hominin]] [[australopithecine]] known as "[[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]" in the [[Afar Triangle]] region of [[Hadar, Ethiopia]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===

Johanson was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] to Swedish parents, and is the nephew of wrestler [[Ivar Johansson (wrestler)|Ivar Johansson]]. He earned a [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1966, and his [[master's degree]] (1970) and [[PhD]] (1974) from the [[University of Chicago]]. At the time of the discovery of Lucy, he was an associate professor of anthropology at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. In 1981, he established the [[Institute of Human Origins]] in [[Berkeley, California]] which he later moved to [[Arizona State University]] in 1997. Johanson holds an honorary doctorate from [[Case Western Reserve University]],&lt;ref name="Honorary Doctorate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.case.edu/case-news/2009/05/14/honorarydegrees2009 |title=Honorary Degrees, CWRU 2009 | date=14 May 2009 | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Westfield State College in 2008.

=== "Lucy" ===
{{Main|Lucy (Australopithecus)}}
Lucy was discovered in [[Hadar, Ethiopia]] on November 24, 1974, when Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student [[Tom Gray (archaeologist)|Tom Gray]] for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out of the corner of his eye, and recognized it as hominin. Forty percent of the skeleton was eventually recovered, and was later described as the first known member of ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]''.  Johanson was astonished to find so much of her skeleton all at once. Pamela Alderman, a member of the expedition, suggested she be named "Lucy" after the Beatles' song "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" which was played repeatedly during the night of the discovery.

A [[Bipedalism#Evolution of human bipedalism|bipedal hominin]], Lucy stood about three and a half feet tall; her bipedalism supported Raymond Dart's theory that [[Australopithecus|australopithecines]] walked upright. Johanson and his team concluded from Lucy's rib  that [[Lucy (Australopithecus)#Rib cage and plant-based diet|she ate a plant-based diet]], and from her curved finger bones that she was probably still at home in trees. They did not immediately see Lucy   as a separate species, but considered her an older member of ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''. The discovery, however, of several more skulls of similar morphology persuaded most palaeontologists to classify her as a species called ''afarensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald C. Johanson|title=Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins|year=2009|publisher=Harmony Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johanson and Maitland A. Edey won a 1982 U.S. [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|in Science]]&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
This was the 1982 [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science|award for paperback Science]].&lt;br /&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories, and [[National Book Award for Nonfiction#nonfiction categories|multiple nonfiction subcategories]]. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints of books eligible for previous awards but the 1982 Science was original, ''Taking the Quantum Leap'' by [[Fred Alan Wolf]].&lt;/ref&gt;
for the first popular book about this work, ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Humankind''.&lt;ref name=nba1981&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1981 "National Book Awards – 1981"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "First Family" ===

'''[[AL 333]]''', commonly referred to as the "First Family," is a collection of prehistoric hominin teeth and bones of at least thirteen individuals that    were also discovered in Hadar by Johanson's team in 1975. Generally thought to be members of the species ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]],'' the fossils are estimated to be about 3.2 million years old.

=== Awards and honors ===
* In 1991, the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSICOP) awarded Johanson their highest honor, the ''In Praise of Reason'' award.&lt;ref name="1991 Awards"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CSICOP's 1991 Awards|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=1991|volume=16|issue=1|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 24, 2014, Johanson accepted the "Emperor Has No Clothes" award at the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] 37th annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/publications/freethought-today/item/22417-crowd-loves-lucy-scientific-sleuth-johanson|title=Crowd loves Lucy scientific sleuth Johanson|work=ffrf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asteroid [[52246 Donaldjohanson]], a target of the [[Lucy (spacecraft)|''Lucy'' mission]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The official {{MoMP|52246|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 25 December 2015 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 97569}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

'''Han Pao-teh''' ({{zh|c=漢寶德|p=Hàn Bǎodé}}; 19 August 1934 – 20 November 2014) was a [[Taiwan]]ese architect, educator and curator.

Han Pao-teh was born and raised in [[Shandong]], China and moved to Taiwan in 1952. In 1958, he graduated in architecture from Tainan Institute of Technology, now known as the [[National Cheng Kung University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/fp.asp?xItem=24778&amp;CtNode=2196 |title=A Postmodern Traditionalist |author=Kelly Her |magazine=Taiwan Today |volume=57  |issue=11 |date=November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a scholarship to [[Harvard University]] in the United States for a master's degree in architecture in 1965 and then also gained an MA degree at [[Princeton University]] in 1967.

He returned to Taiwan in 1967, where he lectured as the head of the Department of Architecture at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]]. He left Tunghai in 1977 to be Dean of the College of Science and Engineering at [[National Chung Hsing University]]. He was one of the architects who played a role in the preservation of historic structures, including the [[Lin Family Mansion and Garden|Lin Family Mansion]] in [[Banqiao District|Banqiao]].&lt;ref name="Wu1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dingbo Wu|title=Handbook of Chinese Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0R-3zFSJbkC&amp;pg=PA341|year=1994|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-27808-2|pages=341–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1981–1986, Han Pao-teh was appointed by the [[Executive Yuan]] to lead the preparation for the establishment of [[National Museum of Natural Science]], the first modern museum in Taiwan, where he was also appointed by the Ministry of Education the first Director from 1987 to 1995. In 1993, Han Pao-teh was also appointed to establish [[Tainan National University of the Arts]] (TNNUA), where he was also selected to be the first president of TNNUA and the program chair of  [https://web.archive.org/web/20080403092430/http://web.tnnua.edu.tw/~museum/news_txt.htm the graduate school of Museum Studies] in 1996. Shortly after his retirement from TNNUA in 2000, Han Pao-teh was invited by the Ling Jiou Mountain Buddhist Foundation to be the first curator of the [[Museum of World Religions]]. During 1998–2001, he was also the director of [http://www.ncafroc.org.tw/ National Culture and Arts Foundation]. Han Pao-teh has been appointed the [[Geheimrat]] of [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei|Presidential Office]] in Taiwan since 2001.

Han Pao-teh died in Taipei, Taiwan, on 20 November 2014. He was posthumously given the Executive Yuan Culture Award, the nation's highest cultural award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Executive Yuan honors contributors to national culture |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/11/26/2003605346 |newspaper=Taipei Times |location= |date=26 November 2014 |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''honor cord''' is a token consisting of twisted cords with [[tassel]]s on either end awarded to members of [[honor society|honor societies]] or for various academic and non-academic achievements, awards, or honors.  Usually, cords come in pairs with a knot in the middle to hold them together.  Sometimes sashes, stoles, or medallions are given in place of cords.  They are most often worn at academic ceremonies and functions.  With cap and gown, and (sometimes) the hood, [[high school]] or [[university]] degree candidates have worn these cords at the discretion of the educational institution, but they are not usually worn with [[academic regalia]] after the academic year in which the honor was awarded. Unlike hoods and [[Academic stole|stoles]], by tradition more than one cord may be worn at the same time.

At some universities, pairs of honor cords, in the school colors, indicate honors graduates: one pair for ''[[cum laude]]'', two pairs for ''[[magna cum laude]]'', and three pairs for ''[[summa cum laude]]''. These are in addition to any cords for membership in an honor society.

'''IDP Education''' ("'''International Development Program'''") is an international education organisation offering student placement in [[Australia]], and to [[New Zealand]], the [[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], and [[Canada]]. IDP has more than 80 offices in 31 countries and 550 counsellors. IDP is also a co-owner of the English language test [[International English Language Testing System|IELTS]]. More than 2.2 million IELTS tests were undertaken around the world in 2013 and over 9000 organisations rely on IELTS including governments for migration assessment, universities for admissions and employers and professional registration bodies. IELTS Australia Pty Ltd manages a network of more than 200 IELTS test centres in over 35 countries. There are over 1000 IELTS test centres globally. IDP Australia partners with [[University of Cambridge ESOL Examinations]] and the [[British Council]] for [[IELTS]] tests.

==History==
IDP was established in 1969 as Australian Asian Universities' Cooperation Scheme (AAUCS)  universities in South-East Asia.  AAUCS changed its name to the International Development Program (IDP) of Australian Universities and Colleges and schools.

In January 2017 IDP acquired UK Educational listings company [[Hotcourses]] for £30 million. Hotcourses was co-founded by British politician and incumbent Secretary of State for Health [[Jeremy Hunt]].&lt;ref name=Hotcourses&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/16/jeremy-hunt-in-line-for-145m-windfall-over-hotcourses-sale|title=Jeremy Hunt in line for £14.5m windfall over Hotcourses sale|work=The Guardian|date=16 January 2017|last=Walker|first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38638577|title=Hunt makes millions from sale of Hotcourses|publisher=BBC News|date=16 January 2017|last=Pollock|first=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11863">An '''Internet scavenger hunt''' or '''CyberHunt''' is an [[education]]al lesson which introduces the [[Internet]] to students. It is often used as tool for teaching students how to search the Internet and how to use the resources and information available on the Internet.
It is an online activity in the form of a [[scavenger hunt]] that focuses on gathering information from web sites to answer questions or to support a concept on a particular theme or content area. The intent is to hunt for facts or information to add details for the answer to the question. The questions themselves may vary from the simple fact or statement to the more complex, depending upon the age and skill level of the student. By completing CyberHunts, students learn how to navigate a web site, scan a page for detailed information, and then apply the facts or ideas to the question. A CyberHunt is an excellent way to teach beginning internet [[research]]ing skills.

An Internet scavenger hunt is a fact-finding exercise where students answer a list of questions or solve problems as they practice information seeking skills. A hunt can serve as a powerful tool to introduce the study of a new subject or to supplement the exploration of various sides of an issue.

Although hunts frequently move from web site to web site, some direct a student's exploration of a single, content rich site. The single site strategy is employed to introduce users to the elements of a highly sophisticated site like the [[Library of Congress]] site, the government site [http://congress.loc.gov/ Congress.gov] or the [[Smithsonian]] site. This permits the teacher to highlight the key areas of a web site.

Recently, the Cyberhunt concept was expanded upon, by creating Extended Cyberhunts or Learning-by-Design Extended Cyberhunts by Dr André du Plessis and Prof Paul Webb of the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University. This newly developed strategy build on the Cyberhunt- or Scavenger hunt concept. These two academics named their extension of Cyberhunts the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy for teaching and learning in schools. The main focus of this strategy is to enable learners to become designers of an educational tool which assists them to learn during the design process, and also can be used by other learners or students to get a better understanding of a topic (see http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet27/duplessis.pdf). Learners are initially introduced to the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy by means of teacher designed Extended Cyberhunts. What makes this strategy different is the fact that there is a deliberate attempt to explore a topic by trying to answer questions that have been created based on the different cognitive levels as suggested by Bloom and the revised taxonomy of Anderson and Krathwohl. The focus is to elicit thinking on different levels and hence the teacher can indicate within brackets the level of thinking that is required. The teacher selects a topic from the curriculum and then search for appropriate web sites or web related resources that can range from pure text based online resources to online video related resources from www.youtube.com as an example. A memorandum is also created in order that the learners can ascertain whether they were on the right track. A teacher can thus create Extended Cyberhunts based upon topics that he/she might not be able to complete in class as a result of time constraints caused by whatever possible cause, but the questions to be explored be the learners have to be on different cognitive levels. However, what makes the ‘Learner Centred Learning-By-Designing Extended Cyberhunts’ (LCLBDEC) strategy unique further, is that the next step is that learners become the designers themselves as learning-as-design (see Perkins) is learning that requires a diverse range of skills. Learning-as-design undertaken by learners focuses not only on the product, but primarily on the learning that occurs as a result of seeing the design of a product or artefact as a learning opportunity where the process is just as important as the product. Learners can design Extended Cyberhunts individually or in groups on a topic related to the curriculum. This topic could a topic that has already been discussed or completed in class, but now deeper exploration can be the motive. In addition, the teacher could also identify topics that he/she has noticed that present a great challenge for learners and hence the additional Extended Cyberhunt that learners design by using different online resources that their peers can explore provide an opportunity for learners to possibly clarify their understanding. In addition, learners can also assist the teacher to design Extended Cyberhunts on a curriculum related topic that there is not time for to cover in class. In addition, learners as the designers also have to create a memorandum for the questions that they have created. Teacher designed or Learner designed Extended Cyberhunts can be designs in applications such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Libre Office or even on a wiki such as www.wikispaces.com. In order for learners to be able to create questions on different cognitive levels, teachers have to introduce the learners to the different levels of the taxonomy of Bloom and also provide them with the different key verbs that are associated with each level. In order to assist teachers (or even lecturers at tertiary level) to be able to design Extended Cyberhunts, the website www.nmmu.ac.za/cyberhunts/index.htm. The theoretical underpinnings of Extended Cyberhunts, as well as an in depth discussion of the process to follow, is available at http://www.ascilite.org.au/ajet/ajet27/duplessis.pdf

==History==
The first Internet Scavenger Hunt was developed in 1992 by [[Rick Gates (Internet pioneer)|Rick Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;Lih, Andrew, "The Wikipedia Revolution", p34, (c)2009, Hyperion.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a professor at the University of California at the time. He created the hunt to encourage adults to explore the resources on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Kozma, Tom, "The Internet Hunt", Info Tech News Issues, Wayne State University. Feb 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Gates distributed the questions to various Usenet newsgroups, LISTSERV discussion lists, and Gopher and FTP sites. He offered a prize for successful completion. As time went by he developed themed and then highly challenging hunts like researching a single email address.

==Levels of sophistication==

Beginner hunts are highly directive taking the user via a link, to the specific web page. A moderately challenging activity takes the user to a web site that has the answer to  a posed question and requires them to choose an appropriate link, use the site map, or site search engine to locate facts that support their answer. The most sophisticated activity may post several open ended questions that require the student to make many choices including search tool and method, web sites and finally the correct supporting information.

Hunts offer several advantages to using the Internet with younger web users. Since the developer chooses the web pages and links directly to them, this minimizes the risk of students being exposed to inappropriate material. With the student's web interaction highly scripted, misdirection by ads or video can be controlled.

Instructors can target the rigor of the activity to challenge students by varying the level of abstraction of questions as defined by [[Bloom's Taxonomy|Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]]. Relevance of instructional material may be addressed by using Internet based news resources to infuse current events into the lesson.

A well-developed scavenger hunt that is based on a novel enriches literature studies. It harnesses online resources to extend exploration of the setting and the plot. Highlighting historical references and lending insight through author study are also possible.

Having students create an Internet fact hunt about a subject is one method for developing higher order thinking skills while reflecting knowledge and developing technology skills.

==Benefits==

The use of online resources for instruction and research takes advantage of widely available access to the hunt and the site(s) to which it is linked. This diminishes the need for extensive investments in print resources that quickly become outdated or irrelevant. A single book can be used by only one student at a time. A single web page can be accessed by millions. Typos and misinformation in print materials are there until the next printing. Typos or erroneous information on web pages are easily remedied in a matter of minutes.

Many educational hunts are posted on the Internet permitting users worldwide to use the activity. Hunts can also be crafted in some word processing software and run from the individual computer desktop. Some developers are providing hunt activities in pdf (portable document format). This provides for a more consistent product appearance when printed. Links embedded in pdf documents are active on computers that have access to the net.

Hunts are different from a [[webquest]] since the emphasis is on facts and finding information while webquest is inquiry-oriented activity that demands that students go beyond fact-finding.

==Examples==

There are thousands{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of hunts on the web that are content focused and grade level specific.  When creating the CyberHunt, the teacher selects web sites that support their specific curriculum focus. The instructor has control over which sites have the best information to answer the questions. The students use only those sites in the activity. The intent is to focus on the material and not have students spend time using search engines or directories to accumulate numerous websites that must then be accessed, assessed and evaluated. Instead, students use their time to navigate to teacher-selected sites for the information. The CyberHunt lesson is streamlined to a simple fact-finding activity. For this reason, the typical activity takes one or more class periods to finish.

There are no firm CyberHunt rules about the number of sites, the type of questions, or the amount of activity time to be allotted. CyberHunts have been created in all shapes and forms and for all grade levels. They cover most subjects and have no set time limit. The teacher has control over the sites, the type of questions, and the final product.

'''Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory''' (Indonesian: ''Planetarium dan Observatorium Jakarta'') is a public planetarium and an observatory, part of the [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] art and science complex in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]. The planetarium is the oldest of the three planetaria in Indonesia. The second planetarium is located in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]]. The third planetarium is located in [[Kutai]], [[East Kalimantan]].&lt;ref name="sejarah"/&gt; 

==History==
Construction of the planetarium was an initiative of President [[Sukarno]] when in the early 1960s he envisaged a monumental large-scaled planetarium project. However, by the next half of the 1960s, the design was made more modest.{{sfn|Merrillees|2015|p=131}} The construction of Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory began in 1964 as part of the construction of the [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] art complex. 
The construction was funded by the Indonesian government and the Indonesian Batik Cooperatives Association (''Gabungan Koperasi Batik Indonesia'' or GKBI). 

The 22 meter dome of the planetarium was completed in 1968. On November 10, 1968, the building was officially inaugurated by the Governor of Jakarta [[Ali Sadikin]] together with the [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] art complex. The planetarium was opened to public on March 1, 1969; the day was made the official birthday of the planetarium. The planetarium made use of the [[Carl Zeiss]] Universal [[Zeiss projector|planetarium projector]]&lt;ref name="sejarah"&gt;{{cite web |language=Indonesian |url=http://planetariumjkt.com/index.php/profile/sejarah.html |title=Sejarah Planetarium |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 12, 2011 |work= |publisher=Planetarium Jakarta |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, a [[Reflecting_telescope#Coud.C3.A9|coudé telescope]] that was already a property of the institution since the 1964s was installed in a two-floored building not far from the planetarium. In 1982, the coudé telescope was moved closer to the present observatory because the land where the telescope stands earlier belongs to another owner.&lt;ref name="koleksi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetariumjkt.com/index.php/observatorium/koleksi-teleskop.html |language=Indonesian |title=Koleksi Teleskop |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 12, 2011 |website=planetariumjkt.com |publisher=Planetarium Jakarta |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1984, Jakarta Planetarium became officially the Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory. In 1991, the building was extended and facilities such as class rooms, were added. In 1994, a 31 cm star telescope was acquired to replace the older telescope.&lt;ref name="koleksi"/&gt; 

Major renovation and technological upgrade of the planetarium was done in 1996. The previous Universal Projector was replaced with the computerized Universarium VIII Projector. The material for the domed screen was replaced and the diameter of the dome was reduced from 23 meter to 22 meter. The floor was elevated and terraced. The previous central-facing seating configuration was reorganized into a south facing configuration, and the amount of seats was reduced from 500 to 320.&lt;ref name="sejarah"/&gt;
  
In 2010, a Mobile Observatory unit was acquired: a minibus which transport several telescopes e.g. the LUNT 80 mm solar telescope, Vixen VC200 telescope, and a 120 mm refractor.&lt;ref name="koleksi"/&gt;

==Facility==
The Jakarta Planetarium and Observatory features an exhibition hall for astronomy. 

The planetarium features nine movies, each with a duration of 60 minutes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16852">A '''junior enterprise''' is a local [[non-profit organization]] entirely executed by [[student]]s. Related to their field of studies the students offer consulting services to the market; experiencing unique learning opportunities by doing professional project work on the one side and managing small- to medium-sized enterprises on the other, by doing this the students add practical experience to their theoretical skills and bridge the gap between academia and the business world. Most Junior Enterprises are linked to [[University|universities]] or business [[school]]s.

==The concept==
# '''Non-profit'''
#:1.1 Not necessarily by legal status but by nature of activities (in countries, where legal circumstances affect the non-profit legal status)
#:1.2 Surplus of the JE should not be used for any economic benefits for the members of the JE unless it is for execution of project work. If the legal status allows economic benefits for Management Board, then the National umbrella should ensure that there is a rule in place to prevent this from happening in a JE
# '''Non-political''': not affiliated to political movement or party, however, able to lobby
# '''Non-religious''': not affiliated to a religious movement or church
# '''Managed entirely by students''': only students make and execute strategic decisions.
# '''Linked to an institution of higher education''', but not necessarily affiliated legally. However, support from the University should be proactively sought.
# '''Legal entity''': legal settlement should be proactively sought.
# '''Fostering entrepreneurship spirit''':
#:7.1 Proactively engaging members in decision making;
#:7.2 Encouraging them to start their own projects;
#:7.3 Actively look for new opportunities.
# '''Contribute to the development of the National Network''' by providing trainings to the Junior Entrepreneurs about the Network and motivating them to be a part of its activities.
# '''Fostering members development'''
#:9.1 The end result of every project should be the development of members by any mean;
#:9.2 Every project should develop a soft or a hard skill. The business acquisition, however, if the market allows, should focus on acquiring projects which develop hard skills (e.g.: resource management, analytics, technical, etc.)
#:9.3 Projects should assume interaction with external parties: private and civil companies
# '''Aiming at sustainable activity''' (at least one project a year must be run for clients). Thus, the Junior Enterprise seeks the quality implementation of the Concept.

==Goals==
This is an opportunity for students to develop self-confidence and experience [[entrepreneurship]] at an early stage in their careers, to add practical experience to the theoretical skills and to provide private business with state-of-the-art knowledge from universities.

Due to the particularity of the Junior Enterprise work, the [[student]]s distinguish themselves for example by their soft skills such as entrepreneurial spirit, team-working, creativity, presentation skills, public speaking, networking and intercultural understanding, work experience,  and project management.

==JADE - European Confederation of Junior Enterprises==
The [http://www.jadenet.org European Confederation of Junior Enterprises] was created in 1992 in order to link all the National Confederations of Junior Enterprises in Europe. The founding members were the Netherlands (FNJE), Portugal (JEP), Italy ([http://www.jeme.it/index.php?lang=en CIJE]), Switzerland (USJE) and France ([http://junior-entreprises.com CNJE]).

Today, the network counts 20.000 student members in fifteen countries, organised in around 280 Junior Enterprises. JADE coordinates Junior Initiatives all over Europe and fosters their development. Together with [http://www.brasiljunior.org.br/ Brasil Junior], the Junior Enterprise Network in Brazil, JADE is one of the largest student networks in the world.

As the voice of the Junior Enterprise Movement and youth entrepreneurship in Europe, JADE’s '''mission''' is to:

• Represent the European Junior Enterprise (JE) Movement

• Integrate the European Network of Junior Enterprises thus encouraging knowledge exchange and cooperation

• Support the development of our members (Confederations and Consultative Members)

• Foster the Junior Enterprise Concept to non-member countries

• Encourage entrepreneurship among students in higher Education through the Junior Enterprise Concept.

Based in Brussels, JADE works closely with the European Institutions, with international organisations (UNESCO, OECD, World Bank) to promote the importance of entrepreneurship education and youth entrepreneurship in young people, providing a valuable learning-by-doing experience and providing students with the skills they will need to be successful in the labour market.

====Impact on employment and entrepreneurship====

=====Facts and Figures=====
Diverse studies carried out by JADE, the European Commission and other parties, prove  that ''' '''participation  in  a  Junior Enterprise'''  '''dramatically  improves  a  student’s  career perspectives, employment and intentions towards entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jadenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/JADE-Recommendations-Entrepreneurship-2020-Act.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030802/http://www.jadenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/JADE-Recommendations-Entrepreneurship-2020-Act.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* More than 60% of students who were part of a Junior Enterprise find a job before ending their studies.
* Former Junior Entrepreneurs have significantly better career start after university and continue to develop more successfully in the long-term than their peers' average without JE experience. 
* 21%  of  the  Junior  Entrepreneurs  end  up  starting  their  own  business  within  the  first  3  years  after graduation, when the EU average is 4-8 %.
* A study ("Effects and impact of entrepreneurship programmes in Higher Education"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/promoting-entrepreneurship/files/education/effects_impact_high_edu_final_report_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513162841/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/promoting-entrepreneurship/files/education/effects_impact_high_edu_final_report_en.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) carried out by the European Commission (DG ENTR) on JADE Alumni, compared with normal students shows that:
** 25% of JADE Alumni indicate that it is (very) likely for them to start their own business within the next ten years; compared to 16% of other students that have taken entrepreneurial education formal courses and to 10% of students who have not received any kind of entrepreneurship education; 
** 78% of JADE Alumni find a job right after graduation; compared to 66% of other students that have taken entrepreneurial education courses and to 59% of students who have not received any kind of entrepreneurship education

==Brasil Júnior - Brazilian Confederation of Junior Enterprises==
[http://www.brasiljunior.org.br/ Brasil Junior] is the world's biggest junior enterprise confederation, composed by more than 320 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasiljunior.org.br/sobre-nos.html About Brasil Júnior(Portuguese)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519111119/http://www.brasiljunior.org.br/sobre-nos.html |date=2011-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; confederated junior enterprises and more than 11,000 junior entrepreneurs. It has as purpose to represent the junior enterprises nationwide and develop the Junior Enterprise Movement as an agent of business education and generation of new business. It is currently formed by 19 state federations.

Brasil Júnior works to bring together the state federations at meetings, and mainly, the  junior enterprises at ENEJ (National Meeting of Junior Enterprises). In 2014, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714113900/http://www.enej2014.com.br/ ENEJ] happened at Espírito Santo with the attendance of 1,800 junior entrepreneurs.

Last year, from 13 to August 17 [https://www.facebook.com/enej2015/ ENEJ] happened at Brasilia, Brazil's capital. Around 2,500 junior entrepreneurs went to the event.

==Rest of the world==

Recently, junior enterprises appeared  also in China, especially on the campus of Peking University. The movement is also taking its first step in North America with the recent launch a cross-faculty Junior Enterprise at McGill University in Canada. Shortly after the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign launched the first [[Junior Enterprise USA|JE in the US]].

'''''Kids on Keys''''' is a 1983 educational video game by [[Spinnaker Software]], designed by Freeda Lekkerkerker.

== Production ==
Spinnaker president David Seuss explained that the intention of the program was not to teach typing; rather it was to promote "keyboard familiarity", teaching kids how to reach all the keys and to type faster. Lekkerkerker wanted the game to challenge players who wanted to advance beyond using a joystick while gaming.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game contains three minigames to teach young players basic language and typing skills. In the first, players have to type the correct falling letter before it hits the ground. The second sees the player type the full name of household items before the words reach the bottom of the screen. The third sees names of objects appear at the bottom of the screen, while a series of pictoral icons appear in the center, with the players tasked to press the number on their keyboard that corresponds to that object's icon.

== Commercial performance ==
''Kids on Keys'' entered the Billboard charts for Top Educational Computer Software at #8 on February 9, 1985.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=uCQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1944&amp;dq=%22Kids+on+Keys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOu4zrrPjRAhWKVrwKHReIAUkQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kids%20on%20Keys%22&amp;f=false|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1985-02-09|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time the game had sold over 150,000 copies, and had been succssful during the 1983 and 1984 holiday seasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==
''[[Texas Monthly]]'' thought the game was "imaginative", and a decent rote-learning game, adding that along with ''[[Early Games]]'' it offered a great first computing experience for young gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yisEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA200&amp;dq=%22Kids+on+Keys%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOu4zrrPjRAhWKVrwKHReIAUkQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Kids%20on%20Keys%22&amp;f=false|title=Texas Monthly|last=Communications|first=Emmis|date=1984-10-01|publisher=Emmis Communications|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''laboratory school''' or '''demonstration school''' is an [[elementary school|elementary]] or [[secondary school]] operated in association with a university, college, or other [[teacher education]] institution and used for the training of future teachers, educational experimentation, educational research, and professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nals.net/about+nals/mission.html|title=nals.net|website=www.nals.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privateschoolreview.com/articles/159|title=Lab Schools - PrivateSchoolReview.com|website=PrivateSchoolReview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many laboratory schools follow a model{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} of [[experiential education]] based on the original Laboratory School run by [[John Dewey]] at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mi-knoll.de/122501.html|title=John Dewey's Laboratory School in Chicago|website=mi-knoll.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many laboratory schools are still in operation in the United States and around the globe. They are known by many names: laboratory schools, demonstration schools, campus schools, model schools, university affiliated schools, child development schools, etc., and most have a connection to a college or university. Each university affiliated school has a unique relationship with a college or university and a different grade configuration. Some lab schools are only for preschool or kindergarten children, some are preschool through fifth or sixth grade, and some continue through high school. 

[[Khan Lab School]] in [[Silicon Valley]] is one of the few laboratory schools not affiliated with a college or university. It is affiliated with [[Khan Academy]], a non-profit educational organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a lab school?|url=https://khanlabschool.org/what-lab-school|publisher=Khan Lab School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school's experimentation with abolishing grade levels was featured on [[Voice of America]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experimental Silicon Valley School Abolishes Grade Levels|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/experimental-silicon-valley-school-abolishes-grade-levels/3629455.html|publisher=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classroom observation==
Laboratory school classrooms may be observed by university professors to assess the student-teacher, but it is desired that the observation be done without the students or student-teachers aware of the observation, thereby avoiding creating a distraction or disruption of classroom activities.

Before the miniaturization and transistorization of electronic camera viewing systems, laboratory schools often included elaborate direct-view observation systems with special observation decks above classrooms or observation rooms alongside the classrooms. One-way mirrors and speaker/intercom systems allowed a professor to silently observe the classroom, but without being seen by the students or the student-teacher.

A modern laboratory school does not need to do anything special with building construction, and is able to use a standard-design school as a laboratory school. The standard rooms are instead outfitted with [[CCTV]] cameras hidden inside black plastic domes on the ceiling. Complex lens optics and multiple cameras allow a single stationary dome to view 360 degrees in all directions with no mechanical noises or moving parts, and high-speed Internet connections allow for a professor at a college to remotely view and interact with student-teachers in a distant laboratory school.

In either case there is no hiding from students or student-teachers that observation may occur, as it is plainly obvious there are special mirrors or cameras in the room. But they do not know when observation may or may not be occurring.

[[File:Université de Kinshasa.JPG|thumb|Buildings of the former Lovanium University in the modern [[University of Kinshasa]] ]]
'''Lovanium University''' ({{lang-fr|Université Lovanium}}) was a [[Catholic]] [[Jesuit]] university in [[Kinshasa]] in the [[Belgian Congo]]. The university was established in 1954 on the [[Kimwenza]] plateau, near [[Kinshasa]]. The university continued to function after independence until it was merged into other universities in the early 1970s. It can be considered an antecedent of the [[University of Kinshasa]].

==Early history==
Before the foundation of Lovanium, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]] already operated multiple institutes for higher education in the [[Belgian Congo]]. The ''Fomulac'' (Fondation médicale de l'université de Louvain au Congo), was founded in 1926, with the goal of forming Congolese medical personnel and researchers specialized in tropical medicine. In 1932 the Catholic University of Louvain founded the ''Cadulac'' (Centres agronomiques de l'université de Louvain au Congo) in [[Kisantu]]. Cadulac was specialized in agricultural sciences and formed the basis for what was later to become Lovanium.&lt;ref&gt;Hyacinthe Vanderyst: ''La future université catholique au Congo belge occidental'', dans ''Revue missionnaire'', 1927, pp.253–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lovanium==
The university was established in 1954 on the [[Kimwenza]] plateau, near Leopoldville (now [[Kinshasa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiOGHWRoJwUC&amp;pg=PA215|page=215 |title=Kinshasa|publisher=Editions L'Harmattan |year=2008|first=Jacques Fumunzanza |last=Muketa|ISBN=2-296-07658-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lovanium was founded by the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] in Belgium, and was named after it (''Lovanium'' being [[Latin]] for Leuven).
When it opened, the university received heavy subsidies from the colonial government, it also received funding from the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and was lauded as the best university in Africa.&lt;ref name="WorldBank"&gt;
{{Cite book | last =World Bank | title =Education in the Democratic Republic of Congo | publisher =World Bank Publications | year =2005 | location =Washington, D.C. | pages =102–122 | isbn =9780821361214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HungerCompetes"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Greenhouse | first = Steven | title = Kinshasa Journal; Hunger Competes With a Thirst for Knowledge | pages = Section A; Page 4, Column 3; Foreign Desk | newspaper = The New York Times | location = New York | date = 2 June 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official opening of the university was in 1954, the first students were to graduate from Lovanium in 1958.

Africa's first nuclear reactor, [[TRIGA|TRIGA I]], was established at Lovanium in 1958, in conjunction with the U.S. [[Atoms for Peace]] program.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Susan|title=Spies in the Congo|date=2016|publisher=Public Affairs|location=New York|isbn=9781610396547|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1971, the university merged with two other universities in the Congo to form the federalised [[National University of Zaire]] (Université Nationale du Zaïre, UNAZA). Between 1980 and 1991, the universities were again divided into three institutions, the [[University of Kinshasa]], [[Kisangani University]], and the [[University of Lubumbashi]].

'''PaGaLGuY''' is a [[Mumbai, India]]-based educational services company.  The company hosts a social media site for students, and produces an educational app called Prepathon for online learning.

__TOC__

==History==

The website was founded in 2002 by an Indian [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] student Allwin Agnel. Initially, the website was an easy to use education discussion forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2012/07/12/pagalguy/ | title=PaGaLGuY reinvents MBA networking | publisher=MBA Crystal Ball | date=12 July 2012 | accessdate=5 November 2014 | author=Kamat, Sameer | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904144124/http://www.mbacrystalball.com/blog/2012/07/12/pagalguy/# | archive-date=2014-09-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, PaGaLGuY launched India's largest B-school rankings initiative. The project was a response to a growing need of both MBA aspirants and recruiters for a credible rating of B-schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/et-empower/stockpile-pagalguy-com-launches-online-b-school-rankings-initiative/articleshow/2593488.cms | title=Stockpile: PaGaLGuY.com launches online B-school rankings initiative | publisher=The Times of India | date=4 December 2007 | accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2009, community members announced a protest against the government for a scam involving medical exams held in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.admissionbackup.com/medical-admission/medical-entrance-exam/|title=Medical Entrance Exam 2018 - NEET, AIIMS, JIPMER UG &amp; PG Exams|website=Admission Guidance &amp; Career Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students called the test unfair, inconsistent and chaotic, and alleged that the questions were leaked even as the examination was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/cat-aspirants-to-take-protests-to-cyber-world/article1-485593.aspx | title=CAT aspirants to take protests to cyber world | publisher=Hindustan Times | date=12 December 2009 | accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, PaGaLGuY created and launched an MBA [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate program]], allowing students to register on the website and apply to multiple colleges thorough a single platform. An applicant's status can be tracked, and he or she can correspond with institutes and pay application fees via the portal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In July 2012, the website was relaunched incorporating social networking features to its platform, changing from a forum website to a social network.

In January 2016, the company launched an interactive test preparation learning application called Prepathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techstory.in/pagalguys-prepathon/ |title=PaGaLGuy’s Prepathon To Enhance The Learning Skills Of Students |website=techstory.in |date=2016-01-18 |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The application raised undisclosed Series A funding in May, and in July received media coverage for its use of automated bots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/security-tech/technology/ed-tech-firms-like-smartivity-and-pagalguy-using-bots-augmented-reality-to-enhance-learning-experiences/articleshow/53328609.cms |title=Ed-tech firms like Smartivity and PaGaLGuY using bots, augmented reality to enhance learning experiences |website=economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2016-07-22 |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/prepathon-raises-funds-from-blume-ventures-in-pre-series-a/articleshow/52092578.cms |title=Prepathon raises funds from Blume ventures in pre-series A |website=economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2016-05-03 |accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, PaGaLGuY was covered as one of the top 11 brand by CNBC as a part of its book "Booming Brands - The Inspiring Story of 11 'Made in India' Brands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/BOOMING-BRANDS-INSPIRING-JOURNEYS-11MADE/dp/9387860086|title=BOOMING BRANDS– INSPIRING JOURNEYS OF 11’MADE IN INDIA’ BRANDS|date=2018-07-01|publisher=TV18 Broadcast Ltd|isbn=9789387860087|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Restaurant Empire''''' ({{zh|s=奇迹餐厅|t=奇蹟餐廳|p=Qí Jì Cān Tīng}}) is a 2003 [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] created by [[Trevor Chan]]. Developed and published by [[Enlight Software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], the player designs, owns and operates a [[restaurant]].

== Gameplay ==
The player controls the kind of cuisine the restaurant serves ([[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[French cuisine|French]], or [[Italian cuisine|Italian]]), what specific food they serve, and the staff. The player has to keep guests happy and make money at the same time.

There is also a sandbox mode which is basically freeform. There are no confines as there are in the storyline mode (regular mode) but there are no challenges either.

== Plot ==
In the game, a global culinary conglomerate, Omnifood, controls over 60% of the world's restaurants and is rapidly growing. The player must compete against Omnifood.

The player takes the role of Armand LeBeouf, a recent graduate from a French culinary school given the opportunity by his uncle to run his own restaurant. Later, the player is given the opportunity to attract investment capital and open more restaurants.

== Sequel ==
Enlight produced a sequel, ''[[Restaurant Empire II]]''. Game publisher [[Paradox Interactive]] signed an agreement with Enlight to bring the game to stores in North America. The game's release was delayed over six times; it was finally released on May 26, 2009.

The new game has several new features, including the addition of [[German cuisine]], as well as the city of [[Munich, Germany|Munich]] as a location for the player to expand his restaurant chain.

== Reception ==
The game scored a 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]]. The game was hurt by poor soundtrack, blurry textures, and blocky character models. The game was helped however by overall good gameplay.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==History==

===1868-1958===
What is now The Royal Commonwealth Society was founded in 1868, as a non-political, [[Learned society|learned organisation]]; a [[royal charter]] was granted in 1869, and a [[Gentlemen's club|clubhouse]] opened in 1885. The Society's name slowly evolved: from ''The Colonial Society'' (1868-1869), to ''The Royal Colonial Society'' (1869-1870), to ''The Royal Colonial Institute'' (1870-1928), to ''The Royal Empire Society (1928-1958)''; ''The Royal Commonwealth Society'' was adopted in 1958.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/beyond-the-league-of-gentlemen/404541.article#survey-answer |title=Beyond the league of gentlemen |date=2008 |work= |publisher=''[[Times Higher Education]]'' |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society may be seen from early on to have been [[Progressivism|progressive]] in its time towards [[Equality and diversity (United Kingdom)|equality and diversity]]. A [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|woman]] was first invited by The Royal Colonial Institute to read a [[Academic journal|research paper]] in 1894, and The Royal Colonial Institute was one of the first learned organisations to admit women as full [[Fellow]]s, in 1922.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The Society's first Asian member was Ji ju Sanjo, son of the Japanese prime minister ([[Sanjo Sanetomi]]), in 1872; the first African member was Samuel Bannerman, of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], in 1879.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ex+libris%3A+the+destruction+of+a+great+commonwealth+treasure-a014249400 |title=Ex libris: the destruction of a great commonwealth treasure |date=1992 |work= |publisher=''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the Society was for more than a hundred years inseparably bound up with its [[Library]]. At a meeting on 26 June 1868, [[Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue, 1st Baron Carlingford|Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue]] recommended "the formation of a colonial library, to which all interested in the welfare of the colonies should have access," an aim affirmed by the Society's first elected chairman, [[William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle|Viscount Bury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge University Library: The Great Collections |last=Fox |first=Peter |year=1998 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0521626471 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's first librarian was appointed in 1869, and the first salaried librarian, Australian-born [[Joseph Sylvester O'Halloran]], in 1885. The person mainly responsible for the Library's remarkable development and international reputation was Evans Lewin, Master Librarian for thirty-six years, 1910-1946.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

The Society’s first home was above a shirt shop at No. 15 The [[Strand, London]], where it remained from 1870 until 1885. It was in this modest space that the organisation’s Library collection began to be assembled.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craggs |first=R. |date=2008 |title=Situating the imperial archive: the Royal Empire Society Library 1868–1945 |url=https://www.academia.edu/300475/Situating_the_Imperial_Archive_the_Royal_Empire_Society_Library_1868-1945 |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=48–67 |doi= 10.1016/j.jhg.2007.04.002|access-date=17 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's Library quickly increased in size and reputation, and the organisation moved in 1885 to 25 [[Northumberland Avenue]] in [[Central London]], where it would remain until 2013. The site was completely rebuilt in 1936 to the design of architect Sir [[Herbert Baker]], providing a greatly extended Library.&lt;ref name="library"/&gt; The expanded and renovated premises was formally opened on 12 November 1936 by the Duke and Duchess of York, later King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;
[[File:The Second World War 1939 - 1945- the Home Front HU1129.jpg|thumb|London during [[the Blitz]]]]
[[The Blitz]] had a devastating effect on the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters and Library. On the night of 16/17 April 1941 the building was struck by a two-ton bomb. Seventy-four people were present at the time; one member was killed and another injured, and two members of staff badly hurt. Fire ignited by the blast and the large quantity of water pumped in to extinguish it meant some unique collections were destroyed; examples, painstakingly assembled over more than seventy years, included: the Library of Overseas Law, the contents of the Newspaper Room, and sections covering the general [[British Empire]], foreign colonies, the [[World War I|First World War]], [[Malta]] and [[Gibraltar]]. The lost collections on the [[German colonial empire]], the [[French colonial empire]], the [[Dutch Empire]], the [[Italian Empire]], and [[Belgian overseas colonies]] - mainly in [[foreign language]]s and published overseas - were unique in the United Kingdom. Numerous early accounts of [[exploration]], voyages and [[travel]] were likewise destroyed. Out of a collection of 260,000, total losses were estimated at approximately 35,000 books and 5,000 pamphlets.&lt;ref name="cambridge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://specialcollections.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=5147 |title=The Royal Commonwealth Society Library and the Blitz |date=2013 |work= |publisher=[[Cambridge University Library]] |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 10/11 May 1941, the hardest night of the Blitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/history-of-the-battle-of-britain/the-blitz-the-hardest-night.aspx |title=The Blitz - The Hardest Night |date=2016 |work= |publisher=[[Royal Air Force Museum London]] |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Northumberland Avenue address was again severely damaged.

The Society persevered, adopting the ‘[[Business as usual (policy)|Business as Usual]]’ motto characteristic of Britons targeted in the Blitz. The subsequent issue of the Society's journal ''United Empire'', May-June 1941, reported the resumption of activities including its Saturday afternoon dances for members of the Overseas Armed Forces. Determined attempts were made to replace the Library’s losses, drawing helpful donations from institutions and individuals and an award from the [[War Damage Commission]], but many items proved irreplaceable.&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt; Full restoration of the Society's Northumberland Avenue headquarters was completed in 1957; the building was officially re-opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and a grand Festival organised to celebrate the event. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of 14 April 1957 noted that the nose of the 16/17 April 1941 bomb was displayed in a prominent position, reflecting "the true spirit of British sportsmanship."&lt;ref name="cambridge"/&gt;

===1958 - present===
The name ''The Royal Commonwealth Society'' was adopted in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11293377 |title=Royal Empire Society: alteration of name to Royal Commonwealth Society |date=2006 |work= |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] |accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiasm may seem to have surrounded the Commonwealth in the 1950s, but political tides began to flow against the Society; for example, [[newsroom]] space was taken for the fledgling [[Voluntary Service Overseas]] (1961-3), which began life under the wing of the Royal Commonwealth Society.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

The Society's library, despite the damage caused by the [[Germany|German]] bombing offensive in [[World War II]], grew to over half a million items; ''[[The Contemporary Review]]'' described the collection as "the most comprehensive single source for the history of the world's greatest empire from its 16th century beginnings to its present fifty-nation Commonwealth."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; [[Cambridge University Library]] recognised the collection as a "treasure-trove" of information on the Commonwealth and Britain's former colonial territories, comprising over 300,000 printed items, about 800 archival collections (including manuscript diaries, correspondence, pictures, cine films, scrapbooks and newspaper cuttings) and over 120,000 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/royal-commonwealth-society |title=Welcome to the Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) Library collections |date=2017 |work= |publisher=[[Cambridge University Library]] |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 to 1987 the society's librarian was Donald Simpson (1920-2002), who had joined the staff in 1945. He was in advance of other librarians of his time in recognising the importance of photographs and ensured that photographic collections were identified and catalogued. He was the author of ''Dark Companions'' (1975), a book about the indigenous associates of explorers.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' obituary; 28 Oct. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Interior reading room.jpg|thumb|[[Cambridge University Library]]'s interior reading room]]
From the late 1960s, however, increasing financial problems, combined with severe [[Water damage|flood damage]], led to the conclusion that it was no longer viable for the Society to maintain its Library. Cambridge University Library acquired the Library's collection in 1993. There had been a sign of things to come when a notable chairman of the Library, Sir [[Alan Burns (governor)|Alan Burns]] (who in 1948 had published a study called ''Colour Prejudice'', a groundbreaking contribution to the subject), resigned from his post in protest at the Society's attempt to sell off Library books in order to supplement its income.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

Cambridge Library's intervention enabled the Society to clear its debts and, in 1994, to redevelop the Northumberland Avenue site, to the design of architect Linda Morey Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womanthology.co.uk/linda-morey-smith-founder-managing-director-morey-smith-looking-things-differently-encouraging-women-design-architecture-go-beyond-expected-find-success/ |title=Linda Morey Smith, Principal Director and Founder of MoreySmith |date=2014 |work= |publisher=Womanthology |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012, unfortunately, financial pressures again presented a challenge. The Society found it necessary in 2013 to sell its longstanding headquarters at Northumberland Avenue, and it moved in 2014 to a new London office, at [[Pall Mall, London]], with a view to focusing on its [[Charitable organization|charitable]] work.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The Royal Commonwealth Society is now the centre of an international [[Business networking|network]] of more than 10,000 members, spread across 100 countries and territories, and linked by around seventy self-governing Society branches and Commonwealth societies, in forty-three countries and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110012585 |title=Royal Commonwealth Society. New South Wales Branch records, ca. 1865-ca. 1992 |date=2017 |work= |publisher=[[State Library of New South Wales]] |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its [[Education|educational]], [[Youth service|youth]] and [[outreach]] programmes, the Society aims to encourage young people to develop skills and, with an increased understanding of their role as [[Global citizenship|global citizen]]s, to engage with challenges facing the international community. It aims to bring alive the principles of the modern Commonwealth - [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Cultural diversity|diversity]], [[Political freedom|freedom]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], [[Liberal democracy|democracy]], [[International human rights law|human rights]], and [[sustainable development]] - to a generation living in an increasingly interconnected world. Society projects aim to enable young people to engage with their counterparts across the Commonwealth in [[youth leadership]] programmes, and [[creative writing]] and [[Filmmaking|film-making]] projects. Through its charitable programmes and its international network, the Society's remit is to work towards the continued growth and resilience of Commonwealth [[civil society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thercssa.com.au/our-story.html |title=Our story |date=2017 |work= |publisher=Royal Commonwealth Society; South Australia Branch |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society is one of three bodies supporting The [[Queen's Commonwealth Canopy]], a project launched in 2015 to preserve and promote forested areas throughout the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite news|work=Radio Times|date=16 April 2018|author=Terry Payne|title=How the Queen is putting politicians to shame with her Commonwealth Canopy project|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-04-16/the-queens-green-planet-itv-commonwealth-canopy-project/|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queen's Commonwealth Canopy|url=https://queenscommonwealthcanopy.org/|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6725">The '''''Schweich Lectures on Biblical Archaeology''''' are a series of lectures delivered and published under the auspices of the [[British Academy]]. The Leopold Schweich Trust Fund, set up in 1907, was a gift from Miss Constance Schweich in memory of her father. It provided for three public lectures to be delivered annually (now triennially) on subjects related to ‘the archaeology, art, history, languages and literature of Ancient Civilization with reference to Biblical Study’.

'''Social learning''' ('''social pedagogy''') is learning that takes place at a wider scale than individual or [[group learning]], up to a societal scale, through social interaction between peers. It may or may not lead to a change in attitudes and behaviour.

==  Definition ==
[[Social learning theory|Social learning]] is defined as learning through the observation of other people’s behaviors. It is a process of social change in which people learn from each other in ways that can benefit wider social-ecological systems. Different social contexts allow individuals to pick up new behaviors by observing what people are doing within that environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Social learning and social pedagogy emphasize the dynamic interaction between people and the environment in the construction of meaning and identity.

The process of learning a new behaviour starts by observing a behaviour, taking the information in and finally adopting that behaviour. Examples of environmental contexts that promote social learning are schools, media, family members and friends.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

If learning is to be considered as social, then it must:
# demonstrate that a change in understanding has taken place in the individuals involved;
# demonstrate that this change goes beyond the individual and becomes situated within wider social units or communities of practice;
# occur through social interactions and processes between actors within a social network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thempra.org.uk/social-pedagogy/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a theoretical system that focuses on the development of the child and how practice and training affect their life skills. This idea is centered around the notion that children are active and competent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2009/03/13/social-pedagogy-in-practice/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== 18th century ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] brings forth the idea that all humans are born good but are ultimately corrupted by society, implying a form of social learning.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== 19th century ===
The literature on the topic of social pedagogy tends to identify German educator [[Karl Mager]] (1810-1858) as the person who coined the term ‘social pedagogy’ in 1844. Mager and [[Friedrich Diesterweg|Friedrich Adolph Diesterweg]] shared the belief that education should go beyond the individual’s acquisition of knowledge and focus on the acquisition of culture by society. Ultimately, it should benefit the community itself.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== 1900s - 1950s ===
[[Developmental psychology]] focused on the theories of [[Radical behaviorism|behaviorism]] from [[B. F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]’s [[psychoanalytic theory]] to explain how humans learn new behaviours.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The founding father of social pedagogy, German philosopher and educator [[Paul Natorp]] (1854-1924) published the book ''Sozialpädagogik: Theorie der Willensbildung auf der Grundlage der Gemeinschaft'' (Social Pedagogy: The theory of educating the human will into a community asset) in 1899. Natorp argued that in all instances, pedagogy should be social. Teachers should consider the interaction between educational and societal processes.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schugurensky &amp; Silver|first=|date=2013|title=Social pedagogy: Historical traditions and transnational connections|url=|journal=Education policy analysis archives|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1950s - 1990s ===
The field of [[developmental psychology]] underwent significant changes during these decades as social learning theories started to gain traction through the research and experiments of Psychologists such as [[Julian Rotter]], [[Albert Bandura]] and [[Robert Richardson Sears|Robert Sears]]. In 1954, Julian Rotter developed his social learning theory which linked human behavior changes with environmental interactions. Predictable variables were behavior potential, expectancy, reinforcement value and psychological situation. Bandura conducted his [[bobo doll experiment]] in 1961 and developed his social learning theory in 1977.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edinyang|first=David|date=Summer 2016|title=The Significance of Social Learning theories in the Teaching of Social Studies Education|url=http://www.eajournals.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Significance-of-Social-Learning-Theories-in-the-Teaching-of-Social-Studies-Education.pdf|journal=International Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Research|volume=2|pages=40–45|via=ea journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; These contributions to the field of developmental psychology cemented a strong knowledge foundation and allowed researchers to build on and expand our understanding of human behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Theories ==

=== Jean-Jacques Rousseau - Natural Man ===
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712 - 1778), with his book ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emile, or On Education|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=|year=1762|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced his pedagogic theory where the child should be brought up in harmony with nature. The child should be introduced to society only during the fourth stage of development, the age of moral self-worth (15 to 18 years of age). That way, the child enters society in an informed and self-reliable manner, with one's own judgment. Rousseau's conceptualization of childhood and adolescence is based on his theory that human beings are inherently good but corrupted a society that denaturalize them. Rousseau is the precursor of the child-centered approach in education.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riley|first=Patrick|date=2011|title=Rousseau’s philosophy of transformative, ‘denaturing’ education|url=|journal=Oxford Review of Education|volume=37|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karl Mager - Social Pedagogy ===
[[Karl Mager]] (1810 - 1858) is often identified as the one who coined the term social pedagogy. He held the belief that education should focus on the acquisition of knowledge but also of culture through society and should orient its activities to benefit the community. It also implies that knowledge should not solely come from individuals but also from the larger concept of society.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schugurensky &amp; Silver|first=|date=2013|title=Social pedagogy: Historical traditions and transnational connections|url=|journal=Education Policy Analysis Archive|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paul Natorp - Social Pedagogy ===
[[Paul Natorp]] (1854 - 1924) was a German philosopher and educator. In 1899, he published ''Sozialpädagogik: Theorie der Willensbildung auf der Grundlage der Gemeinschaft'' (Social Pedagogy: The theory of educating the human will into a community asset). According to him, education should be social, thus an interaction between educational and social processes. Natorp believed in the model of Gemeinshaft (small community) in order to build universal happiness and achieve true humanity. At the time, philosophers like [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Locke]], [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] were preoccupied by the structure of society and how it may influence human interrelations. Philosophers were not solely thinking of the child as an individual but rather at what he/she can bring to creating human togetherness and societal order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beds.ac.uk/jpd/volume-3-issue-2/key-pedagogic-thinkers-paul-natorp|title=Key Pedagogic Thinkers: Paul Natorp|last=Eichsteller &amp; Holthoff|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natorp's perspective was influenced by [[Plato]]'s ideas about the relation between the individual and the city-state (''[[polis]]''). The ''polis'' is a social and political structure of society that, according to Plato, allows individuals to maximize their potential. It is strictly structured with classes serving others and philosopher kings setting universal laws and truths for all. Furthermore, Plato argued for the need to pursue intellectual virtues rather than personal advancements such as wealth and reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politics.virginia.edu/georgeklosko/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/09/plato6.pdf|title=Plato's Political Philosophy|last=Klosko|first=George|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natorp's interpretation of the concept of the ''polis'' is that an individual will want to serve his/her community and state after having been educated, as long as the education is social (''Sozialpädagogik).''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Natorp focused on education for the working class as well as social reform. His view of social pedagogy outlined that education is a social process and social life is an educational process. Social pedagogic practices are a deliberative and rational form of socialization. Individuals become social human beings by being socialized into society. Social pedagogy involves teachers and children sharing the same social spaces.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Herman Nohl - Hermeneutic Perspective ===
Herman Nohl (1879 - 1960) was a German pedagogue of the first half of the twentieth century. He interpreted reality from a hermeneutical perspective (methodological principles of interpretation) and tried to expose the causes of social inequalities. According to Nohl, social pedagogy's aim is to foster the wellbeing of student by integrating into society youth initiatives, programs and efforts. Teachers should be advocates for the welfare of their students and contribute to the social transformations it entails. Nohl conceptualized a holistic educative process that takes into account the historical, cultural, personal and social contexts of any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schugurensky &amp; Silver|first=|date=|title=Social pedagogy: Historical traditions and transnational connections|url=|journal=Education policy analysis archives|volume=21|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Sears - Social Learning ===
[[Robert Richardson Sears]] (1908 - 1989) focused his research mostly on the [[stimulus-response theory]]. Much of his theoretical effort was expended on understanding the way children come to internalize the values, attitudes, and behaviours of the culture in which they are raised. Just like Albert Bandura, he focused most of his research on aggression, but also on the growth of resistance to temptation and guilt, and the acquisition of culturally-approved sex-role behaviors. Sears wanted to prove the importance of the place of parents in the child's education, concentrating on features of parental behaviour that either facilitated or hampered the process. Such features include both general relationship variables such as parental warmth and permissiveness and specific behaviours such as punishment in the form of love withdrawal and power assertion.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grusec|first=Joan|date=1992|title=Social Learning Theory and Developmental Psychology: The Legacies of Robert Sears and Albert Bandura|url=|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=28|pages=776–786|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albert Bandura - Social Learning ===
[[Albert Bandura]] advanced the social learning theory by including the individual and the environment in the process of learning and imitating behaviour. In other words, children and adults learn or change behaviours by imitating behaviours observed in others. Albert Bandura mentions that the environment plays an important role as it is the [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that triggers the learning process. For example, according to Bandura (1978), people learn aggressive behaviour through 3 sources: Family members, community and mass media. Research shows that parent who prefer aggressive solution to solve their problems tend to have children who use aggressive tactics to deal with other people. Research also found that communities in which fighting prowess are valued have a higher rate of aggressive behaviour. Also, findings show that watching televisions can have at least 4 different effect on people: 1) it teaches aggressive style of conduct, 2) it alters restraints over aggressive behavior,3) it desensitizes and habituate people to violence and 4) it shapes people’s image of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1978|title=Social Learning of Aggression|url=|journal=Albert Journal of Communication|volume=|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment also allows people to learn through another person’s experience. For example, students don’t cheat on exams (at least no openly) because they know the consequences of it, even if they never experienced the consequences themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Human Development|last=Salkind|first=Nail J.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, still according to Banduras, the learning process does not stop at the influence of the family, community and media, the internal process (individual thoughts, values, etc.) will determine at which frequency and which intensity an individual will imitate and adopt a certain behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Human Development|last=Salkind|first=Neil.J|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, parents plays an important role in a child’s education for two reasons: Firstly, because of the frequency and intensity of the interactions and secondly because the children often admire their parent and often take them as role models.&lt;ref name="Salkind 2004 16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Human Development|last=Salkind|first=Neil.J|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even if the stimuli is the parents' interactions with their children, if their child did not admire them, their children would not reproduce their behaviour as often. That is the main difference between early social learning theory and Bandura’s point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Theories of Human Development|last=Salkind|first=Neil. J|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is called [[reciprocal determinism]], which means that the developmental process is bidirectional, and that the individual has to value his environment in order to learn for it.&lt;ref name="Salkind 2004 16"/&gt;  Bandura also states that this process starts at births; indeed, research shows that infants are more receptive to certain experiences and less to others'''.'''&lt;ref name="Bandura 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1979|title=Self-Referent Mechanisms in Social Learning Theory|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Albert Bandura also says that most human behaviours are driven by goals and that we regulate our behaviour through weighing the benefits and the troubles that we can get into because of a particular behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bandura 1979"/&gt;

== Application in education and pedagogy ==
Social learning and social pedagogy has proven its efficiency with the application in practical professions, like [[nursing]], where the student can observe a trained professional in a professional/work settings, and they can learn about nursing throughout all its aspects: interactions, attitudes, co-working skills and the nursing job itself. Students who have taken part in social learning state that they increased their nursing skills, and that it could only be possible with a good learning environment, a good mentor, and a student who is assertive enough.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1054/nedt.2000.0522 |pmid=11170797 |title=Social Learning Theory: Its application in the context of nurse education |journal=Nurse Education Today |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=110–7 |year=2001 |last1=Bahn |first1=Dolores }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It means that social learning can be achieved with a good mentor, but one needs to be a good listener too. This mentoring experience creates what Albert Bandura called observational learning, when students observe a well-trained model/teacher and the students's knowledge and understanding increase.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Experiences in the field for student teachers are a good way to show how social pedagogy and social learning contribute to one's education. Indeed, field experiences are part of a student's life in their route to their teaching degree. Field experiences are based on the social learning theory; a student follows a teacher for some time, at first observing the cooperating teacher and taking notes about the teaching act. The second part of the field experience is actual teaching, and receiving feedback from the role model and the students. The student teachers try as much as they can to imitate what they have learned by observing their cooperating teacher.

[[Cyberbullying]] being an issue in schools, social pedagogy can be a solution to decrease this trend. Indeed, the bullied pupil can build a relationship with a particular mentor or role model, which in return can empower the student to deal with issues such as cyberbullying.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kyriacou|first=Chris|last2=Zuin|first2=Antônio|date=2016|title=Cyberbullying and moral disengagement: an analysis based on a social pedagogy of pastoral care in schools|journal=Pastoral Care in Education|language=English|volume=34|issue=1|pages=38|issn=0264-3944|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can work both on the victim and the bully, since both may lack confidence and affection. Using social pedagogy instead of punishments and reactive actions is also a way to derive from the traditional model of raising children, and teaching, which relies on punishments and rewards.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Parent education is also based on social learning. From birth, children look at their parents and try to model what they do, how they talk, and what they think. Of course, a child’s environment is much larger than only their familiar environment, but it is an influential part. A study by Dubanoski and Tanabe&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, was made on parenting and social learning, where parents had to attend classes that would teach them social learning principles to improve their children’s behaviour. The classes taught the parents how to record objectively their children’s behaviour, and to deal with them by teaching the correct behaviour, not by punishing the wrong one. A significant number of parents improve their children behaviour by the end of the study.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubanoski|first=Richard A|last2=Tanabe|first2=Gilfred|date=1980|title=Parent Education: A Classroom Program on Social Learning Principles|url=|journal=Familyrelations Family Relations|language=English|volume=29|issue=1|pages=16–19|issn=0197-6664|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of how long social learning takes is important for the design of learning initiatives, teaching experiences and policy interventions. The process of going beyond individual learning to a broader understanding situated in a community of practice can take some time to develop. A longitudinal case study in Australia&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; looked at an environmental group concerned about [[land degradation]]. The whole project was led by a local committee, Wallatin Wildlife and Landcare. They wanted to "encourage social learning among landholders through field visits, focus groups, and deliberative processes to balance innovative 'thinking outside the box' with judicious use of public funds".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Measham|first=Thomas G.|date=2013|title=How Long Does Social Learning Take? Insights from a Longitudinal Case Study|url=|journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|volume=26|pages=1470|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that social learning was documented after approximately fifteen months, but was initially restricted to an increased understanding of the problem without improved knowledge to address it. Further knowledge necessary to address the problem in focus emerged during the third year of the program. This suggests that learning initiatives could take around three years to develop sufficient new knowledge embedded in a community of practice in order to address complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Measham|first1=T.G.|year=2013|title=How long does social learning take?|journal=Society and Natural Resources|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1468–1477|doi=10.1080/08941920.2013.799726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social media and technology ==
===Benefits===
Social pedagogy is in fact the interaction between society and the individual, which create a learning experience. Therefore, if talking about the current development of social pedagogy and social learning, the recent trend in term of learning in our society, is the use of [[social media]] and other forms of technology. On one side, if well designed within an educational framework, social media can surely help with the development of certain essential skills:

* [[Digital literacy]]
* [[Independence]] and [[Autodidacticism|self-learning]]
* [[Social network|Network]]ing
* [[Knowledge management]]
* [[Decision-making]]
* [[Collaboration]]/[[teamwork]] &lt;ref name="tonybates.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tonybates.ca/2015/01/20/seeking-the-unique-pedagogical-characteristics-of-social-media/|title=Seeking the unique pedagogical characteristics of social media {{!}} Tony Bates|website=www.tonybates.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it can be seen that social media can be extremely useful for developing some of the key skills needed in this digital age. For instance, “the main feature of social media is that they empower the end user to access, create, disseminate and share information easily in a user-friendly, open environment".&lt;ref name="tonybates.ca"/&gt; By using social media, the learning experience becomes easier and more accessible to all. By allowing social media in the pedagogical program of our young students, it could help them to grow and fully participate in our [[digital society]].&lt;ref name="tonybates.ca" /&gt;

With the growing use of technology and different social platform in many aspects of our life, we can use social media at work and at home as well as in schools. It can be seen that social media now enables teachers to set online group work, based on cases or projects, and students can collect data in the field, without any need for direct face-to-face contact with either the teacher or other students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching crowds: learning and social media|last=Dron &amp; Anderson|first=|publisher=AU Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
The benefits of social media in education stipulate how easier the communication between individuals becomes. However, others will argue that it excludes the vital tacit knowledge that direct, face-to-face interpersonal contact enables, and that social learning is bound up with physical and spatial learning. Social learning includes sharing experiences and working with others. Social media facilitates those experiences but make it less effective by eliminating the physical interaction between individuals. The more time students spend on social sites, the less time they spend socializing in person. Because of the lack of nonverbal cues, like tone and inflection, the use of social media is not an adequate replacement for face-to-face communication. Students who spend a great amount of time on social networking sites are less effective at communicating in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.profweb.ca/en/publications/articles/pedagogical-uses-of-social-media-summary-of-a-refad-workshop|title=Pedagogical Uses of Social Media: Summary of a REFAD Workshop|website=Profweb|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the omnipresence of technology in our life and the easy access to unlimited source of information, the difference between using technology as a tool and not as an end in itself needs to be understood.&lt;ref name="tonybates.ca"/&gt;

The '''Society of Aviation and Flight Educators''' ('''SAFE''') is a professional organization open to all [[aviation]] educators, including [[flight instructor]]s, [[Ground Instructor|ground instructors]], academicians, and others who have an interest in aviation education. Founded in [[Connecticut]] in early 2009, SAFE "facilitates the professional development of aviation educators [and] seeks to create a safer aviation environment through enhanced education."&lt;ref name="vms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safepilots.org/governance/vision-mission-statements/|title=Vision and Mission Statements|publisher=Society of Aviation and Flight Educators|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE is governed by a Board of Directors composed of nine members, all of whom are elected by the SAFE membership in a rotating three year cycle.

SAFE introduced scenario-based training into aviation in 2009 with the creation of the '''[https://www.safepilots.org/programs/pilot-proficiency-project%e2%84%a2/ Pilot Proficiency Program]'''. Using the (then brand new) '''[https://simulators.redbirdflight.com/about Redbird Flight Simulator]''', this program challenged pilots with adventurous skill and risk-management story lines. This program expanded to become the popular (EAA) '''[http://eaapilotproficiency.com/ Pilot Proficiency Center]''' that is a highlight of '''[[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh|AirVenture]]''' every year. 
[[File:SAFE-PilotTrainingReformSymposium2011.png|thumb|SAFE 2011 Pilot Training Reform Symposium]]
In 2011 SAFE transformed the flight training system in the United States with the '''[http://www.pilottrainingreform.org/ Pilot Training Reform Symposium]'''. This meeting attracted users, partners and major FAA officials including '''[http://www.pilottrainingreform.org/the-faa-administrators-speech/ FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt]'''  and led to extensive changes in FAA guidance and policy. One significant outcome of this symposium was the introduction of the '''[https://www.faa.gov/training_testing/testing/acs/ Airman Testing Standards]''' (ACS) in June 2016. This revolutionary change introduced the third pillar of flight safety, risk management, into the previous skill and knowledge test requirements of the '''[[Practical Test Standards]]''' (PTS).  The ACS also integrated the knowledge and flight testing components into a more efficient and valid evaluation formatted into a real-life scenario structure.  

SAFE was also revolutionary in developing their own '''[https://www.safepilots.org/programs/cfi-liability-insurance/ aviation educator insurance program]''' to protect their members. This program, launched in collaboration with '''STARR insurance''', provides comprehensive insurance specifically for flight instructors, including all categories and class aircraft they are rated to fly. Significant discounts are available to '''[http://www.masterinstructors.org/ Master Flight Instructors]''' and '''[[FAA WINGS|FAA Wings]]''' participants to incentivize professional development and the pursuit of excellence. 

SAFE has signed letters of understanding with a number of organizations, including [[Cessna Aircraft Company]]&lt;ref name="eva222"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.evaint.com/daily-news/5362/Cessna-becomes-exclusive-sponsor-of-SAFEs-website.aspx|title=Cessna becomes exclusive sponsor of SAFE's website|date=Feb 22, 2010|publisher=EVA International|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[FAA]] Safety Team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safepilots.org/documents/FAASTeam_SAFE_LOU_27Feb09.pdf] Letter of Understanding between SAFE and FAASTeam&lt;/ref&gt; SAFE is also a sponsor of the General Aviation Awards Program.&lt;ref name="gaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generalaviationawards.org/page/ga-awards-program-sponsors|title=GA Awards Program Sponsors|publisher=General Aviation Awards|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is proactive on issues that affect aviation educators&lt;ref name="ann1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aero-news.net/news/genav.cfm?ContentBlockID=3EBD0CB1-33A2-4F63-AA2B-1CA96F4D39C2&amp;Dynamic=1|title=SAFE Opposes California Assembly Bill 48|date=June 7, 2010|work=Aero-News.Net|publisher=Aero-News Network, Inc.|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ann2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aero-news.net/news/genav.cfm?ContentBlockID=957C7C51-A8C0-4339-8582-0352A0792D0A&amp;Dynamic=1|title=SAFE Responds to Photo ID NPRM| date=January 18, 2011|work=Aero-News.Net|publisher=Aero-News Network, Inc.|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has partnered with others to develop a mentoring program for aviation educators.&lt;ref name="gan1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.generalaviationnews.com/2010/04/13/safe-launches-mentoring-program/|title=SAFE launches mentoring program|date=April 13, 2010|work=GeneralAviationNews.com|publisher=General Aviation News|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, SAFE launched a flight instructor liability insurance program&lt;ref name="gan2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.generalaviationnews.com/2010/07/22/new-cfi-insurance-program-from-safe/|title=New CFI insurance program from SAFE |date=July 22, 2010|work=GeneralAviationNews.com|publisher=General Aviation News|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed for its member-instructors.

In the [[education in New Zealand|New Zealand education]] system, '''decile''' is a key measure of [[socioeconomic status]] used to target funding and support schools. In academic contexts the full form,  '''socioeconomic decile''' or '''socioeconomic decile band''' may be used.

:“A school's decile indicates the extent to which the school draws its students from low socioeconomic communities. Decile 1 schools are the 10% of schools with the highest proportion of students from low socio-economic communities"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School deciles|url=https://education.govt.nz/school/running-a-school/resourcing/operational-funding/school-decile-ratings/|publisher=education.govt.nz|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NZ Schools:  The decile system|url=http://ppta.org.nz/dmsdocument/119|website=PPTA.org.nz|publisher=PPTA|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system was initially implemented in 1995, but its exact nature has changed since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiry into decile funding in New Zealand State and integrated schools|url=https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-nz/47DBSCH_SCR2635_1/a0d737616dee49badb33dd37823f97891af572dc|website=New Zealand Parliament|publisher=NZ Government|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the then-current [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] announced plans to replace it "...as early as 2019..." by a system of targeted funding based on how many "at risk" children a particular schools has enrolled.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Nicholas|title=Scrapping deciles will bring 'culture change': Education Minister Nikki Kaye|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11897218|accessdate=2 August 2017|work=New Zealand Herald|date=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
A school's socioeconomic decile is recalculated by the Ministry of Education every five years, using data collected after each [[New Zealand census|New Zealand census of Population and Dwellings]]. Current deciles came into force in 2008 following the [[2006 New Zealand census|2006 census]]. Following the 2013 census (delayed two years due to the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]), work started to determine new school deciles in time for the beginning of the 2015 school year. They are calculated between censuses for new schools and merged schools, and other schools may move up or down one decile with school openings, mergers and closures to ensure each decile contains 10 percent of all schools.

Before the deciles are calculated, [[Statistics New Zealand]] calculates the following factors in each individual [[mesh blocks|meshblock]] (the smallest census unit, consisting of about 50 households each), disregarding any household in the meshblock that does not have school-aged children:&lt;ref name="determination"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&amp;documentid=7697&amp;indexid=11565&amp;indexparentid=3963|title=How The Decile Is Calculated|publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Education]]|accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Household income''': the proportion of households whose total income, adjusted for householder composition, is in the bottom 20 percent nationally
* '''Occupation''': the proportion of employed parents who work in low-skilled or unskilled occupations, specifically those that have skill-levels 4 and 5 on the [[Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations]] (ANZSCO)
* '''Household crowding''': the proportion of households which are overcrowded, that is, in which there are more people living in the house than there are bedrooms, adjusting for couples and children under 10.
* '''Educational qualifications''': the proportion of parents who have no formal qualifications
* '''Income support''': the proportion of parents who receive the [[Domestic Purposes Benefit]], [[unemployment benefits#New Zealand|Unemployment Benefit]], [[Disability pension#New Zealand|Sickness Benefit or Invalid's Benefit]]

Each school provides a list of the addresses of its students to determine which meshblocks are used. For each of the five factors, the average for the school is found by adding together the factor in each of the applicable meshblocks, adjusting for the number of students at the school living in each meshblock. All schools in New Zealand are then listed in order for each factor, and given a percentile for that factor. The percentiles for each factor are then added together to give a score out of 500. When the score is ordered, the list of schools is divided into ten, giving one of the ten deciles.&lt;ref name="determination" /&gt;

This gives a broad measure of the [[relative poverty]], or aggregated socioeconomic (or [[social class]]), of the parents or care-givers of students at the school, with [[decile]] 1 schools being the 10% of schools with the lowest socioeconomic communities and decile 10 schools being at the other end of the scale.

Note that some types of schools acquire a decile rating regardless of the socioeconomic status of the school community. For example, [[Teenage pregnancy|teen-parent]] units always "belong" in decile 1, because of the inherent effect teenage pregnancy and parenthood has on teen parents' socioeconomic status, regardless whether the teen-parent unit is in a high [[Socioeconomic status|SES]] area or attached to a high-decile school.

Decile ratings apply only for the funding of [[compulsory education]], but a number of different central-government funding-streams and support services to schools are strongly affected by the decile rating of a school, with more funding available to lower-decile schools. The funding and support measures include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minedu.govt.nz/educationSectors/Schools/SchoolOperations/Resourcing/OperationalFunding/Deciles/FrequentlyAskedQuestionsAboutDeciles/What_resources_are_affected_by_deciles.aspx|title=What Resources are Affected by Deciles? |publisher=[[New Zealand Ministry of Education]]|accessdate=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistics|Statistical data]] about primary and secondary schools and their students can be broken down into socioeconomic deciles.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} For example, data released by the Ministry of Education shows correlations between high decile schools and higher rates of attaining [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] Level 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/education-and-learning-outcomes/1781 |title=School leavers with NCEA Level 2 or above – Education Counts |publisher= Ministry of Education |accessdate= 25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher rates of tertiary education entrance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/education-and-learning-outcomes/1907 |title=School leavers entering tertiary education – Education Counts |publisher= Ministry of Education |accessdate= 25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lower rates of [[truancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/indicators/main/student-engagement-participation/1935 |title= Truancy from school – Education Counts |publisher= Ministry of Education |accessdate= 25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that socioeconomic decile alone [[Correlation does not imply causation|does not necessarily cause these statistics]]).

==Criticism==
The decile system has come in for criticism from teacher and principal associations in recent years for fomenting destructive competition between schools and the exacerbation of [[white flight]]. Data from the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]] indicated that 60,000 [[Pakeha]]/NZ European students attended low-decile schools in 2000, but that number had halved by 2010, while high-decile schools had a corresponding increase in Pakeha students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10813743|title=Claim of 'white flight' from low decile schools|publisher=New Zealand Herald|author=Hana Garrett-Walker |date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry claimed demographic changes were behind the shifts, but the Secondary Principals Association and [[Post Primary Teachers' Association|PPTA]] have attributed white flight to racial and class stigmas of low-decile schools, which commonly have majority Maori and Pacific Islander rolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/108575/some-pakeha-parents-stereotyping-maori-pupils-principals|title=Some Pakeha parents stereotyping Maori pupils – principals|publisher=Radio New Zealand|date=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visiting [[Fulbright Scholar]], Professor Chris Lubienski, carried out research that found discrepancies in 36 of the 49 secondary school zones in [[Auckland]]. According to Prof Lubienski, principals of schools in the 36 zones anonymously confessed to deliberately skewing their zone boundaries, in order to encourage the enrolment of students from wealthier backgrounds, while preventing the enrolment of poorer students to these schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10815448|title=Call to review Tomorrow's Schools model|author=Kate Shuttleworth |publisher=NZ Herald|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Mount Albert Grammar School]] headmaster Dale Burden countered that school zones "cannot be easily manipulated and changing them is a transparent process". The Ministry of Education issued the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The purpose of an enrolment zone is to ensure the selection of applicants for enrolment is fair and transparent and makes the best use of the school network.&lt;br&gt;
''As far as possible, an enrolment scheme must not exclude local students so that no more students are excluded from a school than is necessary to avoid over-crowding.&lt;br&gt;
''The ministry has recently updated guidelines on enrolments zones. They make clear that before drawing up an enrolment zone boards are required to consult parents and the wider community as well as other schools.&lt;br&gt;
''Householder income should not be considered when zones are drawn up.&lt;br&gt;
''The law requires a board to ensure all students can attend a reasonably convenient school while ensuring other schools do not experience enrolment problems.&lt;br&gt;
''If a school board is unable to agree a boundary arrangement the ministry can step in to resolve the matter. If necessary, the ministry has powers to require a board to amend a proposed enrolment zone.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/109079/enrolment-zones-skewed-to-exclude-poor-children|title=Skewed enrolment zones prompts calls for re-think|publisher=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Possible replacement==
In July 2017 Education Minister [[Nikki Kaye]] announced plans to replace the system "...as early as 2019..." by a system of targeted funding based on how many "at risk" children a particular schools has enrolled – but few details are yet known.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"/&gt;

'''''Students' Guide to Colleges''''' is a series of United States college guidebooks released by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Jordan |title=Students' Guide to Colleges: 2004  |year=2004 |publisher= Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-303558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Students’ Guide to Colleges was featured in [[Time Magazine]], [[Forbes]], [[ABC News]], [[US News &amp; World Report]] and more than 30 national radio programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= An Enjoyable and Thorough Startup |url= http://mashable.com/2008/09/19/unigo/|date= September 19, 2008|publisher=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became one of the top five best-selling college guidebooks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Unigo:Retooling the College Guidebook|url= http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/203108|date= August 19, 2009|publisher=Entrepreneur Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was turned into a series, released in five annually updated editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Announcing a Live Chat With Unigo Founder Jordan Goldman |url= http://mashable.com/2012/09/19/live-chat-announcer-unigo/|date= September 19, 2012|publisher=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Students’ Guide was created by Jordan Goldman and Colleen Buyers when they were 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jordan Goldman|url=http://www.penguin.com/author/jordan-goldman/237372|publisher=Penguin Books|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, the pair built a website and online survey asking college students to tell them the truth about what their colleges were really like.  In an early example of a website going viral, hundreds of thousands of students visited and more than 30,000 current students weighed in with detailed responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Students' Guide to Colleges |url= http://www.curledup.com/gtcolleg.htm|date= October 19, 2006|publisher=Curled Up With a Good Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goldman and Buyers edited the results into a 704-page college guide profiling schools across America and including some explicit content.  They were signed by the literary agency Janklow &amp; Nesbit Associates and their manuscript was purchased by Penguin Books, the second largest publisher in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Grads Release College Guide Book |url= http://wesleyanargus.com/2005/10/07/grads-release-college-guide-book/|date= November 7, 2005|publisher=The Wesleyan Argus}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chuck Hughes, Senior Admissions Officer at [[Harvard]], signed on to write the book’s preface, calling it the result of “a virtual grassroots movement … spurred on by the power of the Internet and the power of student networks ... friends told friends about Students’ Guide ... news spread from school to school.”  Hughes described the finished product as “a new kind of guidebook … providing detailed, nuanced, personal and honest portraits of schools … the stories behind the statistics ... the next best thing to spending a week on campus.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students Guide to Colleges|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/sample/read/9780143035589|publisher=Barnes&amp;Nobles|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial publication Goldman, Buyers and Penguin Books turned Students' Guide into a series, released in five annually updated editions.  Goldman and Buyers launched new online surveys and edited tens of thousands of new student submissions for publication each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Students Guide to Colleges|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292772/students-guide-to-colleges-by-jordan-goldman/|publisher=PenguinRandomHouse|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swarāj''' ({{lang-hi|[[wikt:स्वराज|स्वराज]]}} ''[http://www.shabdkosh.com/en2hi/search.php?ts=1250502226250&amp;e=स्वयं swa-]'' "self", ''[[wikt:raj|raj]]'' "rule") can mean generally [[self-governance]] or "self-rule", and was used synonymously with "home-rule" by [[Maharishi]] [[Dayananda Saraswati|Dayanand Saraswati]] and later on by [[Mohandas Gandhi]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule]]'', Gandhi, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; but the word usually refers to Gandhi's concept for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] from foreign domination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaraj.org/whatisswaraj.htm What is Swaraj?]. Retrieved on July 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Swaraj lays stress on governance, not by a hierarchical government, but by self governance through individuals and [[community building]]. The focus is on political [[decentralisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Parel, Anthony. ''Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Since this is against the political and social systems followed by [[UK|Britain]], Gandhi's concept of Swaraj advocated India's discarding British political, economic, bureaucratic, legal, military, and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaraj.org/whatisswaraj.htm What is Swaraj?]. Retrieved on March 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. Satyamurti]], [[Chittaranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] were among a contrasting group of Swarajists who laid the foundation for [[parliamentary democracy]] in India.

Although Gandhi's aim of totally implementing the concepts of Swaraj in India was not achieved, the voluntary work organisations which he founded for this purpose did serve as precursors and role models for people's movements, voluntary organisations, and some of the non-governmental organisations that were subsequently launched in various parts of India.&lt;ref name="What Swaraj meant to Gandhi"&gt;[http://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/swaraj.htm What Swaraj meant to Gandhi]. Retrieved on September 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The student movement against oppressive local and central governments, led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], and the [[Bhoodan movement]], which presaged demands for land reform legislation throughout India, and which ultimately led to India's discarding of the [[Zamindari system]] of land tenure and social organisation, were also inspired by the ideas of Swaraj.

==Key concepts==
{{wikisource|Hind Swaraj|Swaraj}}
[[Swami Dayanand Saraswati]], founder of the [[Arya Samaj]] and a [[Hindu]] reformer, defined ''swaraj'' as the "administration of self" or "democracy". Swami Dayanand Saraswati, beginning with the premise that God had created people free to perform any work they were inclined to choose, then questioned the legitimacy of the foreign British occupation to make the Indian nation slaves on their own land? In the Swami's view, ''swaraj'' was the basis for freedom fighting. [[Dadabhai Navroji]] said that he had learnt the word ''swaraj'' from the ''[[Satyarth Prakash]]'' of Saraswati.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

Swaraj warrants a stateless society. According to Mahatma Gandhi, the overall impact of the state on the people is harmful. He called the state a "soulless machine" which, ultimately, does the greatest harm to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 236-237.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''raison d'etre'' of the state is that it is an instrument of serving the people. But Gandhi feared that in the name of moulding the state into a suitable instrument of serving people, the state would abrogate the rights of the citizens and arrogate to itself the role of grand protector and demand abject acquiescence from them. This would create a paradoxical situation where the citizens would be alienated from the state and at the same time enslaved to it, which, according to Gandhi, was demoralising and dangerous. If Gandhi's close acquaintance with the working of the state apparatus [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in South Africa|in South Africa]] and [[Indian independence movement|in India]] strengthened his suspicion of a centralised, monolithic state, his intimate association with the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and its leaders confirmed his fears about the [[corruption in India|corrupting influence of political power]] and his skepticism about the efficacy of the [[politics of India|party systems]] of power politics (due to which he resigned from the Congress on more than one occasion only to be persuaded back each time) and his study of the [[British parliamentary system]]s convinced him that [[representative democracy]] was incapable of meting out justice to people.&lt;ref&gt;''Hind Swaraj''. M.K. Gandhi. Chapter V&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi thought it necessary to evolve a mechanism to achieve the twin objectives of empowering the people and 'empowering' the state. It was for this that he developed the two pronged strategy of resistance (to the state) and reconstruction (through voluntary and participatory social action).{{fact|date=February 2015}}

Although the word "Swaraj" means self-rule, Gandhi gave it the content of an integral revolution that encompasses all spheres of life: "At the individual level Swaraj is vitally connected with the capacity for dispassionate self-assessment, ceaseless self-purification and growing self-reliance."&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Gandhi, Young India, June 28, 1928, p. 772.&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, swaraj is self-government and not good government (for Gandhi, good government is no substitute for self-government) and it means a continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it is foreign government or whether it is national. In other words, it is sovereignty of the people based on pure [[moral authority]]. Economically, Swaraj means full economic freedom for the toiling millions. And in its fullest sense, Swaraj is much more than freedom from all restraints, it is self-rule, self-restraint, and could be equated with ''moksha'' or [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;"M. K. Gandhi, Young India, December 8, 1920, p.886 (See also Young India, August 6, 1925, p. 276 and Harijan, March 25, 1939, p.64.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopting Swaraj means implementing a system whereby the state machinery is virtually nil, and the real power directly resides in the hands of people. Gandhi said: "Power resides in the people, they can use it at any time."&lt;ref&gt;Jesudasan, Ignatius. ''A Gandhian theology of liberation''. Gujarat Sahitya Prakash: Ananda India, 1987, pp 251.&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy rests inside an individual who has to learn to be master of his own [[Self (spirituality)|self]] and spreads upwards to the level of his community which must be dependent only on itself. Gandhi said: "In such a state (where swaraj is achieved) everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour."&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He summarised the core principle like this: "It is Swaraj when we learn to rule ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;[[M. K. Gandhi]]. ''Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule''. Ahmedabad, Gujarat: Navajivan Publishing House, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi explained his vision in 1946: {{quote|Independence begins at the bottom... A society must be built in which every village has to be self-sustained and capable of managing its own affairs... It will be trained and prepared to perish in the attempt to defend itself against any onslaught from without... This does not exclude dependence on and willing help from neighbours or from the world. It will be a free and voluntary play of mutual forces... In this structure composed of innumerable villages, there will be ever-widening, never-ascending circles. Growth will not be a pyramid with the apex sustained by the bottom. But it will be an oceanic circle whose center will be the individual. Therefore the outermost circumference will not wield power to crush the inner circle but will give strength to all within and derive its own strength from it.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, Srinivas.''Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy Letters''. Long Beach Publications: Long Beach, 1987, pp 189.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Gandhi was undaunted by the task of implementing such a [[utopian]] vision in India. He believed that by transforming enough individuals and communities, society at large would change. He said: "It may be taunted with the retort that this is all Utopian and, therefore not worth a single thought... Let India live for the true picture, though never realisable in its completeness. We must have a proper picture of what we want before we can have something approaching it."&lt;ref&gt;Parel, Anthony. ''Hind Swaraj and other writings of M. K. Gandhi''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, 1997, pp 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After Gandhi==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:JayaprakashNarayanLakshminarayanLal.jpg|thumb|Jayaprakash Narayan]] --&gt;
After Gandhi's assassination [[Vinoba Bhave]] formed the Sarva Seva Sangh at the national level and Sarvodya Mandals at the regional level to the carry on integrated village service&amp;nbsp;— with the end purpose of achieving the goal of Swaraj. Two major nonviolent movements for socio-economic and political revolution in India: the [[Bhoodan movement]] led by [[Vinoba Bhave]] and the [[Total Revolution movement]] led by [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] were actually formed under the aegis of the ideas of Swaraj. These movements had some success, but due to the socialist tendencies of Nehruvian India were not able to unleash the kind of revolution that was aimed at.

Gandhi's model of Swaraj was almost entirely discarded by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. He had wanted a system of a classless, stateless [[direct democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharyya, Buddhadeva. ''Evolution of the political philosophy of Gandhi''. Calcutta Book House: Calcutta, 1969, pp 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, modern India has kept in place many aspects of British (and Western) influence, including widespread use of the [[English language]], the [[common law]], [[industrialisation]], [[liberal democracy]], [[military organisation]], and [[bureaucracy]].

==Present day==
The [[Aam Aadmi Party]] was founded in late 2012, by [[Arvind Kejriwal]] and some erstwhile activists of [[India Against Corruption]] movement, with the aim of empowering people by applying the concept of swaraj enunciated by Gandhi, in the present day context by changing the system of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=With Swaraj in mind, Kejriwal launches Aam Aadmi Party|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/politics/with-swaraj-in-mind-kejriwal-launches-aam-aadmi-party/article4130337.ece|author=BusinessLine Bureau|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Beach School''' was a [[democratic school|democratic free school]] in [[Toronto]] based on the [[Sudbury School|Sudbury]] principles of education. The model has two basic tenets: [[education]]al freedom and [[democratic governance]]. Small and independent, The Beach School was a community of self-motivated learners, aged 4–19, who determined their own curriculum, and each had an equal voice in school governance. Located at 42 Edgewood Ave near [[Kingston Road (Toronto)|Kingston Road]] and [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street East]], the school opened in the fall of 2003 and closed in June 2008 owing to a shortage of students. The Beach School was incorporated as a [[co-operative]] and, at the time of closing, was one of two Sudbury schools in [[Canada]]; the only one in [[Ontario]].

Some participants of The Beach School are part of a group attempting to open a similar school called Reach Sudbury School of Toronto.&lt;ref name=Boesveld&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  Boesveld | first = Sarah | title = The politics of unschooling: Raising independent trailblazers or lazy free-floaters? | url = http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/05/28/the-politics-of-unschooling-raising-independent-trailblazers-or-lazy-free-floaters/ | publisher =  National Post| date = 28 May 2011 | accessdate = 8 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Modelled after the [[Sudbury Valley School]] in [[Massachusetts]], which opened in 1968, The Beach School community believed that learning which is initiated and pursued by the learner happens naturally, meaningfully, and enduringly. As such, there was no set curriculum at the school; instead individual curiosity and self-initiation directed learning. Beach School students were trusted with their own education and were free to draw from the school’s resources as much or as little as they saw fit. The Beach School encouraged self-evaluation; there were no grades, tests, or assignments unless desired. This educational approach was based on the Sudbury belief that everyone is instinctively curious; therefore, when trusted to do so, they will discover independently the knowledge and experiences they need, becoming self-aware and resourceful in the process.&lt;ref name=Boesveld/&gt;

==Tuition==
Because the [[Ontario Ministry of Education]] does not fund independent schools, The Beach School charged tuition in order to fund the basic operations of the school. The decision on what amount to charge was made each year by the assembly. The Beach School was recognized by the Children’s First Foundation through the [[Fraser Institute]], which provides grants for education to disadvantaged families.

'''''The Substitute 3: Winner Takes All''''' is a 1999 [[action film|action]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by Robert Radler and starring [[Treat Williams]] as a mercenary who goes undercover as a teacher in order to expose a college football team's steroid-abuse scandal. It is the second sequel to ''[[The Substitute]]'' (1996). The film was later released on DVD and in 2000 it bundled with the first film.

==Plot==
Students at a local college have become unusually antagonistic, and when a teacher is attacked by a gang of steroid-pumped students, Karl Thomasson—having earned a teacher's degree to facilitate his actions in the previous film—returns to the classroom to uncover the truth.

What he finds is shocking: the college's football coach is involved in a steroid-doping scandal, and his 'juiced' students were responsible for the attack on the teacher.  Thomasson recruits his old team, planting surveillance equipment in a jukebox inside a local sports-bar that hosts a number of the coach's football players.

It turns out that the coach was doping his players, and rigging football games, to pay off his backers—a local crime syndicate.  When the audio equipment draws the attention of the syndicate's thugs, one of Karl's team is killed in the van, and Karl's calm and collected mask begins to slip.

When one of Thomasson's students dies from a steroid overdose, Thomasson finally loses his jovial nature, confronting the coach and telling him that he knows how the student died, that he knows the coach is responsible, and that he has audiotape to prove his allegations.

In one last showdown, Karl defeats the syndicate and reveals the doping scandal—as he leaves, and the credits roll, a radio news report reveals that the football coach committed suicide in disgrace.

'''UberStudent''' is a [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] computer operating system and collection of programs aimed toward especially higher education and secondary students and their teachers and schools.

Dubbing itself "Linux for Learners", UberStudent describes itself as "a cohesive academic success curriculum integrated into an installable, easy-to-use, and full-featured learning platform" aimed at increasing overall student learning and [[Computers and writing|academic computer literacy]], and lifelong [[Computer literacy#Computer fluency|computer fluency]]. Its additional aim is to increase the adoption of [[free and open-source software|free and open-source]] computing platforms, like itself, within higher education and secondary schools.&lt;ref name="EFYTimes"&gt;"Unique Linux Distro Geared to Impact Higher Education, Student Success."

UberStudent's current release is 4.3, dubbed [[Heraclitus]]. The distribution uses its own dedicated [[software repository]].&lt;ref name="uberstudent.com"&gt;http://uberstudent.com/node/14&lt;/ref&gt; It can be run from a [[live CD]] or [[USB flash drive]], or installed on to a computer's [[harddrive]] from either one of those mediums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://uberstudent.com/get-uberstudent&lt;/ref&gt;

5.0 is being delayed due to Stephen Ewen's son being diagnosed with [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ewen |first1=Stephen |title=UberStudent 5.0 is delayed. Here's why: |url=http://uberstudent.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1315 |website=UberStudent Forums |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and design==
UberStudent's founder and lead [[Software developer|developer]] is Stephen Ewen, a U.S.-based educator who specializes in postsecondary literacy, academic success strategies, and educational technology. He began UberStudent, he has said, as "a way to place a set of smart and dedicated computing tools, and just the right amount of support, into the hands of students, whether currently within higher education or preparing for it in secondary school." His stated goal through UberStudent is for students to "learn to really excel at the core skills and habits they need to become everything they can academically be, and on into professional life." Ewen has stated that UberStudent is, in part, inspired by his own experiences achieving top academic performance with the assistance of [[educational technology]].&lt;ref name="ewenbio"&gt;"Stephen Ewen - Project Lead," 12 Aug 2010. Available at http://www.uberstudent.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=18 [https://www.webcitation.org/5zHVQx4Ea (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Uberstudent-1.0-core-skills-approach.png|thumb|left|UberStudent's core academic skills approach]]

Ewen has described UberStudent's overarching design philosophy as one that provides a "unified system for learning, doing, and teaching academic success". Within this, he has said that UberStudent takes what he calls a "core academic skills" approach, which he has delineated as "the skills in research and writing, studying, and [[Decision making|self-management]] required of students across all academic majors". He has stated that UberStudent can be "easily extended" for specific majors via additional software. Ewen has additionally asserted that, in part due to UberStudent's open source and [[cross-platform]] nature, as well as its [[Unix-like]] base, it is geared to produce "[[Computer literacy#Computer fluency|computer fluency]]" among its users as a "more or less natural outcome".&lt;ref name="EFYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="about-uberstudent"&gt;"About UberStudent." Available at http://about.uberstudent.org/ [https://www.webcitation.org/5z2KiOSyr (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slideshow"&gt;UberStudent Slideshow, http://uberstudent.org/slideshow/slides/, retrieved 28 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ewen has argued that academic institutions can increase both their student learning outcomes and economic efficiency by more broadly adopting open source application and system software for everyday student academic computing needs. He has additionally argued for academic institutions to increase their involvement in developing open source tools, such as UberStudent, citing successes such as the bibliographic manager [[Zotero]] by [[George Mason University]], included among UberStudent's set of core academic programs.&lt;ref name="ubuntugeek"&gt;"UberStudent&amp;mdash;Ubuntu Version for Students and Researchers," ''Ubuntu Geek''. Available at http://www.ubuntugeek.com/uberstudent-ubuntu-version-for-students-and-researchers.html [https://www.webcitation.org/5z2P9mL9f (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and system==
[[File:Uberstudent-1.0-education-menu.jpg|thumb|right|The first level of the Education menu in UberStudent 1.0 Cicero Full Edition]]
Nearly all of UberStudent's software is [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] and its core programs [[cross-platform]] so its adopters can [[Vendor lock-in#Avoiding vendor lock-in for computer software|avoid vendor lock-in]], whether with [[Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], or [[Linux]].&lt;ref name="slideshow"/&gt; The tech review site Dedoimedo reviewed UberStudent as containing a "superb" collection of "smartly selected" programs, "probably the best when it comes to serious work", with each "stitched into the fabric of the operating system".&lt;ref name="dedoimedo-review"/&gt; Tech columnist Jack Wallen said UberStudent "contains so many education-specific tools you will be spending your first days with it just marveling at what the developers have packed into one single operating system."&lt;ref name=wallen-review/&gt;

UberStudent's core programs for academic work are clustered within an [[Start menu#List of Window Managers that provide a start menu|applications menu]] entry, Education, where they are organized by sub-categories, including for Reading, Research and Writing, Self-Management, Study Aids, Subjects, and Utilities, which themselves have sub-categories.&lt;ref name=wallen-review/&gt; In addition to its academic-specific application set, reviewers have noted UberStudent's inclusion of templates for academic work and "tons" of on-board how-to guides as "welcome additions" that are "often missing" from other operating systems.&lt;ref name="dedoimedo-review"/&gt; UberStudent also contains a full range of student-oriented programs in the Multimedia, Games, Graphics, Internet, and several other categories. Within a separate menu, it contains select [[cloud computing]] applications that have been described as containing additions "you don't often see elsewhere".&lt;ref name="profhacker-review"/&gt;

Within its stated intent to couple user-friendliness with [[Computer security|security]] and stability, UberStudent production releases are based on [[Xubuntu]] Long Term Stable releases,&lt;ref&gt;http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=uberstudent&lt;/ref&gt; which stems from the [[Debian]] [[:File:Gldt1009.svg|branch]] of [[Linux]]. UberStudent also includes numerous self-developed programs, as well as its own Update Manager and the [[Deb (file format)|Deb file format]] to manage and update its platform.&lt;ref name="dedoimedo-review"/&gt;

==Editions==
[[File:Uberstudent-1.0-cicero-lxde.jpg|thumb|right|The default desktop of UberStudent 1.0 Cicero Lightweight Edition]]
UberStudent main editions are distributed as a [[Disk image|DVD image]] or pre-made disc. The full edition features the [[Xfce]] desktop environment, and the lightweight edition the [[LXDE]] desktop environment. The LXDE lightweight edition is greatly scaled down and is intended solely "to re-invigorate low-specification or older computers" and fits on a single CD.&lt;ref name="slideshow"/&gt;

===Criticisms of competing desktop environments===
Amid his decision to feature Xfce in UberStudent full editions, Ewen stated that "UberStudent must prefer stability, dependability, and traditional usability over the novel when it comes to such a major thing as the basic desktop environments it uses; and it will."&lt;ref&gt;http://uberstudent.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=73#p1204&lt;/ref&gt;

====GNOME 3, Ubuntu Unity====
During UberStudent's 2.0 release cycle, Ewen criticized the designs of both the [[Unity (user interface)|Ubuntu Unity]] and [[GNOME Shell|GNOME 3 Shell]] Linux desktop environments as hindrances to student academic computing productivity. In a 2011 [[April Fools' Day]] [[satire]], he announced an "UberStudent Dumbed Down Edition" featuring the GNOME 3 Shell. Pointing to what he called "the enforced helplessness" leading to "learned helplessness" that he says the GNOME 3 developers designed into their new desktop environment, he stated that the intent behind the spoof UberStudent edition was to "obscure what is not obvious and easy so it can be continually avoided" by students and thus never learned.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, Stephen, "Announcing UberStudent DumbedDown Edition Based on GNOME 3," ''UberStudent News,'' 1 April 2011. Available at http://www.uberstudent.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=117&amp;mode=1 [https://www.webcitation.org/61f45tuuD (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2011 interview, Ewen expanded his criticisms of Unity and GNOME 3 by citing specific [[usability]] issues, and stated that UberStudent had no plans to adopt either Unity or the GNOME 3 Shell.&lt;ref name="byfield-unity"&gt;Byfield, Bruce. "Other Linux Distros' View of Ubuntu's Unity: It Ain’t Pretty," 17 May 2011. Available at http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3933716/Other-Linux-Distros-View-of-Ubuntus-Unity-It-Aint-Pretty.htm [https://www.webcitation.org/5z2KOOdt3 (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cinnamon====
Amid UberStudent's 3.0 release cycle, Ewen criticized the [[Cinnamon (user interface)|Cinnamon desktop environment]], developed by [[Linux Mint]], pointing out what he called "major shortcomings" in Cinnamon, which he stipulated as its failure to honor certain fundamental [[freedesktop.org]] standards. Ewen stated that, while the desktop environment holds promise, "Cinnamon as of its full May 2013 version 1.8 release is actually beta-quality software." As such, he characterized Cinnamon as "not at all yet suited for a serious and stable workstation.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Releases and naming==
[[File:UberStudent-2.0-Screenshot-Preview.jpg|thumb|right|UberStudent 2.0 pre-release screenshot.]]
According to Ewen, "UberStudent dubs each of its major releases after a famous historical thinker", a practice he describes as "only fitting" in light of UberStudent's educational mission. So far, the thinkers have been Greek and Roman. UberStudent's version 0.9, the first [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]], was released on 15 January 2010 and named after [[Thales]]. Version 1.0, released on 15 July 2010, was named after [[Cicero]].&lt;ref name="aristotle-anounce"&gt;Ewen, Stephen. "UberStudent 2.0 to be Dubbed 'Aristotle,'" ''UberStudent News,'' 11 June 2011. Available at http://www.uberstudent.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=125#p424 [https://www.webcitation.org/5zMDDRc4D (Archived on retrieval date by WebCite)].&lt;/ref&gt; 1.0 also had a brief pre-release edition, once inadvertently reviewed as the release edition.&lt;ref name="dedoimedo-review"/&gt; UberStudent 1.0 Cicero Lightweight Edition was released on 4 September 2010 and inherited the name Cicero from the full edition. UberStudent 2.0 was dubbed "[[Plato]]," UberStudent 3.0 was dubbed "[[Aristotle]],"&lt;ref name="aristotle-anounce"/&gt; and the 4.0 release "[[Socrates]]. The current release, 4.3, is dubbed "[[Heraclitus]]."&lt;ref name=DistroWatch&gt;{{cite news|title=DistroWatch.com: UberStudent|url=http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=uberstudent|work=[[DistroWatch]]|date=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5.0 is being delayed do to his son being diagnosed with [[Acute lymphoblastic leukemia]].
