The '''2017 Jerusalem Light Rail stabbing''' was a stabbing attack and suspected act of terrorism that occurred on [[Good Friday]], 14 April 2017, on [[Jerusalem Light Rail]]'s car. In the attack, a 20 year old British student was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man. Two others, including a pregnant woman, were injured in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/world/middleeast/british-tourist-killed-jerusalem.html|title=British Student Is Fatally Stabbed on Train in Jerusalem|first=Ian|last=Fisher|date=14 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker was arrested and was deemed competent to stand trial.

== Background ==
[[Stabbing as a terrorist tactic|Stabbing attacks]] were rare in Israel in 2017, although there was a [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict (2015–2016)|spate of them in the fall of 2015 and early 2016]].&lt;ref name="EglashGoodFriday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eglash|first1=Ruth|title=Woman fatally stabbed in Jerusalem amid Good Friday gatherings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/woman-fatally-stabbed-in-jerusalem-amid-good-friday-gatherings/2017/04/14/0d416006-2105-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html|accessdate=14 April 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack took place as crowds of pilgrims from around Israel and the world gathered in the center of Jerusalem to celebrate Passover and Good Friday.&lt;ref name="EglashGoodFriday"/&gt;

== Attack ==
The attack occurred at about 1:00 pm 14 April 2017, as a knife-wielding man stabbed a 21 year old British exchange student. An off-duty police officer riding the light rail pulled an emergency brake and tackled the perpetrator, who was then arrested.&lt;ref name="IsraelPolice"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tram stabber was on his way home from a mental hospital — police|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/tram-stabber-was-on-his-way-home-from-a-mental-hospital-police/|accessdate=24 April 2017|publisher=Times of Israel|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Israel's domestic security service, [[Shin Bet]], the attacker was known to the authorities and the attack may have also involved a "[[suicide by cop|suicide by soldier]]" motivation,&lt;ref name="BeaumontBritishStudent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beaumont|first1=Peter|title=Jerusalem stabbing: British student, 21, killed close to Old City|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/14/british-woman-stabbed-to-death-in-jerusalem-good-friday|accessdate=14 April 2017|publisher=Guardian|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as attributed to other incidents in the last 18 months,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inss.org.il/index.aspx?id=4538&amp;articleid=12439 The Palestinian Terrorism of the Past Year: Causes and Policy Recommendations], Kobi Michael, INSS Insight No.862, 14 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; "This is yet another case of a Palestinian suffering from personal, mental or moral distress choosing to commit an act of terror to escape his problems."&lt;ref name="haaretz14Apr17"/&gt;

"'''A Dream'''" is a poem by English poet [[William Blake]]. The poem was first published in [[1789 in literature|1789]] as part of Blake's collection of poems entitled ''[[Songs of Innocence]]''.
[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy L, 1795 (Yale Center for British Art) 15-26 A Dream.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1795 hand painted version of "A Dream" from Copy L of Songs of Innocence and of Experience currently held by the [[Yale Center for British Art]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.l.illbk.15&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, object 15 (Bentley 26, Erdman 26, Keynes 26) "A Dream" | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|accessdate = April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Background==
''Songs of Innocence'' is a collection of 19 illustrated poems published in 1789.&lt;ref name=gilchrist&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilchrist|first1=Alexander|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1907|publisher=The John Lane Company|location=London|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Donald A. Dike, the collection does not “describe an absolute state of being or fashion an autonomous truth.” Rather, he says the poems are resistant, being “consciously against something and trying to see their way through something.” &lt;ref name=dike/&gt;

Songs of Innocence was followed by Blake's ''[[Songs of Experience]]''' in 1794. The two collections were published together under the title ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', showing the "two contrary states of the human soul.” &lt;ref name="gilchrist"/&gt;

==The Poem==
[[File:Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy AA, 1826 (The Fitzwilliam Museum) object 26 Dream.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1826 version of "A Dream" from Copy AA of ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience'' currently held at [[The Fitzwilliam Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.aa.illbk.26&amp;java=| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, object 26 (Bentley 26, Erdman 26, Keynes 26) "A Dream"| editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]|accessdate = April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Once a dream did weave a shade&lt;br /&gt;
O'er my angel-guarded bed,&lt;br /&gt;
That an emmet lost its way&lt;br /&gt;
Where on grass methought I lay.

Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,&lt;br /&gt;
Dark, benighted, travel-worn,&lt;br /&gt;
Over many a tangle spray,&lt;br /&gt;
All heart-broke, I heard her say:

'Oh my children! do they cry,&lt;br /&gt;
Do they hear their father sigh? &lt;br /&gt;
Now they look abroad to see,&lt;br /&gt;
Now return and weep for me.'

Pitying, I dropped a tear:&lt;br /&gt;
But I saw a glow-worm near,&lt;br /&gt;
Who replied, 'What wailing wight&lt;br /&gt;
Calls the watchman of the night?

'I am set to light the ground,&lt;br /&gt;
While the beetle goes his round:&lt;br /&gt;
Follow now the beetle's hum; &lt;br /&gt;
Little wanderer, hie thee home!

==Structure and Summary==
“A Dream” is composed of five [[quatrain]]s using an AABB [[rhyme scheme]]. Blake heavily relies on [[alliteration]], [[assonance]], [[internal rhyme]]s, and [[eye rhyme]]s, especially in the first and fourth stanzas, to create a connection between sight and sound.&lt;ref name=privat&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keller-Privat|first1=Isabelle|title=Commentary on William Blake's "A Dream"|date=2007|publisher=PU du Mirail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem describes a dream featuring four characters: the narrator, the emmet (an archaic word for ant),&lt;ref name="privat"/&gt; the glow-worm, and the beetle. The dream begins with the narrator encountering the main protagonist of the dream, the lost emmet. The worn emmet laments to the narrator about her children back home. The glow-worm, who is “set to light the ground,” becomes the rescuer for the lost emmet. The glow-worm tells the emmet to follow the beetle, who will guide the emmet home.

==Themes and Critical Analysis==
Isabelle Keller-Privat describes “A Dream” as a piece that, like other Songs of Innocence poems, “emphasizes the interconnections between the actors, the voices and the rhythms that give the poem its coherence and harmony.” &lt;ref name="privat"/&gt; This coherence and harmony give the poem its sense of innocence. The world of this poem is portrayed as friendly and the characters are helpful. Yet a hint of experience can also be felt in “A Dream” through the emmet’s fear of its surroundings and its tired, damaged appearance. The emmet has experienced hardship and separation beyond the innocence of the dream.

Dike writes that, by putting the dream’s concerns into the world of an insect, Blake extends the “usual limits of sympathy.” &lt;ref name=dike/&gt; Resolution is found for the emmet through cooperation with the other characters of the dream. According to Dike, this introduces the theme that everyone is imperfect and needs help because the emmet requires the assistance of the narrator’s sympathy, the glow-worm’s rescue, and the beetle’s guidance.&lt;ref name=dike&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dike|first1=Donald A.|title=The Difficult Innocence: Blake's Songs and Pastorals|date=1961|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maternity Plot===
Harriet Kramer Linkin explores the inverted maternity plot present in "A Dream." In many of the poems in ''Songs of Innocence'', Blake portrays mothers as nurturing and protective. However, as Linkin writes, in "A Dream" the "inversion of a popular narrative of idealized maternity pointedly suggests that the domestic ideology is nothing more than a fantasy of Generation."&lt;ref name=linkin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linkin|first1=Harriet Kramer|last2=Rosso|first2=George A. Jr.|last3=Hobson|first3=Christopher Z.|title=Blake, Politics, and History|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134820615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a father returning to his waiting wife and children, the mother is the one returning to her husband and children at home. This maternity plot in "A Dream" follows a trend of absent mothers in other Songs of Innocence poems. According to Linkin, Blake "attends to the problematic institution of a domestic ideology that restructures the middle-class family." &lt;ref name="linkin"/&gt;

'''''Alan Wake''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Remedy Entertainment]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]], released for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. The story follows best-selling thriller novelist Alan Wake, as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life.

In its pacing and structure, ''Alan Wake'' is similar to a thriller television series, with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers. The game itself consists of six episodes, and the fiction is continued by two special episodes, titled "The Signal" and "The Writer", that were made available as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) within the same year of the game's release. Together, they make the first season of a possibly longer story. Additionally, a six-episode live-action web series called ''Bright Falls'' acts as a prequel to the game, and a number of related books also expand upon the ''Alan Wake'' story.

Chiefly written by [[Sam Lake]], ''Alan Wake'' took over five years to create—an unusually long development time in the game industry. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often praised for its visuals, sound, narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. ''Alan Wake'' was awarded the first spot in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010.&lt;ref name="time_goty"/&gt; ''[[Alan Wake's American Nightmare]]'', a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled. However, the scrapped sequel became the foundation and inspiration of Remedy's next title, ''[[Quantum Break]]''.

==Gameplay==

Note the ammo counter for the gun (top right) and the flashlight meter (top left).&lt;ref name=remedy_aw/&gt;]]
''Alan Wake'' is described by Remedy as "the mind of a [[psychological thriller]]" and "the body of a cinematic [[action game]]" put together.&lt;ref name=remedy_aw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remedygames.com/games/alanwake|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204083716/http://www.remedygames.com/games/alanwake|title=Alan Wake|publisher=[[Remedy Entertainment]]|accessdate=31 October 2011|archivedate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gametrailers_x10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/x10-cinematic-alan-wake/61953|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221164530/http://www.gametrailers.com/video/x10-cinematic-alan-wake/61953|title=Alan Wake: X10: Cinematic Action Interview|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=16 February 2010|accessdate=31 October 2011|archivedate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, the game's creators hold that the game does not belong squarely in the [[survival horror]] video game genre.&lt;ref name=gameinformer_x10&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/16/we-talk-with-remedy-about-alan-wake.aspx|title=Interview: Remedy Talks Up Alan Wake DLC|publisher=Game Informer|date=16 February 2010|last=Turi|first=Tim|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is primarily set in the fictional idyllic small town of Bright Falls, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. The main gameplay happens in various areas of Bright Falls – such as the forest, a national park, or a farm – during the night time; these are punctuated by calmer, non-combative sequences set during the day.

The player controls the eponymous protagonist Alan Wake. In the game, a "darkness" is taking over humans, animals and objects. These enemies, dubbed the "Taken", are murderous shadows that attack Wake, wielding weapons of their own, ranging from mallets and knives to shovels and chainsaws. They vary by speed, size, and the amount of damage they can take, and some can teleport between short distances.&lt;ref name=manual&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://epix.xbox.com/shaXam/0201/be/55/be55545b-5cdc-426a-912f-e095846518bb.PDF?v=1#alanwake-en.PDF|title=''Alan Wake'' game manual|publisher=Microsoft Game Studios|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Taken, the player must combat flocks of possessed ravens and [[poltergeist|animated objects]]. When enemies are close, Alan can perform a [[Bullet time|slow-motion]] cinematic dodge maneuver.

The Taken are protected by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on [[flashlight]]s in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a [[revolver]] or [[shotgun]]. Flashlight beams act as a [[reticle]].&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading [[ammunition]], the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or wait for it to recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.

The player is often encouraged to take advantage of environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as [[flare gun]]s, hand-held [[flare]]s and [[Stun grenade|flashbangs]]. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's [[Health (gaming)|health]] faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage.&lt;ref name=manual/&gt; In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's [[Headlamp|headlights]] to destroy them.

A major element of gameplay is the optional discovery and collection of [[manuscript]] pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—''Departure''. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline seems to be becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes that have yet to occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional ''Night Springs'' series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; The radio shows and signs provide a deeper understanding of the town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamefront.com/alan-wake-dlc-the-signal-alarm-clocks/|author=Richardson, Ben|title=Alan Wake DLC – The Signal Alarm Clocks|publisher=[[GameFront]]|date=26 July 2010|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
Alan Wake (voiced by [[Matthew Porretta]]) is a best-selling [[psychological thriller]] author but has been suffering from a two-year stretch of [[writer's block]]. He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls in the state of Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and his friend and agent Barry Wheeler. Before arrival, Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who tried to harm him before an ethereal figure interrupts his dream and teaches him how to use light to fight the shadows. On their arrival, Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky, the cabin's landlord, but he is visited by a mysterious old woman, who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys. After Alan leaves, Stucky is shown trying to catch up to him and give him the real keys.

Alan and Alice arrive at a cabin on an island in the middle of Cauldron Lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice arranged this trip to try to break his writer's block, scheduling him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Hartman and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and takes a short walk, but runs back when Alice cries for help. He returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.

Alan regains consciousness a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, but with no memory of how he got there. He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled ''Departure'' with his name on the by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron Lake for years after it sunk following volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.

Alan receives a call from a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of ''Departure'' in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about to turn over the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. Before being consumed by the tornado, the man revealed that he never had Alice to begin with. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story and claims he is suffering a [[psychotic break]]; everything that he's witnessed being part of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while retrieving the manuscript pages in Dr. Hartman's office, Dr. Hartman tries to stop him and gives the impression that he is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI has arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.

Alan and Barry start to learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has previously tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on [[moonshine]], and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write ''Departure'' during the prior week and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.

Sarah and the FBI arrive to arrest the two, but the shadowy figures drag the FBI agent away. Sarah, now convinced of the Dark Presence, helps Alan and Barry to find Cynthia Weaver, a hermit that fears the Dark Presence. She shows them to the "Well-Lit Room" and to a weapon that is able to defeat the Dark Presence: the Clicker, a simple light switch that has been infused with the power of Alan's writings. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone to face the Dark Presence, using his newfound ability to affect reality with his thoughts aided by the Clicker. The Dark Presence is dispelled but there is no sign of Alice, and Alan believes that to maintain balance, he must give himself to the lake. As Alan sinks below the waters, Alice climbs safely out of the lake.&lt;ref name=e6_end&gt;{{cite video game |title='''Alan Wake''' |developer=[[Remedy Entertainment]]|publisher=[[Microsoft Game Studios]]|date=|platform=|version=|scene=|level=Episode 6|language=|quote='''Alan''': I understood what I had to do now. I knew how to write the ending to ''Departure''. There's light, and there's darkness. Cause and effect. There's guilt and there's atonement. But the scales always need to balance. Everything has a price. That's where Zane had gone wrong. ''[...]'' It's not a lake – it's an ocean.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the depths of the lake, Alan finds himself in the cabin and realizes that ''Departure'' is not yet finished, and turns back to the typewriter to continue the story and write his own means to be free of the lake. He comments to himself that "It's not a lake—''it's an ocean.''"&lt;ref name=e6_end /&gt;

===Special One: The Signal===
Continuing from the end of the main game, Alan finds himself in a [[surrealism|surreal]] version of Bright Falls and realizes he is being held in Cauldron Lake. Zane directs Alan to follow a signal through a cell phone to focus and guide himself out of "the Dark Place", the realm where the Dark Presence came from and where the written word can become reality. As Alan continues to avoid and defeat various Taken, he encounters several television screens that show a more maniacal version of Alan, ranting about upcoming events, forewarning Alan of what is to come. He also encounters an ethereal version of Barry, a figment of his subconsciousness, who also helps to guide Alan safely across the abstract landscape.

Zane's signal leads Alan to a sawmill, but as he explores it, he finds himself back in a setting of his city apartment. Zane appears, and tells Alan that it is ''himself''—the maniacal figure on the televisions—that is keeping him in the Dark Place. Alan refuses to believe that he is trapping himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them that tries to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/faqs/2010/alan-wake-walkthrough-1092902 |title=Alan Wake: Special One Walkthrough|language = | work = |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Two: The Writer===
Still trapped in the Dark Place, Alan regains consciousness to find his memories of Bright Falls emerging; after leaving an [[wikt: amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the Cauldron Lake Lodge and the Andersons' farm, Zane tells Alan he must make his way back to the cabin via a lighthouse. The environments start to become exceedingly surreal and Alan follows Zane's path, avoiding increasing numbers of Taken. Zane warns Alan that the "irrational Alan" is still inside the cabin, controlling the Dark Place, while he himself represents the rational part of Alan; the rational Alan must regain control of the dream in order to have any chance of escaping the Dark Place. The irrational side of Alan attempts to stop him by creating delusions of Alice, extinguishing the lighthouse's light, and sending armies of Taken after him, but with Zane's help, Alan eventually reaches his goal, passing through the lighthouse to reach the cabin.

As he nears the cabin, the imaginary Barry appears and tells Alan that he will have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—''"Return"''.

==Development==
The Finnish studio [[Remedy Entertainment]] is known for creating the critically acclaimed ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' (2001), and its sequel, ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]'' (2003). After shipping ''Max Payne 2'', Remedy Entertainment spent some time "recovering from the crunch",&lt;ref name="alanwake_faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.remedygames.com/showthread.php?t=1216 |title=Alan Wake FAQ|author=User "sidetwo"|format=Forum post|publisher=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started coming up with different concepts for a new project. Among these was the concept for ''Alan Wake''.&lt;ref name="alanwake_faq"/&gt;

The game was announced at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) for "the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|next generation of consoles]] and [[Personal computer|PCs]]", and was shown to the press behind closed doors in the form of a [[tech demo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Surette |first=Tim |accessdate=26 December 2010 |date=21 April 2005 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/remedy-fixin-up-new-game-for-e3-6122709 |title=Remedy fixin' up new game for E3 |publisher=GameSpot |archivedate=8 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108094742/http://www.gamespot.com/news/remedy-fixin-up-new-game-for-e3-6122709 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasavin |first=Greg |url=http://www.gamespot.com/alan-wake/previews/alan-wake-e3-2005-impressions-6125494/ |title=Alan Wake E3 2005 Impressions |publisher=GameSpot |date=18 May 2005 |accessdate=26 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124214608/http://www.gamespot.com/alan-wake/previews/alan-wake-e3-2005-impressions-6125494/ |archivedate=24 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Remedy partnered with [[Microsoft Game Studios]] to publish the game exclusively for Microsoft's [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console]] and then-current [[Windows Vista]] PC [[operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|author1=[[Microsoft Game Studios]] |author2=[[Remedy Entertainment]] |date=9 May 2006 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/microsoft-game-studios-and-remedy-partner-in-delivering-alan-wake-6149852 |title=Microsoft Game Studios and Remedy Partner in Delivering Alan Wake |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=26 December 2010 |archivedate=8 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108094804/http://www.gamespot.com/news/microsoft-game-studios-and-remedy-partner-in-delivering-alan-wake-6149852 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vista_lineup"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2006/may06/05-09G4WE3LineupPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Spectacular Windows Vista Title Lineup |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=9 May 2006 |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114170721/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2006/may06/05-09G4WE3LineupPR.aspx |archivedate=14 November 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first screenshots depicted the character of Alan Wake in much different attire, as well as a different layout for the town of Bright Falls, compared to the released game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/game.php?game_id=4591 |title=Alan Wake Screenshots &amp; Images |publisher=Eurogamer |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=26 December 2010 |archivedate=23 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023164520/http://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-xbox360 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the characters featured in ''Alan Wake'' were based on real life models. [[Ilkka Villi]] and Jonna Järvenpää, the models for Alan and Alice Wake, respectively, are the only Finnish models in the game; all other models were American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tietoviikko.fi/kaikki_uutiset/article135777.ece |title=Alan Wake on oikeasti Ilkka Villi |language = Finnish |publisher=Tieto Viikko |date=20 June 2008|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice overs were provided by native actors from Japan and America for their respective regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/03/25/alan_wake_voice_cast_set/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327091058/http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/03/25/alan_wake_voice_cast_set|title=Alan Wake Voice Cast Set |publisher=Andriasang.com |date=25 March 2010| accessdate=15 August 2011|archivedate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Limited Edition Bonus Disk&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years of having repeatedly demonstrated the [[Microsoft Windows]] version, in 2009, Remedy confirmed that at that point the game was being developed [[Console exclusivity|exclusively]] for the Xbox 360 and the decision to make a PC version was in Microsoft's hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thorsen |first=Tor |publisher=GameSpot |date=15 July 2009 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/pc-alan-wakes-fate-tbd-remedy-6213426 |title=PC Alan Wake's fate TBD&amp;nbsp;– Remedy |accessdate=26 December 2010 |archivedate=18 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118051350/http://www.gamespot.com/news/pc-alan-wakes-fate-tbd-remedy-6213426 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game's release in 2010, Remedy said that bringing the game to the PC was "not on the cards at the moment."&lt;ref name="eurogamer_lookback"/&gt; However, nearly two years after its release, Remedy was able to secure the rights to publish a PC version.

The game was announced as "done" and undergoing final polishing in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/08/17/reassuring-alan-wake-is-done-being-polished/ |title=Reassuring: Alan Wake is 'done,' being polished |publisher=Joystiq |date=17 August 2009 |accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game eventually [[Goes gold|went gold]] on 7 April 2010, and was released in May.

Originally, Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style [[open world]] city, similar to those seen in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. After trying this idea for six months, the team decided to scrap it, because it interfered with the pacing and storytelling they intended to deliver in a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] game.&lt;ref name="joystiq_ozz_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/12/interview-remedys-oskari-ozz-hakkinen-on-alan-wake/ |title=Interview: Remedy's Oskari 'Ozz' Hakkinen on Alan Wake|last=de Matos|first=Xav|date=12 April 2010|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=235109|title=Alan Wake was nearly a sandbox title|date=17 February 2010|last=Ingham |first=Tim |publisher=Computer and Video Games|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matias_myllyrinne_breathing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/14/interview-matias-myllyrinne-on-breathing-life-into-alan-wake/|title=Interview: Matias Myllyrinne on breathing life into Alan Wake|date=14 April 2010|last=Kietzmann|first=Ludwig |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's enemies were designed by drawing concept art and then pouring water over them to make them feel "Just a bit off".&lt;ref name=gamespot-6251528&gt;{{cite news|date=18 February 2010 |title=Remedy on making Alan Wake |work=GameSpot |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/remedy-on-making-alan-wake-6251528 |accessdate=17 December 2011 |archivedate=7 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107004352/http://www.gamespot.com/news/remedy-on-making-alan-wake-6251528 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the character of Alan Wake himself, Remedy used "concept photos" as opposed to more traditional concept artwork.&lt;ref name=gamespot-6251528/&gt; To research the [[Pacific Northwest]] setting for the game, a Remedy team travelled to the area, and produced a large amount of photographs and videos.&lt;ref name="dread_realworld"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=5 February 2012|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37894/exclusive-the-real-world-alan-wake|title=Exclusive: The Real World of Alan Wake|date=7 June 2010|author=User "Mr. Dark" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forum_locations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showpost.php?p=111422&amp;postcount=5 |title=Post No. 5 in 'Town of Bright Falls&amp;nbsp;– where did RMD draw inspiration?'|format=Forum post|publisher=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=31 October 2010 |author=User "MikkiRMD"|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences and allusions===
[[File:Alan Wake allusion to The Shining.png|thumb|right|alt=Top: A screenshot from the game, with Alan looking at an ax that is being smashed through a door from the other side. Bottom: A similar-looking picture from the movie The Shining, where a woman is witnessing the same situation.|''Alan Wake'' includes many references to works of popular culture. This cutscene directly alludes to a famous scene from ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.]]
''Alan Wake'' was influenced by and often alludes to certain films, TV shows, and books, as well as paying [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to a number of artists and works. Remedy has explained the shared themes and ideas between the game and other existing works of popular culture as "taking something familiar to people as an element, and building something of your own, and hopefully something [that is] unique in games, but still familiar from other forms of entertainment."&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"&gt;{{Cite video|people=Parker, Laura (interviewer); Myllyrinne, Matias (interviewee) |date=9 May 2010 |title=Alan Wake Post-Mortem Interview with Matias Myllyrinne |accessdate=7 January 2011 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/alan-wake/videos/alan-wake-post-mortem-interview-with-matias-myllyrinne-6261822/ |publisher=GameSpot |archivedate=8 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108105905/http://www.gamespot.com/alan-wake/videos/alan-wake-post-mortem-interview-with-matias-myllyrinne-6261822/ |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bestselling author [[Stephen King]] was a major inspiration for ''Alan Wake''. The main character as a writer whose work is coming true is a theme that has been explored by King in a number of his works.&lt;ref name="eurog_may2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/i_alanwake_nextgen_may2005|title=Alan Wake Interview|last=Reed |first=Kristan|date=31 May 2005|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wake's narration directly alludes to King on several occasions, including the game's opening line, in which he quotes a Stephen King essay.&lt;ref name="stephenking_quote"&gt;The game's opening line is: "Stephen King once wrote, 'Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations; they're antithetical to the poetry of fear'." The quote's source is the following: {{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20210538,00.html|title=Horror Movies: Why Big Studio Releases Are Rare to Scare|last=King|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King |date=7 July 2008|publisher=EW|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also pays homage to the film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (based on King's [[The Shining (novel)|novel of the same name]]) with a [[hedge maze]] area similar to the iconic maze in the film, among other references,&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xboxer360_hakkinen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xboxer360.com/features/alan-wake-interview-oskari-hakkinen/|title=Alan Wake Interview: Oskari Hakkinen|date=25 February 2010|last=Barker|first=Jeff|publisher=Xboxer360.com|accessdate=7 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718125347/http://www.xboxer360.com/features/alan-wake-interview-oskari-hakkinen/|archive-date=18 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as King's novel [[Christine (novel)|Christine]], with one of the in-game cars resembling her. King himself was asked for permission to use his quote. He also received copies of the game as a "thank you", but was unable to try them out because he does not own an Xbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/forums/showthread.php/18544-Stephen-King-on-Alan-Wake?p=385690#post385690 |title=Stephen King on Alan Wake |publisher=Stephenking.com |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=16 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828045935/http://www.stephenking.com/forums/showthread.php/18544-Stephen-King-on-Alan-Wake?p=385690 |archivedate=28 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to King's work, Lake has cited the stories of [[Bret Easton Ellis]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] as influences, as well as [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ewxtb/im_sam_lake_the_creatorwriter_of_max_payne_and/|title=I'm Sam Lake, the creator/writer of Max Payne and Alan Wake, AMAA!|author=SamLakeRMD|authorlink=Sam Lake|work=reddit.com|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's setting, Bright Falls, draws inspiration from the early 1990s TV show ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which was set in the titular town; both fictional small towns in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name="eurog_may2005"/&gt; [[Alfred Hitchcock]] is also cited as an inspiration, with the flocks of birds that often attack the protagonist being influenced by his classic horror film ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''.&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ausgamer_interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ausgamers.com/features/read/2889669|title=Alan Wake Preview and Interview|author=User "ChadDrake"|publisher=AusGamers.com|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game there are a number of television sets that can be found around the town in different places. They can be switched on and a short episode of the fictional series ''Night Springs'' will be played, which is influenced by the television series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', created by [[Rod Serling]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="forum_twilightzone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showpost.php?p=78813&amp;postcount=20|title=Post No. 20 in 'Night Springs (Possible spoilers)|format=Forum post|publisher=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=7 May 2010|author=User "MarkusRMD"|accessdate=19 January 2011}}{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showpost.php?p=79026&amp;postcount=22|title=Post No. 22 in 'Night Springs (Possible spoilers)|format=Forum post|publisher=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=8 May 2010|author=User "MikkiRMD" |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its structure, the story of ''Alan Wake'' plays out similarly to a mystery television program, where each episode brings another piece of the puzzle to the main ongoing story, yet have a distinct plot of their own.&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"/&gt; As such, ''Alan Wake'' is organised into episodes, which include narrative and [[plot device]]s normally used in TV, such as [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of the episodes. A prominent borrowing from television is the "Previously on ''Alan Wake''..." [[recap sequence]] that opens each episode, and serve to "refresh the player's memory and point to things that will become relevant shortly."&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"/&gt; A different song plays at the end of every episode, imitating certain TV shows that feature different music during each episode's [[closing credits]].

The main game itself is divided up into six episodes. Additionally, two "special features", titled "The Signal" and "The Writer", have been released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Together, ''Alan Wake'' and its DLCs constitute the "first season" of a bigger story. The main game is designed to have a satisfactory ending with the main character reaching his goal, while the DLCs form a two-part special that further expands on the game's story by "[continuing] the fiction and [serving] as a bridge between seasons."&lt;ref name="matias_myllyrinne_breathing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cvg_aw2_chat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=262732 |title=Remedy chats Alan Wake 2|publisher=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]|date=2 September 2010|last=Pakinkis|first=Tom|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the game's developers have expressed interest in following ''Alan Wake'' up with a season two (i.e., a sequel),&lt;ref name="eurogamer_lookback"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-08-09-alan-wake-remedy-looks-back-interview|title=Alan Wake: Remedy Looks Back |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=9 August 2010|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; no plans have been announced about this.

Remedy Entertainment chose the TV series storytelling format to establish a certain stylisation and pacing. The developers felt that watching episodes of certain TV shows&amp;nbsp;– such as the heavily serialised series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''&amp;nbsp;– in the form of released [[box set]]s, at the viewers' pace, was a "natural way of 'consuming media'", and that this episodic format was a better fit for a long game.&lt;ref name="postmortem_video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ausgamer_interview"/&gt; Remedy lauded ''Lost'' for its pacing as a thriller TV show.&lt;ref name="xboxer360_hakkinen"/&gt;

===Product placement===
A number of real-life brands and products appear in ''Alan Wake''. The game's developers have expressed that they tried to "be very conservative and attentive towards gamers" with their use of [[product placement]], and that they aimed "to make the world feel more real rather than put ads in-your-face."&lt;ref name="productplacement_forum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showpost.php?p=84164&amp;postcount=11|title=Re: product placement&amp;nbsp;— well done and not over-the-top|author=User "MarkusRMD" |publisher=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=19 May 2010|format=Forum post|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of such marketing include collectable [[Energizer]] batteries and [[Lithium battery|lithium batteries]] to insert into the player's hand-held lights. The phone service provider [[Verizon Wireless]] is another prominent brand in ''Alan Wake'': besides Verizon branded mobile phones appearing on screen, there is a 30-second Verizon commercial viewable on one of the game's interactive TVs, as well as an allusion to the company's famous advertising line "Can you hear me now?" during a phone conversation in "The Signal" [[downloadable content|DLC]]. Additionally, [[Billboard (advertising)|billboards]] around Bright Falls advertise both Energizer and Verizon. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] automobiles are also featured in the game.

Several [[Microsoft]] related brands also appear in the game. Alan and Alice Wake's car shows that it has the Microsoft-powered [[Ford Sync]] [[In car entertainment|in-vehicle entertainment]] system. An [[Xbox 360]] console can be seen in one section of the game, with the box of the fictional ''Night Springs'' video game next to it, which are collectibles in "The Writer" DLC episode. In multiple sections of the game, [[Microsoft Tag]] bar codes can be seen; these can be scanned in real life by the user with the appropriate software on their mobile device. When scanned, these tags redirect players to a phone number with the voicemail from one of the game's character, or to a Verizon-sponsored web site where users gain access to exclusive ''Alan Wake'' extras for their console.&lt;ref name="microsofttag"&gt;{{cite web|date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=2 January 2011 |publisher=Microsoft |author=Microsoft Tag team |url=http://tag.microsoft.com/tag-in-action/success-story/t/xbox_game_uses_tag_for_coded_messages.aspx |title=Microsoft Tag Blog: Alan Wake &amp; Tag |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724023907/http://tag.microsoft.com/tag-in-action/success-story/t/xbox_game_uses_tag_for_coded_messages.aspx |archivedate=24 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This functionality is only available in the United States.&lt;ref name="productplacement_forum"/&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The game's score is composed by Petri Alanko.&lt;ref name="alanwake_faq" /&gt; The soundtrack features the song "War" by [[Poets of the Fall]], from the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Twilight Theater]]''. Sam Lake said that the song "...is a prominent part of the ''Alan Wake'' soundtrack and the theme also links strongly to the game's storyline."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetsofthefall.com/news/14060_poets_of_the_fall_in_alan_wake/ |title=Official Website&amp;nbsp;– Poets of the Fall in Alan Wake |publisher=Poets of the Fall |accessdate=29 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217101917/http://www.poetsofthefall.com/news/14060_poets_of_the_fall_in_alan_wake/ |archivedate=17 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets of the Fall also perform two original songs, "Children of the Elder God" and "The Poet and the Muse", under the name Old Gods of Asgard. The band wrote the ending theme to Remedy's previous game, ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne]]'', called "Late Goodbye", which is based on a poem written by Lake. "War", however, was not written specifically for ''Alan Wake''. "[[Haunted (Poe album)|Haunted]]" by [[Poe (singer)|Poe]] plays at the end of the second episode. "[[Space Oddity]]" by [[David Bowie]] plays over the end credits. [[Anomie Belle]]'s "How Can I Be Sure" is featured in the third episode. "[[Coconut (song)|Coconut]]" by [[Harry Nilsson]] is played several times during game. On 20 July 2010 an official soundtrack consisting of 18 tracks was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UDIZJC|title=Amazon.com: Alan Wake [Original Soundtrack]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing and release==

''Alan Wake'' was first released [[Console exclusivity|exclusively]] for the [[Xbox 360]] [[video game console]]. The game was scheduled to be released on 18 May 2010 in North America, and on 21 May in Europe. When the game [[Goes gold|went gold]] on 7 April 2010, the European release date was moved up a week. Therefore, the game was released in Europe first, on 14 May 2010, and then in North America on 18 May, as originally scheduled.&lt;ref name=gonegold&gt;{{cite web|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=21 April 2011|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/63179/alan-wake-gone-gold-gets|title=Alan Wake Gone Gold, Gets New Trailer|last=O'Connor|first=Alice|publisher=Shacknews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davey |first=Jamie |date=12 February 2010 |url=http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/7564/microsoft-ses-alan-wake-early-in-europe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011833/http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/7564/microsoft-ses-alan-wake-early-in-europe |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 March 2012 |title=Microsoft releases Alan Wake early in Europe |publisher=Strategy Informer |accessdate=7 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Release Dates|publisher=IGN |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/106/1068670p1.html|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=20 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanwake.com/|title= Official site|accessdate=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showthread.php?t=2942|title=Release Dates|accessdate=11 February 2010|date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 November 2010, ''Alan Wake'' was released on the [[Games on Demand]] service of [[Xbox Live]].&lt;ref name="gamesondemand_pr"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/xbox360press/archive/2010/11/18/alan-wake-lights-up-xbox-live-games-on-demand.aspx |title='Alan Wake' Lights Up Xbox LIVE Games on Demand |date=18 November 2010 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=21 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211051334/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/xbox360press/archive/2010/11/18/alan-wake-lights-up-xbox-live-games-on-demand.aspx |archivedate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2012, a version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released.

Despite the cancellation of the PC version at the same time as the Xbox 360 release as a result of Microsoft's decision, Remedy's Oskari Häkkinen stated that "PC gaming is part of Remedy's heritage" and that the developers still wanted to release a PC version of the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc"&gt;{{cite web|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-16-how-remedy-convinced-microsoft-to-let-it-make-alan-wake-pc|title=How Remedy convinced Microsoft to let it make Alan Wake PC |date=17 February 2012|accessdate=21 February 2012|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remedy continued pressing Microsoft to allow the creation of a PC version, eventually gaining it in mid-2011; Häkkinen attributed Microsoft's agreement partially to their repeated requests, but as well as Remedy's good standing with Microsoft, and the time factor, having the PC version be available ahead of ''American Nightmare''.&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc"/&gt; Development of the PC version began in earnest, with a small team from Remedy working with Finnish independent developer Nitro Games.&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc"/&gt; Instead of starting from the scrapped PC version, the team worked from the Xbox 360 code and added in new features to take advantage of more powerful elements on modern PC machines.&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc"/&gt; Core to the PC version was to make sure that the game played well using typical keyboard and mouse controls in addition to a controller, and to assure the graphics exceeded the limitations of the Xbox 360; Matias Myllyrinne, Remedy's CEO, stated that these elements were important, as "If this is not tuned to perfection, all the visuals are lost and the emotional touchstones are missed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/12/21/alan-wake-developers-remedy-on-self-publishing/|title=Alan Wake devs talk self-publishing and dodgy console ports|first=Henry|last=Winchester|date=21 December 2011|accessdate=21 February 2012|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version was completed in about five months,&lt;ref name="eurogamer pc"/&gt; and the game formally announced to the public in December 2011.&lt;ref name="pc_announcement"&gt;{{cite press release|date=14 December 2011 |url=http://www.gamedevelopment.com/view/pressreleases/81004/Remedy_Entertainment_Announces_Alan_Wake_is_coming_to_PC_inearly_2012.php|title=Remedy Entertainment Announces Alan Wake is coming to PC in early 2012|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game, which includes the main game and both DLC chapters, was released on the Steam platform on 16 February 2012. Within 48 hours, Remedy announced that revenue from sale of this version surpassed their development and marketing costs for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/40402/Alan_Wake_PC_recoups_costs_in_2_days.php|title=Alan Wake PC recoups costs in 2 days|first=Mike|last=Rose|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=21 February 2012|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retail PC version, distributed by [[JoWooD Entertainment|Nordic Games]], was released on 2 March 2012, in both a regular edition and a Collector's edition, containing a soundtrack disc, ''The Alan Wake Files'', and other special content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/82922/Premium_content_unveiled_for_Alan_Wake_CollectorrsquosEdition.php|title=Premium content unveiled for Alan Wake Collector's Edition|date=13 February 2012|accessdate=21 February 2012|publisher=[[GamesPress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PC retail release for the United States was released on 24 April 2012, being distributed by [[Legacy Interactive]].

In December 2013, Remedy and Xbox released a special collector's edition of the hit horror game, loaded with new content on the disc, including a 44-page digital comic book with art by [[Gerry Kissell]] and Amin Amat, and written by Remedy Entertainment's Mikko Rautalahti, who also wrote the script for the video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remedy Releases Free Alan Wake Comics, Soundtrack, and More|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/130854-Remedy-Releases-Free-Alan-Wake-Comics-Soundtrack-and-More|accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bright Falls'' web series===
A promotional live-action [[tie-in]] [[web series]]/[[miniseries]] titled ''Bright Falls'' was made available a few weeks before the game's release on the web&lt;ref name="brightfallscom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightfalls.com/|title=Welcome to Bright Falls!|work=brightfalls.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Xbox Live]] service. The six episodes of ''Bright Falls'' were co-written and directed by Phillip Van,&lt;ref name="g4tv_philvan_interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/704939/interview-bright-falls-directorco-writer-phillip-van.html|title=Interview: Bright Falls Director/Co-Writer|last=Gaskill|first=Jake|publisher=G4tv.com|date=25 May 2010|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they serve as a prequel to the game, set in the eponymous town before Alan Wake arrives there. The main character in the series is Jake Fischer (played by Christopher Forsyth),&lt;ref name="brightfalls_credits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brightfalls.com/html/credits_en-US.html |title=Alan Wake Production Credits |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519132244/http://www.brightfalls.com/html/credits_en-US.html |year=2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010 |archivedate=19 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a newspaper reporter who visits the town on business.

A number of characters are shared between ''Bright Falls'' and ''Alan Wake'', including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode. The actors who play these characters also serve as voice actors and physical models for the characters in the game.&lt;ref name="brightfalls_credits"/&gt;

The web series begins as Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to interview Dr. Hartman on his new book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself waking up in the middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights and daytime. The longer he stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.

===Downloadable content===
During 2010, two "special feature" [[#Episodic format|episodes]] of ''Alan Wake'' were developed and released as [[downloadable content]] (DLC) on the [[Xbox Live]] service, which serve to bridge the gap between the game's ending, and a possible sequel.

The first of the two, titled "The Signal", was released on 27 July 2010.&lt;ref name="thesignal_release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.alanwake.com/showpost.php?p=81439&amp;postcount=7|title=Re: First DLC coming 28 July|work=Alan Wake Community Forums|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=21 April 2011|quote=The episode titled "The Signal" will be available July 27, 2010 on Xbox LIVE.}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Houghton of [[GamesRadar+]] said it was one of the best segments of the game, but worried that it made the main game feel comparatively less impressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/why-alan-wakes-dlc-is-a-brilliant-download-but-a-dangerous-precedent/|title=Why Alan Wake's DLC is a brilliant download but a dangerous precedent|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar+]]|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second episode, "The Writer", was released on 12 October 2010.&lt;ref name="thewriter_trailer"&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmk2dus1BhU|title=Alan Wake: The Writer&amp;nbsp;— Trailer|publisher=Remedy Entertainment|date=28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlcprice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/06/17/alan-wake-dlc-episodes-priced-at-7-each/|title=Alan Wake DLC episodes priced at $7 each|last=Kietzmann|first=Ludwig|date=17 June 2010|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] called it a must-buy for anyone that already purchased "The Signal", and said it satisfyingly closed out the game's story. He did feel that both DLCs were pricey for the amount of content they provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/12/alan-wake-the-writer-review|author=Brudvig, Erik|title= Alan Wake: The Writer Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
The limited collector's edition of the game includes a 144-page book called ''The Alan Wake Files'', which expands on the fiction of the game.&lt;ref name=lce/&gt; A [[novelisation]] of ''Alan Wake'' was written by Rick Burroughs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rick|last=Burroughs|year=2010|title=Alan Wake|publisher=Tor Books|isbn=0765328437}}&lt;/ref&gt; An art/making of book, entitled ''Alan Wake: Illuminated'' is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jorg|last=Neumann|first2=Tony|last2=Elias|title=Alan Wake: Illuminated|publisher=Prima Games|isbn=0307470148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alan Wake'' received positive reviews. Michael Plant from ''[[The Independent]]'' gave the game a score of 5/5. He praised ''Alan Wake'' for its "flawless pacing", which "ensures a compulsive experience". The editing and plot were also received very positively, making the game "the kind of experience the current console generation was made for."&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|date=7 May 2010|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/games-reviews-alan-wake-1964974.html |title=Games Reviews: Alan Wake|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Michael Plant|accessdate=8 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' rated the game 9/10 with editor Nick Cowen being impressed by its "stunning" look, stating the town of Bright Falls and its surrounding environment to be "authentic" in terms of architecture, vegetation, weather and lighting. He described the atmosphere as being able to "...turn on a dime from feeling safe and serene to one of choking menace and foreboding...". Combat mechanics and plot were also praised with the first making "the player feel constantly under threat." and the latter being described as one of the game's "strongest assets". Criticism included the quality of the facial animation and the relatively short length of the game.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/7681625/Alan-Wake-video-game-review.html|title=Alan Wake video game review&amp;nbsp;– Telegraph|author=Nick Cowen|date=6 May 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirk Lammers said the game kept "players on the edge of their seats", giving a final score of 4 out of 4 in his review for the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700033582/Video-game-review-Alan-Wake-offers-tons-of-creepy-thrills.html|title=Review: 'Alan Wake' offers tons of creepy thrills|first=Dirk|last=Lammers|date=19 May 2010|work=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Greenop from ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' rated the game 5/5 and praised the game's "excellent pace" due to its episodic format. He also praised the "chilling" storyline, "brilliant environments" and concluded the game to be "one of the most innovative and entertaining titles so far this year."&lt;ref name="NZHerald"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/games/news/article.cfm?c_id=38&amp;objectid=10644623|title=Game review: Alan Wake|publisher=NZ Herald News|first=Matt|last=Greenop|date=13 May 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Vitka from the ''[[New York Post]]'' graded it B+, praising the game for its "scary atmosphere", music, graphics and "surprising level of complexity" in combat, but commented negatively on the game's animation and storyline.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alan Wake:Stephen King, The Game |author=William Vitka |work=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/alan_wake_stephen_king_the_game_67qoWQlHwuAdgCMiC0IH4L |date=6 May 2010 |accessdate=8 May 2010 |archivedate=10 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510003630/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/gamereport/alan_wake_stephen_king_the_game_67qoWQlHwuAdgCMiC0IH4L |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Crecente]], editor-in-chief of [[Kotaku]], praised the general use of light as a gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: "For the first time in my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion." He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game "redefines interactive storytelling".&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5527633/alan-wake-review-transcending-its-medium |title=Alan Wake Review: Transcending Its Medium |first=Brian |last=Crecente |authorlink=Brian Crecente |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=9 May 2010 |date=5 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508204332/http://kotaku.com/5527633/alan-wake-review-transcending-its-medium |archivedate= 8 May 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom McShea criticised the game for lacking "surprising, memorable gameplay moments" in his review for [[GameSpot]], but hailed it for its "fresh" story-telling, great original as well as licensed music, "subtle" lighting effects, which, along with the soundtrack, "create a disturbing atmosphere", "satisfying" combat system and "clever" inclusion of collectibles, giving a final score of 8.5/10.&lt;ref name="GSpot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-review/1900-6260843/|title=Alan Wake Review for Xbox360 – Gamespot|publisher=GameSpot|author=Tom Mc Shea|date=7 May 2010|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Charles Onyett scored the game 9/10, providing it with the "Editors' Choice Award". He described it as "hard to put down once you have started", and appreciated the game for its episodic structure, "interesting" story-telling mechanic, lighting effects, soundtrack and combat system, which he described as "fast and responsive", but criticised the writing as "uneven". The game received high marks for its "strong atmosphere", "fun gameplay", and "great visuals", but lost some due to its "weak ending".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/108/1087706p1.html|title=Alan Wake Review&amp;nbsp;– Xbox 360 review at IGN|author=Charles Onyett|accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Orry from VideoGamer.com also awarded a score of 9/10, praising the game for its "clever narrative", "incredible atmosphere" and soundtrack which he described as "one of the best and most memorable I've ever heard in a video game".&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/alan_wake/review-3.html|title=Alan Wake Review for Xbox 360|first=Tom|last=Orry|accessdate=4 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406115803/http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/alan_wake/review-3.html|archive-date=6 April 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game an 8.6/10. The review praised the game's presentation for "selling you completely on its twisted nightmare", and providing a "genuine sense of dread".&lt;ref name="GT"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Ellie Gibson awarded a score of 7/10, stating that although she did not consider the game to be very original, she found it accessible and undemanding, with a "neat combat mechanic".&lt;ref name="eurogamer"/&gt;

Chris Kohler from [[Wired magazine]] was more critical and gave it 6/10, saying "when presented with an infinite number of possible resolutions, any answer is going to feel arbitrary. Alan Wake starts strong but finishes weak. Neither the gameplay nor the story deliver on their potential by the time the credits roll". Kohler, however, praised main character, certain gameplay decisions and "unique story".&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/review-alan-wake/|title=Review: Horror Game Alan's Wake Can't Keep it Creepy|first=Chris|last=Kohler|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
[[NPD Group]] stated sales for the first two weeks reached 145,000 units.&lt;ref name="joystiq.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/02/npd-on-the-red-dead-alan-wake-and-split-second-retail-showdown/|title=NPD on the Red Dead, Alan Wake, and Split/Second retail showdown|publisher=Joystiq|date=2 July 2010|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report, ''Alan Wake'' is the second most [[Copyright infringement|illegally copied]] Xbox 360 game of 2010, with more than 1.1 million downloads.&lt;ref name=piracy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-most-pirated-game-of-2010-101228/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops Most Pirated Game of 2010|publisher=TorrentFreak|author="Emesto"|date=28 December 2010|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes an amusing feature where if "pirated", the character wears an eye patch during the game. According to a report by IndustryGamers, sales of ''Alan Wake'' would be much higher than previously estimated, at around 1.4 million, as of December 2011. This includes the digital sales of the game during the Xbox 360 2011 Holiday bundle, which included a token to download ''Alan Wake'', as well as a retail copy of ''[[Forza Motorsport 3]]''.

On 13 March 2012 Remedy Entertainment announced that the game has passed 2 million copies sold, including Xbox 360 and PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/339789/alan-wake-sales-top-2-million-series-has-a-future/|title=Alan Wake sales top 2 million, series 'has a future' |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com|first=Andy|last=Robinson|date=13 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 2013 Remedy creative director Sam Lake announced that the game and its [[Alan Wake's American Nightmare|standalone follow up]] had sold 3 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-23-remedy-on-why-alan-wake-2-isnt-happening-right-now|title=Remedy on why Alan Wake 2 isn't happening right now|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=23 May 2013|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 2015 Remedy's CEO Matias Myllyrinne tweeted that the franchise had sold over 4.5 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/alan_wake/news/alan_wake_franchise_passes_4_5m_sales.html|title=Alan Wake franchise passes 4.5m sales|author=David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.Com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month a [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] story on the game's prototype for a sequel mentioned that ''Alan Wake'' had sold more than 3.2 million copies.&lt;ref name=Crecente&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/4/20/8450329/alan-wake-2-prototype-video-interview|title=Introducing the Alan Wake 2 you will never play|first=Brian|last=Crecente|date=20 April 2015|work=Polygon|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music licensing issues==
Due to expiring music licenses, all digital and retail versions of ''Alan Wake'' were pulled from purchase from the various storefronts as of 15 May 2017, though Remedy offered a large discount for the title in the days prior to removal. The removal does not affect those who already own the game, nor does it impact the availability of ''Alan Wake's American Nightmare'', though that title will likely be affected similarly when its own licensing deals expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/12/alan-wake-is-being-pulled-from-steam-and-the-xbox-store-after-this-weekend/ | title = Alan Wake is being pulled from Steam and the Xbox Store after this weekend | first= Stephany |last = Nunneley | date = 12 May 2017 | accessdate = 12 May 2017 | work = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, by October 2018, Remedy had been able to rework the music licensing details with Microsoft's help, and the game was made available again on Windows storefronts, with the original music tracks. Remedy is currently working to also secure the rights for the Xbox platform in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gog.com/news/alan_wake_back_on_sale_just_in_time_for_spooky_season | title = Alan Wake Back On Sale Just In Time For Spooky Season | date = 25 October 2018 | accessdate = 25 October 2018 | work = [[GOG.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/alan-wake-makes-a-surprise-return-to-steam-after-long-absence | title = Alan Wake Makes a Surprise Return to Steam After Long Absence | first = Matt | last = Kim | date = 25 October 2018 | accessdate = 25 October 2018 | work = [[USGamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/25/18023688/alan-wake-digital-download-purchase-steam-humble | title = Alan Wake returns to digital storefronts, thanks to Microsoft | first=  Allegra | last = Frank  |date = 25 October 2018 | accessdate = 25 October 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off and sequel==
{{main article|Alan Wake's American Nightmare}}
At ''Alan Wake''{{'}}s release, Remedy had intended for a sequel; developer Oskari Häkkinen stated that Remedy saw the game as "Season 1" and its [[Downloadable content|DLC]] was to "bridge the gap to what we're working towards."&lt;ref name="cvg_aw2_chat"/&gt; Häkkinen stated they were not directly working on a sequel at that time, as Microsoft had focused them to complete the DLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]|title=Alan Wake 2 'still not confirmed'|accessdate=9 August 2010|url= http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=253150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Mikko Rautalahti adds the story is "bigger than one game" and the sequel would be "weird and wonderful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=259414|publisher=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]|title=Alan Wake 2 will be very 'weird'|accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, leaked information led to Remedy confirming they were working on a new ''Alan Wake'' project, but affirmed it was not a full sequel.&lt;ref name="next_aw_no2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kietzmann|first=Ludwig|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/10/new-alan-wake-confirmed-but-its-not-alan-wake-2/|title=New Alan Wake confirmed, but it's not 'Alan Wake 2'|publisher=Joystiq|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was ultimately revealed to be ''[[Alan Wake's American Nightmare]]'', a short standalone game released in 2012 that follows Alan's adventures after the first game that they wanted to release on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] platform. The Remedy team had looked at a project borrowing from zombie and monster films like ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'', and wanted to create more of a sandbox mode for players to fight off waves of enemies (which became the game's Arcade mode, "Fight Till Dawn"); they then worked these elements into Alan's story, keeping the theme of ''The Twilight Zone'' to progress the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/alan-wakes-american-nightmare-was-born-out-of-the-fight-till-dawn-arcade-mode/ | title = Alan Wake’s American Nightmare was born out of the Fight Till Dawn arcade mode | first = Adam | last =  Rosenberg | date = December 23, 2011 | accessdate = September 12, 2018 | work = [[Digital Trends]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2013, a new game by Remedy was announced at the Xbox One event called ''[[Quantum Break]]'', before explaining the following day that a sequel to ''Alan Wake'' had been postponed. Despite their love of the property and initially beginning work on a sequel, ''Alan Wake'' was not financially successful enough to receive the funding they needed to continue developing the sequel at the time.&lt;ref name="awan_nosequel"&gt;{{cite news|date=22 May 2013|url=http://www.kotaku.com/alan-wake-creator-explains-why-were-not-getting-a-sequ-509377931|title=Alan Wake Creator Explains Why We Are Not Getting A Sequel|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|accessdate=22 May 2013|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, Polygon published an article describing the development process of ''Alan Wake 2'' that started shortly after the first game released. ''Alan Wake 2'' already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else and development of the sequel has shifted to ''Quantum Break. ''Most of the ideas for ''Alan Wake 2 ''were implemented on ''[[Alan Wake's American Nightmare|American Nightmare]]'', like the game's location, the Arizona Desert, and the concept of Taken enemies with special abilities.&lt;ref name=Crecente/&gt;

In July 2018, Remedy CEO Telo Virtala made an interview for GamesIndustry.biz and revealed that Alan Wake will not be planned without Microsoft Studios' approval (since it was their intellectual property). Virtala stated: "Considering our history... Alan Wake was really interesting but it was a collaboration with Microsoft. Due to certain reasons, it never got a sequel. Quantum Break, also, we put a lot of effort into creating the world, the characters, the stories, but still it was Microsoft IP. They decided not to take it further."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-07-16-how-remedy-is-taking-control-of-its-own-destiny&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television show==
In September 2018, Remedy Entertainment and [[Contradiction Films]] announced plans to develop a live-action ''Alan Wake'' series, with Peter Calloway as the showrunner and Remedy's Sam Lake as executive producer. Contradiction Film's Tomas Harlan had seen ''Alan Wake''{{'}}s potential as a television series, in part that the game was constructed in episodic chapters and presented in a linear fashion, and had spoken to Lake about it several times, and in 2018 began to start on a firm planning process, which including bringing Calloway on board during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]]. The show plans to use concepts from the scrapped ''Alan Wake 2'', as well as building upon what the first game and ''American Nightmare'' provided; Harlan does not expect the series to be in lock-step with the game and while Alan Wake would be the central character of the show, they would spend more time developing his companions from the game. The group plans to shop the show around to networks in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/alan-wake-tv-show-1202938003/ | title = Peter Calloway to Adapt ‘Alan Wake’ for Television  | first =Brian | last = Crecente | date = September 12, 2018 | accessdate = September 12, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alkap''' ({{lang-bn|আলকাপ}}) is a form of [[Bengali language|Bengali]] folk performance popular in the districts of [[Murshidabad district|Murshidabad]], [[Malda district|Malda]] and [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]] in [[West Bengal]] and [[Chapai Nawabganj District|Chapai Nawabganj]], [[Rajshahi Division|Randajshahi]] in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=Banglapedia&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Alkap_Gan| title = Alkap Gan | accessdate = 2009-03-22 | last = Ahmed| first = Wakil | work =Banglapedia  | publisher = Asiatic Society of Bangladesh }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also spread to the adjoining areas of [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]] such as [[Dumka district|Dumka]] and [[Purnia district|Purnia]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.telegraphindia.com/1030718/asp/calcutta/story_2173034.asp

==Etymology==
Kaap means ‘kavya’ (verse) and Aal is part of the verse.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Form==
Alkap is an amalgamation of music, dance and theatrical presentation. An alkap group of ten to twelve performers is led by a ''sarkar'' (master) or ''guru'' (leader) and includes two or three young men called ''chhokras'', one or two ''gayens'' or singers, ''dohar'', choristers, and musicians. Alkap is presented in five parts: '' Asar Vandana'', ''Chhora'', ''Kaap'', ''Baithaki Gaan'' and ''Khemta Pala''. The  programme is a reflection of rural society and puts the focus on the prevailing socio-economic condition of the rural masses.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s there was a significant influx of Finnish economic migrants into [[Sweden]]. Between 1950 and 1980 the number of Finns in Sweden increased from 45,000 to over 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000005198557.html&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes towards Finnish immigrants were quite negative is Sweden. Derogatory expressions "en finne igen" ("yet another Finn") and "finnjävel" (equivalent to "Finnish bastard" or "Finnish devil") were commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://keskustelu.suomi24.fi/t/5211876/en-finne-igen "En Finne Igen"] ''suomi24'', December 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.migranttales.net/too-many-finnish-politicians-and-parties-are-ignorant-of-their-countrys-migrant-and-refugee-history/&lt;/ref&gt; An antology ''Finnjävlar'' was published, in which 15 Swedish-speaking Finns describe their lives and lives of their parents in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=185&amp;artikel=6537429 "Finnjävlar-antologia kirjoittaa uusiksi Ruotsin suomalaisten historiaa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finnjävel===

'''Finnjävel''' (singular) and '''Finnjävlar''' (plural) are [[derogatory]] terms used in [[Sweden]] for [[Sweden Finns|Finnish immigrants]], mostly during the 1950s and 1960s. In this context, [[wikt:jävel|jävel]] or [[wikt:djävel|djävel]], literally meaning "devil", is a generic strong insult.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.helsinkidesignweek.com/series/artisans-created-all-the-plates-and-pieces-for-finnjavel-restaurant/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a book called "Finnjävlar" that discusses Finnish minority identity in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=185&amp;artikel=6537429&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a restaurant in [[Helsinki]] with the name.&lt;ref&gt;https://viisitahtea.com/uutiset/finnjavel-sulkee-lauantaina-henri-alen-ja-tommi-tuominen-perustavat-havikkiravintolan-sitran-tuella/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The prominent role of [[Finnish Americans|Finnish immigrants]] in the 1907 and 1916 [[Mesaba Range]] strikes in [[Minnesota]] has led to [[blacklisting]] of Finns. It was the time of anti-Finnish sentiment in the area, and one could see signs "No Indians or Finns allowed."&lt;ref name="MNopedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scorich|first1=Jason|title=Mesaba Co-op Park|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/place/mesaba-co-op-park|website=[[MNopedia]]|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]]|date=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China Swede ===
'''China Swede''' was a [[derogatory]] term used for [[Finnish American|Finnish immigrants in the United States]] during the early [[20th century|1900s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/199706/10_losurem_finnpoor/finnpoor2.htm |title=MPR: Finland Was a Poor Country |website=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=1997-06-10 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nybergh |first=Thomas |url=http://inktank.fi/china-swedes-forest-finns-and-the-great-migration-how-finnish-immigrants-helped-build-america/ |title=How Finnish immigrants battled racism to help build America |website=Inktank.fi |date=2015-09-27 |accessdate=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in Minnesota and Michigan.&lt;ref name="McPhersonPlunkett2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tristram McPherson|author2=David Plunkett|title=The Routledge Handbook of Metaethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBQwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT349|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-81791-2|pages=349–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boat racing festival called '''Boun Suang Heua'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismlaos.org/show.php?Cont_ID=444  BOUN SUANG HEUA, BOAT RACING FESTIVAL], sur ''tourismlaos.org''. Consulté le 22 septembre 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Boun Xuang Heua''' (Lao: ບຸນຊ່ວງເຮືອ) or '''Loy Krathong''' (Lao: ລອຍກະໂທງ) is celebrated every year, particularly in [[Laos]], usually in October, at the end of Buddhist Lent.

There are spectacular canoe races organized in the cities (mainly [[Vientiane]], [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]], and [[Champasak (town)|Champassak]] province) and villages along the [[Mekong]].

Boats are decorated with flowers and candles. Also, small rafts made of [[bamboo]] and decorated with [[candles]] are launched down the streams and river.

== Origin of the tradition ==

[[File:Laonaga.jpg|thumb|A [[Phaya Naga|naga]], protector of [[Vientiane]].]]
The canoe race has existed for thousands of years. Daily life is greatly organized around the [[Mekong]] River and its numerous tributaries. Indeed, it was both a major means of transport and communication, but also a food source thanks to the fish.

Although today's canoe race is essentially a social, sporting and commercial event, it still remains associated with the [[Nāga|naga]], the protective river spirits of [[Vientiane]], which, according to Lao beliefs, carry away the rice paddies and return them back to the water.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7ZjXzufuiIC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Boun+suang+heua+Laos+OR+Burma+OR+thailand&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ALk-UrfTIIq60wX5soGIDw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Boun%20suang%20heua%20Laos%20OR%20Burma%20OR%20thailand&amp;f=false  DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Cambodia &amp; Laos]'', Dorling Kindersley Ltd, 2013, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=July 2011}}
The film begins in [[Alexandria]] with [[Cleopatra VII]], Egypt's rightful Queen, in exile, while her sister [[Arsinoe IV of Egypt|Arsinoe]] and brother, [[Ptolemy XIII|Ptolemy]] have stolen the throne. Roman general [[Julius Caesar]] comes to collect Egypt's tax debt. After conversing with a courtesan, Cleopatra smuggles herself into the palace wrapped in a carpet; a gift from her to Caesar. He accepts the gift and the young queen is revealed to Caesar. The two spend the night together, and the next morning, Cleopatra and Ptolemy are betrothed to marry by Caesar. Shortly after the siblings are wed, Cleopatra is proclaimed [[Queen regnant|Queen]] of Egypt, forcing Ptolemy to join forces with Arsinoe and drive their sister out of Alexandria.

A war breaks out between the Romans and Ptolemy's Egyptian forces, and in the process, Alexandria's great library is burned to the ground. Even with this loss, Cleopatra soon celebrates the return of her Roman lover, the death of her brother, and the capture of her traitor sister. The two take a 2-month journey down the Nile aboard one of the Queen's elegant ships. Upon their return, Caesar breaks the news that he must leave for Rome. Unbeknownst to him, Caesar leaves Cleopatra pregnant with his child. A son is born to the queen roughly nine months later; he is named [[Caesarion]], in honor of his father.

Back in [[Roman Republic|Rome]], believing that he should hold the same status as his Egyptian lover, Caesar demands he be declared King of Rome. Although they are hesitant to do so, the senate eventually grants Caesar's request. Now having been declared king, Caesar invites Cleopatra to stay at one of his villas, just outside Rome. With her, she brings the couple's infant son. In front of his people (including wife [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]), Cleopatra declares that Caesar is her son's father, publicly forcing his hand, and demanding that her son be allowed to rule both Egypt and Rome invoking the consternation of [[Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius|Cassius]].

Although he accepts Caesarion as his child, Caesar denies the queen's request, explaining that Egypt is only free from Rome because he wishes it to be. Just before her return to Egypt, Cleopatra soon learns that Caesar has been assassinated at the hands of Brutus, Cassius and other senators. The burdens of ruling fall on the shoulders of Caesar's Roman heir and nephew, [[Octavian]]. [[Mark Antony]] declares revenge and begins a war against Brutus and Cassius. In the process, both Cassius and Brutus commit suicide.

In spending time with together, Antony and Cleopatra fall in love. Although they wish to marry, Antony marries Octavian's sister, Octavia, in order to strengthen his alliance and co-ruling with the new emperor. Defying his Roman beliefs against [[polygamy]], Antony marries Cleopatra in Antioch, claiming that her son, Caesarion, is heir to not only Egypt, but also Rome.

Upon hearing of Antony's claim, Octavian wages war against the two lovers, trapping Cleopatra in her own city. Antony army is overwhelmed by Octavian's army. Antony returns with his defeated soldiers, badly wounded and soon dies of his injuries. Cleopatra is devastated. 

Octavian arrives in Egypt, demanding that Cleopatra join him in Rome as his prisoner. She agrees and askes that her son be allowed to rule Egypt. Octavian refuses, but allows Antony to have an Egyptian burial.

After sending her son to [[India]], Cleopatra's lets an Egyptian asp bite her, and dies shortly after. Her handmaidens quickly follow their queen's example. 

Octavian's men break through the doors, only to discover that the queen is dead. Octavian approaches Cleopatra and finds that she is dead. Then he says "You have won, Cleopatra" and then leaves.

[[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] are two [[Constructed language|planned languages]] which have taken radically different approaches to the problem of providing an [[International auxiliary language]] (IAL).

Although they are both classed as IALs, the intellectual bases of Esperanto and Interlingua are quite different. It has been argued that each language is a successful implementation of a particular IAL model. However, in both language communities there is a polemical tradition of using external criteria to critique the perceived opponent language (that is, judging Interlingua by Esperantist criteria and vice versa). In practical use, moreover, language usage in the two communities has sometimes shown convergences despite divergent theory.

== Intellectual background ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
One cannot ascribe a single outlook to all Esperantists or all Interlinguists; however, the contrasting views of [[L. L. Zamenhof]] and [[Alexander Gode]] remain influential among Esperantists and Interlinguists, respectively. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, was motivated by several strands of nineteenth-century idealism, ranging from [[Positivism|Comtean positivism]] to utopian [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]. Esperanto, in his view, was a theoretically neutral [[Tool|instrument]] for communication, which could serve as a vehicle for idealistic values, initially Zamenhof's philosophy of ''[[homaranismo]]'', later the ''interna ideo'' (internal idea) of achieving "fraternity and justice among all people" (Zamenhof) through the adoption of Esperanto. Among later Esperantists, this philosophy has tended to reinforce a set of propositions about the language:

* Esperanto's European character is purely accidental; however, some features of Esperanto (and of some western languages) can be found  in non-Western ones.
* Esperanto is, ideally, the universal '''second''' language, replacing all other languages '''in inter-ethnic communication'''; pro-Esperanto arguments tend to assume a future situation of widespread Esperanto use in many situations where English is currently dominant.
* A tension exists between [[finvenkismo]], predicting a 'final victory' (''fina venko'') of Esperanto, and [[Raumism|Raŭmismo]], which considers the 'final victory' too remote a goal.
* Esperanto is a vehicle for a specific internationalist and humanitarian ideology.
* Cultivation of an internal Esperanto culture is an important value for many Esperantists.

By the mid-twentieth century, when Gode led the development of Interlingua, the ideals underlying Esperanto had come to seem naive. Influenced by [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], Gode propounded a Romantic, anti-positivist view of language: languages are an aspect of the culture of a people, not an instrument to achieve a goal; an ideology cannot be attached to a language, except artificially. This implied, in his view, that a world language on the Esperanto model was either impossible or, worse, achievable only through totalitarian coercion. He was of the opinion that, unless imposed by force, a universal global language would presuppose a universal global culture, which does not currently exist and is not necessarily desirable.

On the other hand, Gode saw another sort of international language—non-universal and non-culturally neutral—as being entirely possible.

== Learnability versus comprehensibility ==

Esperanto and Interlingua are fundamentally different in their purposes. Whereas Esperanto is meant to be an international second language able to be fluently learned by speakers of any language, Interlingua is directed more toward European languages, especially its control languages. Though Esperanto may be more neutral as well as easier to master, Esperantists can usually communicate only with other Esperantists, though the language is at least somewhat incomprehensible to many who have not studied it; Interlingua, however, is intended to be understood to some extent by a speaker of any Romance language, because many words in Interlingua resemble their originals in Latin, the precursor to all Romance languages.

== Vocabulary ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
&lt;!-- this paragraph (or another one) should also compare the methods of selecting vocabulary. Zamenhoff basically seems to have gone through and done the same thing the interlingua team did, and the differences should be contrasted and the similarities commented upon. --&gt;
The vocabulary of both languages is taken largely from Romance, Germanic and Slavic languages; most of these words are derived from Latin. Depending on their international form, Germanic and Slavic words in Interlingua may be Latinized; for example, English ''blockade'', German ''Blockade'', Russian ''блокада'' → Interlingua ''blocada''. By comparison, all words in Esperanto take on a characteristic Esperanto form. In this case, the Interlingua ''blocada'' and the Esperanto ''blokado'' are nearly identical and equally neutral.

Though both Esperanto and Interlingua borrow primarily from European languages, they also borrow words from other languages which have become widespread. Two different philosophies have led to two different approaches. Interlingua highly regards etymological fidelity, thus it usually adopts the word that is the ''nearest common ancestor'' of the respective words in at least three source language units (considering Spanish and Portuguese together as one unit). Esperanto highly regards regularity, thus it disregards the form of the word in European languages to make it match Esperanto's morphology and phonemic orthography. For example, Interlingua has ''geisha'' (from Japanese 芸者), ''sheik'' (from Arabic شيخ), and ''kayak'' (from Inuit ᖃᔭᖅ); in Esperanto, these words are written ''gejŝo'', ''ŝejko'', and ''kajako''.

&lt;!-- Esperanto's correlatives or "tabelvortoj" should be discussed here. RESPONSE: Would love to, but need the interlingua equivalents to compare; I'll bring the correlatives up once someone puts the interlingua to compare against, because this section is already more informative about Esperanto than Interlingua, so as to be nearing unbalanced...--&gt; 
In Esperanto, to form a new word, it is generally preferred to compound two or more existing roots than to borrow a word from another language. This is recommended in order to keep the number of "primitive" roots low and thus to maintain its learnability. Interlingua does not have that as a design aim, thus most of its compound and "primitive" (non-compound) words also exist in its source languages.

== Grammar and word formation ==
Both languages have a highly regular grammar without difficult [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] or [[declension]]s. However, Interlingua lacks adjective agreement and case endings, which make its noun and adjective morphology simpler.

Interlingua draws its roots from certain "control languages": French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, German and Russian. It uses these languages as a means to select the words most used in these major European languages. Esperanto draws from largely the same languages, but uses [[agglutination]] more extensively. Rather than using an existing word commonly used among the major European languages, Esperanto forms its own words using its own roots. For example, the Esperanto word for "hospital" is '''mal·san·ul·ej·o''', which breaks down into five roots: '''mal''' (opposite), '''san''' (health), '''ul''' (person), '''ej''' (place), '''o''' (noun). Interlingua tends to use words derived from natural languages instead of extensive agglutination.

The following table illustrates the difference between Esperanto and Interlingua with regards to word formation:

{| 
| '''Esperanto'''
| '''Interlingua'''
| '''English'''
|- 
| '''san'''a
| san
| healthy
|- 
| '''san'''o
| sanitate 
| health
|- 
| mal'''san'''a
| malade 
| sick, unhealthy
|- 
| mal'''san'''o
| maladia 
| malady, illness, disease
|- 
| mal'''san'''ulejo
| hospital 
| hospital
|- 
| '''san'''iĝi
| recovrar 
| to become healthy, recover
|- 
| '''san'''igi
| curar
| to make healthy, cure
|- 
| mal'''san'''iĝi 
| cader malade
| to become sick, fall ill
|}

To the reader who speaks English or a Romance language, the words in the Interlingua column are more likely to appear recognizable. However, speakers of languages that do not have words related to those in the Interlingua column must learn the Interlingua words one at a time; the Esperanto words, however, would be simple to use because of its system of word derivation. This point underlines the fundamental differences between Esperanto and Interlingua: the latter was designed to be easily ''understood'' by speakers of European languages, whereas the former was designed for people to learn to ''speak'' more easily. (Interlingua does have, however, a more regular system of word derivation than many natural languages.)

Often, the European words on which Interlingua is based gain extensive currency in non-Western languages. ''Hospital'', for example, appears in Celtic languages such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, and Breton; Germanic languages such as Dutch, Danish and Afrikaans; Slavic languages such as Ukrainian and Polish; Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi, Urdu and Bengali; Altaic languages such as Mongolian, Turkmen and Azerbaijani; Austronesian languages such as Indonesian, Ilocano, Tagalog, Tetum and Chamorro; African languages such as Swahili, Kongo and Setswana; and creoles and  linguistically isolated languages such as Papiamento, Albanian, Mapunzugun and Basque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/hospital Webster's Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logosdictionary.org/pls/dictionary/new_dictionary.gdic.st?phrase_code=945582 Logos dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; In many other languages, however, the word ''hospital'' is not found, including Finnish, Arabic, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Hungarian.

Both languages attempt to be as precise as possible; that is, each strives to reflect differences in meaning using different words. The Esperanto compound ''mal-san-ul-ej-o'', literally "un-healthy-person-place-noun", implies a place for people who are unhealthy. The word means "hospital", but the compound could be construed as any place where an unhealthy person is. Interlingua's non-compound word, though possibly less neutral, thus avoids any misunderstanding. (Depending on the speaker and audience, Esperanto could also use a different word for "hospital", such as ''hospitalo'', ''kliniko'', ''lazareto'', ''preventorio'' or ''sanatorio''.)

Interlingua and Esperanto have minor differences regarding precisely how agglutinations occur. For example, Interlingua adds tense endings to the indicative form of a verb ('''dona''' → '''donar'''), while Esperanto adds them to the stem ('''don-''' → '''doni''').

==Orthography==
The orthography of Esperanto is inspired by the [[Latin script|Latin alphabets]] of [[Slavic languages]], and  is almost completely phonemic (one sound, one letter).  Interlingua, by contrast, uses an orthography established by its [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and Slavic source languages. Thus, the orthography of Interlingua is much more broad-based than that of Esperanto. The procedure used sometimes favored English and the Romance languages, however, resulting in a little less phonemicity and a little more familiarity to speakers of those languages.

For example, the Esperanto ''kontakto'' and the Interlingua ''contacto'' mean the same thing and are pronounced the same, but are written differently, because the orthography of Esperanto is simpler: one sound, one letter. Interlingua occasionally departs from this rule, chiefly because the letters "c" and "g" have hard and soft sounds. Such details make Interlingua more difficult to learn and speak for people who are unfamiliar with English and the Romance languages, but at the same time easier to read and understand for speakers of Romance or Romance-influenced languages: the letters show the history of the Romance influence. The difference, however, is minimal.

The use of diacritics in Esperanto historically made it more difficult to type on standard typewriters and older computers; since support for Unicode has become widespread, this is less of an issue, but still may require some setup tweaks for users who don't otherwise use a language with diacritics. Alternately, a widely accepted standard is to signify the letters with diacritics by simply typing the letter "x," which is not part of its alphabet, after the affected letter. On the other hand, Interlingua uses only the basic Latin alphabet, with no diacritics.

==Expressiveness==
Supporters of Interlingua note that their language not only conserves the natural aspect of Western languages, but also their rich, subtle treasury of meanings. Interlingua flows regularly from its Romance, Germanic, and Slavic source languages, and thus it possesses their expressiveness.

Esperanto supporters contend that, by its liberal use of affixes and its flexible word-order, is equally as expressive as Interlingua or indeed any natural language, but is more internationally neutral. While acknowledging that Esperanto is a product of rational construction, not historical evolution, they argue that, after the prolonged usage of more than 100 years, it too has become a living human language.

==Number of speakers==
Although no [[census]] has ever been undertaken, Esperanto speakers frequently place their numbers at somewhere between 100,000 and 3 million speakers. The number of Interlingua speakers is generally estimated between a few hundred and 1,500. Esperanto is the only constructed language with [[Native Esperanto speakers|native speakers]], numbering 200-2000 according to ''[[Ethnologue]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=epo Ethnologue report for language code:epo]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''DC vs. Marvel Comics''''' (issues #2–3 titled '''''Marvel Comics vs. DC''''') was a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] [[intercompany crossover|crossover]] published by [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]] from April to May 1996. The series was written by [[Ron Marz]] and [[Peter David]], with art by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[Claudio Castellini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 272 |quote = Written by Peter David and Ron Marz with art by Dan Jurgens and Claudio Castellini, this four-issue miniseries event consisted of five major battles voted on in advance by reader ballotdistributed to comic stores.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Two godly brothers who personify the [[DC Universe|DC]] and [[Marvel Universe]]s become aware of the other's existence, and challenge one another to a series of [[duels]] involving each universe's respective superheroes. The losing universe would cease to exist. The story had an "out of universe" component in that the outcomes of primary battles were determined by readers voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/dc-vs-marvel |title=DC Vs Marvel – Universe-Shattering Comic Book Crossovers |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2013-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102174650/http://www.ugo.com/the-goods/dc-vs-marvel |archivedate=2013-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous smaller, story-driven skirmishes occur throughout the series, not counted with the primary duels meant to determine the outcome between the brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://secretearths.blogspot.com/2006/05/dc-versus-marvel-dcmarvel-where-dc.html |title=Secret Wars on Infinite Earths: DC versus Marvel |publisher= |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were eleven battles fought between the two universes:
*'''[[Aquaman]]''' (DC) vs. [[Namor]] (Marvel). Aquaman wins by summoning a whale to leap out of the water and land on Namor.  Since Namor is pinned and unable to move, he is declared the loser.
*'''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Catwoman]] (DC). Elektra won by cutting off Catwoman's whip as she hung from a girder on a building under construction, but Catwoman survived by falling into a dumpster filled with sand.
*'''[[Wally West|Flash]]''' (DC) vs. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (Marvel). The Flash wins using superior speed.
*'''[[Tim Drake|Robin]]''' (DC) vs. [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] (Marvel). Robin won by using his cape as a decoy and then tying up Jubilee.
*'''[[Silver Surfer]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern]] (DC). Silver Surfer won when both collided with each other and released a huge explosion which knocked out Green Lantern but left Silver Surfer unfazed.
*'''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (DC). Thor won when Captain Marvel was forced to change back to his alter ego Billy. Billy tried to change back, but Thor used Mjolnir to intercept the lightning-bolt that would have transformed him back to normal, the resulting impact knocked Billy out and sent Thor's hammer flying off.
*'''[[Superman]]''' (DC) vs. [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (Marvel). After exchanging punches and a burst of heat-vision, Superman wins eventually. 
*'''[[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] (DC). With the advantage of his spider-sense, Spider-Man wins by tying up Superboy with impact webbing and electrocuting him with high voltage.
*'''[[Batman]]''' (DC) vs. [[Captain America]] (Marvel). The match ends in uncertainty—though both are evenly matched after hours of combat, a sudden flushing of the sewer knocks Cap off balance as Batman manages to strike him with a Batarang. Batman rescues Cap from certain death via drowning, but Cap's unconsciousness from nearly drowning causes him to lose.
*'''[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] (DC). Wolverine beats Lobo in a brutal barfight which was largely off panel.
*'''[[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]]''' (Marvel) vs. [[Wonder Woman]] (DC). After Diana drops Thor's hammer in order to allow the fight to happen as it was intended, Storm wins the battle after repeatedly hitting Diana with her lightning after a brief melee encounter.

Although the fight ends with the apparent "victory" of Marvel, the new entity of [[Access (comics)|Access]], a being capable of traversing the two universes, infuses Batman and Captain America with fragments of the true universes before the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]] and the [[Living Tribunal]] attempt to create a compromise by fusing the two universes together. This resulted in the publication of the [[Amalgam Comics|twelve-issue ''Amalgam'' universe]], which sees various amalgamated versions of the heroes and villains acting as though they have been in existence for years.

Access is eventually able to find Dark Claw and Super-Soldier - versions of Batman and Captain America who have been 'amalgamated' with Wolverine and Superman respectively - and use the essence of the original universe in them to return the universes to normal. As the Brothers engage in direct battle, the Spectre and the Living Tribunal attempt to stop the conflict, but Batman and Captain America convince Access to take them to the conflict as well. Witnessing the minds of Batman and Captain America as they try to stop the fight, the Brothers realize that the two men are essentially the brothers in miniature, each one unique among their worlds, but with no interest in the conflict that the brothers have engaged in. Acknowledging the pointlessness of their conflict, the Brothers withdraw.

==Collection edition==
The series was collected into a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] titled ''DC versus Marvel Comics'' (collects mini-series and ''[[Doctor Strangefate (comic book)|Doctor Strangefate]]'' #1; 163 pages; September 1996; {{ISBN|1-56389-294-4}}).

'''''Daemonologie'''''—in full '''''Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Books: By the High and Mighty Prince, James &amp;c.'''''—was written and published in 1597&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=G. Blakemore|last1=Evans|title=The Riverside Shakespeare|date=1997|publisher=Mifflin|location=Boston [u.a.]|page=1356|edition=2|isbn=0-395-75490-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]] (later also [[James_VI_and_I#Accession_in_England|James I of England]]) as a [[Medieval philosophy|philosophical dissertation]] on contemporary [[necromancy]] and the historical relationships between the various methods of [[divination]] used from ancient [[black magic]]. This included a study on [[demonology]] and the methods demons used to bother troubled men while touching on topics such as [[werewolves]] and [[vampire]]s. It was a political yet theological statement to educate a misinformed populace on the history, practices and implications of [[Magic_(paranormal)#Witchcraft|sorcery]] and the [[Witch_trials_in_the_early_modern_period#Peak_of_the_trials:_1580.E2.80.931630|reasons for persecuting a person in a Christian society]] accused of being a witch under the rule of [[canonical law]]. This book is believed to be one of the main sources used by [[William Shakespeare]] in the production of ''[[Macbeth]]''. Shakespeare attributed many quotes and rituals found within the book directly to the [[Three Witches|Weird Sisters]], yet also attributed the Scottish themes and settings referenced from the trials in which King James was involved.

==Structure==
King James wrote a dissertation titled ''Daemonologie'' that was first sold in 1597, several years prior to the first publication of the King James [[King James Version|Authorized Version]] of the Bible. Within three short books James wrote a philosophical dissertation in the form of a [[Socratic dialogue]] for the purpose of making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery and witchcraft, but wrote also his [[Classification of demons]]. In writing the book, King James was heavily influenced by his personal involvement in the [[North Berwick witch trials]] from 1590. Following the execution of a notorious sorcerer in the year 1591, the news of the trials was narrated in a news pamphlet titled ''[[Newes from Scotland]]'' and was included as the final chapter of the text. The book endorses the practice of [[Witch-hunt|witch hunting]] in a Christian society. James begins the book: &lt;blockquote&gt;The fearefull aboundinge at this time in this countrie, of these detestable slaves of [[devil|the Devil]], the Witches or [[enchanter (paranormal)|enchanters]], hath moved me (beloved reader) to dispatch in post, this following treatise of mine (...) to resolve the doubting (...) both that such assaults of [[Satan]] are most certainly practised, and that the instrument thereof merits most severely to be punished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As detailed in his preface, the main sources of this work were that of historically confessed witches, judicial case history and the Bible itself, although he also amassed various dissertations on magical studies to expand his education on the relationships between infernal spirits and men. James generally sought to prove that the devilish arts have always been yet still are, but also explains the justification of a witch trial and the punishments which a practitioner of the dark arts merits. He also reasons scholastically what kinds of things are possible in the performance of these arts, and the natural causes of the Devil's power with the use of philosophical reasoning.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; King James sought to prove the existence of witchcraft to other Christians through biblical teachings. As such, his work is separated into three books based on the different arguments the philosophers discuss, with citations of biblical scripture throughout the text.

===Characters===
This work acts as a [[political]] and [[theology|theological]] dissertation in the form of a [[philosophy|philosophical]] dialogue between the characters [[Philomath]]es and [[Epistemology|Epistemon]] who debate the various topics of magic, sorcery, witchcraft and demonology. The purpose seems to be an educational piece on the study of witchcraft and to inform the public about the histories and etymologies of all subcategories involved in magical practices. The work also serves to make formal accusations against the practice of witchcraft and comparatively elaborates James' views against [[papistry]]. In the preface, King James states that he chose to write the content in the form of a dialogue to better entertain the reader. By doing so, he follows the method of many philosophical writers prior to his time. As the main plot, Philomathes hears news in the kingdom regarding the rumors of witchcraft which seems all miraculous and amazing but could find no one knowledgeable on the matter to have a serious political discussion on the issue. He finds a philosopher named Epistemon who is very knowledgeable on the topics of theology.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. x-xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book One===
The argument of the first book is on the following topics regarding the description of Magic: 
* The division of the various magical arts with a comparison between [[Necromancy]] and witchcraft
* The use of charms, circles and conjurations
* The division of [[Astrology]]
* The Devil's contract with man
* Comparisons between the miracles of God and the devil
* The purpose of these practices

===Book Two===
The main argument of the second book is based on the following topics regarding the description of Sorcery and Witchcraft:
* The difference between biblical proof and imagination or myth
* A description of Sorcery and its comparison with Witchcraft 
* The path of a sorcerer's apprenticeship
* Curses and the roles of Satan
* The appearance of devils; the times and forms which they appear
* The division of witch actions
* Methods of transportation and the illusions of Satan

===Book Three===
The third book is the conclusion of the whole Dialogue. Here, King James provides a description of all these kinds of Spirits and [[Apparitional experience|Specters]] that trouble men or women. His [[Classification of demons]] was not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles but rather categorized them based on 4 methods used by any given devil to cause mischief or torment on a living individual or a deceased corpse. He quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying arrays of purposes as well. In his description of them, he relates that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without permission, further illustrating how demonic forces are used as a "Rod of Correction" when men stray from the will of God and may be commissioned by witches, or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others but will ultimately only conduct works that will end in the further glorification of God despite their attempts to do otherwise.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonic forces were described as follows:
* [[Lemures|Spectra]]: Used to describe spirits that trouble houses or solitary places&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Obsession: Used to describe spirits that follow upon certain people to outwardly trouble them at various times of the day. Referencing [[Incubi]] and [[Succubae]]&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Demonic possession|Possession]]: Used to describe spirits that enter inwardly into a person to trouble them.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Faries]]: Used to describe illusionary spirits that prophesy, consort, and transport their servants.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Daemonologie. A Critical Edition. In Modern English. 2016|isbn=1-5329-6891-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newes from Scotland===
{{further|John Fian|North Berwick witch trials}}

'''''Newes from Scotland - declaring the damnable life and death of Dr. Fian, a notable sorcerer''''' is a pamphlet originally printed in London in 1591 that details the infamous [[North Berwick witch trials]] in [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and the confessions given before the King.

[[File:North Berwick Witches.png|thumb|Suspected witches kneeling before King James; ''Daemonologie'' (1597)]]

The initial and subsequent publications of ''Daemonologie'' included a previously published news pamphlet detailing the accounts of the North Berwick witch trials that involved King James himself as he acted as judge over the proceedings. The deputy bailiff to the kingdom of Scotland, David Seaton, had a servant named Geillis Duncan who, within a short period of time, was found to have miraculously helped any who were troubled or grieved with sickness or infirmity.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; David Seaton examined her as a witch and obtained a confession that caused the apprehension of several others&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; later declared to be notorious witches. Agnis Tompson confessed before King James to have attempted his assassination using witchcraft on more than one occasion. The pamphlet details how she attempted these. She also participated in a [[sabbat]] during [[Halloween|All Hallows' Eve]]&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; as her and others sacrificed a cat and sent it into the sea as they chanted in hopes of summoning a tempest to sink a fleet of ships accompanying James as he was arriving in the port of Leith from a trip to Norway. One ship was sunk from the storm containing gifts meant for the [[Anne of Denmark|Queen of Scotland]] but the others including the ship transporting King James were unharmed.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Fian|Doctor Fian]] was deemed a notable sorcerer and was among many others that were apprehended in the trials. The pamphlet details their reasons for conducting sorcery, the methods used, how each of the witches were apprehended and the torture methods used in their punishments and death. The case of Doctor Fian follows his [[Deal with the devil|compact with Satan]], a conflict he had with another witch who sabotaged an enchantment meant for her daughter,&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; his examinations during the trial, the torture he endured, his escape and subsequent execution.

==Cultural significance==
It has been noted that the themes taken from ''Daemonologie'' and King James' involvement in the North Berwick witch trials may have directly contributed to [[Shakespeare]]'s work ''[[Macbeth]]''. Evidence of this exists in the three witches use of ritual magic and direct quotes that directly relate to the testimony given from the witch trials described in the Newes of Scotland pamphlet. Macbeth had come into public enjoyment a few years after the publication of ''Daemonologie'' and retains many of the same Scottish themes and settings.

''Daemonologie'' assisted in the creation of witchcraft reform, heavily inspiring [[Richard Bernard]] in writing a manual on witch-finding in 1629 titled, ''[[A Guide to Grand-Jury Men]]'' which advised judicial trial procedure to take a stronger investigative approach to acquiring and analyzing evidence and obtaining witnesses to be present during witch-craft trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=Richard|title=''[[A Guide to Grand-Jury Men]]''|date=1627|isbn=1542697077|page=iv-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an influence on [[Matthew Hopkins]] in his work as a witch-finder between 1644 and 1646 in which an estimated 300 witches were tried and executed. In the year of Hopkins' death, 1647, he published ''The Discovery of Witches'' which directly cited ''Daemonologie'' as a source for creating methods in discovering a witch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hopkins|first1=Matthew|title=The Discovery of Witches|date=1647|location=Query 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical arguments King James poses through the character Epistemon are based on concepts of theological reasoning regarding society's belief as his opponent, Philomathes, takes a philosophical stance on society's legal aspects but sought to obtain the knowledge of Epistemon. This philosophical approach signified as a [[philomath]] seeking to obtain greater knowledge through [[epistemology]], a term that was later coined by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrier|first1=J. F.|title=Institutions of Metaphysic: The Theory of Knowing and Being|date=1854|location=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, 2007|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. x-xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnocentrism''' is the act of judging another culture based on preconceptions that are found in values and standards of one's own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SkSfAAAACAAJ|title=Thinking like an Anthropologist: A practical introduction to Cultural Anthropology|author=John T. Omohundro|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-319580-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A dictionary of psychology|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0192806321|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnocentric behavior involves judging other groups relative to the preconceptions of one's own ethnic group or culture, especially regarding [[language]], behavior, customs, and [[religion]]. These aspects or categories are distinctions that define each [[ethnicity]]'s unique [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LP9bIrZ9xacC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society|author=Margaret L. Andersen, Howard Francis Taylor|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2006|isbn=978-0-534-61716-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Graham Sumner|William G. Sumner]] defined ethnocentrism as "the technical name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it." He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, belief in one's own group's superiority, and contempt for outsiders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sumner, W. G. ''Folkways''. New York: Ginn, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may occur from the dividing of societies into in-groups and out-groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammond, Axelrod|first=Ross A., Robert|date=December 2006|title=The Evolution of Ethnocentrism|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume= 50|issue=6|pages=926–936|doi=10.1177/0022002706293470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnocentrism is explained in the social sciences and genetics. In anthropology, [[cultural relativism]] is used as an antithesis and antonym to ethnocentrism.&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins20093"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmvJ1XtnIQoC&amp;pg=PA159|title=The Essence of Anthropology|author1=William A.

==  Origins of the concept ==
The term "ethnocentrism" was coined by [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]&lt;ref&gt;Naturalism in Sociology of the Turn of the Century (by Alexander Hofman and Alexander Kovalev) // A History of Classical Sociology. Ed. by [[Igor Kon]]. Moscow, 1989, p. 84. {{ISBN|5-01-001102-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Bizumic  (Research School of Psychology, the Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia). [http://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/264/html Who Coined the Concept of Ethnocentrism? A Brief Report] // [[Journal of Social and Political Psychology]], 2014, Vol. 2(1), {{doi|10.5964/jspp.v2i1.264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently employed by [[William G. Sumner]]. Gumplowicz defined ethnocentrism as the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past&lt;ref&gt;Louis Gumplowicz. La lutte des races. Recherches sociologiques (Guillaumin et Cie., Paris, 1893), p 349. (Cited from: Naturalism in Sociology of the Turn of the Century (by Alexander Hofman and Alexander Kovalev) // A History of Classical Sociology. Ed. by [[Igor Kon]]. Moscow, 1989, p. 84. {{ISBN|5-01-001102-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; (Der Rassenkampf, 1883). 

==Characteristics==
Although central to anthropology, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines the concept of ethnocentrism has been defined and characterized so variously that some scholars have spoken of the "disutility of the ethnocentrism concept" and have wondered whether from the large body of research on ethnocentrism any conclusions could be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Bizumic and John Duckitt, "What Is and Is Not Ethnocentrism? A Conceptual Analysis and Political Implications," ''Political Psychology'', Vol. 33, No. 6 (DECEMBER 2012), pp. 887-909 {{jstor|23324197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Graham Sumner proposed two different definitions.  In the 1906 ''Folkways'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3E8TAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=folkways&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQpcjo1YHeAhWP14MKHT36AqAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=folkways&amp;f=false|title=Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals|first=William Graham|last=Sumner|date=20 November 2018|publisher=Ginn|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sumner stated that "ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it" (13). In the 1911 ''War and Other Essays'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc81TuuKB54C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=war+and+other+essays&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR5r2J1oHeAhVK9YMKHTjrBosQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=war+and+other+essays&amp;f=false|title=War, and Other Essays|first=William Graham|last=Sumner|date=20 November 2018|publisher=Yale University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote that "the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism" (11).

Forty years later, anthropologist Richard Adams undertook to clear up a confusion.  He noted that one scholar, G.P. Murdock, defined ethnocentrism as "the tendency to exalt the in-group and to depreciate other groups," which made out-group antagonism the inevitable concomitant of in-group solidarity, but that another, M. J. Herkovits, defined ethnocentrism as "the point of view that one's way of life is to be preferred to all others." He pointed out that these were two different attitudes, and that it was important to distinguish them. The first is in-group consciousness, a sense of communal interests found even in sub-human animals, but the second arises from the processes of socialization and enculturation, and has no counterpart among sub-human groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Adams,"Ethnocentrism and Ingroup Consciousness," ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 53, No. 4, Part 1 (Oct. - Dec., 1951), pp.598-600. {{jstor|664284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Robert K. Merton]] commented that "although the practice of seeing one's own group as the center of things is empirically correlated with a belief in superiority, centrality and superiority need to be kept analytically distinct in order to deal with patterns of alienation from one's membership group and contempt for it."&lt;ref name="MertonSztompka19963"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQWgLH1fZ2EC&amp;pg=PA248|title=On social structure and science|author1=Robert King Merton|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-226-52070-4|editor=[[Piotr Sztompka]]|page=248|authorlink=Robert K. Merton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People raised in a particular culture that absorb the values and behaviors of that culture will develop a worldview that considers their own culture to be the norm.&lt;ref name="Seidner19823"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ncela.us/rcd/bibliography/BE012786|title=Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective|last1=Seidner|first1=Stanley S.|date=1982|publisher=Centre de Recherche sur le Plurilinguisme|location=Bruxelles|language=English|oclc=51685367|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelfand|first=Michele|date=2015|title=The Inevitability of Ethnocentrism Revisited: Ethnocentrism Diminishes As Mobility Increases|pmc=4672305|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|pages=17963|via=PMC|doi=10.1038/srep17963|pmid=26644192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If people then experience other cultures that have different values and behaviors, they will find that the thought patterns appropriate to their native culture are not appropriate for the new cultures.  However, since people are accustomed to their native culture, it can be difficult for them to see the behaviors of people from a different culture from the viewpoint of that culture rather than from their own.&lt;ref name="Seidner19823" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~anthkb/ethnocen.htm|title=Ethnocentrism|last=Barger|first=Ken|date=February 14, 2018|website=Indiana University Indianapolis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocentrism can be explicit or implicit. Explicit ethnocentrism involves the ability to express the feelings about outsiders (people from other groups), and implicit ethnocentrism refers to the inhibition of the feelings for outsiders.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnocentrism."

== Anthropology ==
Anthropology in the 19th-century had been committed to using evolution as a methodological framework in which European society and culture represented the apex of human development, and all non-European societies and their cultures were described and ranked according to the degree to which they had developed a monotheistic religion, science, technology, and so on. Franz Boas committed himself to overthrowing 19th-century evolutionism, and with his methodological innovations sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. &lt;ref name="proquest.com"&gt;[https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/bualumni-ebooks/reader.action?docID=3440450&amp;ppg=446 Thomas Hylland Eriksen, ''Small Places, Large Issues:  An Introduction to Social and Cultural Anthropology'', 4th edition, London: Pluto Press, 2015, pp.10-18]&lt;/ref&gt;  Boas wrote:

:It is somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has been controlling all our actions from the time of our birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, which are of no less value than ours, although it may be impossible for us to appreciate their values without having grown up under their influence.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mind of Primitive Man'', New York: Macmillan. 1911:207&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boas and his colleagues promulgated the principle that there are no inferior races or cultures. Cultural relativism in anthropology is a methodological principle, indispensable for investigating and comparing societies in as unprejudiced way as possible without using a developmental scale that is usually irrelevant.&lt;ref name="proquest.com"/&gt;  
  
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] such as [[Franz Boas]] and [[Bronislaw Malinowski]] argued that any human science had to transcend the ethnocentrism of the scientist.  Both urged anthropologists to conduct [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] [[Field work|fieldwork]] in order to overcome their ethnocentrism.  Boas developed the principle of [[cultural relativism]] where the "context" plays an important role to the understanding of other people's values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howson|first=Alexandra|date=2009|title=Cultural Relativism|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/uploads/imported/thisTopic-dbTopic-1247.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=1, 2|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Malinowski developed the theory of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] as guides for producing non-ethnocentric studies of different cultures. Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' (1928), Malinowski's ''[[The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia]]'' (1929), and [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[Ruth Benedict#Patterns of Culture|Patterns of Culture]]'' (1934). (Mead and Benedict were two of Boas's students.)

Examples of ethnocentrism include [[religiocentric]] constructs claiming a [[divine]] association like "divine nation", "[[God's Own Country]]", "[[God's Chosen People]]", and "God's Promised Land".&lt;ref name="HavilandPrins20093"/&gt; Although this may be seen as classic examples, a study published by Brill showed that religious attitudes do not effect on negative out-group attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and Ethnocentrism: An Empirical-theological Study|last=Capucao|first=Dave|publisher=Brill|year=2010|isbn=9789004184701|location=|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Precarious Life'', [[Judith Butler]] discusses recognizing the Other in order to sustain the Self and the problems of not being able to identify the Other. Butler writes:

:Identification always relies upon a difference that it seeks to overcome, and that its aim is accomplished only by reintroducing the difference it claims to have vanquished. The one with whom I identify is not me, and that "not being me" is the condition of the identification. Otherwise, as Jacqueline Rose reminds us, identification collapses into identity, which spells the death of identification itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXj3rCh9zRwC|title=Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=2004|publisher=Verso|isbn=9781844675449|location=New York|pages=145–146|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are generally agreed that Boas developed his revolutionary ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant.  Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant’s monumental ''Critique of Pure Reason''.  In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests.  Following Kant, Boas pointed out, for instance, the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs,would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values (''The Mind of Primitive Man'', New York: Macmillan, 1911:126). &lt;ref&gt;Janine Hitchens, “Critical Implications of Franz Boas’ Theory and Methodology,” ''Dialectical Anthropology'', 19 (1994), p. 244. {{jstor|29790560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumer ethnocentrism ===
[[Consumer ethnocentrism]] refers to the preference of buying products from one's own country with the purpose of protecting the economy and the jobs of people in the country. It involves the brand and quality of the products. In order to measure the levels of a consumer's ethnocentric tendencies, the CETSACALE was created and used for many countries and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimp|first1=Terence|last2=Sharma|first2=Shubhash|year=1987|title=Consumer Ethnocentrism: Construction and Validation of the CETSCALE|url=http://iba8010kelly.alliant.wikispaces.net/file/view/session+3+marketing-2.pdf|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=24|issue=3|pages=280–289|doi=10.2307/3151638|jstor=3151638|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.8599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Causes ==

There is no broad consensus as to the cause of ethnocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galerace/prejudice/0?institutionId=6086|title="Prejudice." Encyclopedia of Race and Racism|last=Forbes|first=H.D.|date=2013|website=CREDO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various areas of social and biological science have developed theories as to how ethnocentrism works. The [[social identity approach]] to psychology suggests that ethnocentricity is caused by a strong identification with one's own culture that links one's self-esteem to a positive view of that culture. It's theorized that in order to maintain that positive view, people make [[Social comparison theory|social comparisons]] that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.&lt;ref&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. (2001). An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In M. A. Hogg &amp; D. Abrams (Eds.), Key readings in social psychology. Intergroup relations: Essential readings (pp. 94-109). New York, NY, US: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published by [[PNAS]] (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America) suggested that ethnocentrism may be mediated by the [[oxytocin]] hormone. It was found that in [[randomized controlled trial]]s "oxytocin creates intergroup bias because oxytocin motivates [[in-group favoritism]] and, to a lesser extent, out-group derogation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Dreu|first1=C.

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[Kin selection|genetic theory]]."&lt;ref name="Dawkins20062"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=go0e5sBRznYC&amp;pg=PA99|title=The selfish gene|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-929115-1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=R. A.|last2=Axelrod|first2=R.|year=2006|title=The Evolution of Ethnocentrism|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=50|issue=6|pages=926–936|doi=10.1177/0022002706293470|pmc=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Hartshorn, Artem Kaznatcheev and Thomas Shultz, [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/16/3/7.html "The Evolutionary Dominance of Ethnocentric Cooperation"] Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 30 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Realistic conflict theory]] assumes that ethnocentrism happens due to "real or perceived conflict" in between groups. This also happens with new members of a group where the dominant group may perceive the new ones as a threat.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

[[File:Eyeofneedle.jpg|50px|thumb|Eye of a needle]]
[[File:Johann-Vogel-Meditationes-emblematicae-de-restaurata-pace-Germaniae MGG 1013.tif|thumb|A [[dromedary camel]] passing through the eye of a needle, as a symbol of the improbable [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Engraving, Johann Vogel: ''Meditationes emblematicae de restaurata pace Germaniae'', 1649.]]
The term "'''eye of a needle'''" is used as a metaphor for a very narrow opening. It occurs several times throughout the [[Talmud]]. The [[New Testament]] quotes Jesus as saying that "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God".

The eye of a sewing needle is the part formed into a loop for pulling thread, located at the end opposite from the point.

==Aphorisms==

===Judaism===
The [[Babylonian Talmud]] applies the [[aphorism]] to unthinkable thoughts. To explain that dreams reveal the thoughts of a man's heart, the product of reason rather than the absence of it, some [[rabbis]] say:
:They do not show a man a palm tree of gold, nor an elephant going through the eye of a needle.&lt;ref&gt;B.T. ''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]]'' 55b&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Midrash]] on the [[Song of Songs]] uses the phrase to speak of God's willingness and ability beyond comparison, to accomplish the salvation of a sinner:
:The Holy One said, open for me a door as big as a needle's eye and I will open for you a door through which may enter tents and [camels?].&lt;ref name=camel&gt;{{cite web|title='The camel and the eye of the needle', Matthew 19:24, Mark 10:25, Luke 18:25|url=http://www.biblicalhebrew.com/nt/camelneedle.htm|work=Hebrew New Testament Studies|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rav Sheishet of [[Nehardea]] applies the same aphorism to the convoluted reasoning for which the sages of [[Pumbedita]] were evidently famous: "Are you from Pumbedita, where they push an elephant through the eye of a needle?" ([[Baba Metzia]], 38b).

===Christianity===
[[File:IMG 8924-Bonifatius-Kirche.JPG|thumb|A church portal relief in Dortmund referencing Jesus's use of "camel through the eye of a needle" aphorism.]]
{{main|Jesus and the rich young man}}
"The eye of a needle" is scripture quoting [[Jesus]] recorded in the [[synoptic gospels]]:

:I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” {{bibleverse-lb||Matthew|19:23-26|NIV}}
Parallel versions appear in {{bibleverse-lb||Mark|10:24-27|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse-lb||Luke|18:24-27|NIV}}.

The saying was a response to a [[Jesus and the rich young man|young rich man]] who had asked Jesus what he needed to do in order to inherit eternal life. Jesus replied that he should keep the commandments, to which the man stated he had done. Jesus responded, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." The young man became sad and was unwilling to do this. Jesus then spoke this response, leaving his disciples astonished.

[[Cyril of Alexandria]] (fragment 219) claimed that "camel" is a Greek misspelling; that ''kamêlos'' (camel) was written in place of ''kamilos'', meaning "rope" or "cable".&lt;ref name=camel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Akademie-Verlag| last = Reuss| first = Joseph| title = Matthäus-Kommentare aus der griechischen Kirche| location = Berlin| date = 1957 |page=226 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Matthew 14-28 |last=Simonetti |first=Manlio |date=2002 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |isbn=978-0-8308-1469-5 |location=Downers Grove, Ill. |language=en |oclc=47443858 |quote=By “camel” here he means not the living thing, the beast of burden, but the thick rope to which sailors tie their anchors. He shows this comparison to be not entirely pointless (as a camel would be), but he makes it an exceedingly difficult matter; in fact, next to impossible.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[George Lamsa]], in his [[Lamsa Bible#Matthew 19:24|1933 translation of the Bible]] into English from the Syriac, claimed this as well.

[[ Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Volume 1, § 68, quoted Matthew 19:24. "Es ist leichter, daß ein Ankertau durch ein Nadelöhr gehe, denn daß ein Reicher ins Reich Gottes komme." This is translated into English as "It is easier for an anchor cable to go through an eye of a needle than for a rich person to come to God’s kingdom."

In modern times, the scripture has been used as a counterargument to the ''[[Prosperity theology|prosperity gospel]]'', the belief that accruing wealth is a virtue favored by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Wealth, wages, and the wealthy: New testament insight for preachers and teachers |last=Collins |first=Raymond F. |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=2017 |isbn=978-0-8146-8785-7 |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |page=282 |oclc=983796136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Blessed: A history of the American prosperity gospel |last=Bowler |first=Kate |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-087673-9 |location=New York |page=9 |oclc=1005124050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gate====
The "Eye of the Needle" has been claimed to be a gate in [[Jerusalem]], which opened after the main gate was closed at night. A camel could only pass through this smaller gate if it was stooped and had its baggage removed. This story has been put forth since at least the 15th century, and possibly as far back as the 9th century. However, there is no widely accepted evidence for the existence of such a gate.&lt;ref name=Rozienkow&gt;Егор Розенков, ''Верблюд и игольное ушко'' // Духовный вестник высшей школы, № 8 (24), 01.09.2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Morris | first = Leon | title = The Gospel according to Matthew | publisher = [[William B.

===Islam===
According to the English interpretation of the [[Quran]]:
:To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle: Such is Our reward for those in sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.com/7/40 Al-Araf (The Heights) 7:40] , [http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-7/verse-40/ Quran Surah Al-A'raaf ( Verse 40 )]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12389">'''The house of Finnigans''' was a British luxury luggage and trunk maker established in [[1830]], originally in [[Manchester]] and later in [[New Bond Street]] in [[London]]. The house of Finnigans was once one of the finest British leather goods maker and a successful luxury goods retailer. Renown for its traditional know-how and craftsmanship, Finnigans manufactured and produced a wide range of luxury products, including trunks, bags, fashion, jewelry, timepieces and silverware.

}}

== Early life of Brian Finnigan ==
Finnigans was founded by Brian Finnigan, an Irishman proudly claiming descent from [[Brian Boru]], the charismatic king of [[History of Ireland (800–1169)|Ireland in the high Middle Ages]]. He was the son of a seafarer, who spent summer months sailing off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], where he hunted whale and seal in Arctic waters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/463631126|title=Knock on any door|last=Peter|first=Finnigan|publisher=Melrose Books|year=2009|isbn=9781906561567|location=Ely|pages=xiii-xv|oclc=463631126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, Brian Finnigan apprenticed to his father’s friend and former sailing partner, Reuben Farrel, who then made leather goods in [[Liverpool]], especially bags and trunks. These durable and weatherproof luggage were particularly adapted to the long and tedious journeys of that time. Both Reuben Farrel and Brian Finnigan moved to [[Manchester]] as it developed into a prosperous city with the boom of the cotton industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mancunian origins ==
In 1830, Brian Finnigan established a house on his own, the house of Finnigans. He opened a workshop in Newton Street Mill,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/tours/tour11/area11page34.html|title=The Wentwood Apartments|last=|first=|date=|website=Manchester History|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Finnigans shop in [[Market Street, Manchester|Market Street]], then Manchester most fashionable area. Finnigans soon became famous for its high quality leather goods and saddlery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Particularly timely, the opening of the shop coincided with the beginning of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] and [[Stephenson's Rocket|Robert Stephenson’s Rocket]], the world’s first steam passenger railway, which increased demand for travel goods. Finnigans devised a special range of items for railway travel like the “Lady Train Case”, with a jewelry tray and enough room for a woman’s travelling wardrobe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From then on, the house relentlessly innovated to adapt its travel goods to the new means of transportation from the railway to the automobile, and later air travel.

As picnicking became a fashionable outdoor activity, Finnigans elaborated the “Wicker Picnic Basket”, which was popular not only among English travelers, but also Indian Rajahs who strapped them on the backs of elephants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Expansion and advertising ==
In 1851, Finnigans gained international recognition when the house won a gold medal for craftsmanship at [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]]’s [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] at the Crystal Palace, thereby spreading Finnigans’ reputation even wider.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

By 1855, Finnigans had branched out, and now advertised as a trunk and portmanteau manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://specialcollections.le.ac.uk/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16445coll4|title=Slater's Directory of Manchester &amp; Salford|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its range of items constantly increased to include new items that were adapted to the new means of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Aid to the Traveler in Europe|last=|first=|publisher=The Stuyvesant Co|year=1922|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such item was the “Treble Folding Portmanteau” so constructed that the compartments were accessible at once and entirely distinct from each other, “rendering it unnecessary for luggage being disturbed or moved in passing through the customs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Finnigans' commercial|last=|first=|date=1874|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house’s growth led to the opening of new premises at Piccadilly and [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Street]], in addition to its original location at [[Market Street, Manchester|Market Street]], [[Manchester]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

William Finnigan, who embodied the second generation of the family business, built on his father’s business and was the man behind the company’s diversification and commercial success. He took over when Brian Finnigan passed away in 1868.

== Expanding to New Bond Street in London and Liverpool ==
In 1879, William Finnigan opened a Finnigans shop at [[Bond Street|New Bond Street]] in [[London]]. Soon, American millionaires such as the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], the [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]] and the [[Ford family tree|Fords]] joined the house’s customer base. Opposite Finnigans on Bond Street was [[Asprey]]: the two houses enjoyed a friendly rivalry that led to fruitful commercial developments. Still specializing in leather and saddlery, Finnigans also sold clocks, watches, and silverware.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Their London other addresses were [[Clifford Street]], Coach &amp; Horses Yard, [[Old Burlington Street]] while their London works were at 6-10 Lexington Street, W1.

Finnigans also had stores in [[Liverpool]] at 32 Bold Street and 37-41 [[Dale Street]].

By the end of the century, the Manchester premises also grew too exiguous, and Finnigans moved to a more spacious building in [[Deansgate]]. With the department store [[Kendals]] at one end and Finnigans at the other, Deansgate became Manchester’s main shopping street. The Deansgate store later enlarged to encompass Finnigan’s galleries, including a sports department, fashion and menswear, as well as beauty products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Entering modernity ==
As the use of both personal and professional staff declined, the need for more lightweight luggage arose. Additionally, the use of motor car travel and the individual liberalization of travel were partly responsible for a new generation of luggage.

Portability became Finnigans’ priority. In 1909, Finnigans advertised cases that were strong and resistant yet “so light you can easily carry one yourself and thus retain your jewellery and valuables under your own control.” In 1912, Finnigans also commercialized a “Lady’s Motor Hand Bag,” both lightweight and fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Finnigans's commercial|last=|first=|date=6 July 1912|work=The Illustrated London|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finnigans adapted to modern forms of travels and developed special lines of luggage for overseas travel, especially on ocean liners such as the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], [[SS Normandie|Normandie]], [[Queen Mary (ship)|Queen Mary]], and Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/988006181|title=Ocean liners : glamour, speed and style|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Finamore, Daniel, 1961-, Wood, Ghislaine, Peabody Essex Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum|year=|isbn=9781851779062|location=London|pages=|oclc=988006181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practical, Finnigans’ travel items were also of great workmanship. The house’s lightweight dressing cases in colourful, polished Morocco were particularly successful. Among items of the highest luxury was a dressing case to be offered as a present for marriage or birthday in crocodile skin, solid gold mountings, and tortoiseshell handles. Crocodile briefcases by Finnigans have become highly valued collectible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://howtospendit.ft.com/womens-style/7495-vintage-luggage|title=Vintage luggage|last=Burroughs|first=Katrina|date=2012-06-13|work=How to spend it|access-date=2017-12-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Finnigans launched a sports clothing line to fit the new lifestyle of the elite, and especially the vogue of sunbathing and swimming in seaside resorts. A two-piece bathing suit in bright yellow is preserved at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O234910/bathing-suit-finnigans-ltd/|title=Bathing suit {{!}} Finnigans Ltd. {{!}} V&amp;A Search the Collections|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air travel brought weight restrictions and begat a reduction in the weight, size, and structure of luggage to which Finnigans contributed. New materials like vulcanized fiber replaced the heavier structured cases of leather and wood.

== The Second World War and beyond ==
In 1938, the fourth generation of the family took over and Brian Finnigan, named after his ancestor, became the managing director. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the house of Finnigans contributed to the war effort as its factory produced much needed webbing equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Brian Finnigan expanded the reach of the family business and built up an export market in [[New York City|New York]], [[Canada]], and the [[Caribbean]]. After the war, Peter Finnigan joined his cousin Brian in the company and travelled to Macy's in New York in order to learn from modern American department stores and strengthen Finnigans’ export activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The two men studied with the uttermost interest the moving of city stores to suburban locations and the advent of the shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Consumer’s Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America|last=Cohen|first=Lizabeth|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2004|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the lease of the Deansgate store in Manchester expired in the 1950s, they pioneered this new retailing trend and moved Finnigans to [[Wilmslow]], twelve miles from Manchester’s city centre. Many other shops followed, making Wilmslow a thriving shopping centre.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While in Wilmslow, Finnigans retained its luxury positioning, and notably sold tailor-made suits in high quality tweed. The house also produced high fashion handbags in crocodile lined with suede that were of “lasting luxury”.

In 1968, Finnigans closed its New Bond Street store in London. The company remained a family-run business until it shut down its last store in 1988.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The house of Finnigans today ==
The house of Finnigans has since changed hands and now belongs to the [[Luvanis]] company, specialized in reviving long dormant brands, such as [[Moynat]] and [[Belber]].

'''''Flora Graeca''''' was a publication of the plants of [[Greece]] in the late 18th century, resulting from a survey by [[John Sibthorp]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]].  The botanical descriptions and illustrations were to become highly valued by the English audience; the finely crafted and illustrated work was of both scientific and horticultural interest.

Sibthorp met the [[botanical illustrator]] Bauer in Vienna, where he had made a voyage to study a copy of [[Dioscorides]]' early botanical work, the renowned [[Vienna Dioscurides]]. This was the first part of a journey, to identify medicinal plants used in Greece;  Bauer was to join the expedition as the illustrator. They were to record and collect a large number of novel specimens; their publication introduced these to an English audience. From March 1786 to December 1787 they surveyed the plants and animals of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], Sibthorp collecting and describing, Bauer making dried specimens and producing colour-coded sketches.  Bauer's work, including around a thousand intricate and annotated sketches, is now regarded as one of the finest examples of [[botanical illustration]].

Sibthorp's volumes were to become a botanical publication, the original intention to produce a [[herbal]] or medical volume was transformed into a scientific survey.  An accompanying volume, ''Fauna Graeca'', and other planned works on the region, was not realised.

Sibthorp assembled the descriptions and [[Lithography|plates]], at his death in 1796 his will included an endowment to see the book published.  The task of preparing the works was undertaken by [[James Edward Smith]], who issued the two volumes of the '''''Prodromus''''' in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes as '''''Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana''''' between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by [[John Lindley]] between 1833 and 1840.
E
Each volume contained a hundred plates, except the last, and these were engraved by [[James Sowerby]]. Only 30 copies of this set were issued, another 50 complete sets were reissued in 1845 by [[Henry George Bohn]]. The cost in 1830 was 620 pounds.  The scarcity of the early first editions led to doubt of their existence, the rare book is at the higher end of trade.  The inherent value has led the [[Bodleian Libraries]] to make available a digital scan of the complete set.

The publication was issued with tables and indices of the scientific name, the common name in Greek was in this concordance.
It was during a period of increasing interest in horticulture and highly desired exotic species were described, many would become perennials of the English [[flower garden]].

The concept of '''friction of distance''' is based on the notion that [[distance]] usually requires some amount of [[Work (physics)|effort]], [[energy]], time, and/or other [[resource]]s to overcome.  Because of this "[[friction]]", spatial [[interaction]]s, especially [[transport]] and the particular case of [[human migration]], will tend to take place more often over shorter distances; amount and intensity of interaction will [[distance decay|decay with distance]].  Regardless of physical friction, the various [[cost]]s are metaphorically assumed to correspond to forces that impede movements.

Friction, be it physical or metaphorical, may be a continuous, smooth function or may contain jumps; it may be constant, linear, or nonlinear or a combination of jumps and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] effects, as with [[Intermodal freight transport]] and [[Intermodal passenger transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch7en/conc7en/frictionspace.html

'''India's golden triangle''' is a [[tourist]] circuit which connects the national capital [[Delhi]], [[Agra]] and [[Jaipur]]. The Golden Triangle is so called because of the triangular shape formed by the locations of [[New Delhi]], [[Agra]] and [[Rajasthan]] on a map. The trips usually start in Delhi moving south to the site of [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, then west, to the desert landscapes of [[Rajasthan]]. It is normally possible to do the trip by [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] or private journey through most [[Travel agency|tour operators]]. The Golden Triangle is now a well traveled route providing a good spectrum of the country's different landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/asia/the-complete-guide-to-indias-golden-triangle-434773.html|title=The Complete Guide To: India's Golden Triangle|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=3 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit is about 720&amp;nbsp;km by road. Each leg is about 4 to 6 hours of drive. The Shatabdi express train also connects Delhi with Agra and Jaipur.

[[File:Powhiri, USAF.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Air Force|U.S. airman]] and a [[Māori people|Māori]] warrior exchange a hongi during a [[pōwhiri]] ceremony]]
[[File:A hongi.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Māori women exchange a hongi, 1913]]
The traditional [[Māori culture|Māori]] greeting, the '''''hongi''''' is performed by two people pressing their noses together; some include, at the same time, the touching of foreheads.&lt;ref name="Salmons"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Salmons |first1=Matthew |title=Hongi, our national greeting |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/96504348/hongi-our-national-greeting |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=17 September 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greeting is used at traditional meetings among [[Māori people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Maori – Maori Culture In The 21st Century |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maori#ref180293 |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at major ceremonies, such as a ''[[pōwhiri]]''.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;{{cite web |author=Māori ki Te Whare Wānanga o Ōtākou|title=Pōwhiri |url=https://www.otago.ac.nz/maori/world/tikanga/powhiri/index.html |publisher=[[University of Otago]] |accessdate=1 November 2018 |location=Dunedin |language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be followed by a [[handshake]].&lt;ref name="Otago"/&gt;

In the hongi, the ''ha'' (breath of life) is exchanged in a symbolic show of unity.&lt;ref name="Salmons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Otago"/&gt; Through the exchange of this greeting, one is no longer considered ''manuhiri'', a visitor, but rather ''tangata whenua'', one of the people of the land.&lt;ref name="Otago"/&gt; 

==Symbolism==
When Māori greet one another by pressing noses, the tradition of sharing the breath of life is considered to have come directly from the gods. In [[Māori mythology]], woman was created by the Gods moulding her shape out of the earth. The god [[Tāne]] embraced the figure and breathed into her nostrils. She then sneezed and came to life, creating the first woman in Māori legends, [[Hineahuone]].&lt;ref name="Salmons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derby|first1=Mark|title=Ngā mahi tika - Welcome and hospitality: Origin of the hongi|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/artwork/41176/origin-of-the-hongi|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=8 September 2017|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The hongi may be performed by Māori and non-Māori, and between New Zealanders and foreign visitors. Several [[British royal family|royals]] have been greeted with the hongi during visits to New Zealand, including: [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maori warriors greet Prince Charles and Camilla in New Zealand |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11982116/Maori-warriors-greet-Prince-Charles-and-Camilla-in-New-Zealand.html |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana, Princess of Wales]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering Princess Diana 20 years on |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/2968348-135/remembering-princess-diana-20-years-on |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=[[Gisborne Herald]] |date=31 August 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boyle |first1=Danny |title=Prince William shares hongi greeting as he honours Kiwi Passchendaele soldiers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/12/prince-william-shares-hongi-greeting-honours-kiwi-passchendaele/ |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan, Duchess of Sussex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Meghan praises first female vote in speech |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-46008507 |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] was greeted with a hongi on a November 2010 visit to Wellington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1011/S00038/hillary-clintons-first-powhiri-part-1-images.htm |title=Hillary Clinton's First Powhiri  Hongi  |work=scoop.co.nz |year=2010 |quote=Scoop Images: Hillary Clinton's First Pōwhiri  Hongi |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] exchanged a hongi with New Zealand Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] during a visit to the country in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pictures of the Day: 23 March 2018 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/23/pictures-day-23-march-2018/barack-obama-receives-maori-hongi-kiss-powhiri-government-housein/ |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=1 November 2018 |date=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Hyper Police'''''|はいぱーぽりす|Haipā Porisu|lead=yes}} is the name of a [[manga]] and [[anime]] series created by [[Minoru Tachikawa]] under the [[pseudonym]] MEE. It is a [[comic science fiction]], set in a period in the far future, in which humanity is almost extinct and most of the population are monsters. It is mostly set in the offices of a private police company and focuses on the life of Natsuki Sasahara, a young [[catgirl]], and her co-workers: Foxgirl Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari, [[werewolf]] Batanen Fujioka and his cousin Tomy Fujioka (spelled Tommy in the anime).

For many years, the only western language to have official translations of the ''Hyper Police'' manga was [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[English language|English]] translations have been completed by US company [[Tokyopop]].

== Setting ==
The anime takes place in the year 22 HC (Holy Century), in the Tokyo ward of [[Shinjuku]]. Although theoretically about the competition of rival private police corporations (licensed [[bounty hunter|bounty hunting]] firms) in an Earth where humanity is in danger of extinction, in actuality it focuses more on the lives of the main characters, such as; Natsuki Sasahara, Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari, and Batanen Fujioka. The monsters are usually taken from [[Japanese mythology]], updated for the modern era. In the anime, repeat criminal offenders in [[Tokyo]] have their memories wiped. However, in the manga version, they are castrated. [[Mithril]] exists in this world/setting; it is a sort of specially enchanted [[silver]] that is especially effective against supernatural characters.

== Characters ==
Some of the characters in ''Hyper Police'' are hybrids of human and "monsters"; which occurred during the Holy war when the doorway between the human world and the Monster World opened up, thus allowing humans and monsters to co-exist and interbreed.

; Natsuki Sasahara
:Natsuki is a 17-year-old half-human/half-[[nekomata]]. She is the daughter of a human father and a [[nekomata]] mother. Natsuki is very sweet and kind to everyone and always eager to help protect the weak and uphold the law. Her personality is very feline; she will eat cat food, grooms herself like a cat, play with string and other moving objects (including Sakura's tails), and her favorite drink is [[catnip]]-milk, which has an alcoholic effect on her. Batanen hired her to join Police Company when he saw her ability to create electrical shocks being put to good use, while she was inadvertently taken hostage by a criminal he was chasing, then proceeded to fry him to a crisp. However, this is also her major problem, since Natsuki is so young, she still has trouble controlling her powers and has been known to spark at random when frightened, frying everything within several meters of her. She is also a dangerously bad shot with a gun and has shot her allies at least twice by accident, thus she only uses a short dagger as her melee weapon of choice. When angry or scared, her tail temporarily splits in two. She prides herself on owning an [[Orichalcum|orihalcon]] blade, and is in control of two "parasites", which is unusual for the setting; even having one is considered to be powerful. As of volume nine, it has been revealed that she is the daughter of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian goddess [[Bastet (mythology)|Bast]].

Note that she has 2 sets of ears, human normal position and feline on the top sides of her head.

:{{Voiced by|[[Yuko Miyamura]]}}

; Parasites
: These magical familiars are able to focus their owner's magical energy and turn it into electricity. The names of Natsuki's parasites are [[Fūjin|Fujin]] and [[Raijin]] (named after the Japanese gods of Wind and Thunder). Sakura has one too, but it is rarely seen. In the manga, it was revealed in volume seven, that Fujin and Raijin were engagement "rings" from a prince in china, but due to misunderstandings through Natsuki's father's translator, Natsuki was unaware she was engaged.

; Bob
: Bob is Natsuki's super intelligent pet bobtail cat. He is older than she is, and thus is her legal guardian when her human father is away on his archaeological digs.

:{{Voiced by|[[Kouichi Toochika]]}}

; Sakura Bokuseiinmonzeninari
: Sakura is a [[kitsune]] (fox spirit) and Natsuki's partner for a time.  Though she is 191 years old, she claims that she looks to be only 19. She has human ancestors, thus she was born with only 8 and 1/5 tails and was teased as a child, because of it. Kitsune must have a full nine tails in order to have full use of their power, thus Sakura has spent many years hunting for a powerful being to consume, in order to attain that full power. Sakura joins the Police Company after seeing Natsuki in action, in hopes of consuming her, in order to gain her full ninth tail. She can fly, has some minor electrical power and is an excellent shot with a gun. Sakura is from [[Osaka]], thus has a knack for bartering and handling money. Later on she gives birth to three mischievous kids from her mating with the time-displaced samurai Sakunoshin, by episode 17. Justifying the age-old lore of a Kitsune being a mother and housewife. It is not completely clarified if the two are officially married or not though, Sakura's mother is seen to ask her at one point "when are you two coming to Osaka to get married?"

:{{Voiced by|[[Chiyako Shibahara]]|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]}}

; Sakunoshin Chikura
: Sakunoshin is a displaced samurai from Japan's [[Tenshō (Momoyama period)|Tenshō era]], who ended up in the Holy Era due to Natsuki's power surges that unbeknownst to her have been opening up temporary time portals in various parts of the city. When he first arrives, he mistakes Sakura for his love, ninja Kasumi. Later, when he realizes that Sakura is not Kasumi, he falls in love with her. It is revealed in the anime that Kasumi may be Sakura's direct ancestor. Sakunoshin is very calm and even tempered, though in battle he becomes extremely fierce and deadly, and is able to best even experienced monster fighters. He has an entire kit of samurai armor, along with his katana, equipment, and a set of Japanese smoking pipes (only seen in the manga). In the manga, Sakunoshin is often apprehensive of his wife's romantic advances, as they humorously leave him extremely exhausted. Still, he loves her very much and sets out on an epic journey in search of a cure, when Sakura is affected by magic weapons in later issues. Being human, he and his family are awarded food, clothing and housing from the government.

:Sakunoshin is a very skilled swordsman and to her horror, has even sliced through Natsuki's orihalcon Blade.

:{{Voiced by|[[Toshihiko Seki]]}}

; Batanen Fujioka
: Batanen is a 35-year-old [[werewolf]], and a senior officer at Police Company, as well as the top earner. He is very protective of Natsuki and often acts as a big brother figure to her. He is secretly in love with her and despite being somewhat of a lecher, Batanen is very shy and unsure of himself when it comes to making a move on Natsuki, thus she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. However, he also seems hesitant to make a move even when (for various reasons) Natsuki is trying to be flirty with him. His abilities are quick regeneration (when injured, he becomes fully healed by the next full moon) and near-[[immortality]], as well as being a competent detective and an excellent shot. In the manga, he is always called by his first name, but in the Japanese version of the anime, most everyone refers to him as "Senpai" (senior). At the end of the manga he and Natsuki are married.

:Batanen has a large collection of guns in his apartment and is usually portrayed as carrying what looks like a [[Magnum Research]] [[Desert Eagle]] (only much larger!).

:{{Voiced by|[[Akio Ōtsuka]]}}

; Tommy Fujioka (Tomy in the manga)
: Tommy is Batanen's cousin and partner only a year older than Natsuki. Unlike his cousin Batanen, Tommy has the appearance of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[wolf]]. Although somewhat naive, he is honest and quite skilled, with his specialty being information gathering. He is very adept at problem solving and is skilled in computer systems and possesses a large knowledge of varying subjects (he has demonstrated he can tell when a [[katana]] was made just by looking at it). He later falls in love with the human spirit-summoner Peau and being inexperienced in love, comes on a bit too strong. He apparently has a kink for being servile and tries to get Peau to pander to this. He bought her a pair of scarlet slippers and said "Please take these as a gesture of my fealing and step all over me!" By the end of the series, he marries Peau and they have 19 offspring.

: Tommy carries a rather nondescript gun in the manga, but carries a German [[Walther P38]] in the anime. He is also deeply and madly in love with Peau and is probably the most stable person of the cast.

:{{Voiced by|[[Ryuuzou Ishino]]}}

; Samansa Grey (Samantha)
: Samansa is an [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]] with huge Coke-bottle-lens glasses who works as a secretary for Chief Mudagami, even after the company goes bankrupt. She is a computer and information gathering expert, with a talent of predicting the future with her tarot cards. In the manga, she is virtually non-existent until the company goes under, at which point, she reveals herself as a shrewd businesswoman. She is somewhat manipulative and loves money above all else, a trait that might lead her to ruin? She founds the Grey Company—a sort of spiritual successor to the Police company.

:{{Voiced by|[[Kanako Mitsuhashi]]}}

; Naoko Kondo
: Naoko is one of the few humans in Police Company, she initially hates all non-humans due to the fact that a monster killed her parents when she was a child. Natsuki helps her overcome this hatred when she saved her life, by killing the same monster that killed her parents. She still feels vulnerable when fighting monsters, yet compensates for her lack of supernatural powers by being a crack shot and weapons expert, most likely brought on by her deep desire to avenge the death of her parents. She is much more relevant in the manga then in the anime.

:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hikita]]}}

; Mudagami
: Mudagami is a minor god (immortal, able to teleport, able to notice changes in the nature of reality). He is the chief of Police Company until it goes bankrupt. He is a small man with long kinky black hair and a thin mustache. He often complains about not being taken seriously and remarks that his wife runs his life.

:{{Voiced by|[[Naoki Bandou]]}}

; Nupu
: Nupu is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[lion]] working for [[Police Company]]. He is a senior officer at Police Company and Batanen's best friend. He speaks with a [[British English|British accent]] in the [[English language|English]] version.

:{{Voiced by|[[Takuma Suzuki]]}}

; Peau D'Roquefort (Poe D'Roquefort in the manga)
: Peau is a water mage working for the state police. She is 24 years old and has a very aloof and impersonal businesslike attitude. The common police robots are under her control and she has the ability to conjure various ice and water spirits (such as waterspouts and trapping suspects in blocks of ice). She too is human, born of [[Europe]]an parents. At first Peau is easily disturbed by Tommy's methods of wooing her yet within time and patience, sometime at the end of volume six. (Though finite) she warms up to the young werewolf and they become friends (Although the manga has them taking their relationship much further, as Poe has feared being pregnant with Tommy's child by the end of volume eight.  In the final volume they finally get married and have 19 children).

: In an important moment towards the end of the manga, Peau comments that without Tommy her heart "would turn to ice." Some would say that Tommy was responsible for 'melting' her icy exterior.

:{{Voiced by|[[Yuri Amano]]}}

; Makoto and Ayami Tachibana
: Makoto and Ayami are the husband-and-wife team that run the Lamp (Ranpo) Café. They act as confidants to Natsuki, with Makoto playing the kind, yet concerned businessman and Ayami the sweet generous sister. In the manga, Ayami becomes pregnant around the same time as Sakura, though she doesn't give birth until later on.

; Fonne Walkure
: Fonne is very different in the manga and anime. She is of European descent and is an officer from the MAD Police Corporation owned by her rich father. In the anime, she is extremely prejudiced against all monsters and is largely an unsympathetic character. She especially goes out of her way to irritate and humiliate the easily provoked Sakura. She comes across as being very cold and cruel in the anime. However, in the manga, she is much more complex. In the Anime, at one point Tommy saves her life and as a result, she develops a crush on him, thus, for a short time, competing for his love, with Peau.  In the Manga, she has a boyfriend named Yoshikawa. And while she is somewhat cold, she is later shown doing charity work at an orphanage for monster children!

: She has so far kept her actions within the bounds of the law and carefully watches for one of her "fellow" non-human bounty hunters to cross the line. She pilots an F-Elf class [[VTOL]] aircraft. In the anime, she carries, what looks like some sort of truncated lever-action rifle, like a handgun.

:{{Voiced by|[[Kotono Mitsuishi]]}}

; Chief Tendo
: He is an Oni creature with a massive red head that comprises most of his body. He yells, rather than speaks and his whole head bobs up and down when he does so. He works for the Police Company and later the Gray Company in the Manga. He likes to cook and knows a lot about preparing fish.

; Rai Rai
: A character that is only seen in the manga. She appears after the formal formation of the Police company. Initially, she appears to be a catgirl, but she has a short fluffy tail and ears that are larger and droopier then Natsuki's- leading to her possibly being some sort of canine creature. She has platinum blond hair that is very fluffy and sticks out. She has no major skills, but later becomes fast friends with Natsuki- the two of them get their own storyline in volume nine of the manga. She also may be one of the only people who seriously thinks of Natsuki as a superior officer(senpai?). It is worth noting that an unnamed character who bears a striking resemblance to Rai Rai does make an appearance in episode 23. She has a similar hairstyle, the same ears and even salutes Natsuki as superior officer, as she passes by.

; Mao
: A cat girl and member of the feline patrol, in episode 19.

{{Rhetoric}}
'''''Inventio''''', one of the five canons of rhetoric, is the method used for the ''discovery of arguments'' in Western [[rhetoric]] and comes from the [[Latin]] word, meaning "invention" or "discovery". ''Inventio'' is the central, indispensable canon of rhetoric, and traditionally means a systematic search for [[argument]]s.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheryl Glenn and Melissa A. Goldthwaite|title=The St. Martin’s Guide to Teaching Writing|year=2008|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

A speaker uses ''Inventio'' when he or she begins the thought process to form and develop an effective argument. Often, the invention phase can be seen as the first step in an attempt to generate ideas or create an argument that is convincing and compelling. The other four canons of [[classical rhetoric]] (the others being [[dispositio]], [[elocutio]], [[memoria]], and [[pronuntiatio]]) rely on their interrelationship with invention.

==Purpose==
{{One source|section|date=December 2013}}
According to Crowley and Hawhee, invention is the division of rhetoric that investigates the possible means by which proofs can be discovered. It supplies the speaker and writers with sets of instructions or ideas that help them to find and compose arguments that are appropriate for a given rhetorical situation.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley and Hawhee, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

For personal and lyric essays, narratives, and descriptive writing, invention techniques help writers draw from their memory and observation for the kinds of details that will add depth to their essays.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008 /&gt;{{rp|151–156}}

The first direction of invention aims toward deriving heuristic procedures or systematic strategies that will aid students in discovering and generating ideas about which they might write; the second direction of invention is characterized by how writers establish "voice" in writing and realize individual selves in discourse.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}}

One of the oldest criticisms of rhetoric is that as an art it has no proper subject matter. In other words, an orator might speak on any topic, with his success being measured purely on the brilliance of his rhetorical skills. This aspect of rhetoric is one reason why [[Plato]] attacked what he saw as empty rhetoric on the part of [[sophist]] philosophers such as [[Gorgias]].

[[Aristotle]], in his works on rhetoric, answered Plato's charges by arguing that reason and rhetoric are intertwined ("Rhetoric is the counterpart of [[Dialectic]]" is the first sentence of his ''Rhetoric''). In Aristotle's view, dialectic reasoning is the mechanism for discovering universal truths; rhetoric is the method for clarifying and communicating these principles to others. And in order to communicate effectively, an orator must be able to assemble proper arguments that support a thesis.

''Inventio'', therefore, is the systematic discovery of rhetorical practices. In the Greek and Roman traditions, rhetorical practices are often but not always arguments. Aristotle, as well as later writers on rhetoric, such as [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], devoted considerable attention to developing and formalizing the discipline of rhetorical invention. Two important concepts within invention were topoi and stasis. Other rhetorical cultures seem to have additional means of locating "available means." Historian of [[Celts|Celtic]] poetics [[Robert Graves]] credited [[analepsis]] as a method of inventing his historical arguments in ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] [[medicine woman]] [[Maria Sabina]] credited the hallucinogenic [[psilocybe]] mushroom with the flow of her discourse. The philosopher Jacques Derrida described ''inventio'' as the "invention of the other."

Janice Lauer proposes that invention should be: (1) applicable to a wide variety of writing situations so that they will transcend a particular topic and can be internalized by the student; (2) flexible in direction allowing a thinker to return to a previous step or skip to an inviting one as the evolving idea suggests; and (3) highly generative by involving the writer in various operations—such as visualizing, classifying, defining, rearranging, and dividing—that are known to stimulate insights.&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|155}}

==''Topoi''==
In classical rhetoric, arguments are obtained from various sources of information, or topoi ([[Greek language|Greek]] 'places'; i.e. "places to find something"), also called by the [[Latin language|Latin]] name ''loci'' (''cf''. [[Literary topoi]]). Topoi are categories that help delineate the relationships among ideas; Aristotle divided these into "common" and "special" groups.

In the common group could be found such categories as laws, witnesses, contracts, oaths, comparisons of similarity, difference, or degree, definitions of things, division of things (whole or parts, for instance), cause and effect, and other items that could be analyzed, researched, or documented.

Modern writers and students use these topics, as well, when discovering arguments, although today more emphasis is placed on scientific facts, statistics, and other "hard" evidence. Classical rhetoricians saw many areas of inquiry that today's writer might view as being purely in the province of "logic," developing syllogisms, finding contradictions, as being of equal or greater importance.  Barbara Warnick has compared the 28 topics of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and topical schemes of Chaïm Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca's ''The New Rhetoric'' to illustrate major differences of rhetoric throughout these time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|pages=107|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A.E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, two of Aristotle's topics "Opponent's Utterance" and "Response to Slander" were more relevant to ancient debates in the practice of Athenian law, in which every citizen was his or her own lawyer.  On the other hand, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's schemes were meant to be comprehensive rather than outlining every single detail of speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=113|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A. G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While Aristotle's Rhetoric focused mainly on oral endeavors, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha'sThe New Rhetoric dealt with written arguments.  Writing is a modern innovation that was looked down upon in ancient Greece.  According to Warnick, another difference between the two systems is that Aristotle developed Rhetoric as a way of spreading the practice of rhetoric so it could be performed and taught correctly.  Perelman and Olbrechts-Tytecha's The New Rhetoric emphasized the study of rhetoric, focusing more on the understanding of the topic rather than the practice of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rereading Aristotle's Rhetoric|year=2000|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|page=112|author=Barbara Warnick|editor=A.G. Gross &amp; A. E. Walzer|chapter=Two Systems of Invention: The Topics in the Rhetoric and The New Rhetoric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special topoi included such concepts as justice or injustice, virtue, good, and worthiness. Again, these are areas of inquiry seen by many today as belonging to other arts, but from Greek times through the Renaissance, these were considered integral to the study and practice of rhetoric.

Topics (or topoi) can be used to invent arguments and also to conceptualize and formulate the single-sentence declarative thesis. Edward P.J. Corbett, Robert Connors, Richard P. Hughes, and P. Albert Duhamel define topics as "ways of probing one's subject in order to find the means to develop that subject".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|153}} They issued four common topics that are most useful to students: definition, analogy, consequence, and testimony. Definition involves the creation of a thesis by taking a fact or an idea and explaining it by precisely identifying its nature; it always asks the question "What is/was it?" Analogy is concerned with discovering resemblances or differences between two or more things proceeding from known to unknown; it is a useful tool for investigating comparisons and contrasts because it always asks the question "What is it like or unlike?" Consequence investigates phenomena costs to effect-to-cause pattern, best established through probabilities from patterns that have previously occurred. It always answers the question "What caused/causes/will cause it?" Testimony relies on appeals to an authority (such as an expert opinion, statistics, or the law), and it always answers the question "What does an authority say about it?" "Ultimately a thesis or an argument must say something about the real world. Teaching the topics requires using examples and good examples are to be had by applying each topic to a definite subject and coming up with several thesis statements".&lt;ref name=Glenn2008/&gt;{{rp|156}}

==Modes of persuasion==
Aristotle described three "modes of persuasion," or "appeals."&lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Rhetoric|year=1924|others=Translated by W. Rhys Roberts|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, NY|page=1356a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first dealt with the matter of the case (logos), the second dealt with the character of the speaker (ethos), and the third dealt with the emotions of the audience (pathos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, Pennsylvania|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each mode of persuasion can be inventional, helping an orator create an effective argument.

Aristotle defined ethos as an appeal based on a speaker’s character within a persuasive act. Later, the Roman rhetorician Cicero expanded this definition to contain elements of character outside a particular rhetorical act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=1&amp;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most rhetoric scholars today combine the two definitions, understanding ethos to mean character both inside and outside a rhetorical circumstance. Speakers use the mode of ethos when they create an argument based on their own character. When relying on ethos, a speaker uses personal “trustworthiness or credibility” to persuade the audience to believe their specific argument on a particular topic (Ramage 81). For example, if a presidential candidate has a long history of philanthropy, he or she will invent an argument that demonstrates personal good character in order to convince the audience that he or she is the best candidate for office.

Pathos represents an appeal to the audience’s emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ice|first=Richard|title=Rhetoric in Civic Life|year=2012|publisher=Strata Publishing Inc.|location=State College, PA|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal can be achieved by the use of metaphors, storytelling, or general passion. In order to appeal to an audience’s emotions during the speech’s delivery, the speaker must first take the audience’s emotion into account during the early invention phase. For example, if a presidential candidate grew up poor and managed to succeed in life through hard work and education, then the candidate would have to apply that story to the speech-inventing process in order to appeal to the audience’s emotions. This storytelling draws upon the common "bootstraps" narrative of American culture, one that often appeals to the emotions of the U.S. electorate.

As Aristotle explains, logos, often referred to as the "logical" appeal, uses the arguments present in the case itself to appeal to the audience's reason. Aristotle writes that logos depends on "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt; Logos appeals work "when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question." &lt;ref name="Aristotle 1924 1356a"/&gt;  ''Inventio'' is linked with logos such that it deals with what an author would say as opposed to ''how'' it might be said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Invention|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/canons/invention.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Stasis''==
According to rhetorical scholar Thomas O. Sloane, Cicero described rhetoric as the devising of true or seemingly true arguments for the sake of making one’s case appear probable.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=National Council of English|year=1989|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a speaker must debate both sides of an argument to invent an effective argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 462"/&gt; Sloane goes on to say it is important for a speaker to critique every aspect of his or her argument. Ciceronian invention is simply an analytical process of argument.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|page=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a theorist of law, Cicero put forward a specific procedure commonly referred to as stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 466"/&gt;

Stasis is a procedure by which a speaker poses questions in order to clarify the main issues and persuasive points of a speech or debate.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|title=Reinventing Inventio|year=1989|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure allows the speaker to critically question each point, assessing the relative worth of each point as appropriate to the substance of the case and to its capacity to persuade an audience.

Using stasis theory gives the speaker numerous advantages that will help them excel in persuading. According to Crowley and Hawhee, the following advantages may accrue in the use of stasis theory.&lt;ref name="Sloane 1989 44–74"/&gt;

*Allows the speaker to clarify his or her thinking about the point in dispute.

There are four types of stasis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawhee, Debra and Sharon Crowley|chapter=Stasis theory: Asking the right questions |title=Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students |year=1999|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|pages=44–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; conjectural (question of fact: Is/was it?), definitional (question of definition: What is/what is its meaning?), qualitative (question of quality: How good or bad is/was it), and translative (question of place or procedure: Is/was this appropriate process or place to handle the matter?). For instance, a lawyer defending someone accused of damaging property might pose the following questions:

*Question of fact: did the person damage the item? (conjectural)
*Question of definition: was the damage minor or major? (definitional)
*Question of quality: was he justified in damaging the item? (qualitative)
*Question of jurisdiction: should this be a civil or criminal trial? (translative)

The question of fact is key as the first step in formulating any argument is separating the true from the false. If the terms of the argument at hand cannot be agreed on, the discussion will not move in any positive direction. Going back and forth attacking sources of information is not conducive to making any real progress, so an emphasis on using only solid information and evidence-based anecdotes is at the crucial to achieving stasis

The question of definition means to define what, exactly, the issue of concern is, and what, if any, biases or preconceptions our arguments hold. Then, categorizing the problem is the next focus, agreeing on the class of the event and therefore the attitude with which it should be approached. A political disagreement should be investigated with a different lens than a criminal case, for example, as they are concerns of a different nature.

The question of quality means identifying the magnitude of the event, the wider impacts, as well as what would happen if no action were to be taken. Identifying if this problem is important as part of a bigger picture is key to preparing a sound argument, as well as figuring out whether or not it is a cause worth pursuing. The quality aspect of stasis comes down to deciding if this particular problem requires attention, and at what cost will a resolution come about.

The question of jurisdiction means formulating a plan of action. Just as we calculate whether the particular problem is worth the energy in the quality category, here we make the decision to take action. A plan of action includes determining what kind of people should be involved in solving this problem, and what strategy these people will use.&lt;ref&gt;https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/736/1/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention in the rhetorical tradition==
Invention also entails the adaptation of ideas and stylistic devices to unfamiliar audiences.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=John M.|title=Inventing Authority: Bill Clinton, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Orchestration of Rhetorical Traditions|year=1997|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetorical scholar John M. Murphy argues that rhetorical traditions consist of common patterns of language use and organized “social knowledge” of communities that make resources available for the invention of effective arguments.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt; Invention allows these rhetorical traditions to be adapted across cultural differences or situations. Murphy provides an example in which an orator would blend several rhetorical traditions: one by which the orator might primarily identify and another by which the audience might identify, thus merging speaker and audience through a display of interconnected rhetorical traditions.&lt;ref name="Murphy 1997 71–89"/&gt;

To Cicero, traditional rhetoric was a "mode of thought" and to attain this rhetoric it is required to make the "true nature of rhetorical inventio" apparent.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloane|first=Thomas O.|title=Reinventing Inventio|journal=College English|date=Sep 1989|volume=51|issue=5|pages=303–473|doi=10.2307/378000|jstor=378000|publisher=National Council of Teachers of English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas O. Sloane, a rhetorical scholar, discusses that ''inventio'' in the rhetorical tradition specifically refers to addressing the pros and cons of an argumentation.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  Sloane argues that it is required when using ''inventio'' as a tool that one must not only consider the discourse at hand but the discourses that accompany the positives and negatives attached.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In further explanation, one must debate all sides of an argument "or one's ''inventio'' will remain not fully invented."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  In modern revivals of rhetoric, Sloane argues along with Reed Way Dasenbrock that these pros and cons of ''inventio'' do not have as much emphasis as they did in Cicero.&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;  This lack of attention to different sides of an argument is why Dasenbrock believes that the revival of rhetoric "is relevant; [but] it isn't complete."&lt;ref name="Sloane 303–473"/&gt;

==Amplification and invention==
[[Amplification (rhetoric)|Amplification]] is a term in rhetoric defined as the enrichment of words to increase rhetorical effect.  It is closely related to invention such that it deals with the development and progression of notions, drawing from the topics of invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Gideon O.|title=Figures of Amplification|url=http://rhetoric.byu.edu/Figures/Groupings/of%20amplification.htm|publisher=Brigham Young University|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Topics of invention can also be seen as topics of amplification, especially those of division, definition, and comparison.

The '''Israeli mafia''' ({{lang-he-n|מאפיה ישראלית}} or {{Hebrew|ארגוני פשע בישראל}}) is the general term for [[organized crime]] groups operating in Israel and also internationally. Allegedly there are 16 crime families operating in [[Israel]], five major groups active on the national level, and 11 smaller organizations. There are reputed to be six [[Maghrebi Jews|Maghrebi Jewish]] crime families active and three [[Israeli Arabs|Arab]] crime families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vicelander.blogspot.be/2008/09/charlie-abutbul-was-badly-wounded-in.html#links |title=VICELAND: Charlie Abutbul was badly wounded in a hail of bullets inside a Netanya eatery on Monday |publisher=Vicelander.blogspot.be |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many heads and members of the crime groups have either been killed or are in prison.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/police-cite-significant-achievements-against-major-crime-families-1.272117| newspaper=Haaretz| date=March 15, 2009| title=Police cite significant achievements against major crime families. The Israel Police spent the past year focusing on Israel's 16 crime families| author=Jonathan Lis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organized crime in Israel==
The major crime groups are the [[Abergil crime family|Abergils]], the Abutbuls, the Alperons, the Dumranis, the Shirazis, the Amir Molnar and [[Zeev Rosenstein]] syndicates.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1"/&gt; The illegal activities they are engaged in include operating casinos and other forms of gambling inside and outside Israel, car theft, prostitution, drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, protection and extortion rackets, loan sharking and drug dealing.

According to Israel's former Police Commissioner David Cohen, Israeli crime organizations had penetrated the formal economic sector and local governments, and "equipped themselves with large quantities of combat means explosives and arms." In a mob war starting in the early 2000s between the crime families, several crime bosses were killed. It also cost the lives of innocent bystanders.&lt;ref name="Forward1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/14402/| title=Israel Seeks U.S. Help To Fight Mob Crime Wave| author= Marc Perelman| newspaper= [[The Jewish Daily Forward]]| date=October 16, 2008|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Iakhbal is the Israeli Special Police Unit that fights organized crime.

=== In Israeli politics ===

In 2010, it was reported by [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks]] that the United States Embassy in Israel expressed grave concern that [[Inbal Gavrieli]], the niece of one of Israel's most powerful mafia families, had been elected to the Knesset as an MK for the [[Likud party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/wikileaks-u-s-worried-israel-becoming-the-promised-land-for-organized-crime-1.328480 WikiLeaks: U.S. worried Israel becoming 'the promised land' for organized crime], Haaretz, December 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===North-African and Middle Eastern crime families===
The immigration of [[Egyptian Jews|Egyptian]] and [[Moroccan Jews]] to Israel and their settlement in the more impoverished neighborhoods led to the creation of crime families among Maghrebi Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/06/world/fg-israel-mafia6 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ashraf | last=Khalil | title=Police in Israel grapple with a mafia gang war | date=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in the fact that a large number of ''Israeli'' organized criminals have fled to [[Morocco]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/new-destination-for-alleged-israeli-mobsters-on-the-run-morocco-1.464849|title=New destination for alleged Israeli mobsters on the run: Morocco|date=14 September 2012|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli crime families of [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]] descent expanded their operations to Europe and the USA, especially with their involvement in [[drug trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.be/nieuws/4667/|title=Israëlische mafiabaas is onzichtbare spin in xtc-web / Nieuws / Politics.be - Jouw politieke portaalsite|work=Politics.be|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Israel's more well-known crime families are of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish descent: the [[Abergil crime family]] as well as the Abutbul and Domrani clans are originally from [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/tag/charlie-abutbul/|title=The Jewish Press   »    » Charlie Abutbul|work=The Jewish Press|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Yaakov Alperon|Alperon]] clan came from [[Egypt]], and the Shirazi clan from [[Iran]].

===Israeli Arab organized crime===
[[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli-Arab]] organized crime groups were formed in Israel. Some Palestinian cities and towns are home to local crime families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldblog.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/04/09/4376625-mafia-style-violence-in-gaza-and-bbc-reporter|title=Mafia-style violence in Gaza and BBC reporter|author=World Blog|date=26 December 2014|work=NBC News|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clans like [[Tayibe]] based Abdel-Kader family are involved in [[extortion]], [[drug trafficking|drug]] and [[weapon trafficking]], [[fraud]] as well as [[money laundering]], often in cooperation with their Jewish counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-nab-Israeli-Arab-mob-family-head-16-associates|title=Police nab Israeli-Arab mob family head, 16 associates|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Arab crime family, the Jarushi family from [[Ramla]], is one of the most powerful crime families in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/meet-the-jarushis-the-crime-family-linked-to-likud-mk-david-bitan/&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the criminal gang around Moussa Aliyan in [[New York City]] whose main business was the importation of [[heroin]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1485&amp;context=ilj&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian mafia ===
The [[Russian mafia]] in Israel began with the mass immigration of [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russian Jews]] to Israel in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Misha Glenny| title=McMafia : seriously organised crime| publisher= Vintage Books| year= 2008| location=London| isbn=978-0-09-948125-6| pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish Russian crime bosses such as [[Semion Mogilevich]] acquired Israeli citizenship and laundered money through Israel.

The Russian mafia saw Israel as an ideal place to [[money laundering|launder money]], as Israel's banking system was designed to encourage [[aliyah]], the immigration of Jews, and the accompanying capital. Following the trend of global [[deregulation|financial deregulation]], Israel had also implemented legislation aimed at easing the movement of capital. Combined with the lack of anti-[[money laundering]] legislation, "Russian" organised crime found it an easy place to transfer ill-gotten gains. In 2005, police estimated that Russian organised crime had laundered between [[USD|$]]5 and 10 billion in the fifteen years since the end of the Soviet Union. Non-Jewish criminals such as [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] sought to get [[Israeli passport]]s, using fake Jewish documentation.&lt;ref name="g131"&gt;Glenny (2008) p. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian Jews|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian Jews|Ukrainian Jewish]] criminals have also been able to set up networks in the United States, following the large migration of Russian Jews to [[New York City]] and [[Miami]], but also in European cities such as [[Berlin]] and [[Antwerp]]. Many of these ''Russian'' gangsters have Israeli passports as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toqonline.com/blog/the-jewish-mafia/|title=The Jewish Mafia: An Interview with Hervé Ryssen|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infamous Russian-Jewish mobsters include [[Marat Balagula]], [[Evsei Agron]] and their respective criminal gangs in the United States. Soviet-Jewish criminal groups in the United States are involved in [[racketeering]], [[prostitution]], [[drug trafficking]], [[extortion]], and gasoline [[fraud]] as well as murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydmtk2HGrcAC&amp;pg=PA105 |title=Jews of Brooklyn|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014|isbn=9781584650034|author1=Abramovitch|first1=Ilana|last2=Galvin|first2=Seán|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georgian organized crime====
Family-based organized crime groups were formed among [[Georgian Jews|Georgian Jewish]] immigrants to Israel as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=101282|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian-Jewish crime families have been able to expand their operations to [[Western Europe]]an cities such as [[Antwerp]]. They are involved in [[counterfeiting]], [[fraud]], [[money laundering]], [[drug trafficking]], [[weapon trafficking]], [[prostitution]] and [[armed robbery]]. Such was the case with the Georgian-Jewish Melikhov clan in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=NBRA23012004_036|title=Parket wil Belg-zijn afpakken|work=Het Nieuwsblad|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janice-laureyssens-visie.skynetblogs.be/archive/2006/05/06/gansters-krijgen-vrijbrief-helden-worden-gestraft.html|title=Gansters krijgen vrijbrief - helden worden gestraft|publisher=|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
In the 1980s Israelis set up a crime syndicate headed by Johnny Attias in New York, dubbed the "Israeli mafia". It pulled off the biggest gold heist in the history of Manhattan's jewelry district, getting away with over $4 million in gold jewelry. Attias was murdered in January 1990, and New York's Israeli mafia fell apart soon after. Several members among them Ron Gonen had turned informant and the authorities arrested the rest of the gang in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dave Copeland| title=Blood and Volume: Inside New York's Israeli Mafia| isbn= 978-1-56980-327-1| year=2007| publisher= Barricade Books| location=Fort Lee, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli crime organizations such as the [[Abergil crime family]] and [[Zeev Rosenstein]] were heavily involved in [[MDMA|ecstasy]] trafficking in the United States.&lt;ref name=bbc070604&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3723895.stm| title= Israel struggles to keep a lid on crime| newspaper= BBC News|date=June 7, 2004|accessdate=August 8, 2011| first1=Chris| last1=Summers| first2=Jennifer| last2=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement before Congress in 2000, officials with the U.S. Customs Service noted that "Israeli organized-crime elements appear to be in control" of the multibillion-dollar U.S. ecstasy trade, "from production through the international smuggling phase".&lt;ref name="KetchArtStud"&gt;{{cite news| author= Christopher Ketcham| url= http://dir.salon.com/news/feature/2002/05/07/students/index.html| title= The Israeli "art student" mystery| newspaper= [[Salon.com]]| date= May 7, 2002| accessdate= August 8, 2011| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110917233629/http://dir.salon.com/news/feature/2002/05/07/students/index.html| archivedate= September 17, 2011| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main drug supplier of former [[Gambino crime family]] underboss [[Sammy Gravano]] in his [[Arizona]] drug ring allegedly was New York based Israeli mobster Ilan Zarger,&lt;ref name ="NewCharges"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Charges in Ecstasy Case Are Filed Against Gravano| author=Alan Feuer| newspaper= The New York Times| date=December 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; who allegedly distributed more than one million ecstasy pills from May 1999 to May 2000 with a wholesale value of $7 million.&lt;ref name=nydn070700&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/07/07/2000-07-07__ecstasy_dealer_sold_to_grav.html |title=Ecstasy Dealer Sold To Gravano, Feds Say |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=July 7, 2000 |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421085107/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2000/07/07/2000-07-07__ecstasy_dealer_sold_to_grav.html |archivedate=April 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt250501&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01EEDB1E3DF936A15756C0A9679C8B63| title= Gravano and Son Are to Enter Guilty Pleas in Ecstasy Case| newspaper=The New York Times| date=May 25, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011| first=Alan| last=Feuer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded guilty to charges of running a drug gang that flooded Arizona and New York with almost four million ecstasy pills over three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/09/nyregion/metro-briefing.html| title=Brooklyn Drug Dealer Pleads Guilty | date=January 9, 2001| newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 8, 2011| first=Anthony| last=Ramirez}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Israeli, Oded Tuito, said to head one of the largest ecstasy-smuggling organization, which imported  millions of ecstasy pills from Paris, Brussels and Frankfurt into New York, Miami and Los Angeles, was arrested in May 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/27/nyregion/reporter-s-notebook-in-drug-case-a-chip-off-the-old-bull.html|title=In Drug Case, a Chip Off the Old Bull|author=Alan Feuer| newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 27, 2001|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Zeev Rosenstein was extradited to the U.S., after being arrested in Israel. He pleaded guilty before a federal court in Florida to charges that he distributed ecstasy pills and was sentenced to 12 years in prison which he serves in Israel.&lt;ref name="Forward1"/&gt; In January 2011, Itzik Abergil and Meir Abergil and three other suspects were extradited to the U.S.

They faced 77-page, 32-count federal [[indictment]] that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based ecstasy ring.

The '''Jamaica International Exhibition''' was held in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], [[Jamaica]], from 27 January 1891 to 2 May 1891. It was modelled on the London [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 and was the idea of [[Augustus Constantine Sinclair]] who ran the Government Printing Office in Jamaica.

==Background==
In the 1880s, Jamaica's economy was in decline. Sugar exports were only a quarter of what they had been the start of the century, and the banana export business was in its infancy. There was a great need to promote Jamaican products to the world and attract investment to the island.&lt;ref name=lums&gt;[http://jamaica-history.weebly.com/1891-exhibition.html Jamaica International Exhibition, 1891.] Joy Lumsden. Retrieved 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea to hold an international exhibition to promote Jamaican industry similar to the 1851 [[Great Exhibition]] in London is generally credited to Augustus Constantine Sinclair, head of the Government Printing Office in Jamaica, with subsequent support from [[William Fawcett (botanist)|William Fawcett]], director of gardens and chairman of the [[Institute of Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=lums/&gt; For many years, they were unable to drum up sufficient support for the project, but in 1889 [[Sir Henry Blake]] arrived as the new governor of Jamaica and gave the idea his blessing.&lt;ref name=Gleaner&gt;[http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0018.html Pieces of the Past. The Great Exhibition of 1891: Jamaica on Show.] ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 14 January 2002. Retrieved 6 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exhibition==
The exhibition was funded by a £1,000 grant from the British government and loans from the Jamaican government which were guaranteed by locals in case the exhibition failed. [[Louis Verley]], [[George Stiebel]], and [[Colonel Charles Ward]], between them guaranteed about half the cost.&lt;ref name=lums/&gt;

The exhibition opened on 27 January 1891.&lt;ref name=obs&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-Great-Exhibition-of-1891-and-the-birth-of-Jamaica-s-hotel-industry_18302240 The Great Exhibition of 1891 and the birth of Jamaica's hotel industry.] Merrick Needham, ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 1 February 2015.

The exhibition closed on 2 May 1891 after receiving 302,831 visitors.&lt;ref name=obs/&gt; Despite the high levels of attendance, the exhibition made a loss, resulting in those that had given guarantees being required to provide nearly £30,000 to make up the shortfall.&lt;ref name=lums/&gt;

'''Japanese martial arts''' refer to the variety of [[martial arts]] native to the country of [[Japan]]. At least three Japanese terms are used interchangeably with the English phrase '''Japanese martial arts'''.

The usage of term '''''budō''''' to mean martial arts is a modern one and historically the term meant a way of life encompassing physical, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[moral]] dimensions with a focus of [[self-improvement]], [[Self-fulfillment|fulfillment]] or [[personal growth]].&lt;ref name="MAencyclopediaGreen"&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Disarming an attacker using a ''tachi-dori'' ("sword-taking") technique.]]

The historical origin of Japanese martial arts can be found in the warrior traditions of the [[samurai]] and the [[caste system]] that restricted the use of weapons by other members of society. Originally, samurai were expected to be proficient in many weapons, as well as unarmed combat, and attain the highest possible mastery of combat skills.

Ordinarily, the development of combative techniques is intertwined with the tools used to execute those techniques. In a rapidly changing world, those tools are constantly changing, requiring that the techniques to use them be continuously reinvented. The history of Japan is somewhat unusual in its relative isolation. Compared with the rest of the world, the Japanese tools of war evolved slowly. Many people believe that this afforded the warrior class the opportunity to study their weapons with greater depth than other cultures. Nevertheless, the teaching and training of these martial arts did evolve. For example, in the early medieval period, the bow and the spear were emphasized, but during the Tokugawa period, fewer large scale battles took place, and the sword became the most prestigious weapon. Another trend that developed throughout Japanese history was that of increasing martial specialization as society became more stratified over time.&lt;ref name="RattiWestbrook1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oscar Ratti|author2=Adele Westbrook|title=Secrets of the Samurai: The Martial Arts of Feudal Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFf9e0DmHZUC|accessdate=11 September 2012|date=15 July 1991|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-0-8048-1684-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The martial arts developed or originating in Japan are extraordinarily diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods, and philosophy across innumerable schools and styles. That said, Japanese martial arts may generally be divided into ''[[koryū]]'' and ''[[gendai budō]]'' based on whether they existed prior to or after the Meiji Restoration, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Since ''gendai budō'' and ''koryū'' often share the same historical origin,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} one will find various types of martial arts (such as [[jujutsu]], [[kenjutsu]], or [[naginatajutsu]]) on both sides of the divide.

:''A note on the organization of this article; it would be impossible to discuss Japanese martial arts in terms of the thousands of individual schools or styles, such as ''[[Ittō-ryū]]'', ''[[Daitō-ryū]]'', or ''[[Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū]]''.  Instead, major sections are divided based on when the art originated (regardless of whether it is still practiced), and subsections are dedicated to the root type of martial art, such as jujutsu (the art of empty-handed combat through use of indirect application of force) or kendo (Japanese sport fencing), wherein notable styles or major differences between styles may be discussed.

== Koryū bujutsu ==
{{Main|Koryū}}
{{See also|List of koryū schools of martial arts}}

{{Nihongo|''Koryū''|古流:こりゅう}}, meaning "traditional school", or "old school", refers specifically to schools of martial arts, originating in Japan, either prior to the beginning of the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, or the ''[[Haitō edict|Haitōrei]]'' edict in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, {{Nihongo|''bujutsu''|武術}}, meaning [[military science|military art/science]], is typified by its practical application of technique to real-world or battlefield situations.

The term also is used generally to indicate that a particular style or art is "traditional", rather than "modern". However, what it means for an art to be either "traditional" or "modern" is subject to some debate.  As a rule of thumb, the primary purpose of a ''koryū'' martial art was for use in war. The most extreme example of a ''koryū'' school is one that preserves its traditional, and often ancient, martial practices even in the absence of continuing wars in which to test them. Other ''koryū'' schools may have made modifications to their practices that reflect the passage of time (which may or may not have resulted in the loss of "''koryū''" status in the eyes of its peers).  This is as opposed to "modern" martial arts, whose primary focus is generally upon the self-improvement (mental, physical, or spiritual) of the individual practitioner, with varying degrees of emphasis on the practical application of the martial art for either sport or self-defence purposes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The following subsections represent not individual schools of martial arts, but rather generic "types" of martial arts. These are generally distinguishable on the basis of their training methodology and equipment, though wide variation still exists within each.

=== Sumo ===
{{Main|Sumo}}

{{Nihongo|Sumo|相撲:すもう|sumō}}, considered by many to be Japan's national sport, has its origins in the distant past. The earliest written records of Japan, which are dated from the 8th century AD, record the first sumo match in 23 BC, occurring specifically at the request of the emperor and continuing until one man was too wounded to continue{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. Beginning in 728 AD, the emperor [[Emperor Shōmu|Shōmu Tennō]] (聖武 天皇, 701&amp;ndash;756) began holding official sumo matches at the annual harvest festivals. This tradition of having matches in the presence of the emperor continued, but gradually spread, with matches also held at Shinto festivals, and sumo training was eventually incorporated into military training.  By the 17th century, sumo was an organized professional sport, open to the public, enjoyed by both the upper class and commoners.

Today, sumo retains much of its traditional trappings, including a referee dressed as a Shinto priest, and a ritual where the competitors clap hands, stomp their feet, and throw salt in the ring prior to each match. To win a match, competitors employ throwing and grappling techniques to force the other man to the ground; the first man to touch the ground with a part of the body other than the bottom of the feet, or touch the ground outside the ring with any part of the body, loses. Six grand tournaments are held annually in Japan, and each professional fighter's name and relative ranking is published after each tournament in an official list, called the ''banzuke'', which is followed religiously by sumo fans.

=== Jujutsu ===
{{Main|Jujutsu}}

[[Image:JUJITSU (AND RIFLES) in an agricultural school.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jujutsu training at an agricultural school in Japan around 1920.]]

{{Nihongo|Jujutsu|柔術:じゅうじゅつ|jūjutsu}}, literally translates to "Soft Skills". However, more accurately, it means the art of using indirect force, such as [[joint locks]] or throwing techniques, to defeat an opponent, as opposed to direct force such as a punch or a kick. This is not to imply that jujutsu does not teach or employ strikes, but rather that the art's aim is the ability to use an attacker's force against him or her, and counter-attack where they are weakest or least defended.

Methods of combat included striking (kicking, punching), throwing (body throws, joint-lock throws, unbalance throws), restraining (pinning, strangulating, grappling, wrestling) and weaponry. Defensive tactics included blocking, evading, off balancing, blending and escaping. Minor weapons such as the ''[[tantō]]'' (dagger), ''ryufundo kusari'' (weighted chain), ''jutte'' (helmet smasher), and ''kakushi buki'' (secret or disguised weapons) were almost always included in ''koryū'' jujutsu.

Most of these were battlefield-based systems to be practiced as companion arts to the more common and vital weapon systems. At the time, these fighting arts went by many different names, including ''kogusoku'', ''yawara'', ''kumiuchi'', and ''hakuda''. In reality, these grappling systems were not really unarmed systems of combat, but are more accurately described as means whereby an unarmed or lightly armed warrior could defeat a heavily armed and armored enemy on the battlefield. Ideally, the samurai would be armed and would not need to rely on such techniques.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In later times, other ''koryū'' developed into systems more familiar to the practitioners of the jujutsu commonly seen today. These systems are generally designed to deal with opponents neither wearing armor nor in a battlefield environment. For this reason, they include extensive use of ''atemi waza'' (vital-striking technique). These tactics would be of little use against an armored opponent on a battlefield. They would, however, be quite valuable to anyone confronting an enemy or opponent during peacetime dressed in normal street attire. Occasionally, inconspicuous weapons such as knives or ''tessen'' (iron fans) were included in the curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Today, jujutsu is practiced in many forms, both ancient and modern. Various methods of jujutsu have been incorporated or synthesized into judo and [[aikido]], as well as being exported throughout the world and transformed into sport wrestling systems, adopted in whole or part by schools of karate or other unrelated martial arts, still practiced as they were centuries ago, or all of the above.

=== Swordsmanship ===
{{Main|Swordsmanship#Japanese}}

[[Image:Daisho katana and wakizashi 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A matched set (''daisho'') of antique Japanese (samurai) swords and their individual mountings (koshirae), katana on top and wakisashi below, Edo period.]]

Swordsmanship, the art of the [[sword]], has an almost mythological ethos, and is believed by some to be the paramount martial art, surpassing all others. Regardless of the truth of that belief, the sword itself has been the subject of stories and legends through virtually all cultures in which it has been employed as a tool for violence. In Japan, the use of the [[katana]] is no different.  Although originally the most important skills of the warrior class were proficiency at horse-riding and shooting the bow, this eventually gave way to swordsmanship. The earliest swords, which can be dated as far back as the [[Kofun era]] (3rd and 4th centuries) were primarily straight bladed.  According to legend, curved swords made strong by the famous folding process were first forged by the smith [[Amakuni Yasutsuna]] (天國 安綱, c. 700 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = Japanese Swordsmanship
| publisher = Weatherhill

| pages = 8–9
| isbn = 0-8348-0236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary development of the sword occurred between 987 AD and 1597 AD. This development is characterized by profound artistry during peaceful eras, and renewed focus on durability, utility, and mass production during the intermittent periods of warfare, most notably [[Kamakura period|civil warfare]] during the 12th century and the [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongolian invasions]] during the 13th century (which in particular saw the transition from mostly horseback archery to hand to hand ground fighting).

This development of the sword is paralleled by the development of the methods used to wield it. During times of peace, the warriors trained with the sword, and invented new ways to implement it. During war, these theories were tested. After the war ended, those who survived examined what worked and what didn't, and passed their knowledge on. In 1600 AD, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] (徳川 家康, 1543&amp;ndash;1616) gained total control of all of Japan, and the country entered a period of prolonged peace that would last until the [[Meiji Restoration]]. During this period, the techniques to use the sword underwent a transition from a primarily utilitarian art for killing, to one encompassing a philosophy of personal development and spiritual perfection.

The terminology used in Japanese swordsmanship is somewhat ambiguous. Many names have been used for various aspects of the art or to encompass the art as a whole.

==== Kenjutsu ====
{{Main|Kenjutsu}}

{{Nihongo|''Kenjutsu''|剣術:けんじゅつ}} literally means "the art/science of the sword".  Although the term has been used as a general term for swordsmanship as a whole, in modern times, ''kenjutsu'' refers more to the specific aspect of swordsmanship dealing with partnered sword training. It is the oldest form of training and, at its simplest level, consists of two partners with swords drawn, practicing combat drills.  Historically practiced with wooden katana (''[[bokken]]''), this most often consists of pre-determined forms, called ''[[kata]]'', or sometimes called ''kumitachi'', and similar to the partner drills practiced in kendo. Among advanced students, ''kenjutsu'' training may also include increasing degrees of freestyle practice.

==== Battōjutsu ====
{{Main|Battōjutsu}}

{{Nihongo|''Battōjutsu''|抜刀術:ばっとうじゅつ}}, literally meaning "the art/science of drawing a sword", and developed in the mid-15th century, is the aspect of swordsmanship focused upon the efficient draw of the sword, cutting down one's enemy, and returning the sword to its [[scabbard]] (''[[saya (scabbard)|saya]]''). The term came into use specifically during the [[Sengoku period|Warring States Period]] (15th&amp;ndash;17th centuries).  Closely related to, but predating ''iaijutsu'', ''battōjutsu'' training emphasizes defensive counter-attacking.  ''Battōjutsu'' training technically incorporates ''kata'', but generally consist of only a few moves, focusing on stepping up to an enemy, drawing, performing one or more cuts, and sheathing the weapon. ''Battōjutsu'' exercises tend to lack the elaborateness, as well as the aesthetic considerations of ''iaijutsu'' or ''iaidō'' ''kata''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}  Finally, note that use of the name alone is not dispositive; what is ''battōjutsu'' to one school may be ''iaijutsu'' to another.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==== Iaijutsu ====
{{Main|Iaijutsu}}

{{Nihongo|''Iaijutsu''|居合術:いあいじゅつ}}, approximately "the art/science of mental presence and immediate reaction", is also the Japanese art of drawing the sword. However, unlike ''battōjutsu'', ''iaijutsu'' tends to be technically more complex, and there is a much stronger focus upon perfecting form. The primary technical aspects are smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard, striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.

=== Naginatajutsu ===
{{Main|Naginatajutsu}}

[[Image:Dog - Hata Rokurozaemon with his dog.jpg|120px|thumb|A samurai wielding a naginata.]]

{{Nihongo|''Naginatajutsu''|長刀術:なぎなたじゅつ}} is the Japanese art of wielding the ''naginata'', a weapon resembling the medieval European [[glaive]] or [[guisarme]]. Most ''naginata'' practice today is in a modernized form (''gendai budō'') called the "way of naginata" (''naginata-dō'') or "new naginata" (''atarashii naginata''), in which competitions are also held.

However, many koryu maintain naginatajutsu in their curriculum. Also of note, during the late [[Edo period]], naginata were used to train women and ladies in waiting. Thus, most naginatajutsu styles are headed by women and most naginata practitioners in Japan are women. This has led to the impression overseas that naginatajutsu is a martial art that was not used by male warriors. In fact, naginatajutsu was developed in early medieval Japan and for a time was widely used by [[samurai]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Sōjutsu ===
{{Main|Sōjutsu}}

{{Nihongo|''Sōjutsu''|槍術:そうじゅつ}} is the Japanese art of fighting with the [[spear]] (''[[yari]]''). For most of Japan's history, ''sōjutsu'' was practiced extensively by traditional schools. In times of war, it was a primary skill of many soldiers. Today it is a minor art taught in very few schools.

=== Shinobi no jutsu ===
{{Main|Shinobi no jutsu|}}

''[[Ninjutsu|Shinobi no jutsu]]'' (aka ''[[Ninjutsu]]'') was developed by groups of people mainly from [[Iga, Mie]] and [[Kōka, Shiga|Kōka]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]] of [[Japan]] who became noted for their skills as [[Espionage|Infiltrators]], scouts, secret agents, and spies.  The training of these ''shinobi'' (''[[ninja]]'') can involve [[disguise]], [[Escapology|escape]], [[wikt:concealment|concealment]], [[assassination]], [[archery]], [[medicine]], [[explosives]], [[poisons]], [[black magic]], and more.

=== Other koryū martial arts ===
The original martial art schools of Japan were almost entirely ''sogo'' (comprehensive) bujutsu. With the long peace of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] there was an increase in specialization with many schools identifying themselves with particular major battlefield weapons. However, there were many additional weapons employed by the warriors of feudal Japan, and an art to wielding each. Usually they were studied as secondary or tertiary weapons within a school but there are exceptions, such as the art of wielding the short staff, (''[[jōdō]]'') which was the primary art taught by the [[Shintō Musō-ryū]].

Other arts existed to teach military skills other than the use of weaponry. Examples of these include [[marine (ocean)|marine]] skills such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[ford (crossing)|river-fording]] (''[[suijutsu]]''), [[equestrianism]] (''[[bajutsu]]''), [[arson]] and [[demolition]] (''kajutsu'').

== Gendai budō ==
{{Main|Gendai budō}}

{{Nihongo|''Gendai budō''|現代武道:げんだいぶどう}}, literally meaning "modern martial way",{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} usually applies to arts founded after the beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Aikido and judo are examples of ''gendai budō'' that were founded in the modern era, while ''iaidō'' represents the modernization of a practice that has existed for centuries.

The core difference is, as was explained under "''koryū''", above, that ''koryū'' arts are practiced as they were when their primary utility was for use in warfare, while the primary purpose of ''gendai budō'' is for self-improvement, with self-defense as a secondary purpose. Additionally, many of the ''gendai budō'' have included a sporting element to them.  Judo and  kendo are both examples of this.

=== Judo ===
{{Main|Judo}}

[[Image:Judo01NoBack.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Judoka executing a throw (o-soto-gari).]]

{{Nihongo|Judo|柔道:じゅうどう|jūdō}}, literally meaning "gentle way" or "way of softness", is a  [[grappling]]-based martial art, practiced primarily as a sport. It contains substantially the same emphasis on the personal, spiritual, and physical self-improvement of its practitioners as can be found throughout ''gendai budō''.

Judo was created by [[Kano Jigoro]] (嘉納 治五郎 ''Kanō Jigorō'', 1860&amp;ndash;1938) at the end of the 19th century.  Kano took the ''koryū'' martial arts he learned (specifically [[Kitō-ryū]] and [[Tenjin Shinyo-ryu|Tenjin Shin'yo-ryū]] jujutsu), and systematically reinvented them into a martial art with an emphasis on freestyle practice ([[randori]]) and competition, while removing harmful jujutsu techniques or limiting them to the [[kata]]. Kano devised a powerful system of new techniques and training methods, which famously culminated on June 11, 1886, in a tournament that would later be dramatized by celebrated Japanese filmmaker [[Akira Kurosawa]] (黒沢 明 ''Kurosawa Akira'', 1910&amp;ndash;1998), in the film "[[Sanshiro Sugata]]" (1943).

Judo became an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport in 1964, and has spread throughout the world. Kano Jigoro's original school, the "[[Kodokan]]", has students worldwide, and many other schools have been founded by Kano's students.

=== Kendo ===
{{Main|Kendo}}

[[Image:FENCING AT AN AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL.jpg|thumb|220px|Kendo training at an agricultural school in Japan around 1920.]]

{{Nihongo|Kendo|剣道:けんどう|kendō}}, meaning the "way of the sword", is based on Japanese sword-fighting.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} It is an evolution of the art of ''kenjutsu'', and its exercises and practice are descended from several particular schools of swordsmanship. The primary technical influence in its development was the ''kenjutsu'' school of Ittō-ryū (founded c. 16th century), whose core philosophy revolved around the concept that all strikes in swordsmanship revolve around the technique ''kiri-oroshi'' (vertical downward cut).  Kendo really began to take shape with the introduction of bamboo swords, called ''[[shinai]]'',{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and the set of lightweight wooden armour, called ''[[bogu]]'', by Naganuma Sirōzaemon Kunisato (長沼 四郎左衛門 国郷, 1688&amp;ndash;1767), which allowed for the practice of strikes at full speed and power without risk of injury to the competitors.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Today, virtually the entire{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} practice of kendo is governed by the [[All Japan Kendo Federation]], founded in 1951. Competitions are judged by points, with the first competitor to score two points on their opponent declared the winner. One point may be scored with a successful and properly executed strike to any of several targets: a thrust to the throat, or a strike to the top of the head, sides of the head, sides of the body, or forearms. Practitioners also compete in forms (''kata'') competitions, using either wooden or blunted metal swords, according to a set of forms promulgated by the AJKF.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

=== Iaidō ===
{{Main|Iaidō}}

{{Nihongo|''Iaidō''|居合道:いあいどう}}, which would be "the way of mental presence and immediate reaction", is nominally the modernization of ''iaijutsu'', but in practice is frequently identical to ''iaijutsu''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The replacement of ''jutsu'' with ''dō'' is part of the 20th century emphasis upon personal and spiritual development;{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} an evolution that took place in many martial arts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the case of ''iaidō'', some schools merely changed in name without altering the curriculum, and others embraced the wholesale change from a combat-orientation to spiritual growth.

=== Aikido ===
{{Main|Aikido}}

[[Image:Shihonage.jpg|thumb|220px|Aikido shihōnage technique.]]

{{Nihongo|Aikido|合氣道:あいきどう|aikidō}} means "the way to harmony with [[qi|ki]]". It is a Japanese martial art developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (植芝 盛平 ''Ueshiba Morihei'', 1883 &amp;ndash; 1969). The art consists of "striking", "throwing" and "joint locking" techniques and is known for its fluidity and blending with an attacker, rather than meeting "force with force". Emphasis is upon joining with the rhythm and intent of the opponent in order to find the optimal position and timing, when the opponent can be led without force. Aikidō is also known for emphasizing the personal development of its students, reflecting the spiritual background of its founder.

Morihei Ueshiba developed aikido mainly from [[Daitō-ryū aiki-jūjutsu]] incorporating training movements such as those for the ''yari'' (spear), ''[[jō]]'' (a short [[quarterstaff]]), and perhaps also ''juken'' ([[bayonet]]). Arguably the strongest influence is that of ''kenjutsu'' and in many ways, an aikidō practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.

=== Kyūdō ===
{{Main|Kyūdō}}
{{See also|Yabusame}}

[[File:Kyudo Kai 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A full draw (''kai'').]]

{{Nihongo|''Kyūdō''|弓道:きゅうどう}}, which means “way of the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]]", is the modern name for Japanese [[archery]]. Originally in Japan, kyujutsu, the “art of the bow", was a discipline of the samurai, the Japanese warrior [[Social class|class]]. The bow is a long range weapon that allowed a military unit to engage an opposing force while it was still far away. If the [[Yabusame|archers were mounted on horseback]], they could be used to even more devastating effect as a mobile weapons platform. Archers were also used in sieges and sea battles.

However, from the 16th century onward, firearms slowly displaced the bow as the dominant battlefield weapon. As the bow lost its significance as a weapon of war, and under the influence of [[Buddhism]], [[Shinto]], [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]], Japanese archery evolved into kyudō, the “way of the bow". In some schools kyudō is practiced as a highly refined contemplative practice, while in other schools it is practiced as a sport.

=== Karate ===
{{Main|Karate}}

{{Nihongo|Karate|空手|karate}} literally means "empty hand". It is also sometimes called {{nihongo|"the way of the empty hand"|空手道|karatedō}}.

Karate originated in and, is technically, [[Okinawa]]n, formerly known as the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], but now a part of present-day Japan. Karate is a fusion of pre-existing [[Okinawan martial arts]], called "''te''", and [[Chinese martial arts]]. It is an art that has been adopted and developed by practitioners on the Japanese main island of [[Honshu]].

Karate's route to [[Honshu]] began with [[Gichin Funakoshi]] (船越 義珍 ''Funakoshi Gichin'', 1868&amp;ndash;1957), who is called the father of karate, and is the founder of [[Shotokan]] karate. Although some Okinawan karate practitioners were already living and teaching in [[Honshū]], Funakoshi gave public demonstrations of karate in [[Tokyo]] at a physical education exhibition sponsored by the ministry of education in 1917, and again in 1922. As a result, karate training was subsequently incorporated into Japan's public school system. It was also at this time that the white uniforms and the ''[[kyū]]''/''[[dan rank|dan]]'' ranking system (both originally implemented by judo's founder, Kano Jigoro) were adopted.

Karate practice is primarily characterized by linear punching and kicking techniques executed from a stable, fixed stance. Many styles of karate practiced today incorporate the forms (''[[kata]]'') originally developed by Funakoshi and his teachers and many different weapons traditionally concealed as farm implements by the peasants of Okinawa. Many karate practitioners also participate in light- and no-contact competitions while some (ex. [[kyokushin|kyokushin karate]]) still compete in full-contact competitions with little or no protective gear.

=== Shorinji Kempo ===
{{Main|Shorinji Kempo}}

{{nihongo|Shorinji Kempo|少林寺拳法|shōrinji-kenpō}} is a post-World War II system of self-defense and self-improvement training (行: ''gyo'' or discipline) known as the modified version of [[Shaolin Kung Fu]]. There are two primary technique categories such as ''gōhō'' (strikes, kicks and blocks) and ''jūhō'' (pins, joint locks and dodges). It was established in 1947 by {{nihongo|[[Doshin So]]|宗 道臣|Sō Dōshin}} who had been in [[Manchuria]] during World War II and who on returning to his native Japan after World War II saw the need to overcome the devastation and re-build self-confidence of the Japanese people on a massive scale. 
 
Although Shorinji Kempo was originally introduced in Japan in the late 1940s and 1950s through large scale programmes involving employees of major national organizations (e.g. Japan Railways) it subsequently became popular in many other countries. Today, according to the World Shorinji Kempo Organization (WSKO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Shorinji Kempo Organization |url=http://www.shorinjikempo.or.jp/wsko/wh-shorinji/index.html |work=World Shorinji Kempo Organization |publisher=World Shorinji Kempo Organization |accessdate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729051354/http://www.shorinjikempo.or.jp/wsko/wh-shorinji/index.html |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are almost 1.5 million practitioners in 33 countries.

== Philosophical and strategic concepts ==

=== Aiki ===
{{Main|Aiki (martial arts principle)}}

The principle of {{Nihongo|''aiki''|合気}} is particularly difficult to describe or explain. The most simple translation of ''aiki'', as "joining energy", belies its philosophical depth.  Generally, it is the principle of matching your opponent in order to defeat him. It is this concept of "matching", or "joining", or even "harmonizing" (all valid interpretations of ''ai'') that contains the complexity. One may "match" the opponent in a clash of force, possibly even resulting in a mutual kill. This is not ''aiki''. ''Aiki'' is epitomized by the notion of joining physically and mentally with the opponent for the express purpose of avoiding a direct clash of force. In practice, ''aiki'' is achieved by first joining with the motion of the opponent (the physical aspect) as well as the intent (the mental portion), then overcoming the will of the opponent, redirecting their motion and intent.

Historically, this principle was used for destructive purposes; to seize an advantage and kill one's opponent. The modern art of aikido is founded upon the principle that the control of the opponent achieved by the successful application of ''aiki'' may be used to defeat one's opponent without harming them.

=== Attitude ===
''Kokoro'' (心:こころ) is a concept that crosses through many martial arts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} but has no single discrete meaning. Literally translating as "heart", in context it can also mean "character" or "attitude." Character is a central concept in karate, and in keeping with the ''do'' nature of modern karate, there is a great emphasis on improving oneself. It is often said that the art of karate is for self-defense; not injuring one's opponent is the highest expression of the art. Some popularly repeated quotes implicating this concept include:

:"The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the perfection of the character of its participants." -[[Gichin Funakoshi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ribner |first = Susan |author2=Richard Chin |title = The Martial Arts |year = 1978 |isbn =0-06-024999-4 |page = 95 |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Budō ===

=== Bushidō ===
{{Main|Bushidō}}

A code of honor for samurai way of life, in principle similar to [[chivalry]] but culturally very different. Literally "the way of the warrior", those dedicated to Bushido have exemplary skill with a sword or bow, and can withstand great pain and discomfort. It emphasizes courage, bravery, and loyalty to their lord (daimyō) above all.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Words that I have often heard are that "everything begins with ''rei'' and ends with ''rei''". The word itself, however, can be interpreted in several ways; it is the ''rei'' of ''reigi'' meaning "etiquette, courtesy, politeness" and it is also the ''rei'' of ''keirei'', "salutation" or "bow". The meaning of ''rei'' is sometimes explained in terms of ''kata'' or ''katachi'' ("formal exercises" and "form" or "shape"). It is of prime importance not only in karate but in all modern martial arts. For the purpose in modern martial arts, let us understand ''rei'' as the ceremonial bow in which courtesy and decorum are manifest.

He who would follow the way of karate must be courteous, not only in training but in daily life. While humble and gentle, he should never be servile. His performance of the kata should reflect boldness and confidence. This seemingly paradoxical combination of boldness and gentleness leads ultimately to harmony. It is true, as Master Funakoshi used to say, that the spirit of karate would be lost without courtesy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kiai ===
{{Main|Kiai}}

A term describing 'fighting spirit'.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
In practical use this often refers to the scream or shout made during an attack, used for proper breathing as well as debilitating or distracting the enemy.

=== Hard and soft methods ===
{{Main|Hard and soft (martial arts)}}

[[Image:Yin yang.svg|thumb|right|150 px|The "yin-yang" symbol (Chinese: ''[[taijitu]]'').]]

There are two underlying strategic methodologies to the application of force in Japanese martial arts. One is the {{Nihongo|hard method|剛法|gōhō}}, and the other is the {{Nihongo|soft method|柔法|jūhō}}. Implicit in these concepts is their separate but equal and interrelated nature, in keeping with their philosophical relationship to the Chinese principles of [[yin and yang]] (Jap.: ''in'' and ''yō'').

The hard method is characterized by the direct application of counter-force to an opposing force. In practice, this may be a direct attack, consisting of movement directly towards the opponent, coinciding with a strike towards the opponent. A defensive technique where the defender stands their ground to block or parry (directly opposing the attack by stopping it or knocking it aside) would be an example of a hard method of defense. Hard method techniques are generally conceptualized as being linear.

The soft method is characterized by the indirect application of force, which either avoids or redirects the opposing force. For example, receiving an attack by slipping past it, followed by adding force to the attacker's limb for the purpose of unbalancing an attacker is an example of soft method. Soft method techniques are generally conceptualized as being circular.

These definitions give rise to the often illusory distinction between "hard-style" and "soft-style" martial arts. In truth, most styles technically practice both, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole.

=== Openings, initiative and timing ===
{{See also|Maai}}

Openings, initiative, and timing are deeply interrelated concepts applicable to self-defense and competitive combat. They each denote different considerations relevant to successfully initiating or countering an attack.

{{Nihongo|Openings|隙|suki}} are the foundation of a successful attack. Although possible to successfully injure an opponent who is ready to receive an attack, it is obviously preferable to attack when and where one's opponent is open. What it means to be open may be as blatant as an opponent becoming tired and lowering their guard (as in physically lowering their hands), or as subtle as a momentary lapse in concentration. In the classical form of combat between masters, each would stand almost entirely motionless until the slightest opening was spotted; only then would they launch as devastating an attack as they could muster, with the goal of incapacitating their opponent with a single blow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese martial arts, {{Nihongo|"initiative"|先|sen}} is "the decisive moment when a killing action is initiated."&lt;ref name="Sen"&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Lowry
| first = Dave
| authorlink = Dave Lowry (martial arts)
| title = Sen (Taking the Initiative)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two types of initiative in Japanese martial arts, {{Nihongo|early initiative|先の先|sen no sen}}, and {{Nihongo|late initiative|後の先|go no sen}}. Each type of initiative complements the other, and has different advantages and weaknesses. Early initiative is the taking advantage of an opening in an opponent's guard or concentration (''see ''suki'', supra''). To fully take the early initiative, the attack launched must be with total commitment and lacking in any hesitation, and virtually ignoring the possibility of a counter-attack by the opponent. Late initiative involves an active attempt to induce an attack by the opponent that will create a weakness in the opponent's defenses, often by faking an opening that is too enticing for the opponent to pass up.&lt;ref name="Sen"/&gt;

All of the above concepts are integrated into the idea of the combat {{Nihongo|interval or timing|間合い|maai}}. ''Maai'' is a complex concept, incorporating not just the distance between opponents, but also the time it will take to cross the distance,  and angle and rhythm of attack. It is specifically the exact "position" from which one opponent can strike the other, after factoring in the above elements. For example, a faster opponent's ''maai'' is farther away than a slower opponent. It is ideal for one opponent to maintain ''maai'' while preventing the other from doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Seniors and juniors ===
{{Main|Senpai}}

The relationship between {{Nihongo|senior students|先輩|senpai}} and {{Nihongo|junior students|後輩|kōhai}} is one with its origins not in martial arts, but rather in Japanese and Asian culture generally. It underlies Japanese interpersonal relationships in many contexts, such as business, school, and sports. It has become part of the teaching process in Japanese martial arts schools. A senior student is senior to all students who either began training after him or her, or who they outrank. The role of the senior student is crucial to the indoctrination of the junior students to etiquette, work ethic, and other virtues important to the school. The junior student is expected to treat their seniors with respect, and plays an important role in giving the senior students the opportunity to learn leadership skills. Senior students may or may not teach formal classes, but in every respect their role is as a teacher to the junior students, by example and by providing encouragement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Ranking systems ===
{{Main|Menkyo kaiden|Kyū|Dan rank}}
There are ultimately two ranking systems in the Japanese martial arts, although some schools have been known to blend these two together.  The older system, usual prior to 1868, was based a series of licenses or ''menkyo''. There were generally very few levels culminating in the license of total transmission (''menkyo kaiden'').

In the modern system, first introduced in the martial arts through judo, students progress by promotion through a series of grades (kyū), followed by a series of degrees (dan), pursuant to formal testing procedures.  Some arts use only white and black belts to distinguish between levels, while others use a progression of colored belts for kyū levels.

=== Forms ===
{{Main|Kata}}

It has often been said that forms (''kata'') are the backbone of the martial arts. Nevertheless, different schools and styles put a varying amount of emphasis upon their practice.

'''John Connor''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the primary protagonist of the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]]. Created by [[screenwriter|writer]] and [[film director|director]] [[James Cameron]], the character is first referred to in the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'' and first appears in its 1991 [[sequel]] ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' initially portrayed by [[Michael Edwards (actor)|Michael Edwards]] (briefly as the older Connor) and then by teenage actor [[Edward Furlong]] throughout the remainder of the film; in addition, [[Linda Hamilton]]'s real-life son Dalton Abbot played John as a toddler in a dream sequence. The character is subsequently portrayed in the films, [[Nick Stahl]] in ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003), [[Christian Bale]] in ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009), [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] in ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' (2015) and Jude Collie as the young John in the [[Terminator 6|upcoming untitled sixth installment]] (2019) with Furlong's facial likeness through CGI, as well as the television series  [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] and John De Vito in ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' (2008–2009) as the teenager and little John and finally [[Gideon Emery]], who voiced the character in a [[Terminator Salvation (video game)|video game based on the fourth film]] respectively.

In the fifth film, John Connor was infected by a Terminator named [[Skynet (Terminator)|Alex]] and becomes the '''[[T-3000]]''', which serves as the antagonist of the series.&lt;ref name="NotWelsh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianbale.net/articles/2000/imdb2000.htm |quote=I was born in Wales but I'm not Welsh – I'm English |title=Christian Bale: American Psycho |publisher=IMDB News |accessdate=2008-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723041855/http://www.christianbale.net/articles/2000/imdb2000.htm |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Gina|last=Serpe|title=Bale Goes Batty For Terminator 4|url=http://www6.comcast.net/entertainment/articles/eonline/2007/12/02/9864803c-63b6-42a6-b26f-4c2b3d101a6b/|work=|publisher=Comcast.net Entertainment|date=2 December 2007|accessdate=2007-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221141025/http://www6.comcast.net/entertainment/articles/eonline/2007/12/02/9864803c-63b6-42a6-b26f-4c2b3d101a6b/|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[narrative]] of his [[fictional universe]], John Connor is a [[messiah|messianic figure]] (born on 28 February 1985) who will lead [[Resistance (Terminator)|the Resistance]] to defeat an empire of [[Terminator (character concept)|robotic Terminators]] amassed by [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] (the rogue military supercomputer) following Judgment Day (a [[cybernetic revolt]] [[doomsday event]]). When his mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], became the target of a [[time travel in fiction|time travelling]] Terminator unit ([[Terminator (character)|T-800 (Model 101)]]) in the first film ''The Terminator'', John sent resistance fighter [[Kyle Reese]] to protect her, knowing Kyle and Sarah would later conceive John himself. With foreknowledge from his parents, John fends off Terminator assassination attempts in the second and third films before Judgment Day. In the fourth film, John fights with the Resistance in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic setting]] after Skynet has taken over. As the series' central plot heavily involves the concept of time travel, the story of the character is often non-linear and portrays many possible outcomes, for example ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'', and television series ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' continue from the ending of ''Terminator 2'' but are depicted as taking place in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate timelines]],&lt;ref name="ign1"&gt;{{Cite web| last=Goldman | first=Eric | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/798/798086p1.html | title=Guiding the Sarah Connor Chronicles | publisher=IGN.com | date=2007-06-22 | accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.terminatorchronicles.com/sarah-connor-chronicles-to-create-new-t3-timeline&lt;/ref&gt; while in ''Terminator Genisys'' (2015) revisits and [[reboot (fiction)|changes the events]] of 1984's ''The Terminator''.

===''The Terminator''===
In ''[[The Terminator]]'', John is mentioned and is the basis of the film. The Terminator ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) is attempting to kill Sarah Connor ([[Linda Hamilton]]) because she will be his mother, but does not make a physical appearance. However, at the end of the film, Sarah is shown to be [[pregnant]] with John.

===''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''===
John makes his first true appearance in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' which takes place in 1995, played by [[Edward Furlong]]. He was a 10-year-old juvenile delinquent living with foster parents ([[Jenette Goldstein]] and [[Xander Berkeley]]) while his mother (Hamilton) was at a [[psychiatric hospital|hospital]] for the mentally insane. Though he is informed of his destiny of his future conflict with Skynet, young John is skeptical of his mother's claims of his fate as humanity's leader. One day, while in an arcade with a friend, the [[T-1000]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) and the T-800 (Schwarzenegger) - a reprogrammed android sent by John's future self, fight over him. This starts a chase sequence where the T-800 and John try to lose the T-1000; this event validates John's mother's warning to him about Skynet. Later that night, his mother breaks out and he and the T-800 go to save her, and the three escape. John teaches The Terminator how to be like a human; teaching him sayings like "[[Hasta la vista, baby|''hasta la vista'', baby!]]." He forms an emotional bond with the Terminator, coming to regard it as a father figure, and does not want the Terminator to destroy himself at the end of the film, despite the Terminator's warning that allowing him to continue existing creates the risk that his chip could be used to [[reverse engineering|recreate]] Skynet at some future date. John Connor is briefly seen at the beginning of the film in a flash-forward as an adult, played by [[Michael Edwards (actor)|Michael Edwards]]. Dalton Abbot (Linda Hamilton's son), also played John as a toddler in a dream sequence.

====Alternate ending====
The alternate ending for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' depicts Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. John Connor has become a U.S. senator and father to a daughter in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity. While Sarah states that Judgment Day has been averted, John accepts that he still has a destiny to make a difference, which is what motivates him to enter politic, works with likeminded public servants who share his ideals. In contrast to his alternate self from the beginning of the film, John, despite still struggling to improve people's lives in the new timeline, leads a happier life due to not carrying the responsibility and burden of the weight of the world.

===''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines''===
In ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'', which takes place in 2004, John Connor, portrayed by [[Nick Stahl]], is now a young adult. John has been living [[off-the-grid]] after the events of the second film, even as the original Judgment Day deadline on August 29, 1997 came to pass without incident. His mother eventually developed terminal [[leukemia]] and died. In the film, John crosses paths with Katherine "Kate" Brewster ([[Claire Danes]]), a former classmate from when he was living with his foster parents. He is attacked by a [[T-X]] Terminator ([[Kristanna Loken]]), which was sent from the future. Unlike its predecessors, the T-X's objective was to terminate his future officers as secondary targets because John's location was unknown. When it encounters John it changes its priority to focus entirely on him and Kate. A protector T-850 (Schwarzenegger), who is a doppelgänger of John's previous protector, is also sent back in time to protect him, explaining that Judgment Day had only been delayed to July 25, 2004, which happens to be only hours away. The T-850 also states that it was not sent from the future by John, but by Kate in 2033, who is his future wife and second-in-command - John had actually been killed by that very Terminator on July 4, 2032, as Skynet believed it to be the most suitable for such a mission due to John's emotional attachment to its model. Although John and Kate spend much of the film trying to halt the launching of [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]], they are misled to believe Skynet's core is in an underground facility, only to find themselves locked and protected in a secure bunker as the first nuclear assault is launched on the United States as a result of Skynet's manipulations; Lieutenant General Robert Brewster, who was Skynet's creator and Kate's father, mislead them to the bunker in order to assure Kate's protection, and Skynet is pure software and has already spread to every server worldwide therefore impossible to shutdown. It is via the radios in this bunker that John begins to broadcast messages to lay the groundwork to help survivors and organize the Resistance.

===''Terminator Salvation''===
In ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', which is set fourteen years later in the year 2018, John Connor, portrayed by [[Christian Bale]], is now an older, battle-experienced, Resistance soldier married to Kate Brewster ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]), who serves as a medic and is now pregnant with his child. Kate also assists command with her husband's Tech-Com unit. Since Judgment Day, John has been broadcasting radio messages to both the Resistance forces and surviving refugees in an effort to maintain morale and hope. The story features a new character named Marcus Wright ([[Sam Worthington]]), and a younger Kyle Reese ([[Anton Yelchin]]). John starts as one of the many foot soldiers who make up the Resistance movement based in California. Despite having extensive prior knowledge of the machines and Skynet's capabilities, John is largely dismissed by General Hugh Ashdown ([[Michael Ironside]]) who runs the resistance organization. He considers Connor a delusional false prophet at best and a dangerous liability to their operations at worst. Nonetheless, there are pockets of people within the Resistance who have come to believe in John's experiences and judgment based on their own first hand experiences serving with him. In addition, the majority of the Resistance is gradually losing faith towards the Resistance Command due to Ashdown's ruthless and vicious tactics that cost many of his own soldiers and civilians' lives. Later on, towards the middle of the film, John learns that Kyle Reese has been placed in a detention center by Skynet which is aware of Kyle's future role as John's father, classifying Kyle as its primary target and John as its secondary objective even over the current leaders of the resistance- and sets out to rescue him, with Marcus Wright leading him to the base. Upon arrival, John faces off with a T-800 crafted in the image of the android unit that he and his family have encountered previously. John is hurt during his encounter with the T-800 and receives multiple cuts to the face, mirroring the same scars seen on John's face in the opening scene of ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''. Marcus helps him destroy the T-800, but due to injury, John's heart is too badly damaged and Marcus offers his own to John. In addition, after the Resistance Command is caught into Skynet's trap, John and his subordinates takeover the authority of its forces with no opposition. John's ending statement is that though this battle has been won, the war is far from over.

===''Terminator Genisys''===
{{see also|T-3000}}
John Connor is portrayed by [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] in the fifth installment, ''[[Terminator Genisys]].'' In an alternate timeline, following a confrontation with a T-5000 ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) on the seemingly final day of the war, just as Kyle Reese ([[Jai Courtney]]) is being sent back to save Sarah ([[Emilia Clarke]]), John is forcibly transformed into a nanocyte cyborg, the T-3000, the process changing his allegiance from the resistance to Skynet and becomes sociopathic. Skynet then sends the T-3000 back in time to ensure its creation in the altered timeline- now 'believing' that the future requires [[technological singularity|man and machine to come together]] like he has – in a parallel change with the Terminator from ''The Terminator'' to ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''. After being converted he travels back in time to 2014 and joins Cyberdyne to help create a new version of Skynet after the destruction of the original Terminator prevented its chip being used, working with Miles and Danny Dyson to perfect the development of the new Genisys system, turning Skynet into a massive digital network rather than a single computer system like it was originally. Three years later, despite his superior physical strength, he was later destroyed by "The Guardian" Terminator (Schwarzenegger)- a T-800 reprogrammed and sent into the past by an unknown party to protect Sarah Connor- when both of them were trapped inside a prototype time machine; with the machine just capable of generating the electromagnetic energy that prevented non-living tissue travelling through time without actually generating a temporal portal, Connor is ripped apart while trapped at the heart of the machine after earlier battle-damage disrupted his ability to maintain his organic shell, while the 'Guardian' is thrown out of the machine and falls into a nearby pool of poly-mimetic alloy, allowing its CPU and what remained of its endoskeleton to be absorbed by the metal and convert it into a nano-android similar to the T-1000. It is ambiguous as to whether a version of John Connor will exist in the altered timeline, with John himself stating that his existence is a paradox that is no longer tied to Sarah and Kyle conceiving him (though this view may be attributed to his semi-insanity after his transformation).

====Production background====
The T-3000's sole mission is to protect and ensure the ultimate survival of Skynet, which seeks to eliminate the human race with its global machine network. The T-3000 describes itself as neither machine nor human; rather, it is a hybrid nanotechnological [[cyborg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/04/13/im-not-machine-im-not-man-im-more-new-trailer-for-terminator-genisys/|publisher=bleedingcool.com|title="I'm Not Machine, I'm Not Man... I'm More." - New Trailer For Terminator Genisys|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=April 13, 2015|first=Dan |last=Wickline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[David Ellison]] explains that the title ''Terminator Genisys'' "[is] in reference to genesis, which is in reference to the [[technological singularity|singularity]] and the [[posthuman|man-machine hybrid]] that John Connor ends up being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-terminator-genisys-20150702-story.html|publisher=[[latimes.com]]|title=Why was 'Terminator Genisys' spelled with a 'Y'?|accessdate=2015-07-08|date=July 3, 2015|first=MEREDITH|last=WOERNER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The on-screen representation of the T-3000 was made by British effects company [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]]. Footage combines Jason Clarke filmed on set, [[key frame|keyframed]] animation, and [[motion capture]]. Supervisor Peter Bebb said that the company tried to design the T-3000 like a computer would do it, focusing on design and battle efficiency, "form follows function". Given it is a Terminator built out of a human, the result is "a pure robot that sits under flesh structure", still retaining an overall human shape. The mechanical cells tried to resemble the material on [[stealth aircraft]], with a result described as "more [[Gloss and matte paint|matte]] than metal", resembling a slightly [[Iridescence|iridescent]] [[ceramic matrix composite|ceramic carbon]].&lt;ref name=fxguide&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/terminator-new-makes-new-models-new-vfx/|title=Terminator: New makes.

[[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] portrays John Connor in the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] television series, ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]''. John is Sarah's son and the future leader of the human resistance. He is only fifteen years old at the beginning of the show, turning sixteen in the season one finale, and seventeen throughout season two, although it isn't mentioned. As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. John De Vito plays a young John Connor in two episodes "Queen's Gambit" and "To the Lighthouse".

===Casting and production background===
Dekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Goldman | first=Eric | url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/749/749891p1.html | title=Heroes Star Set to Play John Connor | publisher=IGN.com |date=December 7, 2006 | accessdate=2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the ''Terminator'' films, Dekker says "They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know a lot of the people that I hear from really, really care about John".&lt;ref name="superheroflix"&gt;{{cite web | last=Brokaw | first=Francine | url=http://www.superheroflix.com/tv/news/61/21561.php | title=Inside The Sarah Connor Chronicles | publisher=Superheroflix.com | date=August 2, 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825213429/http://www.superheroflix.com/tv/news/61/21561.php | archivedate=August 25, 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dekker describes his character as "a continuation of Eddie Furlong's character" but "he's in a darker, more mature place now".

The show tells the story of the Connors in alternate timeline from ''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines''.&lt;ref name="ign1" /&gt; It branches off from the shared back story of ''Terminator 2'', and according to consulting producer James Middleton "is [a new] version of ''T3''."&lt;ref name="ew1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Svetkey |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20170519,00.html |title=Sarah Connor Chronicles |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premise===
At the beginning of the series in 1999, John and Sarah try to settle down to normal lives after the events of the second film, but they are in fear of being captured for blowing up Cyberdyne during the events of the second film. While at school, John is attacked by a Terminator posing as a teacher, and is protected by a reprogrammed Terminator named "[[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]]". John learns that Judgment Day has not been prevented, only postponed to April 21, 2011. John does not want to run anymore and asks Sarah to stop Skynet from being created. Cameron uses time dilation technology (built by "The Engineer" from the future) to send all three of them to 2007, just before Skynet is created, so that they can stop it.

Settling down in 2007, John enrolls in Campo de Cahuenga High School under the name of John Baum, after author [[L. Frank Baum]] who wrote ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', a book that Sarah says was John's favorite when he was younger, where he is friends with his fellow students [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Morris|Morris]] and [[Riley Dawson]]. He becomes acquainted with his father's older brother, [[Derek Reese]], who is also a resistance fighter sent back in time to help them. This version of John is shown to be a highly skilled [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacker]] (a nod from ''Terminator 2''), even being able to hack into [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Vick Chamberlain|a Terminator]]'s [[Central processing unit|CPU]] in order to read the information it contains, as well as easily hacking into the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] database. He claims that he could hack a computer system 'in (his) sleep'. He is also proficient in [[chess]], lock-picking, self-defense, and weaponry, all of which were part of his training during his childhood.  The relationship dynamic between John and Cameron is different than with the "Uncle Bob" T-800 by virtue of her size/gender, with some degree of sexual tension. He also develops a relationship with Riley Dawson, a high school classmate, who, unknown to him, is also from the future and working with Jesse Flores, a resistance fighter and lover of Derek Reese. Jesse's plan was for John to become infatuated with Riley, making her a threat to John's security. This would force Cameron to kill Riley, thereby alienating John from her. Apparently, after Judgment Day, rumors abound of an unnatural relationship between the two that affects John's tactical decision making, and some are unsettled that he has appointed a [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] as one of his lieutenants.

==Video games==
===''Terminator Salvation''===
{{Main|Terminator Salvation (video game)}}
In the video game ''Terminator Salvation'', which is set two years before the events of the film. In 2016, John Connor (voiced by [[Gideon Emery]]) and Blair Williams ([[Moon Bloodgood]]) are on a mission to rescue a man named David Weston (Sean Cory Cooper), until they team up with Angie Salter ([[Rose McGowan]]) and Barnes ([[Common (rapper)|Common]]) to fight the machines.

==Attraction==
===''T2-3D: Battle Across Time''===
{{Main|T2-3D: Battle Across Time}} 
[[Edward Furlong]] reprises his role from ''Terminator 2'' in this [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|Universal Studios]] attraction. Set six years after the events of the second film, John and Sarah once again attempt to prevent Judgment Day by infiltrating [[Skynet (Terminator)|Cyberdyne]] to prevent the completion of Skynet. They interrupt Kimberley Duncan's presentation of the T-70 Terminators and attempt to evacuate the facility, but the [[T-1000]] arrives and nearly terminates them. However, the [[Terminator (character)|T-800]] arrives from the future and saves them. The T-800 and John then travel to the future while Sarah stays behind. In the future, they journey across the post apocalyptic landscape, towards Skynet, and are chased by various machines. Eventually, John and the T-800 reach Skynet, housed inside a giant, glowing pyramid. They descend to Skynet Central Core where they face off the T-1000000, a giant liquid-metal spider-like Terminator that guards the CPU. As they run out of time, the T-800 sends John back to the present. After John makes his return, the T-800 destroys itself, the T-1000000, and Skynet in a massive explosion. Back in the present, John and Sarah are reunited.

==Literature==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

===Comic books===
With the success of ''T2'', John Connor would appear in the non-canon Terminator/[[Superman]] crossover ''[[Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future]]'', where DC Comics and Dark Horse Comics teamed Sarah and John Connor up with the [[Superman|Man of Steel]] in an adventure that pitted Superman up against not only Skynet, but also against his old rival [[Hank Henshaw|The Cyborg]]. In this adventure, while trying to protect Sarah and young John, Superman is pulled into the future - the resistance had attempted to recover a Terminator that Skynet had sent back earlier but the machine targeted Superman by mistake, and is then able to help the older John, as well as an older [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] (AKA Steel) take down Skynet once and for all. Meanwhile, back in the past Cyborg makes a deal with Skynet - leaving a message in a Terminator's skull about Superman's weaknesses and subsequently allying himself with a T-X sent back from the future to assist him, while [[Matrix (comics)|Supergirl]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and even [[Lex Luthor]] continue to protect Sarah and young John from wave after wave of Terminator cyborgs, the later models being specifically upgraded to cope with the Superman family. The story concludes with Superman having aided the resistance in destroying Skynet by detonating an EMP in Earth's atmosphere powerful enough to shut down Earth's machines before returning to the past, where the Cyborg is defeated and all Terminator components disposed of in the sun. However, at the end of the comic it is revealed that Lex Luthor has multiple parts of other Terminators. He was continuing to research them since he never was able to capture a fully functional Terminator. This leads the reader to believe that Luthor played a hand in Skynet's creation in the future.

'''Karasuk''' is a [[language family]] proposed by [[George van Driem]] of the [[University of Leiden]] that links the [[Yeniseian languages]] of central Siberia with the [[Burushaski language]] of northern Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;George van Driem (2001) ''Languages of the Himalayas. An Ethnolinguistic Handbook of the Greater Himalayas'', p 1144 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The family is named after the [[Karasuk culture]], which existed in [[Central Asia]] during the [[Bronze Age]] in second millennium BCE. Van Driem postulates the [[Burusho people]] took part in the [[Indo-Aryan migration]] out of Central Asia that resulted in the Indo-European conquest of the [[Indian sub-continent]], while other Karasuk peoples migrated northwards to become the [[Ket people|Yeniseians]]. These claims have recently been picked up by anthropologist and linguist [[Roger Blench]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench (1999) "Language phyla of the Indo-Pacific region: Recent research and classification", in Bellwood &amp; Lilley, eds., ''Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association Bulletin,'' 18:59–76, Australian National University&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for Karasuk is mostly in the verbal and nominal morphology. For example, the [[Grammatical person|second-person]] singular prefixes on intransitive verbs are {{IPA|[ɡu-, ɡó-]}} in Burushaski and {{IPA|[ku-, ɡu-]}} in [[Ket language|Ket]].  Ket has two verbal declensions, one prefixed with ''d-'' and one with ''b-'', and Burushaski likewise has two, one prefixed with ''d-'' and one without such a marker.  However, neither the Burushaski nor the Yeniseian verbal morphology has been rigorously analysed,&lt;ref&gt;Van Driem 2001:1146&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewers have found the evidence to be weak.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Bielmeier (review, 2003), "On the Languages of the Himalayas and their Links (nearly) around the World", ''EBHR'' 24:96&lt;/ref&gt;

While Yeniseian has been proposed to be related to the [[Na-Dene languages]] of North America, as part of a newly named [[Dene–Yeniseian]] family, the relevant morphological correspondences between Na-Dene and Yeniseian have not been found in Burushaski.

'''Laying''' is the [[skill]] of making equipment level. It usually involves moving equipment in small motions so that [[spirit level]]s are centralised in all [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]s. Movement is usually done by small [[worm gear]]s or other fine setting devices for accurate small movements, together with other more coarse [[gear]]s to allow large swings in motion for quick movement between different settings.

Equipment that requires laying before it is can be used accurately includes:
* [[theodolite]]s
* [[gun]]s and [[howitzer]]s in the [[indirect fire]] mode

==See also==
* [[Gun laying]]

==Other uses==
Laying is also the name given to backing an event to lose, for example betting on a horse to lose.

"Laying Out" is a term given to a diving catch in sports.

'''Laying''' is also incorrectly used when the word '[[Lying (position)|lying]]' is meant, as when someone says ''a person is laying down'' when ''a person is lying down'' is what was intended.

'''''Memories with Maya''''' is a [[hard science fiction]] novel by the author Clyde Dsouza. It has been received well by the [[transhumanism]] and the science community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/book-review-memories-with-maya |title=book review &amp;#124; Memories with Maya |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel looks at how [[augmented reality]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] will merge to augment human beings in ways that will affect emotions, intimate human relationships, and our evolution as a species.

==Plot==
The story is a first person narrative told through the eyes of [[protagonist]] Daniel (Dan). Dan lives life on his own terms, convinced that he can hack his destiny through the use of technology to better his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/in-memories-with-maya-human-sexuality-gets-an-upgrade-1172882567 |title=In Memories with Maya, human sexuality gets an upgrade |publisher=Io9.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that prayer is panacea for the weak and he can steer the course of his life through the use of logic, technology and science.

With his close friend Krish, they merge [[artificial intelligence]] and [[augmented reality]] technology to create the ''Wizer'', a [[smartglasses|wearable visor]] much like [[Google Glass]] but powered by [[artificial general intelligence]]. The Wizer plays a key role in advancing the story and has uses in entertainment, sports, and even [[cyber sex]] via ''Dirrogates'' (a portmanteau of the words Digital and Surrogate, invented by the author)

Mid way through the story a dark side of ''Wizer'' technology and augmented reality comes to the front, with a major tragedy occurring in a nightclub. It changes the course of Dan and Krish's life. Dan experiences a loss that challenges him in no uncertain terms to prove he is capable of hacking his destiny. He faces internal turmoil, battling moral and ethical issues to emerge a [[transhuman]], both in mind and body.

==Reception==
The novel has received praise by science fiction reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |title=Review - Memories With Maya by Clyde DeSouza |publisher=Hard SF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024935/http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has featured the novel on their list of publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/publications#books |title=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies: Publications |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals and science fiction enthusiasts, have said the novel has more than [[hard science fiction]] in its pages, and some reviewers say they were touched on an emotional level as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedhowardnz.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/book-review-memories-with-maya/ |title=Book review – Memories with Maya &amp;#124; Ted Howard NZ's Blog |publisher=Tedhowardnz.wordpress.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer for the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|IEET]] wrote an essay titled: ''Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/nickence20130904 |title=Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that interprets the reach of the technology described in the book and its effect on human relationships, even after death.

The book is a collection of stories, essays, art, and other contributions by various artists, musicians, and writers. It centers around the role of the [[mixtape]] and [[cassette culture]] in the lives of the contributors, which stands as a testimony to the importance of the medium starting in the late 1970s to its relevance today. Here tapes are used mostly to confess love or admiration, or to expose an acquaintance to new and underground music.

==Quotes==

"The mix tape is a form of American folk art: predigested cultural artifacts combined with homespun technology and magic marker turn the mix tape into a message in a bottle. I am no mere consumer of pop culture, it says, but also a producer of it. Mix tapes mark the moment of consumer culture in which listeners attained control over what they heard, in what order and at what cost." Matias Viegener

"I have so many Mix Tape stories it's hard to know where to begin."  Allison Anders

"The mix tape is a list a quotations, a poetic form in fact: the [[Cento (poetry)|cento]] is a poem made up of lines pulled from other poems.  The new poet collects and remixes.  Similarly an operation of taste, it is also cousin to the curious passion of the obsessive collector.  Unable to express himself in 'pure' art, the collector finds himself in obsessive acquisition. Collecting is strangely hot and cold, passionate and calculating."  Matias Viegener

A '''nuclear family''', '''elementary family''' or '''conjugal family''' is a [[family]] group consisting of two parents and their [[child]]ren (one or more).&lt;ref name=BritannicaOnline&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2011 |title=Nuclear family |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/421619/nuclear-family |accessdate=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in contrast to a [[single-parent]] family, to the larger [[extended family]], and to a family with more than two parents. Nuclear families typically center on a [[Marriage|married]] couple;&lt;ref name="BritannicaOnline"/&gt; the nuclear family may have any number of children. There are differences in definition among observers; some definitions allow only biological children that are full-blood siblings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/p70-74.pdf Living Arrangements of Children]&lt;/ref&gt; but others allow for a stepparent and any mix of dependent children including stepchildren and adopted children; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxzZl460258C&amp;pg=PA219 |page=219 |first1=William A. |last1=Haviland |first2=Harald E. L. |last2=Prins |first3=Dana |last3=Walrath |title=Cultural anthropology: the human challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=0-495-09561-3 |edition=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_10/sr10_246.pdf Family Structure and Children’s Health in the United States: Findings From the National Health Interview Survey, 2001–2007]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the expansion to include same-sex couples. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/nuclear-family]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Family structures of a married couple and their children were present in Western Europe and New England in the 17th century, influenced by church and theocratic governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Volo|first1=James M.|last2=Volo|first2=Dorothy Denneen|title=Family life in 17th- and 18th-century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyYRbGzqn08C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2006|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0-313-33199-5|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of [[proto-industrialization]] and early capitalism, the nuclear family became a financially viable social unit.&lt;ref&gt;Traditions and Encounters: A Brief Global History (New York: McGraw Hill, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''nuclear family'' first appeared in the early twentieth century. Alternative definitions have evolved to include family units headed by [[LGBT parenting|same-sex parent]]s&lt;ref name=BritannicaOnline/&gt; and perhaps additional adult relatives who take on a cohabiting parental role;&lt;ref&gt;"Strictly, a nuclear or elementary or conjugal family consists merely of parents and children, though it often includes one or two other relatives as well, for example, a widowed parent or unmarried sibling of one or other spouse."&lt;br&gt;[https://workfamily.sas.upenn.edu/glossary/n/nuclear-family-definitions Sloan Work and Family Research Network], citing Parkin, R. (1997). Kinship: An introduction to basic concepts. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. Retrieved April 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter case, it also receives the name of [[conjugal family]].&lt;ref name=BritannicaOnline/&gt;

The concept that narrowly defines a nuclear family is central to stability in modern society that has been promoted by [[familialist]]s who are [[social conservative]]s in the United States, and has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of actual family relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Miriam M.|title=Sex Role Learning in the Nuclear Family|journal=Child Development|date=1 January 1963|volume=34|issue=2|pages=319–333|doi=10.2307/1126730|jstor=1126730}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Freudian Theories of Identification and Their Derivatives" [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] states, "Very little is known about the extent variation in the behavior of fathers and mothers towards sons and daughters, and even less about the possible effects on such differential treatment." Little is known about how parental behavior and identification processes work, and how children interpret sex role learning. In his theory he uses "identification" with the father in the sense that the son will follow the sex role provided by his father and then for the father to be able identify the difference of the "cross sex" parent for his daughter.

Historians [[Alan Macfarlane]] and [[Peter Laslett]] postulated that nuclear families have been a primary arrangement in England since the 13th century. This primary arrangement was different than the normal arrangements in Southern Europe, in parts of Asia, and the Middle East where it was common for young adults to remain in or marry into the family home. In England multi-generational households were uncommon because young adults would save enough money to move out, into their own household once they married. Sociologist Brigitte Berger argued, "the young nuclear family had to be flexible and mobile as it searched for opportunity and property. Forced to rely on their own ingenuity, its members also needed to plan for the future and develop bourgeois habits of work and saving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-real-roots-of-the-nuclear-family|title=The Real Roots of the Nuclear Family|work=Institute for Family Studies|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berge also mentions that this could be one of the reasons why the Industrial Revolution began in England and other Northwest European countries. However, the historicity of the nuclear family in England has been challenged by Cord Oestmann.&lt;ref name="Oestmann1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cord Oestmann|title=Lordship and Community: The Lestrange Family and the Village of Hunstanton, Norfolk, in the First Half of the Sixteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzCdJgm7qfYC&amp;pg=PA53|year=1994|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-0-85115-351-3|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]], single nuclear family households generally have a higher number of children than co-operative living arrangements according to studies from both the [[Western world]]&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C. Billari |author3=Melinda Mills |journal=European Journal of Population|year=2013|volume=29|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Differences in fertility and family planning practices by type of family|vauthors=Gandotra MM, Pandey D |journal=Journal of Family Welfare|year=1982|volume=29|issue=1|pages=29–40|url=http://www.popline.org/node/396150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies done that shows a difference in the number of children wanted per household according to where they live. Families that live in rural areas wanted to have more kids than families in urban areas. A study done in Japan between October 2011 and February 2012 further researched the effect of area of residence on mean desired number of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=Yasuyo|last2=Yamabe|first2=Shingo|date=2013-01-30|title=Family size preference and factors affecting the fertility rate in Hyogo, Japan|journal=Reproductive Health|volume=10|pages=6|doi=10.1186/1742-4755-10-6|issn=1742-4755|pmc=3563619|pmid=23363875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of the study came to the conclusion that the women living in rural areas with larger families were more likely to want more children, compared to women that lived in urban areas in Japan.

==Usage of the term==
[[File:W.H. Shumard family, circa 1955.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man, woman, and two children smiling outside of a house|An American nuclear family composed of the mother, father, and their children circa 1955]]
[[Merriam-Webster]] dates the term back to 1947,&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;Merriam-Webster Online. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/nuclear%20family "Definition of nuclear family"].&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a reference to the term from 1925; thus it is relatively new.

In its most common usage, the term ''nuclear family'' refers to a household consisting of a [[father]], a [[mother]] and their [[child]]ren&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordadvancedlearnersdictionary.com/dictionary/nuclear-family |title=Nuclear family - Definition and pronunciation |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary |accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; all in one household dwelling.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster /&gt; [[George Murdock]], an observer of families, offered an early description: {{quote|The family is a social group characterized by common residence, economic cooperation and reproduction. It contains adults of both sexes, at least two of whom maintain a socially approved sexual relationship, and one or more children, own or adopted, of the sexually cohabiting adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murdock |first=George Peter |origyear=1949 |year= 1965 |title=Social Structure |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |isbn=0-02-922290-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many individuals are part of two nuclear families in their lives: the family of origin in which they are offspring, and the family of procreation in which they are a parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wx73jGq4_owC&amp;pg=PA27 |page=27 |title=An Introduction to Family Social Work |first1=Donald |last1=Collins |first2=Catheleen |last2=Jordan |first3=Heather |last3=Coleman |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |isbn=0-495-60188-8 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the phrase dates approximately from the [[Atomic Age]], the term "nuclear" is not used here in the context of [[nuclear warfare]] or [[nuclear power]], but instead originates in the same way as [[nuclear fission]], from the noun ''nucleus'', itself originating in the [[Latin]] ''nux'', meaning "nut", i.e. the core of something – thus, the nuclear family refers to all members of the family being part of the same core rather than directly to [[atomic weapons]].

==Compared with extended family==
{{Main|Extended family}}
An extended family group consists of non-nuclear (or "non-immediate") family members considered together with nuclear (or "immediate") family members. When extended family is involved they also influence children's development just as much as the parents would on their own.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaFave|first=Dainel|last2=Thomas|first2=Duncan|date=March 2012|title=Extended family and child well being|url=http://www.colby.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2012/04/extfamily-mar12.pdf|journal=Extended family and child well being|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended family resources are usually shared among those involved adding more of a community aspect to the family unit. This is not just talking about sharing money and physical thing but includes sharing time for example extended family such as [[Grandparent|grandparents]] can watch over their grandchildren allowing parents to continue and pursue careers and creating a healthy and supportive environment the children to grow up in and allows the parents to have much less stress.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Extended families help keep the kids in the family healthier because of all the resources the kids get now that they have other individuals able to help them and support them as they grow up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Changes to family formation==
[[Image:Families US.svg|thumb|300px|From 1970 to 2000, family arrangements in the US became more diverse with no particular household arrangement prevalent enough to be identified as the "average"]]

In 2005, information from the [[United States Census Bureau]] showed that 70% of children in the US live in two-parent families,&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Brian |author2=Stacey C. Sawyer |author3=Carl M. Wahlstrom  |year= 2005 |title=Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, MA |isbn=0-205-36674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 66% of those living with parents who were married, and 60% living with their biological parents. The information also explained that "the figures suggest that the tumultuous shifts in family structure since the late 1960s have leveled off since 1990".&lt;ref name="uscensus"&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Roberts |title=Most Children Still Live in Two-Parent Homes, Census Bureau Reports |date=February 25, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/21/us/21census.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=2008-03-05 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When considered separately from couples without children, [[single-parent]] families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States nuclear families appear to constitute a minority of households – with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt; Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703063353/http://web1.msue.msu.edu/msue/imp/modii/ii493007.html Focus on Michigan's Future: Changing Family and Household Patterns]
&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sociologists, "[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today." (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced{{by whom|date=March 2014}}, ''postmodern family'', intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children."&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships" /&gt; Nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with couples without children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children.

In the UK, the number of nuclear families fell from 39.0% of all households in 1968 to 28.0% in 1992. The decrease accompanied an equivalent increase in the number of single-parent households and in the number of adults living alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgPxQaF4bDAC&amp;pg=PA25 |pages=25–28 |last=Pothan |first=Peter |title=Nuclear family nonsense |work=Third Way |date=September 1992 |publisher=Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern 
|volume=15 |number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sociologists, "[The nuclear family] no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today." (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced{{by whom|date=March 2014}}, ''postmodern family'', intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and couples without children."&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

Professor Wolfgang Haak of [[University of Adelaide|Adelaide University]], detects traces of the nuclear family in prehistoric Central Europe. A 2005 archeological dig in Elau in Germany, analyzed by Haak, revealed genetic evidence suggesting that the 13 individuals found in a grave were closely related. Haak said, "By establishing the genetic links between the two adults and two children buried together in one grave, we have established the presence of the classic nuclear family in a prehistoric context in Central Europe.... Their unity in death suggest[s] a unity in life."&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;

"This does not establish the elemental family to be a universal model or the most ancient institution of human communities. For example, polygamous unions are prevalent in ethnographic data and models of household communities have apparently been involving a high degree of complexity from their origins."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In this study evidence suggests that the nuclear family was embedded with an extended family. The remains of three children (probably siblings based on DNA evidence) were found buried with a woman who was not their mother but may have been an "aunt or a step-mother".&lt;ref&gt;Balter, M. (2008) Prehistoric Family Values, ''ScienceNow Daily News'', Nov. 17.

==North American conservatism==
{{Main|Familialism}}
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
For [[social conservatism]] in the [[Social conservatism in the United States|United States]] and [[Social conservatism in Canada|Canada]], the idea that the nuclear family is [[tradition]]al is an important aspect, where [[Family values|family is seen as the primary unit of society]]. These movements oppose [[alternative family]] forms and social institutions that are seen by them to undermine [[parental authority]]. The numbers of nuclear families is slowly dwindling in the US as more women pursue higher education, develop professional lives, and delay having children until later in their life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/12/17/1-the-american-family-today/|title=1. The American family today|date=2015-12-17|work=Pew Research Center’s Social &amp; Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children and [[Marriage in the United States|marriage]] have become less appealing as many women continue to face societal, familial, and/or peer pressure to give up their education and successful career to focus on stabilizing the home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As diversity in the United States continues to increase, it is becoming difficult for the classically traditional family unit—a heterosexual couple of the same race and ethnicity with two children—to stay the norm&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, calling the relevancy of North American Conservatism into question. Data from 2014 also suggests that [[Single parent|single parents]] and the likelihood of children living with one is also determined by race. Pew Research Center has found that 54% of African-American individuals will be single parents compared to 19% of Caucasian individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Several factors account for the differences in family structure including economic and social class. Differences in education level also change the amount of single parents. In 2014, those with less than a high school education are 46% more likely to be a single parent compared to 12% who have graduated college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Critics of the term "traditional family" point out that in most cultures and at most times, the [[extended family]] model has been most common, not the nuclear family,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/05/13/610777733/parenting-myths-and-facts Parenting Myths And Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; though it has had a longer tradition in England&lt;ref&gt;see {{section link|History of the family|Evolution of household}}&lt;/ref&gt; than in other parts of Europe and Asia which contributed large numbers of immigrants to the Americas.  The nuclear family became the most common form in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bebusinessed.com/history/history-nuclear-families/ History of Nuclear Families]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges''' (24 March 1773&lt;ref&gt;Biographers erroneously gave 14 March as birth date but his baptismal certificate in the Saint-Louis parish says: "The year thousand seven hundred seventy-three" and ""twenty four March" was born and baptized by me, the undersigned, Pierre Louis Hus Forges, son of Louis, musician, and Anne Marchand, his wife.&lt;/ref&gt; – 20 January 1838) was a French cellist, conductor and composer. He is sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges Jarnowick".&lt;ref&gt;"Pierre-Louis Hus-Desforges Jarnowick". ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The grandson of [[theatre manager]] [[Barthélemy Hus-Desforges]], he came from a long line of entertainers, the [[Hus family]], and his grandmother was a [[Capetian House of Courtenay|Courtenay]].

After he finished his studies at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] with [[Benoit Tranquille Berbiguier]], he began as a cellist in various orchestras. In the early nineteenth century, he was conductor at [[St. Petersburg]], returned to Paris, then taught in [[Metz]] from 1819 to 1822.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1583">Several [[units of measurement]]s were used in [[Puerto Rico]].  [[Metric system]] has been compulsory since 1860 in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=":ict10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = International Critical Tables of Numerical Data, Physics, Chemistry and Technology|last = Washburn|first = E.W.|publisher = McGraw-Hil Book Company, Inc|year = 1926|location = New York|volume = 1|pages = 10 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zkErAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=international%20critical%20tables%201926&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20critical%20tables%201926&amp;f=false | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System before metric system==

Several units were used before metric adoption.  These units were older Spanish units.

===Area: ''Cuerda''===

Several units were used to measure area.  One [[cuerda]] was equal to 2250 [[Spanish customary units#Vara (unit of length)|vara]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1572 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=":ict10"/&gt; It continues to be an official unit of land measure in Puerto Rico today.&lt;ref name="Sizes"&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/cuerda.htm  ''Units - Cuerda.''] Sizes.com.

'''Satirical hip hop''' (also known as '''[[Internet meme|meme]] rap''')&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme"&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/satirical-hip-hop-meme-rap], [[Know Your Meme]]: "Satirical Hip Hop / Meme Rap".&lt;/ref&gt; is a subgenre of [[hip hop music]] done in a [[sarcastic]], [[parodic]], or [[tongue in cheek]] way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snobsmusic.net/2011/01/kemo-treats-do-satirical-hip-hop-like.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1502506.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Satirical hip hop in many ways is a [[parody]] and a [[criticism]] of the whole genre of hip hop, but more specifically to subgenres like [[gangsta rap]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap rap]], and [[mumble rap]]. According to [[Know Your Meme]], the genre was created with the intent of becoming viral. Some common characteristics of satirical hip hop include [[lo-fi]] production, simplistic music videos, lazy rhymes, and intentionally stereotypical lyrics/topics.&lt;ref name="Know Your Meme" /&gt; Another major characteristic associated with meme rap is the use of [[Alter ego|alternate personas]], which is also a staple in comedy. Internet personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|George "Joji" Miller]] (better known as Filthy Frank), for example, occasionally performed under the alter ego "Pink Guy," a main character in his now-defunct ''Filthy Frank'' YouTube series. The character of Pink Guy is known for performing many absurdist [[comedy rap]] songs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==History and examples==

The earliest example of satirical hip hop can be traced back to the works of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who has made parody tracks of popular hip hop songs since the [[1990s (decade)|1990s]]. Another early example is with Southern California-based rapper [[Afroman]], with his two well-known tracks "[[Crazy Rap]]" and "[[Because I Got High]]," both released in 2001, featuring comedic lyrics.

In 2008, Odd Future members Tyler, the Creator and Jasper Dolphin released [[I Smell Panties#I Smell Panties EP|the sole EP]] under their short-lived comedy group name "I Smell Panties."&lt;ref&gt;[https://oddfuture.bandcamp.com/album/i-smell-panties], Bandcamp link for the "I Smell Panties" EP.&lt;/ref&gt; The duo utilized elements of gangsta rap and [[Southern hip hop]] in a satirical way when performing as I Smell Panties. Tyler then released a track in 2011 called "Come Through Looking Clean", a joke song performed under a character named "Young Nigga." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rap-up.com/2011/09/23/odd-future-drops-debut-single-from-new-artist-young-nigga/], Rap-Up.&lt;/ref&gt; It's a parody of the "Bling Era" of hip hop that was popular during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] and draws heavy inspiration from the music of [[Lil B]]. The Young Nigga character would later be re-used on various skits in the 2012 [[Adult Swim]] program [[Loiter Squad]], which was created by and starred members of Odd Future. In February 2016, Tyler revealed that his 2011 breakout viral single "[[Yonkers (song)|Yonkers]]" was made as a joke song attempting to parody the style of [[East Coast hip hop|New York rappers]] (hence the title of "Yonkers").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tyler, the Creator: "Yonkers" Was Made As a Joke|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/63619-tyler-the-creator-yonkers-was-made-as-a-joke/|website=Pitchfork|access-date=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan-based Internet celebrity and rapper [[Rucka Rucka Ali]] became famous in the late 2000s/early 2010s for creating pop song parodies (including parodies of popular hip hop songs) containing lyrics for [[shock value]]. He often includes juvenile references to [[ethnic stereotypes]], topical subject matter, and [[Black comedy|dark humor]]. His music also tends to make use of comedic portrayals of celebrities in the same vein to the animated comedy series ''[[South Park]]'', and his several alter egos espouses stereotypical qualities of specific ethnic groups; his alter egos include DJ Not Nice (Asian), Seymour Schwartz (Jewish), and Toby Queef (White-American [[redneck]]). Some critics have labeled Ali as a [[racist]] as a reaction to his songs, although his humor seems heavily influenced by mainstream comedy television shows, such as ''South Park'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', and has jokingly defended his brand of humor by claiming that he's "stating objective facts" when he references stereotypes in his songs.&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; His videos and [[YouTube]] channels are frequently removed (since he started creating music videos he has had 17 YouTube channels deleted for terms of service violations&lt;ref&gt;http://ruckasworld.com/&lt;/ref&gt;), but are [[Streisand effect|reuploaded by his fans]].

In the mid-2010s, Ryan Harryman, a [[San Jose State University]] student and member of [[San Jose State Spartans|the school's water polo club team]],&lt;ref name="The Mercury News"&gt;{{cite web|title=San Jose State student dies several days after water polo practice at campus pool|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/10/18/san-jose-state-student-dies-several-days-after-water-polo-practice-at-campus-pool/|website=The Mercury News|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a viral sensation on the Internet under the stage name "3PAC."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuwE5TDU8ANzIvqqSZcgUig], YouTube: 3PACTVHD.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his self-produced music videos, bombastic and aggressive comedic rap songs, and [[diss tracks]] targeting mainstream rappers like [[Eminem]] and [[2 Chainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/3pac], [[Know Your Meme]] page on 3PAC.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as YouTube gaming channel [[PewDiePie]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/3pac-pewdiepie-is-a-child-rapist-song-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "PewDiePie is a Child Rapist" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; 3PAC made a guest appearance on ''[[The New CALassic]]'', a comedy hip hop mixtape performed by Internet music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] (under his "Cal Chuchesta" alter ego) that was released in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/2015/8/cal-chuchesta-the-new-calassic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;{{cite web|title=3Pac: To Live and Die on 4chan|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/3pac-ryan-harryman-profile-death-rapper|website=Spin Magazine|access-date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harryman died at the age of 24 in October 2015 after suffering severe brain damage during a water polo practice.&lt;ref name="The Mercury News" /&gt;

The seventh track of underground rapper [[Hopsin]]'s 2015 album ''[[Pound Syndrome]]'', entitled "No Words", is a skit meant to both satirize and criticize the trend of [[mumble rap]] that was popular during that time, calling rappers (specifically to artists like [[Future (rapper)|Future]], [[Young Thug]], and [[Migos]]) who are a part of that subgenre "[[Intellectual disability|mentally retarded]]"&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Hopsin-no-words-skit-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "No Words" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; and also mocking fans of mumble rap.

In 2017, [[YouTube]] personality [[George Miller (entertainer)|Filthy Frank]] released a music project titled ''[[Pink Season (Pink Guy album)|Pink Season]]'', the second album performed under the name "Pink Guy", with some songs poking fun at hip hop music as a whole, among other things. The track "Hand On My Gat" for example, features a character named PolitikZ that acts as a caricature for [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] [[Underground hip hop|underground rappers]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Pink-guy-hand-on-my-gat-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "Hand On My Gat" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; that character's previous appearance was on the Filthy Frank video "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" (uploaded in November 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6iefP8lf3o], YouTube: "BAD INTERNET RAPPERS" by TVFilthyFrank.&lt;/ref&gt; where he performed a song called "Real Hip Hop" that directly parodied the stereotypical anti-mainstream and [[Political hip hop|politically charged]] attitudes of underground rappers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://genius.com/Politikz-real-hip-hop-lyrics], [[Genius (website)|Genius]]: "REAL HIP HOP" lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHYwprmWMfY], YouTube: "PolitikZ - 'REAL HIP HOP'" by TooDamnFilthy.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pink Season'' album reached number one on the [[iTunes]] charts and peaked at 70 on the [[Billboard 200]].&lt;ref name="Billboard 200"&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard 200|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2017-01-28|website=Billboard|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, nearly a month after the retirement of the "Filthy Frank" project,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pigeonsandplanes.com/news/2017/12/joji-quits-pink-guy-filthy-frank-comedy], [[Pigeons and Planes]]: "Joji Explains Decision to Quit Filthy Frank and Pink Guy as He Pursues Music Career."&lt;/ref&gt; George Miller returned to performing as Pink Guy to co-star in a music video made by Lil Toenail, a Florida-based meme rapper who performs with a giant foot costume and ski mask to maintain his anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpjwhH4Joio], YouTube: "Lil Toenail - Go Out (Official Music Video)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, Internet personality and music critic [[The Needle Drop|Anthony Fantano]] began releasing more satirical hip hop tracks under his Cal Chuchesta alter ego, releasing the tracks "Coin Star"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_B2NEVbP20&lt;/ref&gt; and "Don't Talk To Me."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqWi01SBfmw&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">A '''shaft''' is a [[rotating]] [[machine element]], usually circular in cross section, which is used to [[transmit]] power from one part to another, or from a machine which produces power to a machine which absorbs power.&lt;ref&gt;Khurmi R S, (2014), 'A text book of machine design', Eurasia publishing house(P) ltd., New-Delhi, {{ISBN|9788121925372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various members such as [[pulleys]] and [[gears]] are mounted on it.

[[File:Shaft animation.gif|thumb|Shaft animation]]

==Types==
They are mainly classified into two types.
* Transmission shafts are used to transmit power between the source and the machine absorbing power; e.g. counter shafts and [[line shaft]]s.
* Machine shafts are the integral part of the [[machine]] itself; e.g. [[crankshaft]].

==Materials==
The material used for ordinary shafts is [[mild steel]]. When high strength is required, an [[alloy steel]] such as [[nickel]], [[Nickel-chrome|nickel-chromium]] or [[chromium-vanadium steel]] is used.

Shafts are generally formed by [[hot rolling]] and finished to size by [[cold drawing]] or [[turning]] and [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]].

==Standard sizes==
Source:&lt;ref&gt;Mahadevan K and Reddy K.Balaveera, (2015), 'Design data hand book', CBS publishers and Distributors (P) ltd., New-Delhi, {{ISBN|9788123923154}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Machine shafts===
* Up to 25 mm steps of 0.5 mm

===Transmission shafts===
* 25 mm to 60 mm with 5 mm steps
* 60 mm to 110 mm with 10 mm steps
* 110 mm to 140 mm with 15 mm steps
* 140 mm to 500 mm with 20 mm steps

The [[standard length]]s of the shafts are 5 m, 6 m and 7 m.

==Stresses==
The following [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] are induced in the shafts.
# [[Shear stress]]es due to the transmission of [[torque]] (due to torsional load).
# Bending stresses ([[tensile]] or [[compressive]]) due to the forces acting upon the machine elements like [[gears]] and [[pulleys]] as well as the self weight of the shaft.
# Stresses due to combined [[torsional]] and [[bending]] loads.

==Design stresses==
The maximum permissible ([[design]]) [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]] in bending ([[Tension (physics)|tension]] or [[Compression (physics)|compression]]) may be taken as:
# 112 N/mm{{sup|2}} for shafts with allowance for keyways.
# 84 N/mm{{sup|2}} for shafts without allowance for keyways.
The maximum permissible (design) [[shear stress]]es may be taken as:
# 56 N/mm{{sup|2}} for shafts with allowance for keyways.
# 42 N/mm{{sup|2}} for shafts without allowance for keyways.

{{numismatics}}
The '''''Standard Catalog of World Coins''''' is a series of [[numismatics|numismatic]] [[Coin catalog|catalogs]], commonly known as the '''Krause catalogs'''. They are published by [[Krause Publications]], a division of F+W Media.

==Overview==
The by-century volumes list by date virtually every [[coin]] type, most of which are photographed, with [[Mint (coin)|mintage]] and other information, plus market valuations in up to 5 grades. Listings are by [[Denomination (currency)|denomination]] rather than series, as in earlier World coin catalogs.  The proprietary Krause-Mishler (or KM) numbers are widely used; for just a few countries earlier systems such as Y (Yeoman) and C (Craig) numbers are given instead.

The century format is often considered inconvenient and expensive for those who collect geographically, and date listings are clipped at the century mark. Originally covering 1835 or so to date, the main catalog (first edition 1972) evolved into an annual 20th century-only work, plus separate 17th, 18th, and 19th century volumes which are revised on a three-year cycle. Beginning with the 34th (2007) ed, listings covering 2001 to date are included in a separate 21st Century catalog.

Data from the by-century volumes are collated together in special editions for [[Crown (British coin)|Crowns]], Gold, German, and North American coins. Fantasies and medallion issues, which do not appear in the other catalogs, are covered in a publication called ''Unusual World Coins''. There is also a publication called ''Collecting World Coins'' that includes only 20th- and 21st-century coins that circulated regularly.

The 12th (1986) and 19th (1992) are two-volume hardcovers covering 1700-date; 13th (1987) is the last edition to include cross-references to Yeoman and Craig; 23rd (1996) is the last main edition covering 1800-date; 33rd (2006) is the last 20th century edition including 21st century listings.

List priced at $73 to $85 ($25 for the shorter 21st century catalog)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

they are often discounted, and can be found in many public libraries. Older editions are steeply discounted even though revisions between editions in many areas are minimal. Following the appearance of unlicensed DVD versions, DVDs were included with the 1601-1700 4th edition, the 1901-2000 36th edition, and possibly others, but are now sold as a separate product.

In 1975, the ''Catalog'' comprised a single volume with about 1,000 pages. By 2007, it had expanded to a five-volume set with more than 6,000 pages in total.&lt;ref name="coinworld2017-colin-bruce"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Starck|first=Jeff|title=Numismatist, author Colin R. Bruce II dies; long-time Krause Publications editor helmed 'Standard Catalog' series|date=October 23, 2017|magazine=[[Coin World]]|volume=58|issue=3002|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early editions attribute authorship to the publisher Chester L. Krause, and Clifford Mishler, although starting with the second edition Colin R. Bruce II was the actual chief compiler and is given an editor or senior editor title on later editions. According to ''[[Coin World]]'', Bruce was the lead cataloger and editor of every annual edition from 1976 through 2007, retiring in 2008.&lt;ref name="coinworld2017-colin-bruce"/&gt; George S. Cuhaj is the current editor, with Thomas Michael credited as market analyst, although Krause collate contributions from many collecting experts and dealers.

'''''The Canterbury Tales''''' ({{lang-enm|Tales of Caunterbury}}{{refn|The name "Tales of Caunterbury" appears within the surviving texts of Chaucer's work. Its modern name first appeared as {{lang|enm|Canterbury talys}} in [[John Lydgate]]'s 1421–1422 prologue to the ''Siege of Thebes''.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, David.

Accessed 6 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;}}) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in [[Middle English]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] between 1387 and 1400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Canterbury-Tales Encyclopedia Brittanica]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, in 1389, Clerk of the King's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Medieval People: Vivid Lives in a Distant Landscape|last = Prestwich|first = Michael|publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson|year = 2014|isbn = 9780500252031 |location = London|pages = 4. An Age of Plague 1300–1400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The tales (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]], although some are in [[prose]]) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of [[pilgrim]]s as they travel together from London to [[Canterbury]] to visit the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at Southwark on their return.

After a long list of works written earlier in his career, including ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[House of Fame]]'', and ''[[Parlement of Foules|Parliament of Fowls]]'', ''The Canterbury Tales'' is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy]] in 1372.

It has been suggested that the greatest contribution of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to [[English literature]] was the popularisation of the English [[vernacular]] in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], [[the Pearl Poet]], and [[Julian of Norwich]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.

''The Canterbury Tales'' is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the [[General Prologue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400) "The Canterbury Tales" (in middle english and modern english)|url = http://www.librarius.com/cantales.htm|website = www.librarius.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; some 30 pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim, two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of about 120 stories). Although perhaps incomplete, ''The Canterbury Tales'' is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Broadview Anthology of British Literature|last = Black|first = Joseph|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2011|isbn = |location = Canada|pages = 229–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The question of whether ''The Canterbury Tales'' is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four [[incunabula]] (printed before c 1540) editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]''. This is taken as evidence of the ''Tales''' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.&lt;ref name="Pearsall, 8"&gt;Pearsall, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 6—7&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tales'' vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure. 

Even the oldest surviving manuscripts of the ''Tales'' are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called "[[Hengwrt Chaucer|Hengwrt]]"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The most beautiful, on the other hand, is the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]], a manuscript handwritten by one person with illustrations by several illustrators; the tales are put in an order that many later editors have followed for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 10, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of ''The Canterbury Tales'' to be published in print was [[William Caxton]]'s 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the [[British Library]] and one held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. 

In 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the [[scrivener]] who worked for Chaucer as an [[Adam Pinkhurst]]. Mooney, then a professor at the [[University of Maine]] and a visiting fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of ''The Canterbury Tales'' that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney (2006), "Chaucer's Scribe," ''Speculum'', '''81''' : 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jul/20/highereducation.books] Ezard, John. The scrivener's tale: how Chaucer's sloppy copyist was unmasked after 600 years The Guardian. 20 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; That identification has been questioned and doubted by others and is being debated.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, Alexandra. Reading Chaucer's Words to Adam. The Chaucer Review. Vol. 42, No. 3 (2008) pp. 269-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order===
{{main article|Order of The Canterbury Tales|List of The Canterbury Tales characters}}
In the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the ''Tales'' exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.&lt;ref name = seven&gt;Cooper, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Textual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the ''Tales'' into ten "Fragments". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).&lt;ref name = seven/&gt; Victorians frequently used the nine "Groups", which was the order used by [[Walter William Skeat]] whose edition ''Chaucer: Complete Works'' was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now{{when|date=March 2018}} seldom followed.&lt;ref name = seven/&gt;

An alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing ''The Canterbury Tales'', the early-fifteenth century [[Harley MS. 7334]]) places Fragment VIII before VI. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, just as VI and VII, IX and X do in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast, vary in location from manuscript to manuscript.

Chaucer wrote in late Vernacular Middle English, which has clear differences from Modern English. From philological research, we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced ''-e'' at the end of words, so that ''care'' was {{IPA-enm|ˈkaːrə|}}, not {{IPAc-en|k|ɛər}} as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word ''knight'' was {{IPA|[kniçt]}}, with both the ''k'' and the ''gh'' pronounced, not {{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|t}}. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] had not yet happened. For instance, the long ''e'' in ''wepyng'' "weeping" was pronounced as {{IPA-enm|eː|}}, as in modern German or Italian, not as {{IPAc-en|iː}}. Below is an [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription of the opening lines of ''The Merchant's Prologue'':

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by [[Adam Pinkhurst]], a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the ''Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;Linne R. Mooney, "Chaucer’s Scribe", ''Speculum'', 81 (2006), 97–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the final ''-e'' sound was lost soon after Chaucer's time, scribes did not accurately copy it, and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ian Robinson, ''Chaucer's Prosody: A Study of the Middle English Verse Tradition'' (London: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; It has now been established, however, that ''-e'' was an important part of Chaucer's grammar, and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative.&lt;ref&gt;Seminal studies included M. L. Samuels, "Chaucerian Final '-e'", ''Notes and Queries'', 19 (1972), 445–48, and D. Burnley, "Inflection in Chaucer's Adjectives", ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen'', 83 (1982), 169–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

No other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of ''The Canterbury Tales'', a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen "master of ceremonies" to guide them and organise the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the "pilgrim" figures of Dante and Virgil in ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''.&lt;ref name="Harold Bloom"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Road Trip|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sobecki|first1=Sebastian|title=A Southwark Tale: Gower, the 1381 Poll Tax, and Chaucer’s ''The Canterbury Tales''|journal=Speculum|date=2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=630–660|doi=10.1086/692620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Decameron]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] contains more parallels to ''The Canterbury Tales'' than any other work. Like the ''Tales'', it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the [[Black Death]]). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like [[Chaucer's Retraction]] to the ''Tales''. A quarter of the tales in ''The Canterbury Tales'' parallel a tale in the ''Decameron'', although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the ''Decameron'' at some point,&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; while a new study claims he had a copy of the ''Decameron'' and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/971521732|title=Chaucer's ''Decameron'' and the Origin of the Canterbury Tales|last=Biggs|first=Frederick M.|others=D.S. Brewer,|isbn=9781843844754|location=Cambridge|oclc=971521732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by [[Ovid]], the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of [[Petrarch]] and [[Dante]]. Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two, both Italians. [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' appears in several tales, as the works of [[John Gower]] do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as [[John Bromyard]]'s ''[[Summa praedicantium]]'', a preacher's handbook, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Against Jovinianus|Adversus Jovinianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, pp. 12–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars say there is a good possibility [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio]].&lt;ref name="Brewer227"&gt;Brewer, p. 227. ''Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers, and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview; yet it seems likely, that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions, and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brewer277"&gt;Brewer, p. 277. ''...where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose-writers: Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these, Petrarch.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hendrickson183-192"&gt;Hendrickson, pp. 183–192. Professor G. L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch.&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Rearden, p. 458. ''There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally. They were both in France many times, where they might have met. They were both courtiers. They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship. Whether they met then, or whether Chaucer, when on his visit to Genoa, specially visited the Italian, it does not appear.'' ''...but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it. Still, on the other hand, would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch, and whose only claim to notice, literary-wise, was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French?''&lt;/ref&gt;{{incomplete short citation|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;Skeat (1874), p. xxx. '' And we know that Petrarch, on his own shewing, was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could, for the express purpose of repeating it to friends, before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him. Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth, either in Italian or French; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch's Latin version, which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre and structure==
[[File:Canterbury-Cathedral-Church-of-England-1890-1900.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west [[circa]] 1890–1900 (retouched from a black &amp; white photograph)]]
''The Canterbury Tales'' is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or [[frame tale]], a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's ''Tales'' differs from most other story "collections" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the ''Decameron'', storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a [[pilgrimage]] to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though "the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one".&lt;ref&gt;"Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales", 2002, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the structure of the ''Tales'' is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the ''General Prologue'', Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hengwrt Chaucer (f.2.r) title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst, c.1400]]

The variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as [[Virgil]] suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from [[St. Augustine]], who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into "majestic persuades", "temperate pleases", and "subdued teaches". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.&lt;ref name="empathy article"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/tuesday-tome-canterbury-tales-geoffrey-chaucer/|title=Puppetry and the "Popet:" Fiction, Reality, and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer’s ''Canterbury Tales''|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 29, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a "lady", while the lower classes use the word "wenche", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word "pitee", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the ''Merchant's Tale'' it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the ''Nun's Priest's Tale'' show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the ''Knight's Tale'' is at times extremely simple.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of ''Sir Thopas'' and his prose tales. It is a [[decasyllable]] line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with [[riding rhyme]] and, occasionally, a [[caesura]] in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of [[iambic pentameter]]. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use [[rhyme royal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context and themes==
[[File:DeathWatTylerFull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 is mentioned in the ''Tales''.]]

''The Canterbury Tales'' was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the [[Western Schism]] and, although it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, it was the subject of heavy controversy. [[Lollardy]], an early English religious movement led by [[John Wycliffe]], is mentioned in the ''Tales'', which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of [[indulgences]], which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the [[Sacrament of Confession]]) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. ''The Canterbury Tales'' is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the [[Peasants' Revolt|1381 Peasants' Revolt]] and clashes ending in the deposing of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the ''Tales''' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to [[Kent]] to get away from events in London.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some readers look to interpret the characters of ''The Canterbury Tales'' as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.&lt;ref&gt;Donald R. Howard, ''Chaucer and the Medieval World'' (London, 1987), pp. 410–417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
The ''Tales'' reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the [[Black Death]], many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to [[lollardy]], while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false [[relic|church relics]] or abuse of [[indulgences]].&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 49–51, 56–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Several characters in the ''Tales'' are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church "indulgences" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Friar's Tale]], one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Becket Murder.JPG|thumb|left|The murder of [[Thomas Becket]]]]
Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 73–75, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 91–95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Prioress's Tale]] is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a [[blood libel against Jews]] that became a part of English literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt; The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/chaucer/zatta/prioress.html "The Prioress's Tale"], by Prof. Jane Zatta.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 99–102.&lt;/ref&gt; but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. [[Thomas Becket|Saint Thomas Becket]], Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by knights of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 110–113.&lt;/ref&gt; The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social class and convention===
[[File:Bors and Lionel.jpg|thumb|[[Bors]]' Dilemma – he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother [[Sir Lionel|Lionel]]]]

The upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 123–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. [[The Knight's Tale]] shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was on the decline in Chaucer's day, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 139–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer himself had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] under [[Edward III]], who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Two tales, ''[[Sir Topas]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'' are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalry—the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tales'' constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of [[Estates of the realm|the three estates]]: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being "those who pray" (the clergy), "those who fight" (the nobility), and "those who work" (the commoners and peasantry).&lt;ref&gt;Bisson, pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some "quit" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the ''Tales'' to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition "the ordered and the grotesque, [[Lent]] and [[Carnival]], officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside."&lt;ref name=opp&gt;Cooper, 19&lt;/ref&gt; Several works of the time contained the same opposition.&lt;ref name=opp/&gt;

===Relativism versus realism===
Chaucer's characters each express different—sometimes vastly different—views of reality, creating an atmosphere of [[Playspace|testing]], [[empathy]], and [[relativism]].&lt;ref name="empathy article" /&gt; As [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]] says, "Different genres give different readings of the world: the [[fabliau]] scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion." The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the ''Tales'' as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liminality===
The concept of [[liminality]] figures prominently within ''The Canterbury Tales''.&lt;ref name="empathy article" /&gt; A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a “real” (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Norma J. "Liminal Space in Travellers’ Tales: Historical and Fictional Passages (Folklore, Ritual, History).” Order No. 8615152 The Pennsylvania State University, 1986. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 30 Sep. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centres on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of ''The Canterbury Tales'' itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in ''The Canterbury Tales'',

"Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space."&lt;ref&gt;Jost, Jean. “Urban and Liminal Space in Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale: Perilous or Protective?” Albrecht Classen, ed. Fundamentals of Medieval and Early Modern Culture : Urban Space in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Age. Berlin, DEU: Walter de Gruyter, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the [[The Friar's Tale|Friar’s Tale]] in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Morton W. “The ‘Friar’s Tale’ as a Liminal Tale.” The Chaucer Review 17.4 (1983): 286–291. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Franklin's Tale|Franklin’s Tale]] is a [[Breton lai|Breton Lai]] tale, which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal, but also the relation between the present and the imagined past.&lt;ref&gt;Nowlin,  Steele. “Between Precedent and Possibility: Liminality, Historicity, and Narrative in Chaucer's ‘The Franklin's Tale.’" Studies in Philology 103.1 (2006): 47–67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on literature==
It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to [[English literature]] was in popularising the literary use of the [[vernacular]] English, rather than French or [[Latin]]. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporaries—[[John Gower]], [[William Langland]], and [[the Pearl Poet]]—also wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as ''[[The Floure and the Leafe]]'', which was translated by [[John Dryden]]), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the [[Court of Chancery]] in the decades during and after his lifetime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Reception==
[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|left|Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]].]]
[[File:Wife-of-Bath-ms.jpg|thumb|right|Opening prologue of [[The Wife of Bath's Tale]] from the Ellesmere Manuscript.]]

While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' is believed to have been written for [[John of Gaunt]] on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of ''The Canterbury Tales'' is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a [[courtier]], leading some to believe that he was mainly a [[court poet]] who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by [[Eustache Deschamps]] and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 294-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except ''[[The Prick of Conscience]]'', causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as [[John Lydgate]]'s religious and historical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 295-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===15th century===
John Lydgate and [[Thomas Occleve]] were among the first critics of Chaucer's ''Tales'', praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in ''The Canterbury Tales'' manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with "sentence" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, 298–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary additions and supplements==
The incompleteness of the ''Tales'' led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the ''Cook's Tale'', which Chaucer never finished, ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', ''[[The Tale of Gamelyn]]'', the ''[[Siege of Thebes (Lydgate)|Siege of Thebes]]'', and the ''[[Tale of Beryn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, Stephanie, ''Congenial Souls: Reading Chaucer from Medieval to Postmodern'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2002, p. 86. {{ISBN|0-8166-3823-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tale of Beryn'', written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with ''Tale of Beryn''. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale ''[[Bérinus]]'' and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]].&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 86–88, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lydgate wrote ''The Siege of Thebes'' in about 1420. Like the ''Tale of Beryn'', it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the ''Knight's Tale''. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the ''Tales''. It was first printed as early as 1561 by [[John Stow]], and several editions for centuries after followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Trigg, pp. 88–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are actually two versions of ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]'', both of which are influenced by the story ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the ''General Prologue'' of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by [[Thomas Occleve]], describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to [[John Wycliffe]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer, Charlotte, ''Editing Piers Plowman: The Evolution of the Text'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996, pp. 8–9. {{ISBN|0-521-34250-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Tale of Gamelyn'' was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlgren, Thomas, ''Medieval Outlaws'', Parlor Press, 2005, pp. 264–265. {{ISBN|1-932559-62-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary adaptations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

Many literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to ''The Canterbury Tales'' as an homage. Science-fiction writer [[Dan Simmons]] wrote his [[Hugo Award]] winning novel ''[[Hyperion (Simmons novel)|Hyperion]]'' based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] used ''The Canterbury Tales'' as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about [[evolution]] titled ''[[The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]''. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.

[[Henry Dudeney]]'s book ''[[The Canterbury Puzzles]]'' contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.

Historical-mystery novelist [[P.C. Doherty]] wrote a series of novels based on ''The Canterbury Tales'', making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.

Canadian author [[Angie Abdou]] translates ''The Canterbury Tales'' to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel ''The Canterbury Trail''.

==Adaptations and homages==
''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of "The Knight's Tale", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, [[Erik Chisholm]] completed his opera, ''The Canterbury Tales''. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Bath’s Tale, The Pardoner’s Tale and The Nun’s Priest’s Tale. [[Nevill Coghill]]'s modern English version formed the basis of a musical [[Canterbury Tales (musical)|version]] that was first staged in 1964.

''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'', a 1944 film jointly written and directed by [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]], is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the ''General Prologue''. The scene then makes a [[Match cut#Notable examples|now-famous transition]] to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. ''A Canterbury Tale'' is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Steve, ''Chaucer at Large'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2000, pp. 64–65. {{ISBN|0-8166-3376-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s 1972 film ''[[The Canterbury Tales (film)|The Canterbury Tales]]'' features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The ''Cook's Tale'', for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the ''Friar's Tale'' extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the ''Miller's Tale'', the ''Summoner's Tale'', the ''Wife of Bath's Tale'', and the ''Merchant's Tale''.&lt;ref&gt;Pencak, William, ''The Films of Derek Jarman'', Jefferson: McFarland &amp; Co, 2002, pp. 178–9. {{ISBN|0-7864-1430-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 1986, American radio personality [[Garrison Keillor]] opened "The News from Lake Wobegon" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue.  He commented, "Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring."

Television adaptations include [[Alan Plater]]'s 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: ''[[Trinity Tales]]''. In 2003, BBC again featured [[The Canterbury Tales (TV series)|modern re-tellings of selected tales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/canterburytales/ |title=BBC – Drama – Canterbury Tales |accessdate=6 May 2007 |work=[[BBC]] Drama article about the series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fallible Fiend''''' is a [[fantasy  novel]] by American writer [[L. Sprague de Camp]], the third book of his [[Novarian series]]. It was first published as a two-part serial in the magazine ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' for December 1972 and February 1973, and subsequently expanded and revised for book publication.&lt;ref name="Laughlin1"&gt;{{cite book | last=Laughlin | first=Charlotte |author2=Daniel J.

==Plot summary==
On the demonic Twelfth Plane the demon Zdim is drafted for a year's indentured servitude on the human Prime Plane, the demon society having an agreement to provide service to human sorcerers in return for supplies of iron, a raw material it desperately needs.

Zdim is duly summoned to the Prime Plane by the sorcerer Dr. Maldivius of Novaria. There he strives to do his duty, but his demonic literal-mindedness hampers him. Assigned to protect the Sibylline Sapphire from any trespassers, he promptly eats Maldivius' apprentice Grax when the latter intrudes.

Similar misadventures result in the disgusted Maldivius selling his contract, and the demon is passed from one master to another, from circus master Bagardo to the rich widow Roska of Ir, all the while doing his level best to figure out what the muddled humans truly wish of him.

Against all odds he becomes a hero when he recruits aid for the city-state of Ir after it discounts intelligence of an imminent invasion by the cannibal Paaluans. Returning to his home plane early and with extra iron, he resolves never again to leave the comforts of the Twelfth Plane — until he realizes how dull it is compared with the picturesque insanity of the human realm...

By internal chronology, ''The Fallible Fiend'' is the second story in the Novarian series, coming after the short story "[[The Emperor's Fan]]", which is set centuries before the others, and prior to the ''[[The Reluctant King|Reluctant King]]'' trilogy. (The Paaluan invasion of Ir is mentioned in the second and third books of the trilogy, ''[[The Clocks of Iraz]]'' and ''[[The Unbeheaded King]]'', respectively, as an event occurring either recently or some generations past.)

==Setting==
The world of which Novaria is part is a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] to [[Earth]], a plane of existence related to ours in that ours constitutes its [[afterlife]]. Culturally it bears resemblances to the eras of both [[Ancient Greece|Classical Greece]] and [[Middle Ages|Medieval Europe]]. The states of Novaria itself are split between competing systems of government, some of them unique, which allows the author to explore various pros and cons of different styles of governance as his hero tours the country.

The name of Ir, the subterranean city-state where much the plot takes place, is simply the [[Hebrew]] word for "city" (עיר).

==Features==
Adopting the viewpoint of an outsider to comment on the foibles of one's own society has been done before in fiction,but adapting it to fantasy also permits him to extend it into an outside view of humanity as a whole by an alien being and maintain a satirical edge throughout the book. De Camp's demonic protagonist Zdim long remained a uniquely unlikely fantasy hero, as other authors were slow to mine the concept de Camp pioneered.

==Reception==
Roger C. Schlobin praises the book's "[d]elightful episodes occur[ring] as the fiend misunderstands his commands and tries to function in a totally alien environment, which is, of course, quite normal for the reader." He feels it "[d]eteriorates somewhat at the end as the fiend becomes a hero and saves civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Schlobin, Roger C. "Masterpieces of Modern Fantasy: an Annotated Core List." In Tymn, Marshall B., ed., ''The Science Fiction Reference Book'', Starmont House, c1981, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Stableford|Brian M. Stableford]] calls "''The Fallible Fiend'' ... more offbeat than de Camp's other ventures in the genre," and Zdim "perhaps the only sword-and-sorcery hero who regularly devours people. Still, he remains likable as he provides a suitably ironic commentary on human affairs from the demonic standpoint."&lt;ref&gt;Stableford, Brian M. "L. Sprague de Camp 1907- / Fletcher Pratt 1897-1956," in Bleiler, Everett F., ed., ''Supernatural Fiction Writers'', 1985, v. 2, p. 929.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven H Silver|Steven Silver]] called the book "a humorous novel, although not in a laugh-out-loud way." He sees its "main point [as] satire, a fact which is driven home if the reader begins to look at characterization or plot, neither of which appear in particular abundance. ... The characters are drawn with broad strokes, each inspired by one, or possibly two, character traits." But "as [with] most satire, he causes the reader[s] to recognize the humor of the situation and compare it to their own situation." Silver sees "Zdim's travels throughout Novaria as a pretext for unleashing slings and arrows of outrageous satire at governmental practices and systems ... thereby highlighting the follies of our own system of government." The hero's contact with other cultures, the "fantasy staples" of "the semi-human Zaperazh, the horse nomadic Hruntings, and the cannibalistic Paaluans ... clearly shows why each is as implausible as the more 'corrupt' human institutions of civilizations."&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Steven. "[http://www.sfsite.com/~silverag/fiend.html Steven Silver's Reviews: The Fallible Fiend.]" At ''The SF Site: The Best in Science Fiction and Fantasy'', January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don D'Ammassa]] finds "''The Fallible Fiend'' ... in much the same vein" as ''[[The Reluctant King]]'' series, with "[m]ost of the humor com[ing] from the efforts by the demon to understand human behavior."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ammassa, Don. ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction'', Facts on File, c2006, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] called the story "a wonderfully nostalgic fantasy in the ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike. ''Gateways to Forever: The Story of the Science-Fiction Magazines from 1970-1980'', Liverpool University Press, 2007, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In its original serial form the book won the [[British Fantasy Society]]'s 1973 [[British Fantasy Award|August Derleth Fantasy Award]] for best short story.&lt;ref name="Laughlin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt;

'''''Tintin in Thailand''''' is a parody of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' books by [[Hergé]], released in 1999. It is written and designed to emulate a volume of the Tintin books, but is the author's own story. It was written by a Belgian author, Baudouin de Duve, who used the alias Bud E. Weyser, a name that is a play on the name of American beer, [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]].&lt;ref&gt;Burdet, Matthieu. "Rencontre en Thaïlande avec Baudouin de Duve, l'auteur d'une parodie de Hergé, qui se trouve lui-même propulsé dans une histoire encore plus rocambolesque que le récit qu'il a imaginé. L'affaire «Tintin en Thaïlande» ou quand la réalité dépasse la fiction." ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]''. 2001. Retrieved on 2 January 2011. "Une feuille de papier, un feutre noir et des idées à la louche, ainsi naît la première planche de «Tintin en Thaïlande», sous le pseudonyme de Bud E. Weiser, clin d'oeil à la célèbre marque de cervoise américaine." - It was at {{cite web |url=http://archives.lematin.ch/LM/LMS/-/article-2002-04-989/sagaexclusif-rencontre-en-thailande-avec-baudouin-de-duve-l-auteur-d-une-parodie-de-herge-qui-se |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713182020/http://archives.lematin.ch/LM/LMS/-/article-2002-04-989/sagaexclusif-rencontre-en-thailande-avec-baudouin-de-duve-l-auteur-d-une-parodie-de-herge-qui-se |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--About BLP concerns, in the article de Duve says: "Dans les couloirs du parquet, de Duve constate que «beaucoup de policiers sont en train de lire «Tintin en Thaïlande». L'un d'eux me demande si j'ai un exemplaire à dédicacer. Je lui dis que je n'en ai plus. Il me répond: «C'est pas grave, moi, j'en ai»..." - So he was freely interviewed about it, and this does not violate WP:BLP--&gt;

==Design==
''Tintin in Thailand'' emulates the style and format of the original Tintin books, with some key differences. With the exception of the cover, the entire volume is in black and white. The characters are imitations of the originals, and are presented as acting uncharacteristically, such as by using [[profanity|profane language]]. "Bud E. Weyser" is listed as the author, and there is a one-page foreword in French.

Copies were printed in Thailand to be distributed in Belgium, where ''Tintin in Thailand'' is thought to have been in circulation from December 1999. Thousands of copies in both French and English were also distributed in Thailand. The quality of the Thai forgeries was found to be superior to that of the Belgian version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/14/books.booksnews |title=Forgers send Tintin to sleazy bars of Bangkok |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |accessdate=2008-02-06 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Osborn | date=2001-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot opens on a rainy and cold night in [[Marlinspike Hall]]. The occupants, [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and [[Captain Haddock]] are unhappy and financially broke, since there are no new Tintin adventures for them because of the death of their creator, Hergé. (This is the first of many [[self-reference]]s the plot makes.) As they discuss their plight, [[Jolyon Wagg]]'s wife arrives and ask them to go to [[Thailand]] to search for her husband, who went there on a trip he won from his employer, the Rock Bottom Insurance Company, and never returned. She had already sent [[Thomson and Thompson]] to look, but without any results. Since it is an all expenses paid trip, Tintin and Haddock immediately accept and are soon on their way to Thailand. Nestor, [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] and the cat are left behind, but [[Professor Calculus]] joins them.

As they check into their [[Bangkok]] hotel, they are spotted by Derek Dimwit, a representative of the Marlinsprick Company which holds the rights to the Tintin franchise. He calls his head office and is told he must stop them from going on any more adventures that could be used in a book not controlled by Marlinsprick.

Tintin and his friends go to the [[red light district]], where they run into [[General Alcazar]], now the owner of a Thailand bar after being deposed by [[General Tapioca]]. Alcazar tells them he saw Jolyon Wagg in his bar, but he has gone north to [[Chiang Mai]] with a [[kathoey]] (transsexual). Calculus and Haddock both pick up [[prostitution|prostitutes]] in the bar, but Tintin prefers the company of a young boy instead (This is a reference to questions by fans regarding Tintin's sexuality in the original books).

The next day the adventurers fly north and soon run into Thomson and Thompson. The Thompson twins do not want anyone to find Wagg, since they are enjoying themselves in Thailand at Mrs. Wagg's expense. However, they pick up the trail and Wagg, who is living outside Chiang Mai. They learn he no longer enjoys the company of his kathoey partner. Wagg longs for his wife's cooking, in particular her [[rabbit]] marinated in beer. After a series of misadventures, they all find themselves back in Chiang Mai in time to celebrate the new year of 2000. The story ends with Tintin being presented the first copy of ''Tintin in Thailand''. He declares the proceeds will guarantee him many peaceful days in the sun.

==Arrests==
In February 2001, the [[Hergé Foundation]] learned about Bud E. Weyser's attempts to market ''Tintin in Thailand'' as an unknown Tintin book to distributors in Belgium. The Belgian police organized a sting, with an officer pretending to be a prospective buyer; two arrests were made in [[Tournai]]. They also arrested the designer in [[Antwerp]]. The men confessed to printing more than 1,000 copies for sale in Belgium, and the 650 copies found were seized. All three men were subsequently released.

Copies of ''Tintin in Thailand'' can still occasionally be found in Bangkok. However, the Hergé Foundation takes quick action to remove copies that are posted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eursoc.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1838/Rights_Group_Wants_Tintin_Canned.html |title=Rights Group Wants Tintin Canned |publisher=EURSOC |accessdate=2008-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221045640/http://www.eursoc.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1838/Rights_Group_Wants_Tintin_Canned.html |archivedate=2007-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Unrequited'''" is the sixteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It was written by [[Howard Gordon]] and series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], and directed by [[Michael Lange]]. It originally aired in the United States on February 23, 1997 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.9 and was seen by 16.56 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. "Unrequited" received mixed to negative reviews from television critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, the murder of a [[US Army|U.S. Army]] [[Lieutenant General]] has Mulder and Scully struggling to stop a seemingly invisible assassin. The two agents soon learn that they are doomed to failure from the start, as the U.S. government is attempting to cover up the existence of American POWs still being kept in Vietnam.

Gordon was inspired to write the episode after viewing an installment of the news series ''[[60 Minutes]]'' that dealt with [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|American secret agents the CIA left behind during the Vietnam War]]. The eventual concept that the assassin could create blind spots came after the writer spoke with his [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] brother. The entry featured a finished replica of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and various Canadian locales substituted for various locations in [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Plot==
The episode begins at the [[National Mall]], where [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] Benjamin Bloch ([[Scott Hylands]]) gives a speech to a crowd of [[Vietnam War]] veterans. [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]), [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), and [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) patrol the crowd, searching for a potential gunman. However, when the agents see the gunman, he repeatedly disappears and makes their efforts to track him difficult. Mulder finds himself aiming his gun towards the panicked crowd, desperately searching for the gunman, who has disappeared right in front of him.

Twelve hours earlier, at Fort Evanston, [[Maryland]], [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] Peter MacDougal (Bill Agnew) is shot in his [[limousine]] by the gunman. Skinner briefs the agents on the killing, noting a king of hearts playing card—used by the soldiers in Vietnam to mark their kills—was left at the scene. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] suspects a far-right [[paramilitary]] group, the Right Hand, of killing MacDougal in an effort to stop an upcoming re-dedication of a [[Vietnam war memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

Mulder and Scully head to [[Virginia]] to question the Right Hand's leader, Denny Markham (Larry Musser). A search of his fenced-off cabin uncovers ammunition and a photograph showing him in the company of a [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Nathaniel Teager (Peter LaCroix). After being arrested, Markham reveals that Teager was a soldier in Vietnam who was left for dead as a [[prisoner of war]]. Meanwhile, at the Vietnam memorial, Teager approaches a war widow and claims that her husband is still alive as a POW. After giving the woman her husband's [[dog tags]], Teager mysteriously disappears.

Skinner informs the agents that Teager is officially dead, and that his remains are at the Army's forensics lab. However, Mulder learns that the lab only possesses Teager's dental remains, and that the cause of his death was recorded as "inconclusive". Mulder believes that [[General (United States)|General]] John Steffan (William Nunn), who signed Teager's [[death certificate]], is his next target. Teager makes his way past [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] security and kills Steffan in his office. Upon seeing Teager on the Pentagon's surveillance tapes, Mulder notes the frequent unexplained appearances and disappearances of [[Viet Cong]] troops reported by POWs in Vietnam.

During a meeting with [[Marita Covarrubias]] ([[Laurie Holden]]), Mulder learns that Steffan, McDougal, and Bloch were all involved in negotiations concerning POWs. Meanwhile, as Bloch's [[motorcade]] makes its way to the Mall, Scully spots Teager in the crowd, only to see him vanish in an instant. Mulder tells Skinner and Scully that the government has arranged for their investigation to fail in an effort to cover up the truth about [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue|American POWs still being kept in Vietnam]].

In the present, during the re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes that no one can see Teager if they are in his [[Sightline|line of sight]]. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a different person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the war as he looks upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.&lt;ref name=plot/&gt;

==Production==

[[File:Howard Gordon by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|160px|[[Howard Gordon]] was inspired to write "Unrequited" after viewing an episode of ''[[60 Minutes]]'' about American secret agents that were left behind during the Vietnam War.]]

During the show's fourth season, episode co-writer [[Howard Gordon]] was slated to pen only one episode, the nineteenth entry "[[Synchrony (The X-Files)|Synchrony]]". However, after hearing rumors about American CIA agents left behind during the [[Vietnam War]], he started to develop what would become the story for "Unrequited". The day before the show's 1996 Christmas break, Howard approached series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] and co-executive producer [[Frank Spotnitz]] and told them about his new episode idea. The project was green-lit, but Howard struggled with breaking the story, necessitating Carter heavily assisting him (thus their shared writing credits).&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt;

Gordon had long been interested in writing an antagonist who could turn invisible, but he struggled with finding a scientific mechanism to explain this plot point. Eventually, Gordon discussed the struggle with his [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] brother, who told about [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spots]] in the human eye.&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt; Gordon noted, "These stories come from scientific research&amp;nbsp;... So I said, what if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists?"&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon decided to make the antagonist a Vietnam War veteran because "they are getting old, and like the Holocaust survivor [in] '[[Kaddish (The X-Files)|Kaddish]]', starting to die".&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt; This storyline also allowed Gordon the chance to give Vietnam veteran Walter Skinner a larger role{{em dash}}a chance that Gordon relished.&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt;

The episode featured a replica of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], of which only a portion was real (the rest being filled in with [[computer generated imagery|CGI]]).&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt;&lt;ref name=locale/&gt; Due to legal restrictions, the replica featured fake names, chosen by the sister of art assistant Kristina Lyne; the wall also included the names of ''The X-Files'' cast and crew, as well as noted writer [[Harlan Ellison]], and model [[Jessica Hahn]].&lt;ref name=meisler/&gt; For day scenes, the replica and an accompanying [[grandstand]] were erected in Vancouver's Jericho Park due to the locale's "expansive, groomed, flat" characteristics,&lt;ref name=locale/&gt; whereas nigh scenes were filmed in a large warehouse in [[Ballantyne Pier]]. This move required the production crew to dismantle and cart the grandstand from Jericho Park to the warehouse.&lt;ref name=locale&gt;Gradnitzer and Pittson, pp. 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The crowd used to film the memorial's reinauguration scene comprised 500 extras, who were multiplied in [[post-production]] with CGI technology. Fifty of these individuals had won the opportunity to appear on the show in local radio contests.&lt;ref name=meisler&gt;Meisler, p.&amp;nbsp;174–5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Park]] doubled as [[Freedom Plaza]]. Because the park is public and operated by the [[Vancouver Park Board]], city police cannot deny anyone access. This caused something of an issue when members of the [[paparazzi]] tried to photograph Anderson. Consequently, many of the available crew and production staff members formed a "human blockade", thereby blocking the photographers and protecting their co-star.&lt;ref name=locale/&gt;

==Reception==
"Unrequited" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on February&amp;nbsp;23,&amp;nbsp;1997.&lt;ref name="BBCdate"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Fourth Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 4) |origyear=1996–97 |others=[[R.W.

Club]]'' gave the episode a "B–".&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=VanDerWerff|url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/unrequitedcovenant,49921/|title='Unrequited'/'Covenant' {{!}} The X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club|publisher=[[The Onion]]|work=[[The A.V.

Instead, it's actually the endpoint".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Despite the negativity towards the plot, he wrote that the entry was "a good episode for Skinner" in that it gives him a mission and hints at his past without being heavy-handed.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Furthermore, VanDerWerff also applauded the way the show used the Vietnam War in a way that felt "fresh".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Independent reviewer [[Sarah Stegall]] awarded the episode a two out of five and derided it as a "pseudo-political story".&lt;ref name=sarah/&gt; She was negative towards the "lack of emotional investment", which she felt was what damaged the episode; she called Teager a cipher who was portrayed as a "Twitchy Vet" rather than a "Tragic Hero".&lt;ref name=sarah&gt;{{cite web|last=Stegall|first=Sarah|title=Now You See Him, Now You Don't|url=http://www.munchkyn.com/xf-rvws/unrequited.html|publisher=The Munchkyn Zone|accessdate=January 1, 2013|year=1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824063753/http://www.munchkyn.com/xf-rvws/unrequited.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', rated the episode two stars out of five.&lt;ref name=shearpear/&gt; They heavily criticized the episode for taking place before the events of "[[Kaddish (The X-Files)|Kaddish]]" and "[[Memento Mori (The X-Files)|Memento Mori]]" in an attempt to not deal with Scully's cancer. Furthermore, the two criticized the episode for being "thin stuff" and heavily padded; Shearman and Pearson note that the long teaser is replayed in the episode "to no new dramatic effect" and that Covarrubias's appearance offers no new information.&lt;ref name=shearpear&gt;Shearman and Pearson, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; Paula Vitaris, writing for ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', rated "Unrequited" one star out of four, writing that it "collapses under the weight of its message" and that it "fails to bring to life any of its guest characters".&lt;ref name=cine/&gt; Furthermore, she criticized the reusing of the teaser, noting that it "just comes off as a writer's device".&lt;ref name=cine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitaris|first=Paula|title=Episode Guide|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1997|volume=29|issue=4/5|pages=35–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Velvet Elvis''' is a [[painting]] of [[Elvis Presley]] on [[velvet]].  It typically represents a costumed torso of Elvis holding a [[microphone]], painted on [[black]] [[velvet]] (or velvet of some other dark color, such as [[navy blue]], [[red]] or [[purple]]). This iconic [[velvet painting]] is considered an archetypical example of [[kitsch]].

A brief history of black velvet paintings is presented by Pamela Liflander in ''Black Velvet Artist'', a booklet published by [[Running Press]], [[Philadelphia]] in 2003, and included in an art kit by the same name. Liflander also details the life of [[Edgar Leeteg]], "the father of American black velvet kitsch," whose "raucous and bawdy" life was previously captured by [[James Michener]] in ''[[Rascals in Paradise (book)|Rascals in Paradise]]'' (1957).

Velvet was a popular medium for artists on the streets of [[Tijuana]], reaching a height of popularity in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/spike/1040196203.php|title=The Rise and Fall of Velvet Elvis|publisher=OJR|accessdate=2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We'Moon: Gaia Rhythms for Womyn''''' is an astrological and lunar calendar datebook, featuring art and writing submitted by, for and about women. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt; "Wemoon" means "women," "we of the moon" (for other [[alternative political spelling]]s, see [[Womyn]]). The datebook was founded in 1981 and is published annually in Oregon, USA, by Mother Tongue Ink (d.b.a. We’Moon Company). ''We'Moon'' is a publication focused on “helping women make their daily lives sacred and align themselves with Earth and Moon rhythms.” &lt;ref&gt; Eisenberg, ''Sage Woman Magazine #66''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''We'Moon'' was inspired by the women’s liberation and emerging people's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and came to fruition in the 1980s as a vehicle for the creative expression of women's empowerment and [[earth-based spirituality]]. The idea of a special calendar for women—based on lunar, solar and astrological cycles—originated at Kvindelandet, an international [[womyn's land|women’s land]] in Denmark where 50–60 lesbians from different countries lived together in the late 1970s. The first ''We'Moon'' was self-published in France in 1981 under the name of Mother Tongue Ink, as a pocket-sized astrological moon calendar diary, handwritten in five languages. The first five editions were pocket-sized, homemade, and continually evolving in format, design and technology, changing languages every year. During these years, the datebook was created by groups of volunteers in various locations in Europe. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

''We'Moon '87'' was the first edition created in the U.S., where production has remained. Mother Tongue Ink, d.b.a. We’Moon Company, was incorporated in 1995. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.49, p,58&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mother Tongue Ink published a children’s book, ''The Last Wild Witch'', by [[Starhawk]], illustrated by Lindy Kehoe. ''In the Spirit of We’Moon – Celebrating 30 years – An Anthology of We’Moon Art and Writing'', was released in 2011. ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'' is "an anthology of writing and art originally published in the annual publication ''We'Moon'', with commentary and other new material." &lt;ref&gt; University of Oregon www.libweb.uoregon.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

''We'Moon'' sends out an annual Call for Contributions to women internationally, and publishes approximately 250 pieces of original art and writing in each year’s datebook. ''We'Moon''’s thematic focus includes feminism, goddess and earth-based spirituality, world community, environmentalism, peace and justice. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt;The datebook includes articles by astrologers Gretchen Lawlor, Heather Roan Robbins, [[Susan Levitt]] and Sandra Pastorius. Lunar phase and astrological aspect data are listed for each date. &lt;ref&gt; Sydney L. Murray, ''Vision Magazine'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''We'Moon'' has published work by thousands of contributing women, including writings by [[Joanna Macy]], [[Starhawk]], [[Susan Weed]], [[Winona LaDuke]], [[Carolyn Gage]], [[Myshkin (singer)|Myshkin]], [[Vicki Noble]], [[Donna Henes]], [[Alice Walker]], and founding editor Musawa, and art by [[Monica Sjoo]], [[Tee Corinne]], [[Meinrad Craighead]], Toni Truesdale, [[Betty LaDuke]], Sandra Stanton, Leah Dorion, Max Dashu, Sudie Rakusin and Hrana Janto. &lt;ref&gt; ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p. 242 - 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''West Chester University Poetry Conference''' is an international [[poetry]] [[Convention (meeting)|conference]] that has been held annually since 1995 at [[West Chester University]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.  It hosts various panel discussions and poetry craft [[Class (education)|workshops]], which focus primarily on formal poetry, [[narrative poetry]], [[New Formalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Nigel S. "[http://www.wcupa.edu/_ACADEMICS/SCH_CAS/POETRY/Poetry_Conference/tls.asp Letter from West Chester]." ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''. September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Expansive Poetry]]. It is the largest poetry-only conference in America&lt;ref name=timpane20100606/&gt; and possibly the world&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.14by14.com/Issue6/SoYouWanttoWinaNemerov.html So You Want to Win a Nemerov?]" ''14 by 14''. Issue 6. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the only conference which focuses on traditional craft.&lt;ref name=timpane20100606&gt;Timpane, John "[http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20100606_Conference_draws_poets_not_for_reading__but_for_crafting.html Conference draws poets not for reading, but for crafting]." ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' Sun, Jun. 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The conference was founded in 1995 by West Chester professor Michael Peich and poet [[Dana Gioia]] with 85 poets and scholars in attendance.&lt;ref name=wsj17june2010&gt;Hitchner, Earle "[https://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704009804575309183533157688.html Verse That Sings in Many Styles]." ''Wall Street Journal''. JUNE 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The original core faculty members included [[Annie Finch]], [[R. S. Gwynn]], [[Mark Jarman]], [[Robert McDowell (poet)|Robert McDowell]], and [[Timothy Steele]].  While some of these faculty still return regularly to teach, the faculty has expanded in recent years to include [[Kim Addonizio]], [[Rhina Espaillat]],  [[B. H. Fairchild]], [[Rachel Hadas]], [[Molly Peacock]], [[Mary Jo Salter]], [[A. E. Stallings]], and many other widely published New Formalists.

Starting in 1999, the conference's program began including an [[art song]] concert.&lt;ref name=wsj17june2010/&gt;

In 2003, Gioia stepped down as co-director of the conference in order to become chairman of the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].

The 2010 conference was the 16th and last year with Peich as director before he retired and passed the position to [[Kim Bridgford]].&lt;ref name=timpane20100606/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcupa.edu/_ACADEMICS/SCH_CAS/POETRY/BridgfordAnnouncement.asp&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the conference attendance had increased to 300 poets and poetry scholars.&lt;ref name=wsj17june2010/&gt; That year's concert of art song featured [[Natalie Merchant]], who sung the poetry of various poets of the past.&lt;ref name=wsj17june2010/&gt; On June 12, the last day of the conference, the [[2010 Birthday Honours|Queen's Birthday Honours 2010]] were announced, including British comic poet [[Wendy Cope]]'s appointment as an [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188429.pdf Queen's Birthday Honours List 2010]''. Saturday 12 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everseradio.com/wendy-cope-interviewed-at-west-chester-poetry-conference/ Wendy Cope Interviewed at West Chester Poetry Conference]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[R. S. Gwynn]] was named Program Director in September, 2015. His innovations included the initiation of a "Great Debates" series, the first of which, "Poetry or Verse?" was conducted by the poets [[James Matthew Wilson]] and [[Robert Archambeau]].

[[File:Wish Tree at Spier's.jpg|thumb|250px|Wishes on the [[Spier's school|Spier's]] Wish Tree in [[Beith]], [[Scotland]]]]
A '''wish tree''' is an individual tree, usually distinguished by species, position or appearance, which is used as an object of wishes and offerings. Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value. Postulants make [[votive]] offerings in hopes of having a wish granted, or a prayer answered, from a [[Animism|nature spirit]], [[saint]] or [[goddess]], depending on the local tradition. 

== Practices ==
===Coin trees===
[[File:Wish Tree at Aira Force.jpg|250px|thumb|Wish tree coins in timber at [[Aira Force]]]]
[[File:Hammering coin into Coin Tree.jpg|thumb|Hammering coin into Coin Tree at [[Bolton Abbey]]]]
One form of votive offering is the token offering of a coin. The remains of one such tree can be found&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-6UFDV2&lt;/ref&gt; near Ardmaddy House in [[Argyll]], [[Scotland]], a [[Common hawthorn|hawthorn]], which is a species traditionally linked with fertility. The trunk and branches are covered with hundreds of coins which have been driven through the bark and into the wood. The local tradition is that a wish will be granted for each of the coins so treated.&lt;ref name="Rodger"&gt;Rodger, Donald, Stokes, John &amp; Ogilve, James (2006). Heritage Trees of Scotland. The Tree Council. P.87. {{ISBN|0-904853-03-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*On [[Isle Maree]] in [[Loch Maree]], [[Gairloch]], in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] is an [[oak]] wish tree made famous by a visit in 1877 by [[Queen Victoria]] mentioned in her published diaries. The tree, and others surrounding it, are festooned with hammered-in coins.  It is near the healing well of St. Maree, to which votive offerings were made, including the sacrifice of bulls, which continued up to the 18th century, according to records.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;Sharp, Mick (1997). Holy Places of Celtic Britain. Blandford. {{ISBN|1-85079-315-8}}. P. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Near [[Mountrath]], [[County Laois]], is a shapeless old wish tree in the form of a [[Sycamore Maple|sycamore]] tree called St. Fintan's Well. The original well was filled in, but the water re-appeared in the centre of the tree. Hundreds of Irish pennies have been beaten into the bark as good luck offerings.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson P.108."&gt;Wilkinson, Gerald (1976). Trees in the Wild. Book Club Associates. P. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[High Force]] Waterfall has a coin wish tree in the grounds of the waterfall.
*A coin wish tree can be found in [[Colby Woodland Garden]].
*A coin tree can be found in the ground of [[Bolton Abbey]].
*Many public houses, such as the Punch Bowl in [[Askham, Cumbria|Askham]], near [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumbria, have old beams with splits in them into which coins are forced for luck.

Folklorist Ceri Houlbrook observed actions at a coin tree in [[Aira Force]], [[Cumbria]], noting that a succession of at least twelve families passed by the site and decided to hammer coins into it using a piece of limestone lying around; she commented that this custom appeared to offer "little variation: it is imitative, formulaic, homogeneous".{{sfn|Houlbrook|2014|p=40}}

===Clootie wells===

{{Main|clootie well}}
The practice of tying pieces of cloth to a wish tree is often directly associated with nearby [[clootie well]]s, as they are known in Scotland and Ireland, or "cloutie" or "cloughtie" in [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref name="Straffon"&gt;Straffon, Cherly (1998). Fentynyow Kernow. In Search of Cornwall's Holy Wells. Pub. Meyn Mamvro. {{ISBN|0-9518859-5-2}}, pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
There are parallels here with [[wassailing]] where the Wassail Queen is lifted up into the boughs of the apple tree, where she places toast that has been soaked in Wassail from the Clayen Cup as a gift to the tree spirits to ensure good luck for the coming season's crop and to show them the fruits of what they created the previous year.

===Shoe trees===
In a related cultural tradition found in many locations, including the United States, supplicant will toss or hurl shoes into trees that are locally designated as wellsprings of good fortune.  See [[Shoe tossing]].

===Other offerings===
* The [[Lam Tsuen Wishing Trees]] are located in Hong Kong near the Tin Hau Temple in Lam Tsu. Two banyan trees are frequented by tourists and the locals during the Lunar New Year. Previously, they burnt [[joss sticks]], wrote their wishes on joss paper tied to an orange, and then threw them up to hang in these trees, believing that if the paper successfully hung onto one of the tree branches, their wishes would come true.
* In [[Glasgow]]'s Hidden Garden at [[Pollockshields]] and at the [[Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery]] in Scotland, a number of trees have been planted onto which people can tie white labels, on which they have written their wishes.&lt;ref name="Hidden"&gt;[http://www.ben-network.org.uk/participation/green_spaces/gs_more_info/Hidden.html  Glasgow's Hidden Gardens].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Eglinton Castle]] estate, now [[Eglinton Country Park]], has had a wish tree for many years, a yew on an island in the Lugton Water, now left high and dry due to the [[weir]] giving way.
* The [[Christmas tree]] is often quoted as being a [[Paganism|pagan]] symbol connected with [[tree worship]], clearly linked with good luck achieved through offerings (decoration) to and [[veneration]] of special trees.
* A number of wish trees have been set up to make a wish for the environment, such as at the [[Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park]] Centre at [[Balloch, West Dunbartonshire|Balloch]] in Scotland. People make their wish for and pledge to help the environment and tie the wish label to the tree.
* The sacred well of [[Theneva|Saint Tanew]] – or [[Teneu|St Enoch]] – in Glasgow was much visited for cures and the old tree beside it was covered in small bits of tin-iron nailed to it by pilgrims. The offerings were shaped as eyes, feet, hands, ears, etc. depending on the cure hoped for. The saint was mother to [[Saint Mungo]].&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, Andrew (1880). ''Old Glasgow. The Place and the People''. Glasgow: Blackie and Son. Page 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dan Sing Khon260.JPG|thumb|250px|''[[Hopea odorata]]'' tree (ตะเคียน) stump with offerings near a ''[[Nang Ta-khian]]'' shrine. [[Dan Sing Khon]].]]
* In [[Hindu mythology]], the [[banyan]] tree is also called ''[[kalpavriksha]]'', meaning "wish- fulfilling tree", as it represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.
* ''Ashen tree, ashen tree, / Pray buy these warts of me'' was a rhyme one had to sing whilst sticking a pin first into one's warts and then into the tree.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson P.26."&gt;Wilkinson, Gerald (1976). Trees in the Wild. Book Club Associates. P.26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Wishing Tree or Kissing Tree was made at Christmas or [[Yuletide]] before pine trees were introduced by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1840. An evergreen bough was hung with apples, sweetmeats, and candles and decked with ribbons representing wishes.
* At the summit of the Fereneze Braes in [[Neilston]], Renfrewshire, Scotland, there was an old hawthorn, well known locally as "The Kissing Tree". The story goes that if a young man could drive a nail fully into the thorn tree with a single blow, then he would be entitled to "ae fond kiss" on the spot from his sweetheart. Success in the task was considered proof of his suitability as a good suitor for the young lady. The original tree fell in around 1860, but in 1910, a replacement was said to exist.&lt;ref name="Pride"&gt;Pride, David (1910), ''A History of the Parish of Neilston.'' Pub. Alexander Gardner, Paisley. P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Driving a nail into the tree may link the custom with that of driving coins into trees as noted above.
* In parts of [[Yorkshire]], a tree with two spreading branches which also formed a [[wikt:bower|bower]] over the point of branching, was known as a Wish Tree by children who would climb onto the junction and make a wish.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, Charles &amp; Patricia (2006). Oral communication to Mr. Roger S.Ll. Griffith.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Darwin]] encountered a tree in [[Argentina]] called ''Walleechu'', which was regarded by the local inhabitants as a god. The tree was festooned with offerings such as cigars, food, water, cloth, etc., hung from the branches by bright strips of coloured thread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/29/4.html "The Voyage of the Beagle"], Chapter IV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Harry (2006). ''[[This Thing of Darkness]].'' Pub. Headline Review. {{ISBN|0-7553-0281-8}}. P. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Thai folklore]] there are certain [[spirit]]s or [[fairy|fairies]] related to trees that are known generically as ''[[Nang Mai]]'' (นางไม้; "Lady of the Tree"), the most well-known being ''[[Nang Ta-khian]]''.&lt;ref name="Phi"&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/bouddha/animism5.htm Spirits]&lt;/ref&gt; Legends in the [[Thailand|Thai]] [[oral tradition]] say the spirit inhabits a [[Hopea odorata|''Ta-khian'' tree]] and sometimes appears as a beautiful young woman wearing traditional Thai attire, usually in reddish or brownish colours, contrasting with ''[[Nang Tani]]'' who haunts a type of banana trees and is mostly represented in a green dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tumnandd.com/wp-content/uploads/takien.jpg Nang Ta-khian image]&lt;/ref&gt; Trees, logs, beams or keels of wooden boats where the spirit is deemed to reside are an object of pilgrimage and have lengths of colored silk tied as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.tlcthai.com/news/41148.html 9-year old asked Lady Ta-khian for help (Thai)]&lt;/ref&gt; In present times Nang Ta-Khian is usually propitiated in order to be lucky in the [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.mthai.com/blog/32621.html 10 อันดับ สถานที่ขอหวย ที่ฮิตมากที่สุด ในประเทศไทย]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==

===Yoko Ono===
Since the 1990s the wish tree has played a significant part in many of [[Yoko Ono]]'s [[exhibition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a-i-u.net/wishtree2.html Wishing in Yoko Ono's Art].&lt;/ref&gt; Ono's ''[[Wish Tree (Yoko Ono art series)|Wish Tree]]'', installed in the Sculpture Garden of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York in July 2010, has become very popular, with contributions from all over the world.
Her ''[[Wish Tree for Washington, DC]]'' at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] was installed three years prior.

===Mandali Mendrilla===
Fashion Designer Mandali Mendrilla designed a runway collection inspired by Wish Trees called Wish Tree Dress that was presented on the catwalk of the Croatian Fashion Week in June 2015. Mandali also designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the China Art Museum in Shanghai in November 2015. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living Wish Tree. &lt;ref&gt;http://wall.hr/fashion/dizajnerica-hrvatskog-podrijetla-mandali-mendrilla-u-najvecem-azijskom-muzeju/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://formsofdevotion.org/china-art-museum-in-shanghai/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Tourism rankings''' are compiled by the [[United Nations]] [[World Tourism Organization]] as part of their ''World Tourism Barometer'' publication, which is released three times throughout the year. In the publication, [[United Nations geoscheme|UN regions and subregions]] are ranked by the number of international visitor arrivals, by the [[revenue]] generated by inbound [[tourism]], and by the [[cost|expenditures]] of outbound travelers.

==Most visited destinations by international tourist arrivals==
In 2017, there were 1.323 billion international tourist arrivals worldwide, with a growth of 6.8% as compared to 2016.&lt;ref name="WTO Tourism Highlights 2018 Edition"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights: 2018 Edition {{!}} World Tourism Organization|url=https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284419876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top 10 international tourism destinations in 2017 were (2017 numbers are preliminary):
