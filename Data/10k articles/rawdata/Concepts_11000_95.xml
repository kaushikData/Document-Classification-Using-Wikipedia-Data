'''Acceptance''' in [[human]] [[psychology]] is a person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a negative or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it or protest it. The concept is close in meaning to ''acquiescence'', derived from the Latin ''acquiēscere'' (to find rest in).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquiesce|title=Acquiesce - Define Acquiesce at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

The term ''acceptance'' is a noun with various different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acceptance|title=Acceptance - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the person to whom a proposal is made signifies their assent, it is an "acceptance" of their offer, also called an agreement. For example, if someone gives a gift and another receives it, then they have accepted the gift; therefore, having acceptance. Another definition of acceptance has to do with positive welcome and belonging, favor, and endorsement. For instance, one can like someone and accept them due to their approval of that person. Another description is that acceptance can be an act of believing or assenting. The definition overlaps with ''[[toleration]]'', but acceptance and tolerance are not synonyms.

Acceptance – "An express act or implication by conduct that manifests assent to the terms of an offer in a manner invited or required by the offer so that a [[legally binding|binding]] contract is formed. The exercise of power conferred by an offer by performance of some act. The act of a person to whom something is offered of [[tendered]] by another, whereby the offered demonstrates through an act invited by the offer an intention of retaining the subject of the offer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts|last=Chirelstein|first=Marvin|publisher=Foundation|year=2001|isbn=1587781972|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eckhart Tolle]], a spiritual teacher who is alive today, defines acceptance as a "this is it" response to anything occurring in any moment of life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} There, strength, peace and serenity are available when one stops struggling to resist, or hang on tightly to what is so in any given moment. What do I have right now?  Now what am I experiencing? The point is, can one be sad when one is sad, afraid when afraid, silly when silly, happy when happy, judgmental when judgmental, overthinking when overthinking, serene when serene, etc. 

To simplify, acceptance means allowing; allowing unwanted private experiences (thoughts, feelings and urges) to come and go without struggling with them.

==Types==
Before any breakdown to types, it should be recognized that ''acceptance'' is treating whatever happens, the actual event which is the outcome of all combined previous events, as overall the best outcome. Acceptance typically contains the concept of approval; the [[Psychology|psycho]]-[[Spirituality|spiritual]] use of the term infers a non-judgmental mindset. Acceptance is contrasted with ''resistance'', a term that has strong political and [[psychoanalytic]] connotations that do not apply in most contexts. Groups and individuals can show acceptance of various events and conditions in the world; individuals may accept elements of their own thoughts, feelings, and personal histories. For example, [[psychotherapeutic]] treatment of a person with [[depression (mood)|depression]] or [[anxiety]] can involve fostering acceptance either for whatever personal circumstances may give rise to those feelings or for the feelings themselves. Psychotherapy can also involve lessening an individual's acceptance of various situations.

Notions of acceptance are prominent in many faiths and meditation practices. For example, [[Buddhism]]'s [[Four Noble Truths|first noble truth]], "All life is suffering", invites people to accept that [[suffering]] is a natural part of life. The term "[[Kabbalah]]" literally means acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[minority group|Minority groups]] in society often describe their goal as acceptance, wherein the [[Normative social influence|majority]] will not [[marginalize]] the minority's full participation in society. A majority may be said to [[Toleration|tolerate]] minorities when it confines their participation to certain aspects of society, but not accept them.

Acceptance is the fifth stage of the [[Kübler-Ross model]] (commonly known as the "stages of dying").

''The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous'' describes the importance of acceptance in the treatment of alcoholism. It states that acceptance can be used to resolve situations where a person feels disturbed by a "person, place, thing or situation – some fact of [their] life – [which is] unacceptable to [them]". It claims that an alcoholic person cannot find serenity until they accept that "nothing happens in God's world by mistake" and that the condition of alcoholism must be accepted as a given.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Paul O, "The big book of Alcoholics Anonymous" P449, 3rd ed or P417, 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-acceptance===
{{main article|Self-acceptance}}
Self-acceptance is being satisfied with one's current [[self]]. It is an agreement with oneself to appreciate, validate, and support the self as it is, despite deficiencies and negative past behavior. People have trouble accepting themselves because of a lack of [[motivation]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some people have the misconception that if one is happy with themself, they would not change anything about themself. Individuals do not have to be unhappy with themselves to know and can actively change things they don't like.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Social acceptance===
[[File:Percentage Reporting living together as acceptable option.png|thumb|Changes in attitudes toward [[cohabitation]] in the [[United States|US]]]]

Social acceptance affects people of all [[Social group|social]] and age groups. Social acceptance can be defined as tolerating the differences and [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in others because most people attempt to look and act like others do in order to fit in.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Children and teenagers tend to desire to be accepted among friends as part of that group, and act upon that desire through [[peer pressure]]. Peer pressure sometimes determines how people style their hair and clothing to "look cool". A [[Motivation|desire]] to be accepted by those whose friendship one values can [[Social influence|determine their openness]] towards popular behavior smoking, drinking, swearing, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drinking, smoking causes early heart problems |url=https://www.krem.com/article/news/health/drinking-smoking-causes-early-heart-problems/293-588907864 |website=KREM |publisher=KREM |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; People exhibit and avoid certain behaviors out of the desire for the [[Social approval|approval]] of their friends, which may include [[Alcoholic drink|drinking]] or taking [[Narcotic|drugs]].

When it comes to [[Mental disabilites|mental disabilities]], social acceptance plays a big role in [[Recovery model|recovery]]. Many people don't understand mental illness, so they are unsure of how to embrace people who have a disease, leaving these people with feelings of [[Social isolation|isolation]] in friend groups.

===Conditional===
[[File:Infant furniture acceptable gaps.svg|thumb|Standards specify acceptable and hazardous gaps in [[infant bed]]s]]

A type of acceptance that requires modification of the initial conditions before the final acceptance is made, is called conditional acceptance, or qualified acceptance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} For example, a contract that needs to be accepted from two parties may be adjusted or modified so that it fits both parties' satisfactions. A person has been made an offer that they are willing to agree on as long as some changes are made in its terms or that some conditions or event occurs gives conditional acceptance. In a contract that is made from a business to the employer, both parties may change and modify the contract until both parties agree or accept the details in the business contract.

===Expressed===

Expressed acceptance involves making an [[wikt:overt|overt]] and unambiguous acceptance of the set conditions. For example, a person clearly and explicitly agreeing to an offer. They accept the terms without any changes.

===Implied===

Implied acceptance has one's intents to consent to the presented conditions made. Acceptance is implied by demonstrating any act indicating a person's assent to the proposed bargain. If a lady selects an item in a department store and pays the cashier for it, the lady has indicated that she has agreed to the department stores owner's offer to sell the item for the price stated on the price tag.

== Beliefs ==

Acceptance is fundamental to the core beliefs of most [[Abrahamic]] religions: the word "[[Islam]]" can be translated as "acceptance", "surrender" or "voluntary submission",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVyMAvW9slYC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=surrender+to+will+of+God+islam#v=onepage&amp;q=surrender%20to%20will%20of%20God%20islam&amp;f=false|first1=Bernard Ellis|last1=Lewis|first2=Buntzie Ellis|last2=Churchill|title=Islam: The Religion and the People|page=8|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=admin |title=What does ISLAM mean? |url=http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |work=The Friday Journal |publisher=qaem.org |accessdate=13 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314072458/http://www.qaem.org/wp/what-does-islam-mean/ |archivedate=14 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christianity]] is based upon the "acceptance" of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as the [[Christ]] and acceptance of God's will. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest a path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and [[Fate|fated]], or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk. Acceptance may imply only a lack of outward, behavioral attempts at possible change, but the word is also used more specifically for a felt or hypothesized [[cognitive]] or [[emotional]] state.

Within [[Christian]] beliefs, acceptance is characterized as embracing the reality of a situation based on one's [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] in God's perfect will and control. In the [[Muslim]] community, acceptance of Allah is similar to people that are considered [[Christian]] and how they accept God as their higher being (Bates, 2002). [[Judaism|Jewish]] people accept the [[Ten Commandments|Commandments]] as a way to live and have a good and fulfilling life (Mcdowell and Stewart, 1983).

[[Belief]]s and acceptance overlap in meaning. The acceptance of one's beliefs is important to show commitment and structure of one's life. Not only is it vital for [[Surviving|survival]], but it is used in everyday relationships.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Being accepted by a friend has shown to positively affect an individual's [[self-esteem]] and [[well-being]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} In fact, without acceptance, it could lead to a host of psychological issues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2772">[[Image:Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg|right|thumb|An artistic representation of the [[medieval Inquisition]], showing the carrying out of death sentences during an ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' (circa 1495).]]
'''''Ad extirpanda''''' (named for its [[Latin]] [[incipit]]) was a [[papal bull]] promulgated on Wednesday, May 15, 1252 by [[Pope Innocent IV]] which authorized in limited and defined circumstances the use of [[torture]] by the [[Inquisition]] for eliciting confessions from [[heretics]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, J (2006). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0028-4289.2006.00142.x Aquinas on Torture] ''New Blackfriars'', 87:229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The bull was issued in the wake of the murder of the papal inquisitor of Lombardy, [[St. Peter of Verona]], who was killed by a conspiracy of [[Catharism|Cathar]] sympathizers on 6 April 1252. The bull argued that as heretics are "murderers of souls as well as robbers of God’s [[sacraments]] and of the Christian faith ...", they are "to be coerced—as are thieves and bandits—into confessing their errors and accusing others, although one must stop short of danger to life or limb." &lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The following parameters were placed on the use of torture:&lt;ref name="catholic"&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*that it did not cause loss of life or limb (''citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum'') 
*that it was used only once
*that the Inquisitor deemed the evidence against the accused to be virtually certain.

The bull conceded to the State a portion of the property to be confiscated from convicted heretics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/php/disp.php3?a=schaff&amp;b=encyc06&amp;p=2 ''New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia'':] II. "The Inquisition in the Middle Ages".  Concise historical context of ''Ad extirpanda''&lt;/ref&gt; The State in return assumed the burden of carrying out the penalty. The relevant portion of the bull read: "When those adjudged guilty of heresy have been given up to the civil power by the bishop or his representative, or the Inquisition, the [[podestà]] or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once, and shall, within five days at the most, execute the laws made against them."&lt;ref&gt;Kline, Austin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5345">'''All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch''' ('''AIDMAM''') is a platform for women from the [[Dalit]] community to raise their voices for justice. This platform has raised several struggles and movements for self-respect and dignity. AIDMAM is a movement which was initiated by the [[National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights]] (NCDHR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asha Kowtal|url=http://idsn.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/Profiles/Asha_Kowtal_Profile_2014.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the movement is to recognize how the [[class (social)|class]], [[caste]], and [[gender identity]] of a dalit woman overlap and place them at the very bottom of the [[social hierarchy]]. They work to empower dalit women to challenge these caste, class, and gender hierarchies and move forward in their struggle for justice. They do so through networking, enhancing skills and leadership at the state and district level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2017/11/23/interview-anju-singh-aidmam/|title=Interview With Anju Singh From AIDMAM|last=Banerji|first=Mahika|date=2017-11-23|work=Feminism In India|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beginnings and organisation ==
AIDMAM was founded in 2006 by [[convener]], [[Vimal Thorat]] and general secretary, [[Asha Kowtal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2801526761.html|title='Untouchability Is an Instrument in the Hands of the Upper Castes'|last=|first=|date=30 October 2012|work=Tehelka|access-date=13 August 2018|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/dalit-womens-rights-activists-to-present-accounts-of-caste-violence-at-unhrc-5223007/|title=Dalit women’s rights activists to present accounts of caste violence at UNHRC|last=Nair|first=Shalini|date=2018-06-19|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They primarily work in North India and have intervened in six states: [[Haryana]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Bihar]], [[Madhya Pradesh|MP]] and [[Rajasthan]]. As a movement they are constantly networking with dalit, women and human rights organisations and facilitate the building of dalit women's perspective. They monitor violence against dalit women and also conduct research on these issues which facilitated their advocacy efforts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Building on the capacities of dalit women connected with the movement is one of their main activities.

In 2009, AIDMAM started a programme which worked with dalit women who were elected representatives of [[panchayats]] in five states. The aim was to train these women to act upon issues of violence against women. They also started a dalit women's self-respect [[yatra|''yatra'']], which was a monthlong ''yatra'' in 2014 where they traveled across states and organised the dalit community and campaigned against violence against dalit women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalit women's self-respect yatra|url=https://madmimi.com/p/c487a4|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, AIDMAM traveled in the [[United States]] and spoke to [[Black people|black]] activists in that country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AIDMAM held additional marches in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jun/24/dalit-women-to-march-across-seven-haryana-districts-against-caste-violence-1832746.html|title=Dalit women to march across seven Haryana districts against caste violence|last=Mitra|first=Ritwika|date=24 June 2018|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2018, they presented a "side event" at the 38th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] which included testimonies of caste-based violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-women-s-group-bats-for-rights-at-united-nations-forum/story-HkAmMbvna4sB6M78NMv3CI.html|title=Dalit women’s group bats for rights at United Nations forum|last=Ratnam|first=Dhamini|date=2018-06-22|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social media]] campaign, called #DalitWomenFight, is used by AIDMAM to increase support for their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/aYFKgQWoIz0GxJYPDlczjK/Dalit-women-are-brewing-their-own-social-revolution.html|title=Dalit women are brewing their own social revolution|last=Masoodi|first=Ashwaq|date=2018-07-18|work=Live Mint|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattleglobalist.com/2015/10/22/dalit-women-fight-caste-apartheid-black-lives-matter/43025|title=Connecting the movements for Dalit and Black lives - The Seattle Globalist|date=2015-10-22|work=The Seattle Globalist|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/dalitwomenfight-brings-fight-against-caste-based-violence-u-s-n454056|title=#DalitWomenFight Brings Fight Against Caste-Based Violence to U.S.|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism}}

The '''Allegory of the Cave''', or '''Plato's Cave''', was presented by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (514a–520a) to compare "the effect of [[education]] ([[Wiktionary:παιδεία|παιδεία]]) and the lack of it on our [[physis|nature]]". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother [[Glaucon]] and his mentor [[Socrates]], narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the [[analogy of the sun]] (508b–509c) and the [[analogy of the divided line]] (509d–511e). All three are characterized in relation to [[dialectic]] at the end of Books&amp;nbsp;VII and VIII (531d–534e).

Plato has Socrates describe a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and give names to these shadows. The shadows are the prisoners' reality. Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all, for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners. The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison, for they know no better life. The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day, and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was. They discovered the sun, which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man cannot see behind. Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave, the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the [[sense]]s. Even if these interpretations (or, in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] terminology, intuitions) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality, we cannot somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition—we cannot free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains. If, however, we were to miraculously escape our bondage, we would find a world that we could not understand—the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it. In other words, we would encounter another "realm", a place incomprehensible because, theoretically, it is the source of a higher reality than the one we have always known; it is the realm of pure [[Theory of forms|Form]], pure fact.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, A. S. "Plato's Simile of Light. (Part II.) The Allegory of the Cave (Continued)". ''The Classical Quarterly'' 16, no. 1 (1922): 15–28. {{jstor|636164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates remarks that this allegory can be paired with previous writings, namely the analogy of the sun and the analogy of the divided line.

==Terminology==
The allegory of the cave is also called the '''''analogy of the cave''''', '''''myth of the cave''''', '''''metaphor of the cave''''', '''''parable of the cave''''', and '''''Plato's Cave'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The various English names of this allegory were often traditionally capitalized as if they were the names of a chapter in Plato's text, which is not correct, or according to an older style that capitalized all (famous) allegories and theories and even concepts. Wikipedia's manual of style does not follow this older practice, and neither do many modern publications in reliable sources nor, for example, the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Columbia Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imprisonment in the cave ===
Plato begins by having Socrates ask Glaucon to imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not look around at the cave, each other, or themselves (514a–b).&lt;ref name="The Republic"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|editor1-last=Rouse|editor1-first=W.H.D.|title=The Republic Book VII|publisher=Penguin Group Inc|pages=365–401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets "of men and other living things" (514b).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do ("just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets" (514a)&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;). The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows (514c).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see (514b-515a).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

===Departure from the cave===

Plato then supposes that one prisoner is freed. This prisoner would look around and see the fire. The light would hurt his eyes and make it difficult for him to see the objects casting the shadows. If he were told that what he is seeing is ''real'' instead of the other version of reality he sees on the wall, he would not believe it. In his pain, Plato continues, the freed prisoner would turn away and run back to what he is accustomed to (that is, the shadows of the carried objects). He writes "... it would hurt his eyes, and he would escape by turning away to the things which he was able to look at, and these he would believe to be clearer than what was being shown to him."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

Plato continues: "Suppose... that someone should drag him... by force, up the rough ascent, the steep way up, and never stop until he could drag him out into the light of the sun."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The prisoner would be angry and in pain, and this would only worsen when the radiant light of the sun overwhelms his eyes and blinds him.&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

"Slowly, his eyes adjust to the light of the sun. First he can only see shadows. Gradually he can see the reflections of people and things in water and then later see the people and things themselves. Eventually, he is able to look at the stars and moon at night until finally he can look upon the sun itself (516a)."&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; Only after he can look straight at the sun "is he able to reason about it" and what it is (516b).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; (See also [[Analogy of the Sun|Plato's Analogy of the Sun]], which occurs near the end of ''The Republic'', Book VI.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, B. (ed.) (1941). ''Plato's The Republic''. New York: The Modern Library. {{OCLC|964319}}.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Return to the cave===
Plato continues, saying that the freed prisoner would think that the world outside the cave was superior to the world he experienced in the cave; "he would bless himself for the change, and pity [the other prisoners]" and would want to bring his fellow cave dwellers out of the cave and into the sunlight (516c).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

The returning prisoner, whose eyes have become accustomed to the sunlight, would be blind when he re-enters the cave, just as he was when he was first exposed to the sun (516e).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt; The prisoners, according to Plato, would infer from the returning man's blindness that the journey out of the cave had harmed him and that they should not undertake a similar journey. Plato concludes that the prisoners, if they were able, would therefore reach out and kill anyone who attempted to drag them out of the cave (517a).&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

== Symbolism  ==
[[File:Plato - Allegory of the Cave.png|thumb|200px|right|"Plato's Cave Allegory" by Markus Maurer]] The allegory contains many forms of symbolism used to describe the illusions of the world. The cave represents the superficial world for the prisoners. The chains that prevent the prisoners from leaving the cave represent ignorance, meaning the chains are stopping them from learning the truth. The shadows that cast on the walls of the cave represent the superficial truth, which is an illusion that the prisoners see in the cave. The freed prisoner represents those in society who see the physical world for the illusion that it is. The sun that is glaring the eyes of the prisoners represents the real truth of the actual world.&lt;ref name="The Republic" /&gt;

==Themes in the allegory appearing elsewhere in Plato's work==
The allegory is probably related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], according to which the "Forms" (or "[[Idea]]s"), and not the material world known to us through sensation, possess the highest and most fundamental kind of reality. Only knowledge of the Forms constitutes real knowledge or what Socrates considers "the good".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5–7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=978-1-85326-483-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates informs Glaucon that the most excellent people must follow the highest of all studies, which is to behold the Good. Those who have ascended to this highest level, however, must not remain there but must return to the cave and dwell with the prisoners, sharing in their labors and honors.

Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' contains similar imagery to that of the allegory of the Cave; a philosopher recognizes that before philosophy, his soul was "a veritable prisoner fast bound within his body... and that instead of investigating reality of itself and in itself is compelled to peer through the bars of a prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=R. K.|title=Socrates and Plato's Cave|journal=Kant-Studien|year=1967|volume=58|issue=2|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly discussion==
Scholars debate the possible interpretations of the allegory of the Cave, either looking at it from an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] standpoint – one based on the study of how Plato believes we come to know things – or through a political ([[Politeia]]) lens.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Hall-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Much of the scholarship on the allegory falls between these two perspectives, with some completely independent of either. The epistemological view and the political view, fathered by [[Richard Lewis Nettleship]] and A.S. Ferguson respectively, tend to be discussed most frequently.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Hall-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Nettleship interprets the allegory of the cave as representative of our innate intellectual incapacity, in order to contrast our lesser understanding with that of the philosopher, as well as an allegory about people who are unable or unwilling to seek truth and wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Dale. "INTERPRETING PLATO'S CAVE AS AN ALLEGORY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION." ''Apeiron: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy and Science'' 14, no. 2 (1980): 74-86. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.jstor.org/stable/40913453&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson, on the other hand, bases his interpretation of the allegory on the claim that the cave is an allegory of human nature and that it symbolizes the opposition between the philosopher and the corruption of the prevailing political condition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Nettleship-7|[7]]][[Allegory of the Cave#cite note-Ferguson-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Cleavages have emerged within these respective camps of thought, however. Much of the modern scholarly debate surrounding the allegory has emerged from [[Martin Heidegger]]'s exploration of the allegory, and philosophy as a whole, through the lens of human freedom in his book ''The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato's Cave Allegory and Theaetetus''.&lt;ref&gt;McNiell, William. "Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews." The Essence of Human Freedom: An Introduction to Philosophy and The Essence of Truth: On Plato's Cave Allegory and Theaetetus // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame. Accessed December 09, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23227/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Hannah Arendt]], an advocate of the political interpretation of the allegory, suggests that through the allegory, Plato "wanted to apply his own theory of ideas to politics".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Abensour, Miguel. ''Against the Sovereignty of Philosophy over Politics: Arendt's Reading of Plato's Cave Allegory Social Research''; Winter 2007; 74, 4; ProQuest Social Sciences Premium Collection pg. 955&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Heidegger argues that the essence of truth is a way of being and not an object.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Sally. "Discovering the Unhidden: Heidegger's Interpretation of Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Its Implications for Psychotherapy." ''Existential Analysis'' 22, no. 1 (January 2011). Accessed December 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt criticised Heidegger's interpretation of the allegory, writing that "Heidegger…is off base in using the cave simile to interpret and 'criticize' Plato's theory of ideas".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is also implicit in much of science; for instance, experiments on laboratory rats typically proceed on the basis that some physiological similarities between rats and humans entails some further similarity (e.g. possible reactions to a drug).&lt;ref name="salmon"&gt;{{citation|last=Salmon|first=Merrilee|title=Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vd8JAAAAQBAJ|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-133-71164-2|pages=132–142|chapter=Arguments from analogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
The process of analogical inference involves noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"&gt;{{Cite book

: P has been observed to have further property x.

The argument does not assert that the two things are ''large and very big'', only that they are ''similar''.  The argument may provide us with ''good evidence'' for the conclusion, but the conclusion does not follow as a matter of [[logical truth|logical necessity]].&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;  Determining the strength of the argument requires that we take into consideration more than just the ''form'': the ''content'' must also come under scrutiny.

== Analyzing arguments from analogy ==

===Strength of an analogy===

Several {{vanchor|factors}} affect the strength of the argument from analogy:
* The '''{{vanchor|relevance}}''' (positive or negative) of the ''known'' similarities to the similarity ''inferred in the conclusion''.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gensler"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|degree}}''' of relevant similarity (or dissimilarity) between the two objects.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;
* The '''{{vanchor|amount}}''' and '''{{vanchor|variety|diversity}}''' of instances that form the basis of the analogy.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Counterarguments===

Arguments from analogy may be attacked by use of '''disanalogy''', '''counteranalogy''', and by pointing out '''unintended consequences''' of an analogy.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  In order to understand how one might go about analyzing an argument from analogy, consider the [[Watchmaker analogy|teleological argument]] and the criticisms of this argument put forward by the philosopher [[David Hume]].

According to the analogical reasoning in the teleological argument, it would be ridiculous to assume that a complex object such as a watch came about through some random process. Since we have no problem at all inferring that such objects must have had an intelligent designer who created it for some purpose, we ought to draw the same conclusion for another complex and apparently designed object: the universe.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

Hume argued that the universe and a watch have many relevant dissimilarities; for instance, the universe is often very disorderly and random. This is the strategy of "disanalogy": just as the amount and variety of relevant similarities between two objects strengthens an analogical conclusion, so do the amount and variety of relevant dissimilarities weaken it.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  Creating a "counteranalogy," Hume argued that some natural objects seem to have order and complexity — snowflakes for example — but are not the result of intelligent direction.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;  But then just as the snowflake's order and complexity itself might not have direction, the causes of the order and complexity might.  So this would be an example of disproof by begging the question.  Finally, Hume provides many possible "unintended consequences" of the argument; for instance, given that objects such as watches are often the result of the labor of groups of individuals, the reasoning employed by the teleological argument would seem to lend support to polytheism.&lt;ref name="Baronett"/&gt;

==False analogy==
A '''false analogy''' is a faulty instance of the argument from analogy.

An argument from analogy is weakened if it is inadequate in any of the [[#factors|above respects]]. The term "false analogy" comes from the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], who was one of the first individuals to engage in a detailed examination of analogical reasoning.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt; One of Mill's examples involved an inference that some person is lazy from the observation that his or her sibling is lazy. According to Mill, sharing parents is not all that relevant to the property of laziness.&lt;ref name="salmon"/&gt;

===Examples===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
A basic example:
"The model of the solar system is similar to that of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. Electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we should study ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit."

Another example is:

Person A: ''"I think that people can have some affection for their cultural heritage."''

Person B: ''"You're just like [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]!"''

In the above example, Person B has evaded a reasoned discussion by tarring Person A with an irrelevant association to an idea that Hitler used.
No one person is identical to another to the extent that their proposals can be disparaged by a mere reference to that other person. It is a form of [[ad hominem]]: Attacking the messenger, rather than the message. The above example is also an example of [[Reductio ad Hitlerum]] and, in an online context, invokes [[Godwin's law]].

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} FR_1 \\ FR_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} DP_1 \\ DP_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method gets its name from its use of design principles or design [[Axioms]] (i.e., given without proof) governing the analysis and [[decision making process]] in developing high quality product or system designs.  The two axioms used in Axiomatic Design (AD) are:

* Axiom 1: '''The Independence Axiom'''.  Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs).
* Axiom 2: '''The Information Axiom'''.  Minimize the information content of the design.

Axiomatic design is considered to be a design method that addresses fundamental issues in [[Taguchi methods]].

The methodology was developed by Dr. [[Suh Nam Pyo]] at MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering since the 1990s. A series of academic conferences have been held to present current developments of the methodology. The most recent International Conference on Axiomatic Design (ICAD) was the 11th ICAD hosted in Romania in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icad.tcm.cmmi.tuiasi.ro/|title=11th ICAD|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14178">A '''behavioral cusp''' is any [[behavior]] change that brings an organism's behavior into contact with new contingencies that have far-reaching consequences.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; A behavioral cusp is a special type of behavior change because it provides the learner with opportunities to access new reinforcers, new contingencies, new environments, new related behaviors (generativeness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alessi | first1 = G. | year = 1987 | title = Generative strategies and teaching for generalization | url = | journal = The Analysis of Verbal Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 15–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and competition with archaic or problem behaviors. It affects the people around the learner, and these people agree to the behavior change and support its development after the intervention is removed.

The concept has far reaching implications for every individual, and for the field of developmental psychology, because it provides a behavioral alternative to the concept of [[Developmental psychology|maturation]] and change due to the simple passage of time, such as [[developmental milestones]]. The cusp is a behavior change that presents special features when compared to other behavior changes.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
The concept was first proposed{{when|date=August 2014}} by [[Sidney W. Bijou]], an American developmental psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, S. and Hixson, M.D. (2004). The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 5 (3), 244–253 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the cusp was to link behavioral principles to rapid spurts in development (see [[Behavior analysis of child development]]).

A behavioral cusp as conceptualized by Jesus Rosales-Ruiz &amp; [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in 1997 is an important behavior change that affects future behavior changes.&lt;ref name="rosales97"&gt;{{citation |last= Rosales-Ruiz |first=J. |last2=Baer |first2=D.M. |year=1997 |chapter=Behavioral cusps: a developmental and pragmatic concept for behavior analysis |title=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=30 |pages= 533–544 |pmc=1284066 |pmid=9316263 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1997.30-533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral cusp, like the [[reinforcer]], is apprehended by its effects. Whereas a reinforcer acts on a single response or a group of related responses, the effects of a behavioral cusp regulate a large number of responses in a more distant future.

The concept has been compared to a [[developmental milestone]], however, not all cusps are milestones. For example, learning to play soccer is not a milestone, but it was life-changing for [[Pelé]]. As a result of learning to kick grapefruits (the initial important change or cusp), Pelé accessed (1) new environments, (2) new reinforcers, (3) new soccer moves, (4) dropped competing behaviors (smoking), and (5) gained international acclaims for his skill. Soccer is not a [[developmental milestone]] because it is not a necessary skill in most environments.

==Properties==
The following properties are special features of a behavioral change that lead to more change, and an increased likelihood of social adaptation, independence, and [[cultural fitness]].

===New reinforcers===
New reinforcers are accessible and enrich the perspective of the learner. Additionally these reinforcers may lead to an increase in the variety of behaviors. If the reinforcers are promoting health and social behaviors, they will lead to an improved quality of life.

====Case example====
A child who learns to open a door may access the swing for the first time and learns to use the swing.&lt;ref name="rosales97"/&gt; Here, the new skill (swinging motion is the reinforcer) may lead to more complex and social activities such as (1) turn taking, (2) asking someone to share the swing, (3) taking turns pushing someone, which in turn (4) may provide more social opportunities to speak and (5) interact with the play partners, etc.

====Case non-example====
A child learns to open a door and walks outside. He finds some ants behind a shrubbery and watches the ants. His parents are looking for him, they get worried and are calling him. The child is unusually mesmerized by columns of ants on the ground and does not hear the calls. His parents find him shortly after, but they are frantic from their 5-minute search and accidentally scare him from going outside. In this non-example, learning to open doors that lead outside resulted in consequences that did not directly benefit the child and maybe decrease important skills related to exploration and search. In this case, no new reinforcers were contacted and learning to open the backyard door (that has a special latch) was effectively a waste of time because the child's parents don't usually approve being alone in the backyard.

===New contingencies of reinforcement===
New contingencies are responsible for the selection of novel and more [[adaptive behaviors]] while decreasing problematic or archaic behaviors. Contingencies of reinforcement (before&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reinforcer) produce and maintain each and every learned behavior. New contingencies establish the control of new stimuli over our behaviors, and therefore make us more sensitive and aware of our surrounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Selection by Consequences |url=http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |publisher=Walden Fellowship, Inc. |year=1999 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171113/http://www.bfsr.org/element1.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

===New environments===
New environments are geographical and/or virtual areas of potential change (receiving environments). New environments regulate, maintain, and set the micro-cultural boundaries for reinforcers (and punishers), and their antecedents. They include tools and stakeholders controlling the pace and content of instruction and, as a result, they regulate boundary of what the learner learns (e.g., school curriculum). New environments must contain some of the stakeholders' preferences and reinforcers to create lasting [[positive reinforcement]] practices for the learner.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

===Generativeness===
Generativeness describes the ability of the receiving environment to regulate novel responses, functions, values or response products derived from the original cusp response. For a behavior, it is the ability to recombine or merge into more complex units, or the ability to contact environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosch | first1 = S. | last2 = Fuqua | first2 = R.W. | year = 2001 | title = Behavioral cusps: a model for selecting target behaviors | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 123–125 | doi=10.1901/jaba.2001.34-123| pmc = 1284293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[phonetic reading]] and can recombine the 50 or so English phonemes into 50,000 words by recombining the individual sounds he has learned to read. The generative index for this act of learning the basic English phonemes is approximately 10,000 (where one new behavior results in a potential 10,000 applications).

====Case non-example====
{{NPOV|reason=Seems partisan in favor of the pro-phonics camp|date=July 2015}}
A child learns [[Look-say|sight reading]] for 50 words. When a new word is presented, the child learns by listening to a teacher and memorizes the words rather than using what he has previously learned, thus becoming able to read only 50 words using this method. Additionally, he is now dependent on someone for learning each new vocabulary word.

===Competition with archaic behaviors===
Behavior competition is the ability of cusp behaviors to displace previously established behaviors on a continuum of intensity and rate, across repertoires, and environments. Competing archaic behaviors occur on a corresponding continuum of severity.

===Effect on stakeholders===
Effect on others comes from the learner's behavior affecting the stakeholders who control reinforcers and punishers in a specific environment. It is important to identify these stakeholders' motivations and reinforcers in selecting potential cusps. Effect refers to the changes in values and behaviors of the stakeholder resulting from a cusp in the learner. The initial and gradually more complex behaviors that constituted the entry point for an important behavior change that, once initiated, so profoundly alters, displaces, or transforms one's behavioral repertoire that it renders preexisting behavioral repertoires obsolete. A behavioral cusp is an important behavior change that alters the probability of the learner's future repertoires and interactions with stakeholders' repertoires.

===Social validity===
[[Social validity]] is an indicator of social acceptability of a behavior and its consequences for the stakeholders representing the communities which the learner is accessing or will access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = I. | last2 = Baer | first2 = D. | year = 1991 | title = Social validity Assessment: Is current practice state of the art? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 189–204 | doi=10.1901/jaba.1991.24-189| pmc = 1279564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some seemingly insignificant changes in a stakeholder may dramatically affect the learner. All stakeholders (e.g., government officials, teachers, parents, and other interventionists) should agree to the goals, methods, and tools for the intervention and the norms from the local community suggest the boundaries of what should be learned.

==Applications==

===Life span/development guidelines===
The behavioral cusp has implications for the selection and sequencing of skills during the life span. While milestones are mainly concerned with the chronology of behaviors, the concept of behavioral cusp is concerned with the fitness of the behavior within a context or a [[receiving environment]]. As Rosales-Ruiz and Baer (1997) stated, "One child's cusp may be another child's waste of time." Thus, there is a great need for empirically-based guidelines in making decisions related to the initial selection of skills.

===Prediction and control of development over longer periods of time===
The applications of the concepts are related to the prediction, selection, and retention of successful and adaptive behaviors to the treatment of [[childhood autism]], [[Down syndrome]], and other [[developmental disabilities]] is humane and based on evidence from the field of [[behavior analysis]]. The first applications of the concept derive from a set of guidelines proposed by Bosch and Fuqua in ''The [[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]''.

===Development of new technology===
A new technology and methodology, necessary to measure the effects of a small change over time, will reveal a strong dependence on the initial conditions selected by a cusp specialist ([[butterfly effect]]).

==Future research==
Future research will elucidate the nature and parameters of the criteria and the tools used in the selection and sequencing of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=The final piece to a complete science of behavior: behavior development and behavioral cusps |title=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=244–254 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hixson |first=M.D. |year=2004 |chapter=Behavioral cusps, basic behavioral repertoires, and cumulative-hierarchical learning |title=The Psychological Record |volume=54 |pages=387–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As importantly, the existing parameters (proposed by Rosales-Ruiz, Baer, Bosch, &amp; Fuqua) provides justifications for behavioral interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stokes | first1 = John V. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = Michael J. | last3 = Dorsey | first3 = Michael F. | last4 = Fleming | first4 = Elizabeth | year = 2004 | title = Task analysis, correspondence training, and general case instruction for teaching personal hygiene skills | url = | journal = Behavioral Interventions | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 121–135 | doi=10.1002/bin.153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = D.E. | last2 = Greer | first2 = D.R. | year = 2003 | title = Generalized imitation and the mand: introducing first instances of speech in young children with autism | url = | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 58–74 | doi=10.1016/s0891-4222(02)00167-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ala'i-Rosales, S.; Smith, G.J. &amp; Edelen-Smith, P.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13063">'''Physical causal closure''' is a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory about the nature of causation in the [[Physical property|physical]] realm with significant ramifications in the study of [[metaphysics]] and [[Philosophy of mind|the mind]]. In a strongly stated version, physical causal closure says that "all physical states have ''pure'' physical causes" — [[Jaegwon Kim]],&lt;ref name="Kim1" /&gt; or that "physical effects have ''only'' physical causes" — Agustin Vincente, p.&amp;nbsp;150.&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;

Those who accept the theory tend, in general although not exclusively, to the physicalist view that all entities that exist are physical entities.  As Karl Popper says, "The physicalist principle of closedness of the physical ... is of decisive importance and I take it as the characteristic principle of physicalism or materialism."&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;

==Definition==
Physical causal closure has stronger and weaker formulations.&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt;

The stronger formulations assert that "No physical event has a cause outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; That is, they assert that for physical events, causes ''other'' than physical causes do not exist. (Physical events that are not causally ''determined'' may be said to have their objective ''chances of occurrence'' determined by physical causes.)&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt;

Weaker forms of the theory state that "Every physical event has a physical cause." — Barbara Montero,&lt;ref name=Montero/&gt; or that "Every physical effect (that is, caused event) has physical sufficient causes" — Agustin Vincente,&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt; (According to Vincente, a number of caveats have to be observed, among which is the postulate that "physical entities" are entities postulated by a true theory of physics, a theory of which we are ignorant today, and that such a true theory "will not include mental (or in general, dubious) concepts" (Note 5, p.&amp;nbsp;168).&lt;ref name=Vicente /&gt;) or that "if we trace the causal ancestry of a physical event we need never go outside the physical domain." — Jaegwon Kim.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt;  Weaker forms of physical causal closure are synonymous with the ''causal completeness'',&lt;ref name="VelmansSchneider2008"/&gt; the notion that "Every physical effect that has a sufficient cause has a sufficient physical cause."&lt;ref name=Sarkar/&gt; That is, weaker forms allow that ''in addition'' to physical causes, there may be other kinds of causes for physical events.

The notion of [[Reduction (philosophy)|reductionism]] supplements physical causal closure with the claim that ''all'' events ultimately can be reduced to physical events. Under these circumstances, mental events are a subset of physical events and caused by them.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Importance==
Physical causal closure is especially important when considering [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] theories of [[mind]]. If no physical event has a cause outside the physical realm, it would follow that non-physical [[mental events]] would be causally impotent in the physical world. However, as Kim has agreed, it seems intuitively problematic to strip mental events of their causal power.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Only epiphenomenalists would agree that mental events do not have causal power, but [[epiphenomenalism]] is objectionable to many philosophers. One way of maintaining the causal powers of mental events is to assert [[Anomalous monism|token identity]] [[non-reductive physicalism]]—that [[mental property|mental properties]] [[supervenience|supervene]] on neurological properties. That is, there can be no change in the mental without a corresponding change in the physical. Yet this implies that mental events can have two causes (physical and mental), a situation which apparently results in [[overdetermination]] (redundant causes), and denies the strong physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Kim1/&gt; Kim argues that if the strong physical causal closure argument is correct, the only way to maintain mental causation is to assert [[Type physicalism|type identity]] [[reductive physicalism]]—that mental properties are neurological properties.&lt;ref name=Kim2/&gt;

==Criticism==

The validity of the physical causal closure has long been debated.&lt;ref name=Libet/&gt; In modern times, it has been pointed out that science is based on removing the subject from investigations, and by seeking objectivity. This outsider status for the observer, a third-person perspective, is said by some philosophers to have automatically severed science from the ability to examine subjective issues like consciousness and free will.&lt;ref name=Hong/&gt;&lt;ref name=NagelT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mohrhoff/&gt; A different attack upon the physical causal closure discussed by Hodgson is to claim science itself does not support the physical causal closure.&lt;ref name=Hodgson/&gt; Some philosophers have criticized the argument for the physical causal closure by supporting [[teleology]] and mental-to-physical causation via a ''soul''.&lt;ref name=Goetz/&gt;

===Ignoring phenomena===
There seem ''prima facie'' to be irreducible purpose-based (or teleological) explanations of some natural phenomena. For instance, the movement of a writer's fingers on the keyboard and a reader's eyes across the screen is irreducibly explained in reference to the ''goal'' of writing an intelligible sentence or of learning about the physical causal closure arguments, respectively. On the face of it, an exclusively non-teleological (descriptive) account of the neurological and biological features of hand movement and eye movement misses the point. To say, "I am moving my fingers ''because'' my brain signals are triggering muscle motion in my arms" is true, but does not exhaustively explain all the causes. Both are causes. In Aristotelian terms, a neurological account explains the efficient cause, while the purpose-based account explains the final cause.&lt;ref name=Falcon/&gt;

The physical causal closure thesis challenges this account. It attempts to reduce all teleological final (and formal) causes to efficient causes. Goetz and Taliaferro urge that this challenge is unjustified, partly because it would imply that the ''real'' cause of arguing for the physical causal closure is neurobiological activity in the brain, not (as we know it is) the purpose-based attempt to understand the world and explain it to others.

===Fallacious===
One way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to add a premise specifying that there are no irreducible teleological causes. This, of course, is the attempted conclusion of the argument. Putting the conclusion as one of the premises of the argument is formally valid, but fallacious (begging the question). It is no more sound than the argument that "I believe in the Bible because it is the written word of God through his prophets. Obviously, God would not lie to his prophets. After all, the Bible says so."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Trivial===
Another way of clarifying the physical causal closure argument is to specify that "Every physical effect [that has a physical cause] has a physical cause." But this is a tautology, and therefore true but trivial, like the statement "Every angel that has wings is an angel that has wings" or "Every white male who is bald is a bald white male."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Compulsory sterilization''', also known as '''forced''' or '''coerced sterilization''', programs are government policies which force people to undergo surgical or other [[Human sterilization|sterilization]]. The reasons governments implement sterilization programs vary in purpose and intent.&lt;ref name="who-2014"&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization: An interagency statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711130919/http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/gender_rights/eliminating-forced-sterilization/en/ |date=2015-07-11 }}, [[World Health Organization]], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 20th century, several such programs were instituted in countries around the world, usually as part of [[eugenics]] programs intended to prevent the reproduction of members of the population considered to be carriers of defective [[Genetics|genetic]] traits.&lt;ref&gt;Webster University, Forced Sterilization. Retrieved on August 30, 2014. {{cite web |url=http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907114059/http://www2.webster.edu/~woolflm/forcedsterilization.html |archivedate=2015-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bases for compulsory sterilization have included general population growth management, sex discrimination, "sex-normalizing" surgeries of [[intersex]] persons, limiting the spread of HIV,&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt; and reducing the population of ethnic groups. The last is counted as an act of genocide under the [[Statute of Rome]]. Some countries require transgender people to undergo sterilization before [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|gaining legal recognition of their gender]], a practice that [[Juan E. Méndez]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[Convention Against Torture|torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment]] cites as a violation of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/Regularsession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|format=PDF|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (A/HRC/22/53)|at=para.&amp;nbsp;78|publisher=Ohchr.org|accessdate=2013-10-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824161117/http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A.HRC.22.53_English.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory sterilization has been proposed as a means of [[human population planning]].

==Affected populations==

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]], [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement''. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* [[Women]], especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of welfare mothers by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughy 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of welfare mothers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last=Baxandall|first=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York, NY|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats to cease welfare occur when women do are hesitant to consent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Disabled people]], often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.&lt;ref name="who-2014" /&gt;

== As a part of human population planning ==
[[Human population planning]] is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archivedate=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1977 textbook ''[[Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment]]'', the authors discussed in this encyclopedic textbook the possible role of a wide variety of formulations to address human overpopulation. This included the possibility of compulsory sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Egnor |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |title=The Inconvenient Truth About Population Control, Part 2; Science Czar John Holdren's Endorsement of Involuntary Sterilization |website=evolutionnews.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=October 3, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005193751/http://www.evolutionnews.org/2009/08/the_inconvenient_truth_about_p023831.html |archivedate=October 5, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A government might utilize [[sortition]] to select those to be sterilized in order to avoid accusations of bias or having any other adverse agenda. In ''Ecoscience'', in the chapter entitled "The Human Predicament: Finding A Way Out", the authors speculate about pharmaceuticals that might be developed to sterilize people. Some partial fulfillments of these predictions are the birth control drugs in [[Norplant]] and [[Depo-Provera]]. See also [[sterilization (medicine)#Pharmacological]]. One can further speculate about pharmaceuticals designed to permanently sterilize the gestating human fetus ''in utero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110095317/http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/072109_holdren2.pdf/ |archivedate=2016-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

=== International law ===
The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits forced sterilization (Article 39).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531114057/https://rm.coe.int/168046031c |archivedate=2017-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Widespread or systematic forced sterilization has been recognized as a [[Crime against Humanity]] by the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] in the explanatory memorandum. This memorandum defines the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113112157/http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf |date=2016-01-13 }}'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation.

=== Bangladesh ===

[[Bangladesh]] has a long running government operated civilian exploitative [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] program as a part of its population control policy, where poor women and men are mainly targeted. The government offers 2000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (24 USD) for the woman who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for the man who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] (a [[garment]] worn by women in [[Indian subcontinent]]) and men are offered a [[lungi]] (a [[garment]] for men) to wear for undergoing sterilization. The referrer, who persuades the woman or man to undergo sterilization gets 300 Bangladeshi Taka (3.60 USD).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|title=পরিবার পরিকল্পনা {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন {{!}} উত্তরখান ইউনিয়ন|website=uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2017-11-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185603/http://uttarkhanup.dhaka.gov.bd/site/field_office/3354b838-2016-11e7-8f57-286ed488c766|archivedate=2017-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600-1000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AR|first=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy--safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

Ershad's government trained 1,200 doctors and 25,000 field workers who must conduct two tubal ligations and two vasectomies each month to earn their salaries. And the government wanted to persuade 1.4 million people, both women and men to undergo sterilization within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|title=The Bangladesh government plans a mass voluntary sterilization of...|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002940/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One population control expert called it 'the largest sterilization program in the world'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|title=Impoverished Bangladesh plans sterilization program|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185727/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|archivedate=2017-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1983, 40,000 government field workers were employed in Bangladesh's 65,000 villages to persuade women and men to undergo sterilization and to promote usage of birth-control across the country.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Food subsidies under the group feeding program (VGF) were given to only those women with certificates showing that they had undergone [[tubal ligation]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles and Shiva 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1977 study, a one-year follow-up of 585 men sterilized at [[vasectomy]] camps in Shibpur and Shalna in rural [[Bangladesh]] showed that almost half of the men were dissatisfied with their vasectomies. 58% of the men said their ability to work had decreased in the last year. 2%–7% of the men said their sexual performance decreases. 30.6% of the Shibpur and 18.9% of the Shalna men experienced severe pain during the vasectomy. The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least 2 days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and [[dizziness]] arose after the sterilization. The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints.

[[Bangladesh]] is planning to introduce sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have been fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] state, [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] Muslims in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

“I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them,” she said.

“My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]]). We don’t have to worry to feed them,” she said.

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide [[Vasectomy|vasectomies]] for men and [[Tubal ligation|tubectomies]] (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] people undergo sterilization routinely under government's sterilization program in the border town of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox’s Bazar]], where the [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee Muslims have taken shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archivedate=2017-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh ‘plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims’ as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archivedate=2017-11-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The [[Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|accessdate=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archivedate=November 23, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kecFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397%2C1039102 Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

Over 60 women are involved in a lawsuit in this case.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-november-13-2018-1.4902679/indigenous-women-kept-from-seeing-their-newborn-babies-until-agreeing-to-sterilization-says-lawyer-1.4902693&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/18/canada-indigenous-women-coerced-sterlilization-class-action-lawsuit Human rights groups call on Canada to end coerced sterilization of indigenous women] The Guardian, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=April 22, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archivedate=March 14, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, recently accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota. These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level. An especially egregious example, according to Amnesty International, has been occurring in Puning City, [[Guangdong Province]]. The sterilization drive in this city was in accordance with regulations outlined by the government in the Population and Family Planning Law of 2002. This drive, also known as the [[Iron Fist Campaign]], also is said to have used coercive methods in order to ensure that close to 10,000 women were sterilized, including detaining elderly family members. It is unclear whether support of the increase of the now 90% Han Chinese majority here plays a role&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archivedate=February 10, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it remains unclear to what extent the government has prosecuted or disciplined the officials in charge of family planning in the country.

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich.&lt;ref&gt;Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China, ''[[Forbes]]'', September 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011431/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |archivedate=2017-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cases registered in the Chinese legal system (cf.

{{Main|Nazi eugenics}}

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3703%2C266241 Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

The Montreal Gazette. June 20, 1934.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was signed by Hitler himself, and over 200 eugenic courts were created specifically as a result of this law. Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1710%2C6396277 Wallace R.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilised under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilisation was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalised or suffering from birth defects were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
India's state of emergency [[The Emergency (India)|between 1975 and 1977]] included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population. This program used propaganda and monetary incentives to, some may construe, inveigle citizens to get sterilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/A-generation-of-lost-manhood/articleshow/47824811.cms|title=A generation of lost manhood|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107221309/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/A-generation-of-lost-manhood/articleshow/47824811.cms|archivedate=2016-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who agreed to get sterilized would receive land, housing, and money or loans.&lt;ref name=Relyingonhardandsoftsells&gt;''Relying on Hard and Soft Sells India Pushes Sterilization'', New York Times, June 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this program, thousands of men received vasectomies and even more women received tubal ligations, both possibly reversible. However, the program focused more on sterilizing women than men. An article in The New York Times titled “For Sterilization, Target Is Women” states, “There were 114,426 vasectomies in India in 2002-03, and 4.6 million tubal ligations, the analogous operation on women, though ligation is a more complicated operation.”&lt;ref name=Forsterilizationtargetiswomen&gt;''For Sterilization Target is Women'', New York Times, November 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Son of the Prime Minister at the time [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Sanjay Gandhi]] was largely blamed for what turned out to be a failed program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The Indira enigma | date=May 11, 2001 | accessdate=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110074114/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | archivedate=November 10, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong backlash against any initiative associated with family planning followed the highly controversial program, the backlash of which{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!-- backlash--&gt; continues into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Male involvement and contraceptive methods for men | date=September 1996 | accessdate=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811233229/http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php | archivedate=August 11, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants]] both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO [[Haifa Women's Coalition]] published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by [[Israeli Educational Television]] a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months, sometimes presented to them as vaccine. In 2016 Israel's State Comptroller concluded his inquiry into the affair by claiming that injections of Depo-Provera had not been forced on the women; however, the Comptroller had refused to hear complainants' testimony, and his probe into the role of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC), whose activists had looked after the women in the Ethiopian transit camps, left open questions, since the JDC official who had handled family programming in Ethiopia refused to give the Comptroller any information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-forced-birth-control-probe-wouldn-t-hear-complainants-testimony-1.5396634&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Eugenics in Japan}}

In the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], Japanese governments promoted increasing the number of healthy Japanese, while simultaneously decreasing the number of people deemed to have mental retardation, disability, genetic disease and other conditions that led to inferiority in the Japanese gene pool.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1940_on_20131210024331"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=R.

The ''Leprosy Prevention laws'' of 1907, 1931 and 1953, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common and authorized punishment of patients "disturbing peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hansen's sanitarium were houses of horrors |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2005-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085432/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050128a1.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}, {{cite journal |first=Hajime |last=Sato |title=Abolition of leprosy isolation policy in Japan: policy termination through leadership |journal=Policy Studies Journal |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=29–46 |date=February 2002 |doi=10.1111/j.1541-0072.2002.tb02126.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the colonial Korean ''Leprosy prevention ordinance'', Korean patients were also subjected to hard labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Korean Hansens patients seek redress |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=2004-02-26 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120605020715/search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20040226a4.html |archivedate=2012-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Race Eugenic Protection Law'' was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Diet. After four amendments, this draft was promulgated as a ''National Eugenic Law'' in 1940 by the [[Fumimaro Konoe|Konoe]] government.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1940_on_20131210024331"&gt;{{cite web |trans-title=The Eugenic Protection Law |title=国民優生法 |quote=The 107th law that Japanese Government promulgated in 1940　(国民優生法) 第二条　本法ニ於テ優生手術ト称スルハ生殖ヲ不能ナラシムル手術又ハ処置ニシテ命令ヲ以テ定ムルモノヲ謂フ |url=http://www.res.otemon.ac.jp/~yamamoto/be/BE_law_04.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205110722/http://www.res.otemon.ac.jp/~yamamoto/be/BE_law_04.htm |archivedate=2014-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matsubara Yoko, from 1940 to 1945, sterilization was done to 454 Japanese persons under this law.

According to the ''Eugenic Protection Law'' (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals "with genetic predisposition to commit crime", patients with genetic diseases including mild ones such as total color-blindness, [[hemophilia]], [[albinism]] and [[ichthyosis]], and mental affections such as [[schizophrenia]], [[manic-depression]] possibly deemed occurrent in their opposition and [[epilepsy]], the sickness of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |title=SOSHIREN / 資料・法律−優生保護法 |publisher=Soshiren.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209082910/http://www.soshiren.org/shiryou/yuseihogohou.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental sicknesses were added in 1952.

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | accessdate=April 30, 2006 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archivedate=June 30, 2006 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name=Diplo&gt;[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt;

On February 25, 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|accessdate=August 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archivedate=September 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.&lt;ref name="Diplo"/&gt; The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).&lt;ref name=Diplo/&gt; A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

On October 21, 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori’s sterilization program involved [[crimes against humanity]], which are not time-limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published November 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America. It may carry a parallel to any suspect cases for international investigation in any other continent, and be in the sphere of medical genocide.

The eugenistic legislation was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976.

===Switzerland===
In October 1999, Margrith von Felten suggested to the [[National Council of Switzerland]] in the form of a general proposal to adopt legal regulations that would enable reparation for persons sterilized against their will. According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:
{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:

The report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health "Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.

Hans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.

Following agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 "Directive For Surgical Sterilization" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.

A statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.

A study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.

Having evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the "[[Informed consent|consent]]" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.

More than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of "[[life unworthy of life]]" and "racial purity" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a "healthy nation" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals – serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}

The United States during the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | url = | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas C.

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen, King|first=Randall, Desmond|date=Summer 2017|title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104|journal=World Politics|volume=53|pages=237–263|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were the [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] and the [[Mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with [[epilepsy]], and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different than today's. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

Some sterilizations took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]], targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 Julz 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html |date=2013-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Open WorldCat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kevles|first=Daniel|title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-50702-6|edition=1st|date=April 12, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was [[Michigan]], in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass. Eight years later [[Pennsylvania]]'s state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor. [[Indiana]] became the first state to enact sterilization legislation in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;The Indiana Supreme Court overturned the law in 1921 in {{cite journal |title=Williams et al v.

After [[World War II]], public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. The [[Oregon]] Board of Eugenics, later renamed the Board of Social Protection, existed until 1983,&lt;ref name=oregonapology&gt;{{cite web |author=Governor John Kitzhaber |authorlink=John Kitzhaber |date=December 2, 2002 |title=Proclamation of Human Rights Day, and apology for Oregon's forced sterilization of institutionalized patients |url=http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528024042/http://archivedwebsites.sos.state.or.us/Governor_Kitzhaber_2003/governor/speeches/s021202.htm |archivedate=May 28, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the last forcible sterilization occurring in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Sullivan.

(Mirrored in ''Eugene Register-Guard'', November 16, 2002, at [[Google News]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] [[Puerto Rico]] had a sterilization program as well. Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of [[Adolf Hitler]] to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.&lt;ref&gt;On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon&lt;ref name=oregonapology/&gt; and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG) believes that mental disability is not a reason to deny sterilization. The opinion of ACOG is that "the physician must consult with the patient’s family, agents, and other caregivers" if sterilization is desired for a mentally limited patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000263915.70071.29 |pmid=17601925 |title=ACOG Committee Opinion No. 371: Sterilization of Women, Including Those with Mental Disabilities |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology |volume=110 |issue=1 |pages=217–220 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Douglas Diekema wrote in Volume 9 of the journal Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews that "involuntary sterilization ought not be performed on mentally retarded persons who retain the capacity for reproductive decision-making, the ability to raise a child, or the capacity to provide valid consent to marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Involuntary sterilization of persons with mental retardation: An ethical analysis, Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews, Volume 9, Issue 1, pages 21-26, 2003. {{cite journal |title=Archived copy |doi=10.1002/mrdd.10053 |pmid = 12587134|volume=9 |issue=1 |year=2003 |journal=Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews |pages=21–26 | last1 = Diekema | first1 = Douglas S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Journal of Medical Ethics]] claimed, in a 1999 article, that doctors are regularly confronted with request to sterilize mentally limited people who cannot give consent for themselves.

The inability to pay for the cost of raising children has been a reason courts have ordered coercive or compulsory sterilization.

By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====1940s-1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as “[[Operation Bootstrap]].”&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Princeton’s [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In response, Puerto Rico’s governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;

=====Sterilization Procedures and [[Coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the “hyper-fertility” of Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Iris|title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|date=1993|volume=22|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing “population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,” was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Laura|title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-22255-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramirez de Arellano|first1=Annette B.|last2=Seipp|first2=Conrad|title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico|date=1983|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "B" /&gt; This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt; There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

======Controversy and Opposing Viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; and Iris Lopez,&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].,&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Elena&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States|journal=Latino(a) Research Review|date=2009–2010|volume=7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "Elena" /&gt;

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt; She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.&lt;ref name="Briggs" /&gt;

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.&lt;ref name="Nick" /&gt; By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.&lt;ref name= "Mass" /&gt;

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Presser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Harriet B.|title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1969|volume=23|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.2307/2172875|jstor=2172875}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

Presser’s analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10 to 14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20 to 24 years.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt; Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.&lt;ref name="Presser" /&gt;

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.&lt;ref name="Mass" /&gt; In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt; The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.&lt;ref name= "Lopez" /&gt;

===Mexico===
“Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres. Violencia contra las mujeres y tortura u otros malos tratos en ámbitos de salud sexual y reproductiva en América Latina y el Caribe|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|year=2016|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=28|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“A [http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19462/html report] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres. Violencia contra las mujeres y tortura u otros malos tratos en ámbitos de salud sexual y reproductiva en América Latina y el Caribe|publisher=Amnesty International Publications|year=2016|isbn=|location=United Kingdom|pages=27|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This happens even when the health norm [http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/005ssa23.html NOM 005-SSA2-1993] states that family planning is “the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services” and that “the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Based on a report by journalist Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women.

The same report also states that sterilization is to be done on a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt; In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Uzbekistan |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |author=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |website=2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices |date=April 8, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624052726/https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/sca/154489.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.&lt;ref name="theworld.org"/&gt;

On May 15, 2012, during a meeting with the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] in [[Moscow]] the Uzbek president Islam Karimov said: "we are doing everything in our hands to make sure that the population growth rate [in Uzbekistan] does not exceed 1.2-1.3"&lt;ref name="RFE/RL"&gt;{{cite news|title="Akhborot" censors Karimov|url=http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=[[RFE/RL]]'s Uzbek Service|date=17 May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529011406/http://www.ozodlik.org/content/article/24584171.html|archivedate=29 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Uzbek version of [[RFE/RL]] reported that with this statement Karimov indirectly admitted that forced sterilization of women is indeed taking place in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt; The main Uzbek television channel, O'zbekiston, cut out Karimov's statement about the population growth rate while broadcasting his conversation with Putin.&lt;ref name="RFE/RL" /&gt;
It is unclear if there is any genocidal conspiracy in regard of the Mongol type involved, in connection with genetic drain of this type through lack of their reproduction.

Despite international agreement concerning the inhumanity and illegality of forced sterilization, it has been suggested that the Government of Uzbekistan [[#Uzbekistan|continues to pursue such programs]].&lt;ref name=bbc-news-2012-04-12 /&gt;

===Other countries===
Eugenics programs including forced sterilization existed in most Northern European countries, as well as other more or less Protestant countries. Other countries that had notably active sterilisation programmes include [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunnar Broberg]] and [[Nils Roll-Hansen]], eds., ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland'' (Michigan State University Press, 2005), it is unclear whether genocide investigations in regard of Hun descendant and pure Aryan types has been undertaken, and if concealment is attempted through the prevalence of cremation and allegation of psychiatric treatment facial mimicry of Mongolian types.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], and some countries in [[Latin America]] (including [[Panama]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]] was a noted advocate, and his successor [[Reginald McKenna]] introduced a bill that included forced sterilisation.

A '''cultural system''', is the interaction of different elements in [[culture]]. While a cultural system is very different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the [[sociocultural system]].

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
[[Talcott Parsons]], a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, "Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social [[structure and agency]]. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced [[Jürgen Habermas]]' discussion in the classic ''Legitimation Crises'', who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
[[Margaret Archer]] (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work ''Culture and Agency'', argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and later by [[Mary Douglas]], is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by [[Antonio Gramsci]] through the theory of [[cultural hegemony]] through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture.  Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency&amp;nbsp;– that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory&amp;nbsp;– yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==	
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies." Constrained by Merton's [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

'''Daniel Goleman''' (born March 7, 1946) is an author and [[science journalist]]. For twelve years, he wrote for ''[[The New York Times]]'', reporting on the brain and behavioral sciences. His 1995 book ''[[Emotional Intelligence]]'' was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for a year-and-a-half, a best-seller in many countries, and is in print worldwide in 40 languages. Apart from his books on [[emotional intelligence]], Goleman has written books on topics including self-deception, creativity, transparency, meditation, social and emotional learning, ecoliteracy and the ecological crisis, and the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]’s vision for the future.

==Biography==
Daniel Goleman grew up in a [[American Jews|Jewish]] household in [[Stockton, California]], the son of Fay Goleman (née Weinberg; 1910–2010), professor of sociology at the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100926/A_NEWS/9260312 |accessdate=September 13, 2015 |title=Goleman was Pacific professor, women's advocate |publisher=The Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Irving Goleman (1898–1961), humanities professor at the Stockton College (now [[San Joaquin Delta College]]). His mother's brother was nuclear physicist [[Alvin M. Weinberg]].

Goleman studied in [[India]] using a pre-doctoral fellowship from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and a post-doctoral grant from the [[Social Science Research Council]]. While in India, he spent time with spiritual teacher [[Neem Karoli Baba]], who was also the guru to [[Ram Dass]], [[Krishna Das (singer)|Krishna Das]] and [[Larry Brilliant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/krishna_das/|title=Krishna Das : Songwriter Interviews|author=|date=|website=www.songfacts.com|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote his first book based on travel in India and [[Sri Lanka]].

Goleman then returned as a visiting lecturer to Harvard, where during the 1970s his course on the psychology of consciousness was popular. [[David McClelland]], his mentor at Harvard, recommended him for a job at ''[[Psychology Today]]'', from which he was recruited by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1984.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danielgoleman.info/biography/ |publisher=Daniel Goleman |title=Bio |accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goleman co-founded the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning at [[Yale University]]'s Child Studies Center, which then moved to the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. Currently he co-directs the Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations at [[Rutgers University]]. He sits on the board of the [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind &amp; Life Institute]].&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Career==

Goleman authored the internationally best-selling book ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1995, Bantam Books), which spent more than one-and-a-half years on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list. In "Working with Emotional Intelligence" (1998, Bantam Books), Goleman developed the argument that non-cognitive skills can matter as much as [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] for workplace success, and made a similar argument for leadership effectiveness in ''Primal Leadership'' (2001, Harvard Business School Press). Goleman's most recent best-seller is ''Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence'' (Harper, 2013).

In his first book, ''[[The Meditative Mind|The Varieties of Meditative Experience]]'' (1977) (republished in 1988 as ''The Meditative Mind''), Goleman describes almost a dozen different [[meditation]] systems. He wrote that "the need for the meditator to retrain his [[attention]], whether through [[Attentional control|concentration]] or [[mindfulness]], is the single invariant ingredient in the recipe for [[altered states of consciousness|altering consciousness]] of every meditation system".&lt;ref name="varmed"&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''The Varieties of Meditative Experience''. New York: Tarcher. {{ISBN|978-0-87477-833-5}}. p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Goleman has received many awards, including: 
* Career Achievement award for journalism from the [[American Psychological Association]]{{cn|date=October 2017}}
* Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in recognition of his efforts to communicate the behavioral sciences to the public{{cn|date=October 2017}}

A '''deva''' in the [[New Age movement]] refers to any of the spiritual forces or beings behind [[nature]].  The origin of the word 'deva' comes from the Sanskrit language. According to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]] [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] devas represent a separate [[Evolution (philosophy)|evolution]] to that of [[human race|humanity]]. The concept of devas as nature-spirits was further developed in the writings of Theosophist [[Geoffrey Hodson]]. It is believed that there are numerous different types of devas with a population in the millions performing different functions on Earth to help the [[ecology]] function better.  It is asserted they can be observed by those whose [[third eye]]s have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"&gt;Hodson, Geoffrey, ''Kingdom of the Gods''. 1952. {{ISBN|0-7661-8134-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it is believed by Theosophists that there are millions of devas living inside the [[Sun]], the indwelling [[solar deity]] of which Theosophists call the ''[[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]]''—these devas are called ''solar angels'', or sometimes ''solar devas'' or ''solar spirits''.  Sometimes, it is believed, they visit Earth and can be observed, like other devas, by humans whose third eyes have been activated.&lt;ref name="Hodson, Geoffrey 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W  ''A Textbook of Theosophy''. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution''. London:1930. The Theosophical Publishing House. See the chart on page 44 called "The Evolution of Life"--this ''lifewave chart'' shows the various life forms that evolving souls inhabit as they reincarnate. The ''solar spirits'' living inside the Sun are shown at the top of the chart as the most advanced life forms in our [[solar system]].&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophists believe that there are also devas living inside all the other [[star]]s besides [[Sun|Sol]]; these are called ''stellar angels''.

In the [[Findhorn Foundation|Findhorn]] material, the term refers to [[archetype|archetypal]] spiritual intelligences behind species, in other words the group soul of a species.

Some New Age sources use the term as a generic term to designate any being regarded as being composed of [[Etheric plane|etheric matter]]--[[elemental]]s, [[nature spirit]]s (including the various types of nature spirits such as [[fairy|fairies]], [[Undine (alchemy)|ondines]], etc.). The pre-New Age etymology of the term is described in the article [[Deva (Hinduism)]].

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{DLR} = \frac{\mathit{displacement}(\mathrm{lb}) ~/~ 2240} {(0.01 \times \mathit{LWL}(\mathrm{ft}))^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

The DLR can be used to compare the relative mass of various boats no matter what their length. A DLR less than 200 is indicative of a racing boat, while a DLR greater than 300 or so is indicative of a heavy cruising boat.

The '''doctrine of equivalents''' is a legal rule in many (but not all) of the world's [[patent]] systems that allows a [[court]] to hold a party liable for [[patent infringement]] even though the infringing device or process does not fall within the literal scope of a [[claim (patent)|patent claim]], but nevertheless is equivalent to the claimed [[invention]].  U.S. Judge [[Learned Hand]] has described its purpose as being "to temper unsparing logic and prevent an infringer from stealing the benefit of the invention".&lt;ref&gt;''Royal Typewriter Co. v. [[Remington Rand]], Inc.'', 168 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards for determining equivalents==

=== Germany ===
German courts typically apply a three-step test known as Schneidmesser's questions.&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 2002, p 513. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], March 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These questions are:
#Does the variant solve the problem underlying the invention with means that objectively have the same effect?
#Would the [[person skilled in the art]], using the [[common general knowledge]], have realised at the [[Priority right|priority date]] that the variant has the same effect?
#Are the considerations which the skilled person takes into account for the variant in the light of the meaning of the invention close enough to the considerations taken into account for the literal solution protected by the claims, such that the skilled person will consider the variant as a solution which is equivalent to the literal one?

All of the above questions need to be answered in the affirmative in order to demonstrate equivalent infringement. In addition, an allegation of equivalent infringement needs to withstand the [[Formstein defence|Formstein test]].&lt;ref&gt;Schneidmesser II; GRUR 1986, p 803. [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]], April 29, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding question reads:
:Does the variant, having regard to the [[Prior art|state of the art]], lack [[Novelty (patent)|novelty]] or is the variant [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|obvious]] to a person skilled in the art?

=== Ireland ===

Ireland appears to subscribe to a doctrine of equivalents. In ''[[Farbwerke Hoechst v Intercontinental Pharmaceuticals (Eire) Ltd]]'' (1968), a case involving a patent of a chemical process, the High Court found that the defendant had infringed the plaintiff's patent despite the fact that the defendant had substituted the starting material specified in the patent claim for another material. Expert evidence showed that any technician who failed to obtain a good result using the specified starting material would try the replacement material. The two materials were therefore held to be chemically equivalent, and the replacement of one with the other by the defendant did not prevent a finding and injunction against him.

=== Switzerland ===
On 21 March 2013, the [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]] adopted an approach similar to the three-prong test applied in [[Germany]]. The court based its decision on the three questions:&lt;ref&gt;Kontrazeptiva; GRUR Int 2014, p 543. [[Federal Patent Court of Switzerland]], March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Do the replaced features have the same objective function (same effect)? 
#Are the replaced features and their same objective function obvious to a [[person skilled in the art]] on the basis of the teaching of the patent (accessibility)? 
#After reading the wording of the claim in light of the description, would a [[person skilled in the art]] consider the replaced features as a solution of equal value (equal value)?

The court denied equivalent infringement of EP0918791B3, since paragraph 19 of EP0918791B3 explicitly teaches that toxic chromium compounds may be replaced by metallic catalysts. A person skilled in the art would not consider the organic catalyst TEMPO as a solution of equal value to the ruthenium salts specified in claim 1. The answer to the third question was negative.

The court also ruled that there was equivalent infringement of EP1149840B1, since all questions of the three-prong test were answered in the affirmative. The court set forth that the replacement of the claimed p-Toluenesulfonic acid with pyridine/water constituted basic knowledge taught during the first years of an undergraduate course in organic chemistry.

In ''Urinal valve II'',&lt;ref&gt;Patentverletzung durch Nachahmung; GRUR Int 1/2017, p 40. [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]], October 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] basically affirmed the three-prong test applied by the Federal Patent Court. The Supreme Court still partly reversed the Federal Patent Court’s earlier ruling on case [https://www.bundespatentgericht.ch/fileadmin/entscheide/O2014_002_Teilurteil_2016-11-21.pdf O2014_002]. The Supreme Court contended (reasons 6.4) that a second embodiment of the urinal valve fully implemented the key teachings of the asserted patent EP1579133, even though the second embodiment was not literally covered by the wording of the relevant claim. The Court went on to establish equivalent infringement.

=== United Kingdom ===
As a signatory to the European Patent Convention (EPC), the UK is required to follow the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 of the EPC, which requires member states to draw a balance between interpreting patent claims with strict literalism (with the description and drawings only helping resolve ambiguity) and regarding the claims as a mere guideline only.

The [[United Kingdom]] had historically never employed a doctrine of equivalents approach.  Instead, the UKIPO employed a [[purposive approach]] to assessing the scope of the claims, which applied to both patentability and infringement.  The latest UK case law on claim interpretation is found in '[[Improver Corp v Remington Consumer Products Ltd]]' (1990) and the [[House of Lords]] decision in 'Kirin-Amgen' (2004).  The so-called 'Improver' (or Protocol) questions found in the former are a widely used three-step test for deciding direct patent infringement.  

In July 2017, [[Lord Neuberger]] in ''Actavis UK v Eli Lilly'' introduced a new doctrine of equivalents test.  The Supreme Court set out three questions to consider when determining whether a patent infringed the claims as an equivalent:&lt;ref&gt;Actavis UK Ltd and others v Eli Lilly and Company [2017] UKSC 48. [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], 12 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Notwithstanding that it is not within the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent, does the variant achieve substantially the same result in substantially the same way as the invention, ie the inventive concept revealed by the patent?"
# "Would it be obvious to the person skilled in the art, reading the patent at the priority date, but knowing that the variant achieves substantially the same result as the invention, that it does so in substantially the same way as the invention?"
# "Would such a reader of the patent have concluded that the patentee nonetheless intended that strict compliance with the literal meaning of the relevant claim(s) of the patent was an essential requirement of the invention?"

The first two questions must be answered in the affirmative, and the third question in the negative to demonstrate equivalent infringement.

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], the doctrine of equivalents analysis is applied to individual claim limitations, not to the invention as a whole.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."&gt;''See [[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.|Warner-Jenkinson Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal test, articulated in ''[[Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co.]]'' (1997), is whether the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim is "insubstantial."

One way of determining whether a difference is "insubstantial" or not is called the "triple identity" test.  Under the triple-identity test, the difference between the feature in the accused device and the limitation literally recited in the patent claim may be found to be "insubstantial" if the feature in the accused device:
#Performs substantially the same function
#In substantially the same way
#To obtain the same result
as the limitation literally recited in the patent claim.  See ''[[Graver Tank &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.]]'', (1950).

The Court also explained that the doctrine of equivalents applies if two elements are interchangeable and a person with ordinary skill in the art would have known that the elements were interchangeable at the time of infringement.&lt;ref name="Warner-Jenkinson Co."/&gt;

In the United States, the doctrine of equivalents is limited by [[prosecution history estoppel]].  Under prosecution history estoppel, if the patentee abandoned through an amendment to the patent application certain literal claim coverage (e.g., by narrowing the literal scope of the patent claim), then the patentee is estopped from later arguing that the surrendered coverage is insubstantially different from the literally claimed limitation.&lt;ref&gt;''See [[Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed equivalents also cannot cover, or ensnare, the prior art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140611070955/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/08-1240.pdf] ''Depuy Spine, Inc. v. Biedermann Motech GMBH'' (Fed. Cir. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States also has a statutory equivalents doctrine that is codified in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6, which extends to structural equivalents. However, while the general doctrine of equivalents extends to technological equivalents developed after the issuance of a claim, the statutory structural equivalents in 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 6 extends only to equivalents available at issuance.{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}

== Harmonization attempts ==
Attempts have been made to harmonize the doctrine of equivalents.

For instance, Article 21(2) of 1991 [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]'s "Basic Proposal" for a Treaty Supplementing the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] states:
:"(a) (...) a claim shall be considered to cover not only all the elements as expressed in the claim but also equivalents.
:(b) An element ("the equivalent element") shall generally be considered as being equivalent to an element as expressed in a claim if, at the time of any alleged infringement, either of the following conditions is fulfilled in regard to the invention as claimed:
::(i) the equivalent element performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way and produces substantially the same result as the element as expressed in the claim, or
::(ii) it is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the same result as that achieved by means of the element as expressed in the claim can be achieved by means of the equivalent element."

The [[EPC 2000]], which came into effect on 13 December 2007, included an amended "Protocol on the interpretation of {{EPC Article|69}}" intended to bring about uniformity at a national level between contracting states to the EPC when interpreting claims.&lt;ref name="EPC2000"&gt;"An Overview of the New European Patent Convention and its Potential Impact on European Patent Practice", S.J. Farmer and M. Grund, Bio-Science Law Review, Vol. 9, Issue 2, pages 53-61&lt;/ref&gt; The amended text reads:
:''For the purpose of determining the extent of protection conferred by a European patent, due account shall be taken of any element which is an equivalent to an element specified in the claims.''
However, no definition of what was meant by an "equivalent" was included in the Protocol and it is expected that this lack of a binding definition will do little to achieve the desired uniform interpretation.&lt;ref name="EPC2000" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27652">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[multilinear algebra]], a '''dyadic''' or '''dyadic tensor''' is a second [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)#Definition via tensor products of vector spaces|order]] [[tensor]], written in a notation that fits in with [[vector algebra]].

There are numerous ways to multiply two [[Euclidean vector]]s. The [[dot product]] takes in two vectors and returns a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], while the [[cross product]] returns a [[pseudovector]]. Both of these have various significant geometric interpretations and are widely used in mathematics, [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The '''dyadic product''' takes in two vectors and returns a second order tensor called a ''dyadic'' in this context. A dyadic can be used to contain physical or geometric information, although in general there is no direct way of geometrically interpreting it.

The dyadic product is [[distributive property|distributive]] over [[vector addition]], and [[associative]] with [[scalar multiplication]]. Therefore, the dyadic product is [[linear]] in both of its operands. In general, two dyadics can be added to get another dyadic, and [[scalar multiplication|multiplied]] by numbers to scale the dyadic. However, the product is not [[commutative]]; changing the order of the vectors results in a different dyadic.

The formalism of '''dyadic algebra''' is an extension of vector algebra to include the dyadic product of vectors. The dyadic product is also associative with the dot and cross products with other vectors, which allows the dot, cross, and dyadic products to be combined together to obtain other scalars, vectors, or dyadics.

It also has some aspects of [[matrix algebra]], as the numerical components of vectors can be arranged into [[row and column vectors]], and those of second order tensors in [[square matrix|square matrices]]. Also, the dot, cross, and dyadic products can all be expressed in matrix form. Dyadic expressions may closely resemble the matrix equivalents.

The dot product of a dyadic with a vector gives another vector, and taking the dot product of this result gives a scalar derived from the dyadic. The effect that a given dyadic has on other vectors can provide indirect physical or geometric interpretations.

Dyadic notation was first established by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] in 1884. The notation and terminology are relatively obsolete today. Its uses in physics include [[continuum mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]].

In this article, upper-case bold variables denote dyadics (including dyads) whereas lower-case bold variables denote vectors. An alternative notation uses respectively double and single over- or underbars.

==Definitions and terminology==

===Dyadic, outer, and tensor products===

A ''dyad'' is a [[tensor]] of [[Tensor order|order]] two and [[Tensor rank|rank]] one, and is the result of the dyadic product of two [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s ([[complex vector]]s in general), whereas a ''dyadic'' is a general [[tensor]] of [[Tensor order|order]] two (which may be full rank or not).

There are several equivalent terms and notations for this product:
*the '''dyadic product''' of two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; (no symbol; no multiplication signs, crosses, dots etc.)
*the '''[[outer product]]''' of two [[column vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted and defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}^T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; means [[transpose]],
*the '''[[tensor product]]''' of two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;,

In the dyadic context they all have the same definition and meaning, and are used synonymously, although the '''tensor product''' is an instance of the more general and abstract use of the term.

Dirac's [[bra–ket notation]] makes the use of dyads and dyadics intuitively clear, see [[#Cahill|Cahill (2013)]].

====Three-dimensional Euclidean space====

To illustrate the equivalent usage, consider [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], letting:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1 \mathbf{i} + a_2 \mathbf{j} + a_3 \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = b_1 \mathbf{i} + b_2 \mathbf{j} + b_3 \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

be two vectors where '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' (also denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the standard [[basis vectors]] in this [[vector space]] (see also [[Cartesian coordinates]]). Then the dyadic product of '''a''' and '''b''' can be represented as a sum:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
\mathbf{ab} = &amp; a_1 b_1 \mathbf{i i} &amp; + a_1 b_2 \mathbf{i j} &amp; + a_1 b_3 \mathbf{i k} \\
&amp;+ a_2 b_1 \mathbf{j i} &amp; + a_2 b_2 \mathbf{j j} &amp; + a_2 b_3 \mathbf{j k}\\
&amp;+ a_3 b_1 \mathbf{k i} &amp; + a_3 b_2 \mathbf{k j} &amp; + a_3 b_3 \mathbf{k k}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

or by extension from row and column vectors, a 3&amp;times;3 matrix (also the result of the outer product or tensor product of '''a''' and '''b'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a b} \equiv \mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b} \equiv \mathbf{a b}^\mathrm{T} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 a_1 \\
 a_2 \\
 a_3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
 b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a_1b_1 &amp; a_1b_2 &amp; a_1b_3 \\
 a_2b_1 &amp; a_2b_2 &amp; a_2b_3 \\
 a_3b_1 &amp; a_3b_2 &amp; a_3b_3
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A ''dyad'' is a component of the dyadic (a [[monomial]] of the sum or equivalently an entry of the matrix) — the dyadic product of a pair of [[basis vector]]s [[scalar multiplication|scalar multiplied]] by a number.

Just as the standard basis (and unit) vectors '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', have the representations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 \\
 0 \\
 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{j} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\
 1 \\
 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\
 0 \\
 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(which can be transposed), the ''standard basis (and unit) dyads'' have the representation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ii} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{ik} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ji} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{jj} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{jk} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ki} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{kj} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{kk} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

For a simple numerical example in the standard basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{A} &amp; = 2\mathbf{ij} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\mathbf{ji} - 8\pi \mathbf{jk} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \mathbf{kk} \\
&amp; = 2 \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} - 8\pi \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}\\ 
&amp; = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 \\
 \sqrt{3}/2 &amp; 0 &amp; - 8\pi \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====''N''-dimensional Euclidean space====

If the Euclidean space is ''N''-[[dimension]]al, and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \sum_{i=1}^N a_i\mathbf{e}_i = a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \cdots a_N \mathbf{e}_N&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = \sum_{j=1}^N b_j\mathbf{e}_j  = b_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + b_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \cdots b_N \mathbf{e}_N&lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[standard basis]] vectors in ''N''-dimensions (the index ''i'' on '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; selects a specific vector, not a component of the vector as in ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), then in algebraic form their dyadic product is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ab} = \sum _{j=1}^N\sum_{i=1}^N a_ib_j{\mathbf{e}}_i\mathbf{e}_j.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the ''nonion form'' of the dyadic. Their outer/tensor product in matrix form is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{ab}^\mathrm{T} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 a_1 \\
 a_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 a_N
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
 b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_N
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
 a_1b_1 &amp; a_1b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1b_N \\
 a_2b_1 &amp; a_2b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_2b_N \\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 a_Nb_1 &amp; a_Nb_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_Nb_N
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A ''dyadic polynomial'' '''A''', otherwise known as a dyadic, is formed from multiple vectors '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \sum_i\mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{a}_1\mathbf{b}_1+\mathbf{a}_2\mathbf{b}_2+\mathbf{a}_3\mathbf{b}_3+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

A dyadic which cannot be reduced to a sum of less than ''N'' dyads is said to be complete. In this case, the forming vectors are non-coplanar,{{Dubious|date=October 2012}} see [[#Chen|Chen (1983)]].

|}

==== Double-dot product ====

There are two ways to define the double dot product, one must be careful when deciding which convention to use. As there are no analogous matrix operations for the remaining dyadic products, no ambiguities in their definitions appear.

The double-dot product is [[commutative]] due to commutativity of the normal dot-product:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \colon \! \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} \colon \! \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

There is a special double dot product with a [[transpose]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \colon \! \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} = \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \colon \! \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

Another identity is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\colon\mathbf{B}=\left(\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T}\right)\colon \mathbf{I}
=\left(\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\right)\colon \mathbf{I} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Double-cross product ====

We can see that, for any dyad formed from two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', its double cross product is zero.

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbf{ab}\right)
\!\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!\!
\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)=\left(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{a}\right)\left(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{b}\right)= 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, by definition, a dyadic double-cross product on itself will generally be non-zero. For example, a dyadic '''A''' composed of six different vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\sum _{i=1}^3 \mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{b}_i &lt;/math&gt;

has a non-zero self-double-cross product of

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}
\!\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!\!
\mathbf{A} = 2 \left[\left(\mathbf{a}_1\times \mathbf{a}_2\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_1\times \mathbf{b}_2\right)+\left(\mathbf{a}_2\times \mathbf{a}_3\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_2\times \mathbf{b}_3\right)+\left(\mathbf{a}_3\times \mathbf{a}_1\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_3\times \mathbf{b}_1\right)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

====Tensor contraction====

{{main|Tensor contraction}}

The ''spur'' or ''expansion factor'' arises from the formal expansion of the dyadic in a coordinate basis by replacing each dyadic product by a dot product of vectors:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
|\mathbf{A}| &amp; = A_{11} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{12} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{13} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{21} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{22} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{23} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{k}\\
&amp; + A_{31} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{32} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{33} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} \\
\\
&amp; = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

in index notation this is the contraction of indices on the dyadic:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{A}| = \sum_i A_i{}^i&lt;/math&gt;

In three dimensions only, the ''rotation factor'' arises by replacing every dyadic product by a [[cross product]]

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
\langle\mathbf{A}\rangle &amp; = A_{11} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{12} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{13} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{21} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{22} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{23} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{k}\\
&amp; + A_{31} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{32} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{33} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{k} \\
\\
&amp; = A_{12} \mathbf{k} - A_{13} \mathbf{j} - A_{21} \mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{23} \mathbf{i} + A_{31} \mathbf{j} - A_{32} \mathbf{i} \\
\\
&amp; = (A_{23}-A_{32})\mathbf{i} + (A_{31}-A_{13})\mathbf{j} + (A_{12}-A_{21})\mathbf{k}\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

In index notation this is the contraction of '''A''' with the [[Levi-Civita tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{A}\rangle=\sum_{jk}{\epsilon_i}^{jk}A_{jk}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Unit dyadic==

There exists a unit dyadic, denoted by '''I''', such that, for any vector '''a''',

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{I}= \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

for any vector '''a'''.

Given a basis of 3 vectors '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''', with [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{{\mathbf{a}}}, \hat{\mathbf{b}}, \hat{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;, the unit dyadic is expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{a}\hat{\mathbf{a}} + \mathbf{b}\hat{\mathbf{b}} + \mathbf{c}\hat{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the standard basis,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{ii} + \mathbf{jj} + \mathbf{kk} &lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the dot product to the right of the unit dyadic is

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{a} &amp; = (\mathbf{i}\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}\mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}\mathbf{k})\cdot \mathbf{a} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{k} (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{a}) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{i} a_x + \mathbf{j} a_y + \mathbf{k} a_z \\
&amp; = \mathbf{a} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and to the left

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{I} &amp; = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{i}\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}\mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}\mathbf{k})\\
&amp; = (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{i})\mathbf{i} + (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{j})\mathbf{j} + (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{k})\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; = a_x \mathbf{i} + a_y \mathbf{j} + a_z \mathbf{k}  \\
&amp; = \mathbf{a} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be put on more careful foundations (explaining what the logical content of "juxtaposing notation" could possibly mean) using the language of tensor products.  If ''V'' is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]], a dyadic tensor on ''V'' is an elementary tensor in the tensor product of ''V'' with its [[dual space]].

The tensor product of ''V'' and its dual space is [[isomorphic]] to the space of [[linear map]]s from ''V'' to ''V'': a dyadic tensor ''vf'' is simply the linear map sending any ''w'' in ''V'' to ''f''(''w'')''v''. When ''V'' is Euclidean ''n''-space, we can use the [[inner product]] to identify the dual space with ''V'' itself, making a dyadic tensor an elementary tensor product of two vectors in Euclidean space.

In this sense, the unit dyadic '''ij''' is the function from 3-space to itself sending ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''k''' to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''', and '''jj''' sends this sum to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j'''. Now it is revealed in what (precise) sense  '''ii''' + '''jj''' + '''kk''' is the identity:  it sends ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''k''' to itself because its effect is to sum each unit vector in the standard basis scaled by the coefficient of the vector in that basis.

;Properties of unit dyadics

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{I}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{I}\right)= \mathbf{ab}-\left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\cdot
\end{array}\!\!\!
\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)=\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!
\mathbf{A}=(\mathbf{A}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 \colon \!
\end{array}\!\!
\mathbf{I})\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}\;\colon\left(\mathbf{ab}\right) = \left(\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\cdot\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where "tr" denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

==Examples==

===Vector projection and rejection===

A nonzero vector '''a''' can always be split two perpendicular components, one parallel (‖) to the direction of a [[unit vector]] '''n''', and one perpendicular (⊥) to it;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}_\parallel + \mathbf{a}_\perp &lt;/math&gt;

The parallel component is found by [[vector projection]], which is equivalent to the dot product of '''a''' with the dyadic '''nn''',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\parallel = \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{a}) = (\mathbf{nn})\cdot\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and the perpendicular component is found from [[vector rejection]], which is equivalent to the dot product of '''a''' with the dyadic {{nowrap|'''I''' − '''nn'''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\perp = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{a}) = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{nn})\cdot\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

===Rotation dyadic===

{{Further|Axis–angle representation}}

====2d rotations====

The dyadic

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{ji} - \mathbf{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; -1 \\
 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is a 90° anticlockwise [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]] in 2d. It can be left-dotted with a vector '''r''' = ''x'''''i''' + ''y'''''j''' to produce the vector,

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{j i} - \mathbf{i j}) \cdot (x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j}) =
x \mathbf{j i} \cdot \mathbf{i} - x \mathbf{i j} \cdot \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j i} \cdot \mathbf{j} - y \mathbf{i j} \cdot \mathbf{j} = 
-y \mathbf{i} + x \mathbf{j},&lt;/math&gt;

in summary

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{rot} &lt;/math&gt;

or in matrix notation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; -1 \\
 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
 x \\
 y
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
-y \\
 x
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

For any angle ''θ'', the 2d rotation dyadic for a rotation anti-clockwise in the plane is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}\cos\theta + \mathbf{J}\sin\theta = (\mathbf{ii}+\mathbf{jj})\cos\theta + (\mathbf{ji}-\mathbf{ij})\sin\theta = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta &amp;-\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta &amp;\;\cos\theta 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''I''' and '''J''' are as above, and the rotation of any 2d vector '''a''' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'''''i''' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''''j''' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot} = \mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

====3d rotations====

A general 3d rotation of a vector '''a''', about an axis in the direction of a [[unit vector]] '''ω''' and anticlockwise through angle ''θ'', can be performed using [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]] in the dyadic form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot} = \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the rotation dyadic is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I} \cos\theta + \sin\theta \boldsymbol{\Omega} +  (1 - \cos\theta) \boldsymbol{\omega\omega} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the Cartesian entries of '''ω''' also form those of the dyadic

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = \omega_x( \mathbf{kj} -\mathbf{jk} ) + \omega_y( \mathbf{ik} -\mathbf{ki} ) + \omega_z( \mathbf{ji} - \mathbf{ij} ) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

The effect of '''Ω''' on '''a''' is the cross product

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot\mathbf{a} = \boldsymbol{\omega}\times \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the dyadic form the [[cross product matrix]] with a column vector.

===Lorentz transformation===

In [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz boost]] with speed ''v'' in the direction of a unit vector '''n''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma\left(t - \frac{v\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r}}{c^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}' = [\mathbf{I}  + (\gamma-1) \mathbf{nn}]\cdot \mathbf{r} - \gamma v \mathbf{n}t &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]].

'''Eliminationism''' is the belief that one's political opponents are "a [[cancer]] on the body politic that must be excised—either by separation from the public at large, through [[censorship]] or by outright [[mass murder|extermination]]—in order to protect the purity of the nation".&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| last = Bernard | first = Phyllis E. | title = Eliminationist Discourse In A Conflicted Society: Lessons For America From Africa? | date = June 12, 2009 | url = http://epublications.marquette.edu/mulr/vol93/iss1/12/ |accessdate = 2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''eliminationism'' was coined by American political scientist [[Daniel Goldhagen]] in his 1996 book ''[[Hitler's Willing Executioners]]'' in which he posits that ordinary [[Germans]] not only knew about, but also supported, the [[Holocaust]] because of a unique and virulent "eliminationist antisemitism" in the German identity, which had developed in the preceding centuries.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

==Effects==
In his 2009 book ''Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism, and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity'', Goldhagen argues that eliminationism is the root cause of every [[mass murder]] perpetrated in the 20th and 21st centuries, including:&lt;ref name="Gray 2009"&gt;{{cite paper| author = Gray, John | title = Worse Than War: Genocide, Eliminationism and the Ongoing Assault on Humanity By Daniel Jonah Goldhagen | date = 4 February 2010 | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/02/genocide-goldhagen-mass | accessdate = 2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[David Neiwert]] argued in 2009 that eliminationist rhetoric is becoming increasingly mainstream within the [[Conservatism in the United States|American right wing]], fueled in large part by the extremist discourse found on conservative [[blog]]s and [[talk radio]], which may provoke a resurgence of [[lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2009"&gt;{{cite paper|author=Holland, Joshua |title=The Terrorist Threat: Right-Wing Radicals and the Eliminationist Mindset |date=12 June 2009 |url=http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723075225/http://www.alternet.org/module/printversion/140578 |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law Phyllis E. Bernard argues that interventions in [[Rwanda]] and [[Nigeria]], which adapted American dispute prevention and [[dispute resolution|resolution]] methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.&lt;ref name="Bernard 2009"/&gt;

[[Theodore N. Kaufman]] self-published ''[[Germany Must Perish!]]'' in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through [[forced sterilization]] of all [[Germans]] and the territorial disassociation of [[Germany]]. The obscure book received very little attention in the US, but was eventually cited by the [[Nazi]] regime as proof of a vast [[Jew]]ish [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitic conspiracy theories|conspiracy]] to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime [[propaganda]], pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the [[Holocaust]].

During the 1991–2002 [[Algerian Civil War]] the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as ''[[les éradicateurs]]'' for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics. These hardliners were opposed in the [[People's National Army (Algeria)|Army]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] by ''[[les dialoguistes]]''.

In [[econometrics]], '''endogeneity''' broadly refers to situations in which an [[explanatory variable]] is [[correlation|correlated]] with the [[errors and residuals|error term]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey M. |title=Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach |location=Australia |publisher=South-Western |year=2009 |edition=Fourth |pages=88 |isbn=978-0-324-66054-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between [[wiktionary:endogenous|endogenous]] and [[wiktionary:exogenous|exogenous]] variables originated in [[simultaneous equations model]]s, where one separates [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] whose values are determined by the [[Economic model|model]] from variables which are predetermined;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in a simple [[supply and demand]] model, when predicting the quantity demanded in equilibrium, the price is endogenous because producers change their price in response to demand and consumers change their demand in response to price. In this case, the price variable is said to have '''total endogeneity''' once the demand and supply curves are known. In contrast, a change in [[consumer]] tastes or [[preference]]s would be an [[exogenous]] change on the [[demand curve]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Kmenta |authorlink=Jan Kmenta |title=Elements of Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=MacMillan |edition=Second |year=1986 |isbn=0-02-365070-2 |pages=652–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring [[simultaneity]] in the estimation leads to biased estimates as it violates the exogeneity assumption of the [[Gauss–Markov theorem]]. The problem of endogeneity, is, unfortunately, oftentimes ignored by researchers conducting non-experimental research and doing so precludes making policy recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antonakis|first=John|last2=Bendahan|first2=Samuel|last3=Jacquart|first3=Philippe|last4=Lalive|first4=Rafael|date=December 2010|title=On making causal claims: A review and recommendations|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.010|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=21|issue=6|pages=1086–1120|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.10.010|issn=1048-9843}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Instrumental variable]] techniques are commonly used to address this problem.

Besides simultaneity, correlation between explanatory variables and the error term can arise when an unobserved or [[Omitted-variable bias|omitted variable]] is [[confounding]] both independent and dependent variables, or when dependent variables are [[Errors-in-variables models|measured with error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Johnston |authorlink=John Johnston (econometrician) |title=Econometric Methods |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=Second |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-032679-7 |pages=267–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exogeneity versus endogeneity ==

In a [[stochastic model]], the notion of the ''usual exogeneity'', ''sequential exogeneity'', ''strong/strict exogeneity'' can be defined. '''Exogeneity''' is articulated in such a way that a variable or variables is exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Even if a variable is exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, it might be endogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

When the explanatory variables are not stochastic, then they are strong exogenous for all the parameters.

&lt;!-- The following paragraph is not very good --&gt;
If the [[independent variable]] is [[correlation|correlated]] with the [[error term]] in a [[Regression analysis|regression]] model then the estimate of the regression coefficient in an [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) regression is [[Bias of an estimator|biased]]; however if the correlation is not contemporaneous, then the coefficient estimate may still be [[Consistent estimator|consistent]]. There are many methods of correcting the bias, including [[instrumental variable]] regression and [[Heckman correction|Heckman selection correction]].

=== Static models ===
The following are some common sources of endogeneity.

==== Omitted variable ====
{{further|Omitted-variable bias}}
In this case, the endogeneity comes from an uncontrolled [[confounding variable]]. A variable is correlated with both an independent variable in the model, and with the error term. (Equivalently, the omitted variable both affects the independent variable and separately affects the dependent variable.) Assume that the "true" model to be estimated is,
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \gamma z_i + u_i&lt;/math&gt;
but we omit &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; (perhaps because we don't have a measure for it) when we run our regression. &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; will get absorbed by the error term and we will actually estimate,
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_i=\gamma z_i + u_i&lt;/math&gt;)

If the correlation of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is not 0 and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; separately affects &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (meaning &lt;math&gt;\gamma \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is correlated with the error term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, ''x'' and 1 are not exogenous for ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'', since, given ''x'' and 1, the distribution of ''y'' depends not only on ''&amp;alpha;'' and ''&amp;beta;'',  but also on ''z'' and gamma.

==== Measurement error ====

Suppose that we do not get a perfect measure of one of our independent variables. Imagine that instead of observing &lt;math&gt;x^{*}_{i}&lt;/math&gt; we observe &lt;math&gt;x_i=x^{*}_{i}+ \nu_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the measurement "noise". In this case, a model given by
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x^{*}_{i} + \varepsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;
is written in terms of observables and error terms as
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta(x_i-\nu_i) + \varepsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x_i +(\varepsilon_i - \beta\nu_i) &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; y_i = \alpha+\beta x_i +u_i &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (where &lt;math&gt;u_i=\varepsilon_i - \beta\nu_i&lt;/math&gt;)
Since both &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; depend on &lt;math&gt;\nu_i&lt;/math&gt;, they are correlated, so the OLS estimation of &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; will be biased downward. Measurement error in the dependent variable, however, does not cause endogeneity (though it does increase the variance of the error term).

==== Simultaneity ====
Suppose that two variables are codetermined, with each affecting the other. Suppose that there are two "structural" equations,
:&lt;math&gt;y_i = \beta_1 x_i + \gamma_1 z_i + u_i &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_i = \beta_2 x_i + \gamma_2 y_i + v_i&lt;/math&gt;
Estimating either equation by itself results in endogeneity. In the case of the first structural equation, &lt;math&gt;E(z_i u_i) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Solving for &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; we get (assuming that &lt;math&gt;1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;),
:&lt;math&gt;z_i = \frac{\beta_2 + \gamma_2 \beta_1}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}x_i+\frac{1}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}v_i+\frac{\gamma_2}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}u_i&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming that &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; are uncorrelated with &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt;, we have that,
:&lt;math&gt;E(z_i u_i) = \frac{\gamma_2}{1-\gamma_1 \gamma_2}E(u_i u_i) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, attempts at estimating either structural equation will be hampered by endogeneity.

=== Dynamic models ===
The endogeneity problem is particularly relevant in the context of [[time series]] analysis of [[causal]] processes. It is common for some factors within a causal system to be dependent for their value in period ''t'' on the values of other factors in the causal system in period ''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. Suppose that the level of pest infestation is independent of all other factors within a given period, but is influenced by the level of rainfall and fertilizer in the preceding period. In this instance it would be correct to say that infestation is [[exogenous]] within the period, but [[endogenous]] over time.

Let the model be ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''u''. If the variable ''x'' is sequential exogenous for parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and y does not cause x in [[Granger causality|Granger]] sense, then the variable ''x'' is strong/strict exogenous for the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Simultaneity ====
&lt;!--Expand section with a dynamic simultaneity example --&gt;
Generally speaking, simultaneity occurs in the dynamic model just like in the example of static simultaneity above.

[[File:Flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Flow around a wing. This incompressible flow satisfies the Euler equations.]]
In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Euler equations''' are a set of [[Differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]s governing [[adiabatic process|adiabatic]] and [[inviscid flow]]. They are named after [[Leonhard Euler]]. The equations represent [[Cauchy momentum equation|Cauchy equations]] of conservation of mass (continuity), and balance of momentum and energy, and can be seen as particular [[Navier–Stokes equations]] with zero [[viscosity]] and zero [[thermal conductivity]].&lt;ref name="Toro24"&gt;see Toro, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Euler equations can be obtained by linearization of some more precise [[continuity equation]]s like [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in a local equilibrium state given by a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]. The Euler equations can be applied to [[incompressible flow|incompressible]] and to [[compressible flow]] – assuming the [[flow velocity]] is a [[solenoidal field]], or using another appropriate energy equation respectively (the simplest form for Euler equations being the conservation of the [[specific entropy]]). Historically, only the incompressible equations have been derived by Euler. However, fluid dynamics literature often refers to the full set – including the energy equation – of the more general compressible equations together as "the Euler equations".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. (1995), Computational Fluid Dynamics, The Basics With Applications. {{ISBN|0-07-113210-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mathematical point of view, Euler equations are notably hyperbolic [[conservation equation]]s in the case without external field (i.e., in the limit of high [[Froude number]]). In fact, like any Cauchy equation, the Euler equations originally formulated in convective form (also called "[[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian form]]") can also be put in the "conservation form" (also called "[[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Eulerian form]]"). The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical interpretation of the equations as conservation equations through a control volume fixed in space, and is the most important for these equations also from a numerical point of view. The convective form emphasizes changes to the state in a frame of reference moving with the fluid.

==History==
The Euler equations first appeared in published form in Euler's article "Principes généraux du mouvement des fluides", published in ''Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de Berlin'' in 1757 (in this article Euler actually published only the ''general'' form of the continuity equation and the momentum equation;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E226.html E226 – Principes generaux du mouvement des fluides]&lt;/ref&gt; the energy balance equation would be obtained a century later). They were among the first [[partial differential equations]] to be written down. At the time Euler published his work, the system of equations consisted of the momentum and continuity equations, and thus was underdetermined except in the case of an incompressible fluid. An additional equation, which was later to be called the [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic condition]], was supplied by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1816.

During the second half of the 19th century, it was found that the equation related to the balance of energy must at all times be kept, while the adiabatic condition is a consequence of the fundamental laws in the case of smooth solutions. With the discovery of the [[special theory of relativity]], the concepts of energy density, momentum density, and stress were unified into the concept of the [[stress–energy tensor]], and energy and momentum were likewise unified into a single concept, the [[Four-momentum|energy–momentum vector]].&lt;ref name=Christodoulou&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-07-01181-0|last=Christodoulou|first=Demetrios|title=The Euler Equations of Compressible Fluid Flow|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|volume=44|issue=4|date=October 2007|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2007-44-04/S0273-0979-07-01181-0/S0273-0979-07-01181-0.pdf|accessdate=June 13, 2009|pages= 581–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density==
In convective form (i.e., the form with the [[convective derivative|convective operator]] made explicit in the [[Cauchy momentum equation|momentum equation]]), the incompressible Euler equations in case of density constant in time and uniform in space are:&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/notes/euler.pdf Hunter, J.K. An Introduction to the Incompressible Euler Equations]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1

|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{D\mathbf{u} \over Dt} = - \nabla w +\mathbf{g} \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

where:
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in an ''N''-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;u_1, u_2, \dots, u_N&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;{D \over Dt}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[material derivative]] in time,
*&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[scalar product]],
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here used to represent the specific thermodynamic work [[gradient]] (first equation), and
*&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity [[divergence]] (second equation),
*&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal [[Linear differential equation|source term]].
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[inertial acceleration]]s, [[electric field]] acceleration, and so on.

The first equation is the [[Cauchy momentum equation|Euler momentum equation]] with uniform density (for this equation it could also not be constant in time). By expanding the [[material derivative]], the equations become:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial \mathbf{u} \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u =- \nabla w + \mathbf{g}  \\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact for a flow with uniform density &lt;math&gt;\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; the following identity holds:

&lt;math&gt;\nabla w \equiv \nabla \left(\frac p {\rho_0} \right) = \frac 1 {\rho_0} \nabla p &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the mechanic [[pressure]]. The second equation is the [[incompressible flow|incompressible constraint]], stating the flow velocity is a [[solenoidal field]] (the order of the equations is not casual, but underlines the fact that the incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the [[continuity equation]], but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the [[continuity equation]] would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time ''or'' varying in space. For example, with density uniform but varying in time, the continuity equation to be added to the above set would correspond to:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

So the case of constant '''and''' uniform density is the only one not requiring the continuity equation as additional equation regardless of the presence or absence of the incompressible constraint. In fact, the case of incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density being analyzed is a [[toy model]] featuring only two simplified equations, so it is ideal for didactical purposes even if with limited physical relevancy.

The equations above thus represent respectively [[conservation of mass]] (1 scalar equation) and [[conservation of momentum|momentum]] (1 vector equation containing &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; scalar components, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the physical dimension of the space of interest). Flow velocity and pressure are the so-called ''physical variables''.&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;

In a coordinate system given by &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\dots, x_N)&lt;/math&gt; the velocity and external force vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; have components &lt;math&gt;(u_1,\dots, u_N)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(g_1,\dots, g_N)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Then the equations may be expressed in subscript notation as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial u_i \over\partial t} + \sum_{j=1}^N {\partial (u_i u_j + w \delta_{ij})\over\partial x_j} = g_i\\
\sum_{i=1}^N {\partial u_i\over\partial x_i}=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; subscripts label the ''N''-dimensional space components, and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kroenecker delta]]. The use of [[Einstein notation]] (where the sum is implied by repeated indices instead of [[Summation#Capital-sigma_notation|sigma notation]]) is also frequent.

===Properties===
Although Euler first presented these equations in 1755, many fundamental questions about them remain unanswered.

In three space dimensions it is not even known whether solutions of the equations are defined for all time or if they form singularities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/notes/euler.pdf Hunter, An introduction to incompressible Euler equations], p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Smooth solutions of the free (in the sense of without source term: g=0) equations satisfy the conservation of specific kinetic energy:

: &lt;math&gt;{\partial \over\partial t} \left(\frac 1 2 u^2 \right) + \nabla \cdot (u^2 \mathbf u + w \mathbf I) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In the one dimensional case without the source term (both pressure gradient and external force), the momentum equation becomes the inviscid [[Burgers equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;{\partial u \over\partial t}+ u {\partial u \over\partial x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This is a model equation giving many insights on Euler equations.

===Nondimensionalisation===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Nondimensionalisation}}
In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt;, and a characteristic velocity &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt;, need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u^* &amp; \equiv \frac u {u_0}, \\[5pt]
r^* &amp; \equiv \frac r {r_0}, \\[5pt]
t^* &amp; \equiv \frac {u_0}{r_0} t, \\[5pt]
p^* &amp; \equiv \frac w {u_0^2}, \\[5pt]
\nabla^* &amp; \equiv r_0 \nabla
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and of the field [[unit vector]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf g}\equiv \frac {\mathbf g} g, &lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of these inversed relations in Euler equations, defining the [[Froude number]], yields (omitting the * at apix):
{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density''' (''nondimensional form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D \mathbf u \over Dt}= - \nabla w + \frac 1 {\mathrm{Fr}} \hat{\mathbf g}\\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Euler equations in the Froude limit (no external field) are named free equations and are conservative. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable and can be studied with [[perturbation theory]].

===Conservation form===
{{see also|Conservation equation|}}
The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical properties of Euler equations, and especially the contracted form is often the most convenient one for [[computational fluid dynamics]] simulations. Computationally, there are some advantages in using the conserved variables. This gives rise to a large class of numerical methods
called conservative methods.&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;

The '''free Euler equations are conservative''', in the sense they are equivalent to a conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot \mathbf F ={\mathbf 0},
&lt;/math&gt;

or simply in Einstein notation:

:&lt;math&gt; 
\frac{\partial y_j}{\partial t}+
\frac{\partial f_{ij}}{\partial r_i}= 0_i,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the conservation quantity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; in this case is a vector, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; is a [[flux]] matrix. This can be simply proved.

{{hidden
|Demonstration of the conservation form
|First, the following identities hold:

::&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot (w \mathbf I) = \mathbf I \cdot \nabla w + w \nabla \cdot \mathbf I = \nabla w &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]]. The same identities expressed in [[Einstein notation]] are:

::&lt;math&gt;\partial_i (w \delta_{ij} ) = \delta_{ij} \partial_i w + w \partial_i \delta_{ij} = \delta_{ij} \partial_i w =  \partial_j w&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;u_j \partial_i u_i = \partial_i (u_i u_j)&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the [[identity matrix]] with dimension N and δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; its general element, the Kroenecker delta.

Thanks to these vector identities, the incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density and without external field can be put in the so-called ''conservation'' (or Eulerian) differential form, with vector notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot (\mathbf u  \otimes \mathbf u + w \mathbf I)=\mathbf{0}\\
{\partial 0 \over\partial t}+ \nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0,
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

or with Einstein notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
\partial_t u_j  + \partial_i (u_i u_j + w \delta_{ij})=0\\
\partial_t 0  + \partial _j u_j=0,
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Then '''incompressible''' Euler equations with uniform density have conservation variables:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + w \mathbf I \\ \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the second component u is by itself a vector, with length N, so y has length N+1 and F has size N(N+1). In 3D for example y has length 4, I has size 3x3 and F has size 4x3, so the explicit forms are:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}  u_1 \\ u_2  \\ u_3 \\0 \end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}
u_1^2 + w &amp;  u_1u_2 &amp;  u_1u_3
\\  u_2 u_1 &amp; u_2^2 + w &amp;  u_2 u_3
\\ u_3 u_1 &amp;  u_3 u_2 &amp;  u_3^2 + w 
\\ u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

At last Euler equations can be recast into the particular equation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equation(s) with constant and uniform density''' (''conservation or Eulerian form'')

:&lt;math&gt;

===Spatial dimensions===
For certain problems, especially when used to analyze compressible flow in a duct or in case the flow is cylindrically or spherically symmetric, the one-dimensional Euler equations are a useful first approximation. Generally, the Euler equations are solved by [[Riemann]]'s [[method of characteristics]]. This involves finding curves in plane of independent variables (i.e., &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;) along which [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE's) degenerate into [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODE's). [[Numerical analysis|Numerical solutions]] of the Euler equations rely heavily on the method of characteristics.

==Incompressible Euler equations==
In convective form the incompressible Euler equations in case of density variable in space are:&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equations''' (''convective or Lagrangian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \begin{align} 
{D \rho \over D t} = 0\\
{D \mathbf u \over Dt}=- \frac {\nabla p}{\rho}+\mathbf{g}\\
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

where the additional variables are:
*&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid [[mass density]],
*&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]], &lt;math&gt;p = \rho w&lt;/math&gt;.

The first equation, which is the new one, is the incompressible [[continuity equation]]. In fact the general continuity equation would be:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho \over\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho +  \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

but here the last term is identically zero for the incompressibility constraint.

===Conservation form===
{{see also|conservation equation|}}
The incompressible Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \rho \mathbf u  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho \mathbf u\\\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + p \mathbf I\\\mathbf u\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length &lt;math&gt;N+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size &lt;math&gt;(N+2)\times N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In 3D for example &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length 5, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I&lt;/math&gt; has size 3x3 and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size 5x3, so the explicit forms are:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho \\  \rho u_1 \\ \rho u_2  \\ \rho u_3  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho u_1 &amp; \rho u_2 &amp; \rho u_3 \\
\rho u_1^2 + p &amp;  \rho u_1u_2 &amp;  \rho u_1u_3
\\  \rho u_1 u_2 &amp; \rho u_2^2 + p &amp;  \rho u_2u_3
\\ \rho u_3 u_1 &amp;  \rho u_3 u_2 &amp;  \rho u_3^2 + p
\\ u_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3 \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \rho \mathbf u  \\0\end{pmatrix}+ \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\rho \mathbf u\\\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + p \mathbf I\\ \mathbf u\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\  \rho \mathbf g \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Conservation variables===
The variables for the equations in conservation form are not yet optimised. In fact we could define:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\ \mathbf j  \\0\end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix} \mathbf j \\ \frac {1} \rho \, \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j+ p \mathbf I\\ \frac \mathbf j \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf j = \rho \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] density, a conservation variable.

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Incompressible Euler equation(s)''' (''conservation or Eulerian form'')
|equation=
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t}\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \mathbf j  \\0\end{pmatrix}+ \nabla \cdot \begin{pmatrix}\mathbf j \\ \frac 1 \rho \, \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + p \mathbf I\\ \frac \mathbf j \rho\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\  \mathbf f \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA
}}

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f = \rho \mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[force density]], a conservation variable.

==Euler equations==
In differential convective form, the compressible (and most general) Euler equations can be written shortly with the [[material derivative]] notation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations''' (''convective form'')
|equation=
&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D \rho\over Dt} = - \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u \\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = - \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{D e \over Dt} = -\frac p \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u  \end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FF0000
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where the additional variables here is:
*&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific [[internal energy]] (internal energy per unit mass).

The equations above thus represent [[conservation of mass]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], and [[conservation of energy|energy]]: the energy equation expressed in the variable internal energy allows to understand the link with the incompressible case, but it is not in the simplest form.
Mass density, flow velocity and pressure are the so-called ''convective variables'' (or physical variables, or lagrangian variables), while mass density, momentum density and total energy density are the so-called ''[[conserved variables]]'' (also called eulerian, or mathematical variables).&lt;ref name="Toro24" /&gt;
If one explicitates the material derivative the equations above are:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{\partial\rho\over\partial t} + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0\\[1.2ex]
\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{\partial e \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot \nabla e + \frac p \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u = 0\end{align} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

===Incompressible constraint===
Coming back to the incompressible case, it now becomes apparent that the ''incompressible constraint'' typical of the former cases actually is a particular form valid for incompressible flows of the ''energy equation'', and not of the mass equation. In particular, the incompressible constraint corresponds to the following very simple energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over D t} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus '''for an incompressible inviscid fluid the specific internal energy is constant along the [[flow lines]]''', also in a time-dependent flow. The pressure in an incompressible flow acts like a [[Lagrange multiplier]], being the multiplier of the incompressible constraint in the energy equation, and consequently in incompressible flows it has no thermodynamic meaning. In fact, thermodynamics is typical of compressible flows and degenerates in incompressible flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, Fluidodinamica comprimibile, Chap. 9, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho e \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho e \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

meaning that for an incompressible inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the internal energy.

===Enthalpy conservation===
Since by definition the specific enthalpy is:

&lt;math&gt;h = e + \frac p \rho &lt;/math&gt;

The material derivative of the specific internal energy can be expressed as:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = {D h \over Dt} - \frac 1 \rho \left({D p \over Dt} - \frac p \rho {D \rho \over Dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Then by substituting the momentum equation in this expression, one obtains:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt}= {D h \over Dt} - \frac 1 \rho \left(p \nabla \cdot \mathbf u + {D p \over Dt} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

And by substituting the latter in the energy equation, one obtains that the enthalpy expression for the Euler energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D h \over Dt} = \frac 1 \rho {D p \over Dt} &lt;/math&gt;

'''In a reference frame moving with an inviscid and nonconductive flow, the variation of enthalpy directly corresponds to a variation of pressure.'''

===Thermodynamic systems===
In [[thermodynamics]] the independent variables are the [[specific volume]], and the [[specific entropy]], while the [[specific energy]] is a [[function of state]] of these two variables.

{{hidden
|Deduction of the form valid for thermodynamic systems
|Considering the first equation, variable must be changed from density to specific volume. By definition:

&lt;math&gt; v \equiv \frac 1 \rho &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the following identities hold:

&lt;math&gt; \nabla \rho =\nabla \left(\frac 1 v \right) = - \frac 1 {v^2} \nabla v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac {\partial}{\partial t} \left(\frac 1 v \right) = - \frac 1 {v^2} \frac {\partial v}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

Then by substituting these expressions in the mass conservation equation:

&lt;math&gt; - \frac{\mathbf{u}}{v^2} \cdot \nabla v - \frac 1 {v^2} \frac {\partial v}{\partial t} = - \frac 1 v \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;

And by multiplication:

&lt;math&gt; {\partial v \over\partial t}+\mathbf u \cdot \nabla v = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

Note that this equation is the only belonging to general continuum equations, so only this equation have the same form for example also in Navier-Stokes equations.

On the other hand,  the pressure in thermodynamics is the opposite of the partial derivative of the specific internal energy with respect to the specific volume:

&lt;math&gt; p (v,s) = - {\partial e (v,s) \over \partial v}&lt;/math&gt;

since the internal energy in thermodynamics is a function of the two variables aforementioned, the pressure gradient contained into the momentum equation should be explicited as:

&lt;math&gt;- \nabla p (v,s) = - \frac {\partial p}{\partial v} \nabla v - \frac {\partial p}{\partial s} \nabla s = \frac {\partial^2 e}{\partial v^2} \nabla v +  \frac {\partial^2 e}{\partial v \partial s}\nabla s &lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient for brevity to switch the notation for the second order derivatives:

&lt;math&gt; - \nabla p (v,s) =  e_{vv} \nabla v + e_{vs} \nabla s &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the energy equation:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = - p v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

can be furtherly simplified in convective form by changing variable from specific energy to the specific entropy: in fact the [[first law of thermodynamics]] in local form can be written:

&lt;math&gt;{D e \over Dt} = T {D s \over Dt} - p {D v \over Dt}&lt;/math&gt;

by substituting the material derivative of the internal energy, the energy equation becomes:

&lt;math&gt;T {D s \over Dt} + \frac p {\rho^2} \left( {D \rho \over Dt} + \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

now the term between parenthesis is identically zero according to the conservation of mass, then the Euler energy equation becomes simply:

&lt;math&gt;{D s \over Dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

For a thermodynamic fluid, the compressible Euler equations are consequently best written as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations''' (''convective form, for a thermodynamic system'')
|equation=:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{D v \over Dt} = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = v e_{vv} \nabla v + v e_{vs} \nabla s + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{D s \over Dt} =0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FFFF00
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where:
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity vector
* &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the specific entropy

Note that, in the general case and not only in the incompressible case, the energy equation means that '''for an inviscid thermodynamic fluid the specific entropy is constant along the [[flow lines]]''', also in a time-dependent flow. Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form:&lt;ref&gt;Landau, Lifshits, Fluid Mechanics, par. 1.1, eq. 2.6 and 2.7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \rho s \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho s \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

meaning that for an inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the entropy.

On the other hand, the two second-order partial derivatives of the specific internal energy in the momentum equation require the specification of the [[fundamental equation of state]] of the material considered, i.e. of the specific internal energy as function of the two variables specific volume and specific entropy:

&lt;math&gt;e = e(v,s)&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the ''fundamental'' equation of state contains all the thermodynamic information about the system (Callen, 1985),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L.F. Henderson, ''par. 2.6 Thermodynamic properties of materials'', in Handbook of Shock Waves, p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt; exactly like the couple of a ''thermal'' equation of state together with a ''caloric'' equation of state.

===Conservation form===
{{see also|Conservation equation|}}
The Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}\rho  \\  \mathbf j  \\E^t \end{pmatrix}; \qquad {\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf j\\ \frac 1 \rho \mathbf j \otimes \mathbf j + p \mathbf I\\(E^t +p) \frac \mathbf j \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf j = \rho \mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is the [[momentum]] density, a conservation variable.
* &lt;math&gt;E^t = \rho e + 1/2 \rho u^2&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total energy]] density (total energy per unit volume).

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt; has length N+2 and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; has size N(N+2).&lt;ref&gt;In 3D for example y has length 5, I has size 3x3 and F has size 3x5, so the explicit forms are:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}  j_1 \\ j_2  \\ j_3 \end{pmatrix}; \quad
{\mathbf F}=\begin{pmatrix}j_1 &amp; j_2 &amp; j_3 \\
\frac{ j_1^2}\rho + p &amp;  \frac{j_1j_2}\rho&amp;  \frac{j_1j_3} \rho\\
\frac{j_1j_2}\rho &amp; \frac {j_2^2} \rho + p &amp;  \frac{j_2j_3} \rho\\
\frac{j_3j_1}\rho &amp;  \frac{j_3j_2}{\rho} &amp;  \frac {j_3^2} \rho + p \\
(E^t+p) \frac {j_1} \rho &amp; (E^t+p) \frac {j_2} \rho &amp; (E^t+p) \frac{j_3} \rho \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equation(s)''' (''original conservation or Eulerian form'')
|equation=

where:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f = \rho \mathbf g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[force density]], a conservation variable.

We remark that also the Euler equation even when conservative (no external field, Froude limit) have '''no [[Riemann invariant]]s''' in general.&lt;ref&gt;Chorin, Marsden, ''A mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics'', par. 3.2 Shocks, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Some further assumptions are required

However, we already mentioned that for a thermodynamic fluid the equation for the total energy density is equivalent to the conservation equation:

&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial t} (\rho s) + \nabla \cdot (\rho s \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Then the conservation equations in the case of a thermodynamic fluid are more simply expressed as:

where:
* &lt;math&gt;S = \rho s&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy density, a thermodynamic conservation variable.

Another possible form for the energy equation, being particularly useful for [[isobaric process|isobarics]], is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial H^t  }{\partial t}+ \nabla \cdot (H^t \mathbf u) = \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf f - \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;H^t = E^t + p = \rho e + p + 1/2 \rho u^2&lt;/math&gt; is the total [[enthalpy]] density.

==Quasilinear form and characteristic equations==
Expanding the [[flux]]es can be an important part of constructing [[numerical solution|numerical solvers]], for example by exploiting ([[approximation|approximate]]) solutions to the [[Riemann problem]]. In regions where the state vector '''''y''''' varies smoothly, the equations in conservative form can be put in quasilinear form :

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} + \mathbf A_i \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial r_i}  = {\mathbf 0}. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_i&lt;/math&gt; are called the flux [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]s defined as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]:

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathbf A_i (\mathbf y)=\frac{\partial \mathbf f_i (\mathbf y)}{\partial \mathbf y}. &lt;/math&gt;

Obviously this Jacobian does not exist in discontinuity regions (e.g. contact discontinuities, shock waves in inviscid nonconductive flows). Note that if the flux Jacobians &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_i&lt;/math&gt; are not functions of the state vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y&lt;/math&gt;, the equations reveals ''linear''.

===Characteristic equations===
The compressible Euler equations can be decoupled into a set of N+2 [[wave]] equations that describes [[sound]] in Eulerian continuum if they are expressed in [[method of characteristics|characteristic variables]] instead of conserved variables.

In fact the tensor '''A''' is always [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]. If the [[eigenvalue]]s (the case of Euler equations) are all real the system is defined ''hyperbolic'', and physically eigenvalues represent the speeds of propagation of information.&lt;ref&gt;Toro, Rienmann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics, par 2.1 Quasi-linear Equations: Basic concept, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; If they are all distinguished, the system is defined ''strictly hyperbolic'' (it will be proved to be the case of one-dimensional Euler equations). Furthermore, note that diagonalisation of compressible Euler equation is easier when the energy equation is expressed in the variable entropy (i.e. with equations for thermodynamic fluids) than in other energy variables. This will become clear by considering the 1D case.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[right eigenvector]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[eigenvalue]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt;, by building the [[projection matrix]]:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=[ \mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, ... , \mathbf{p}_n]&lt;/math&gt;

One can finally find the ''characteristic variables'' as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}= \mathbf{P}^{-1}\mathbf{y},&lt;/math&gt;

Since '''A''' is constant, multiplying the original 1-D equation in flux-Jacobian form with '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; yields the characteristic equations:&lt;ref&gt;Toro, ''op. cit.'', par 2.3 Linear Hyperbolic System, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial w_i}{\partial t} + \lambda_j \frac{\partial w_i}{\partial r_j} = 0_i
&lt;/math&gt;

The original equations have been [[Linear independence|decoupled]] into N+2 characteristic equations each describing a simple wave, with the eigenvalues being the wave speeds.  The variables ''w''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are called the ''characteristic variables'' and are a subset of the conservative variables. The solution of the initial value problem in terms of characteristic variables is finally very simple. In one spatial dimension it is:

:&lt;math&gt;
w_i (x, t)  = w_i (x-\lambda_i t, 0)  
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the solution in terms of the original conservative variables is obtained by transforming back:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}= \mathbf{P} \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

this computation can be explicited as the linear combination of the eigenvectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(x,t) = \sum_{i=1}^m w_i (x-\lambda_i t, 0) \mathbf p_i,&lt;/math&gt;

Now it becomes apparent that the characteristic variables act as weights in the linear combination of the jacobian eigenvectors. The solution can be seen as superposition of waves, each of which is advected independently without change in shape. Each ''i''-th wave has shape ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and speed of propagation ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the following we show a very simple example of this solution procedure.

===Waves in 1D inviscid, nonconductive thermodynamic fluid===
If one considers Euler equations for a thermodynamic fluid with the two further assumptions of one spatial dimension and free (no external field: ''g''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) :

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
{\partial v \over  \partial t} + u {\partial v \over  \partial x} - v {\partial u \over  \partial x} = 0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial u \over  \partial t} + u {\partial u \over  \partial x} - e_{vv} v {\partial v \over  \partial x}- e_{vs} v {\partial s \over  \partial x} = 0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial s \over  \partial t} + u {\partial s \over  \partial x} = 0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

If one defines the vector of variables:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ u  \\s \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

recalling that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the flow speed, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the specific entropy, the corresponding jacobian matrix is:

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf A}=\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; u \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

At first one must find the eigenvalues of this matrix by solving the [[characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]]:

&lt;math&gt;\det(\mathbf A (\mathbf y)-\lambda (\mathbf y) \mathbf I))=0&lt;/math&gt;

that is explicitly:

: &lt;math&gt;\det\begin{bmatrix}u-\lambda &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u-\lambda &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; u-\lambda \end{bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

This [[determinant]] is very simple: the fastest computation starts on the last row, since it has the highest number of  zero elements.

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \det \begin{bmatrix}u-\lambda &amp; -v \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; u -\lambda \end{bmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now by computing the determinant 2x2:

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \left( (u-\lambda)^2 - e_{vv} v^2 \right) =0&lt;/math&gt;

by defining the parameter:

: &lt;math&gt;a(v,s) \equiv v \sqrt {e_{vv}} &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently in mechanical variables, as:

: &lt;math&gt;a(\rho,p) \equiv \sqrt {\partial p \over \partial \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

This parameter is always real according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In fact the second law of thermodynamics can be expressed by several postulates. The most elementary of them in mathematical terms is the statement of convexity of the fundamental equation of state, i.e. the [[hessian matrix]] of the specific energy expressed as function of specific volume and specific entropy:

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}e_{vv} &amp; e_{vs} \\ e_{vs} &amp; e_{ss} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is defined positive. This statement corresponds to the two conditions:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
e_{vv}&gt;0\\[1.2ex]
e_{vv}e_{ss}-e_{vs}^2 &gt; 0
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

The first condition is the one ensuring the parameter ''a'' is defined real.

The characteristic equation finally results:

: &lt;math&gt;(u-\lambda) \left( (u-\lambda)^2 - a^2 \right) =0&lt;/math&gt;

That has three real solutions:

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(v,u,s) = u-a(v,s) \quad \lambda_2(u)= u, \quad \lambda_3(v,u,s) = u+a(v,s)&lt;/math&gt;

Then the matrix has three real eigenvalues all distinguished: the 1D Euler equations are a '''strictly hyperbolic system'''.

At this point one should determine the three eigenvectors: each one is obtained by substituting one eigenvalue in the eigenvalue equation and then solving it. By substituting the first eigenvalue &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; one obtains:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a  &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ - e_{vv} v &amp; a &amp; - e_{vs} v \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; a \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ u_1  \\s_1 \end{pmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Basing on the third equation that simply has solution s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0, the system reduces to:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a  &amp; -v \\-a^2 /v&amp; a  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\ u_1 \end{pmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The two equations are redundant as usual, then the eigenvector is defined with a multiplying constant. We choose as right eigenvector:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_1=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ a  \\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The other two eigenvectors can be found with analogous procedure as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf p_2=\begin{pmatrix} e_{vs} \\ 0\\ - \left(\frac a v \right)^2 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mathbf p_3=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ -a \\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then the projection matrix can be built:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf P (v,u,s)=( \mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \mathbf{p}_3) =\begin{pmatrix} v &amp; e_{vs} &amp; v\\ a &amp; 0 &amp; -a \\ 0 &amp;  - \left(\frac a v \right)^2 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally it becomes apparent that the real parameter ''a'' previously defined is the speed of propagation of the information characteristic of the hyperbolic system made of Euler equations, i.e. it is the ''[[group velocity|wave speed]]''. It remains to be shown that the sound speed corresponds to the particular case of an [[isoentropic transformation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s \equiv \sqrt {\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s} &lt;/math&gt;

===Compressibility and sound speed===
Sound speed is defined as the wavespeed of an isentropic transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s(\rho,p) \equiv \sqrt {\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s} &lt;/math&gt;

by the definition of the isoentropic compressibility:

:&lt;math&gt;K_s (\rho,p) \equiv \frac 1 \rho \left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s &lt;/math&gt;

the soundspeed results always the square root of ratio between the isoentropic compressibility and the density:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s \equiv \sqrt {\frac {K_s} \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

====Ideal gas====
The sound speed in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (T) = \sqrt {\gamma \frac T m} &lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
|Deduction of the form valid for ideal gases
|In an ideal gas the isoentropic transformation is described by the [[Poisson's law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;d (p \rho^{-\gamma})_s =0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;gamma;'' is the [[heat capacity ratio]], a constant for the material. By explicitating the differentials:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho^{-\gamma} (d p)_s + \gamma p \rho^{-\gamma-1} (d \rho)_s =0&lt;/math&gt;

and by dividing for ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sup&gt;−''&amp;gamma;''&lt;/sup&gt; d''&amp;rho;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\left({\partial p \over \partial \rho} \right)_s= \gamma p \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Then by substitution in the general definitions for an ideal gas the isentropic compressibility is simply proportional to the pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;K_s (p) = \gamma p &lt;/math&gt;

and the sound speed results ('''Newton–Laplace law'''):

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (\rho,p) = \sqrt {\gamma \frac p \rho} &lt;/math&gt;

Notably, for an ideal gas the [[ideal gas law]] holds, that in mathematical form is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;  p = n T &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the [[number density]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]], provided it is measured in ''energetic units'' (i.e. in [[joules]]) through multiplication with the [[Boltzmann constant]]. Since the mass density is proportional to the number density through the average [[molecular mass]] ''m'' of the material:

&lt;math&gt; \rho = m n &lt;/math&gt;

The ideal gas law can be recast into the formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac p \rho = \frac T m &lt;/math&gt;

By substituting this ratio in the Newton–Laplace law, the expression of the sound speed into an ideal gas as function of  temperature is finally achieved.

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

Since the specific enthalpy in an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;h = c_p  T = \frac {\gamma}{\gamma-1} \frac T m &lt;/math&gt;

the sound speed in an ideal gas can also be made dependent only on its specific enthalpy:

:&lt;math&gt;a_s (h) = \sqrt {(\gamma -1) h} &lt;/math&gt;

==Bernoulli's theorem for steady inviscid flow==

[[ Bernoulli's theorem]] is a direct consequence of the Euler equations.

===Incompressible case and Lamb's form===
The [[vector calculus identity]] of the [[Curl (mathematics)#Identities|cross product of a curl]] holds:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v \  \times } \left( \mathbf{ \nabla \times F} \right) =\nabla_F \left( \mathbf{v \cdot F } \right) - \mathbf{v \cdot \nabla } \mathbf{ F} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where the Feynman subscript notation &lt;math&gt;\nabla_F&lt;/math&gt; is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Horace Lamb|Lamb]] in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895), still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}}[http://web2srv.ing.uniroma1.it/~m_valorani/GasTurbines_LM_files/DispenseTurboMacchine.pdf Valorani, Nasuti, Metodi di analisi delle turbomacchine], pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \mathbf u = \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

the Euler momentum equation in Lamb's form becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g} 
=\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) - \mathbf u\times(\nabla \times \mathbf u)     + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Lamb form}}

Now, basing on the other identity:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left( \frac {p}{\rho} \right) = \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} - \frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho &lt;/math&gt;

the Euler momentum equation assumes a form that is optimal to demonstrate [[Bernoulli's theorem]] for steady flows:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left(\frac 1 2 u^2 + \frac p \rho \right) - \mathbf g =  - \frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, in case of an external [[conservative field]], by defining its potential &amp;phi;:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u) - \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla  \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) =  -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \nabla \rho  + \mathbf u \times (\nabla \times \mathbf u)&lt;/math&gt;

And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a ''[[streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]'', the cross product disappears because its result is always perpendicular to the velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla  \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right) = -\frac{p}{\rho^2} \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho  &lt;/math&gt;

In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt;

, that is '''the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant'''.  Then the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho \right)  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The convenience of defining the [[total head]] for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent:

:&lt;math&gt; b_l \equiv \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi + \frac p \rho , &lt;/math&gt;

which may be simply written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_l = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, '''the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant'''.

===Compressible case ===
In the most general steady (compressibile) case the mass equation in conservation form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf j = \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf u + \mathbf u \cdot \nabla \rho = 0&lt;/math&gt; .

Therefore, the previous expression is rather

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \left({\frac {1}{2}}u^{2}+\phi +{\frac {p}{\rho }}\right)= \frac {p}{\rho}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u}    &lt;/math&gt;

The right-hand side appears on the energy equation in convective form, which on the steady state reads:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla  e =  - \frac{p}{\rho}  \nabla \cdot \mathbf u &lt;/math&gt;

The energy equation therefore becomes:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla \left( e + \frac p \rho + \frac 1 2 u^2 + \phi \right) = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

so that the internal specific energy now features in the head.

Since the external field potential is usually small compared to the other terms, it is convenient to group the latter ones in the [[total enthalpy]]:

:&lt;math&gt; h^t \equiv e + \frac p \rho + \frac 1 2 u^2&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Bernoulli invariant]] for an inviscid gas flow is:

:&lt;math&gt; b_g \equiv h^t + \phi = b_l + e , &lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla b_g = 0&lt;/math&gt;

That is, '''the energy balance for a steady inviscid flow in an external conservative field states that the sum of the total enthalpy and the external potential is constant along a streamline'''.

In the usual case of small potential field, simply:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \cdot \nabla h^t \sim 0&lt;/math&gt;

===Friedman form and Crocco form===
{{see also|Crocco's theorem}}
By substituting the pressure gradient with the entropy and enthalpy gradient, according to the first law of thermodynamics in the enthalpy form:

:&lt;math&gt;v \nabla p = -T \nabla s + \nabla h&lt;/math&gt;

in the convective form of Euler momentum equation, one arrives to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D\mathbf u}{Dt}=T \nabla\,s-\nabla \,h&lt;/math&gt;

[[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] deduced this equation for the particular case of a [[perfect gas]] and published it in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Friedmann A. An essay on hydrodynamics of compressible fluid (Опыт гидромеханики сжимаемой жидкости), [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], 1922, 516 p., [http://books.e-heritage.ru/book/10073889 reprinted] in 1934 under the editorship of [[Nikolai Kochin]] (see the first formula on page 198 of the reprint).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this equation is general for an inviscid nonconductive fluid and no equation of state is implicit in it.

On the other hand, by substituting the enthalpy form of the first law of thermodynamics in the rotational form of Euler momentum equation, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + \frac 1 2 \nabla (u^2) + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  + \frac {\nabla p}{\rho} = \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

and by defining the specific total enthalpy:

:&lt;math&gt; h^t =h + \frac 1 2 u^2&lt;/math&gt;

one arrives to the '''[[Crocco's theorem|Crocco–Vazsonyi form]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Handbook of Shock Waves, Vol I, par. 2.12 Crocco's theorem, p.177]&lt;/ref&gt; (Crocco, 1937) of the Euler momentum equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{ u}}{\partial t} + (\nabla \times \mathbf u) \times  \mathbf u  - T \nabla s + \nabla h^t = \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

In the steady case the two variables entropy and total enthalpy are particularly useful since Euler equations can be recast into the Crocco's form:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\begin{align}   \mathbf u  \times \nabla \times \mathbf u + T \nabla s - \nabla h^t = \mathbf{g} \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla s = 0 \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla h^t = 0  \end{align} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

Finally if the flow is also isothermal:

&lt;math&gt;T \nabla s = \nabla (T s)&lt;/math&gt;

by defining the specific total [[Gibbs free energy]]:

&lt;math&gt; g^t \equiv h^t + Ts &lt;/math&gt;

the Crocco's form can be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt; \left\{\begin{align}   \mathbf u  \times \nabla \times \mathbf u - \nabla g^t = \mathbf{g} \\
\mathbf u \cdot \nabla g^t = 0  \end{align} \right. &lt;/math&gt;

From these relationships one deduces that the specific total free energy is uniform in a steady, irrotational, isothermal, isoentropic, inviscid flow.

==Discontinuities==
{{see also|Shock waves|Burgers equation}}
The Euler equations are [[Differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic partial differential equation|hyperbolic]] equations and their general solutions are [[wave]]s. Under certain assumptions they can be simplified leading to [[Burgers equation]]. Much like the familiar oceanic [[waves and shallow water|waves]], waves described by the Euler Equations [[breaking wave|'break']] and so-called [[shock waves]] are formed; this is a nonlinear effect and represents the solution becoming [[multi-valued function|multi-valued]]. Physically this represents a breakdown of the assumptions that led to the formulation of the differential equations, and to extract further information from the equations we must go back to the more fundamental integral form. Then, [[weak solution]]s are formulated by working in 'jumps' (discontinuities) into the flow quantities – density, velocity, pressure, entropy – using the [[Rankine–Hugoniot equations]]. Physical quantities are rarely discontinuous; in real flows, these discontinuities are smoothed out by [[viscosity]] and by [[heat transfer]]. (See [[Navier–Stokes equations]])

Shock propagation is studied – among many other fields – in [[aerodynamics]] and [[rocket|rocket propulsion]], where sufficiently fast flows occur.

To properly compute the continuum quantities in discontinuous zones (for example shock waves or boundary layers) from the ''local'' forms&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes the local and the global forms are also called respectively ''differential'' and ''non-differential'', but this is not appropriate in all cases. For example, this is appropriate for Euler equations, while it is not for Navier-Stokes equations since in their global form there are some residual spatial first-order derivative operators in all the caractheristic transport terms that in the local form contains second-order spatial derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt; (all the above forms are local forms, since the variables being described are typical of one point in the space caonsidered, i.e. they are ''local variables'') of Euler equations through [[finite difference method]]s generally too many space points and time steps would be necessary for the memory of computers now and in the near future. In these cases it is mandatory to avoid the local forms of the conservation equations, passing some [[weak formulation|weak forms]], like the [[finite volume method|finite volume one]].

===Rankine–Hugoniot equations===
Starting from the simplest case, one consider a steady free conservation equation in conservation form in the space domain:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where in general '''F''' is the flux matrix. By integrating this local equation over a fixed volume V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{V_m} \nabla \cdot \mathbf F dV = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, basing on the [[divergence theorem]], we can transform this integral in a boundary integral of the flux:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F ds = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This ''global form'' simply states that there is no net flux of a conserved quantity passing through a region in the case steady and without source. In 1D the volume reduces to an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], its boundary being its extrema, then the divergence theorem reduces to the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{x_m}^{x_{m+1}} \mathbf F(x') dx' = \mathbf 0,&lt;/math&gt;

that is the simple [[finite difference equation]], known as the ''jump relation'':

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf F = \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

That can be made explicit as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F_{m+1} - \mathbf F_m= \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;

where the notation employed is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F_{m}=\mathbf F(x_m).&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if one performs an indefinite integral:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf F - \mathbf F_0= \mathbf 0.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, a transient conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial y \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

brings to a jump relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d x}{dt} \,  \Delta u = \Delta \mathbf F.&lt;/math&gt;

For one-dimensional Euler equations the conservation variables and the flux are the vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf y = \begin{pmatrix} 1/v \\ j \\ E^t \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F = \begin{pmatrix} j \\ v j^2 + p \\ v j (E^t + p) \end{pmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume,
* &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is the mass flux.

In the one dimensional case the correspondent jump relations, called the [[Rankine–Hugoniot equation]]s, are:&lt;ref&gt;Chorin, Marsden, A mathematical introduction to fluid mechanics, par. 3.2 Shocks, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta (1/v) = \Delta j \\[1.2ex]
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta j = \Delta (v j^2 +p)\\[1.2ex]
\frac {d x}{dt} \Delta E^t = \Delta (j v (E^t + p))\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

In the steady one dimensional case the become simply:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (v j^2 +p) = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (j (\frac {E^t} \rho + \frac p \rho))= 0\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

Thanks to the mass difference equation, the energy difference equation can be simplified without any restriction:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (v j^2 + p)= 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta h^t = 0\end{align}\right.,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;h^t&lt;/math&gt; is the specific total enthalpy.

These are the usually expressed in the convective variables:

&lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\Delta j = 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta (\frac {u^2} v + p)= 0\\[1.2ex]
\Delta  \left(e + \frac 1 2 u^2 + p v \right) = 0 \end{align}\right.,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the flow speed
* &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific internal energy.

Note that the energy equation is an integral form of the '''Bernoulli equation''' in the compressible case. 
The former mass and momentum equations by substitution lead to the Rayleigh equation:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v} = - \frac {u_0^2}{v_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the second member is a constant, the Rayleigh equation always describes a simple [[line (geometry)|line]] in the [[pressure volume diagram|pressure volume plane]] not depending of any equation of state, i.e. the [[Rayleigh line]].
By substituition in the Rankine–Hugoniot equations, that can be also made explicit as:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\rho u = \rho_0 u_0\\[1.2ex]
\rho u^2 + p= \rho_0 u_0^2 + p_0\\[1.2ex]
e + \frac 1 2 u^2 + \frac p \rho = e_0 + \frac 1 2 u_0^2 + \frac {p_0}{\rho_0} \end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

One can also obtain the kinetic equation and to the Hugoniot equation. The analytical passages are not shown here for brevity.

{{see also|Rayleigh equation|Hugoniot equation}}

These are respectively:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
u^2(v,p) = u_0^2 + (p-p_0)(v_0+v)\\[1.2ex]
e(v,p)= e_0 + \frac 1 2 (p+p_0)(v_0-v)\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

The Hugoniot equation, coupled with the fundamental equation of state of the material:

&lt;math&gt; e = e(v,p)&lt;/math&gt;

describes in general in the pressure volume plane a curve passing by the conditions (v&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), i.e. the [[Hugoniot curve]], whose shape strongly depends on the type of material considered.

It is also customary to define a ''Hugoniot function'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=qcYjUc7A9KMC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false L.F. Henderson, ''par. 2.96 The Bethe–Weyl theorem'', in Handbook of Shock Waves, p. 167]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak h (v,s) \equiv e(v,s) - e_0 +\frac 1 2 (p(v,s) + p_0) (v -v_0) &lt;/math&gt;

allowing to quantify deviations from the Hugoniot equation, similarly to the previous definition of the ''hydraulic head'', useful for the deviations from the Bernoulli equation.

===Finite volume form===
On the other hand, by integrating a generic conservation equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} +\nabla \cdot \mathbf F = \mathbf s &lt;/math&gt;

on a fixed volume V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, and then basing on the [[divergence theorem]], it becomes:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {d}{dt} \int_{V_m} \mathbf y dV + \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F \cdot \hat n ds = \mathbf S .&lt;/math&gt;

By integrating this equation also over a time interval:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_{n+1}) \, dV - \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_n) \, dV+ \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf F \cdot \hat n \, ds \, dt = \mathbf 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

Now by defining the node conserved quantity:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf y_{m,n} \equiv \frac 1 {V_m} \int_{V_m} \mathbf y(\mathbf r, t_n) \, dV ,&lt;/math&gt;

we deduce the finite volume form:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}_{m,n+1}=\mathbf{y}_{m,n} - \frac{1}{V_m} \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \oint_{\partial V_m} \mathbf{F} \cdot \hat{n}\, ds \, dt .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for Euler equations, once the conserved quantities have been determined, the convective variables are deduced by back substitution:

: &lt;math&gt;\left\{\begin{align} 
\mathbf u_{m,n} = \frac {\mathbf j_{m,n}}{\rho_{m,n}}\\[1.2ex]
e_{m,n} = \frac {E^t_{m,n}}{\rho_{m,n}} -\frac 1 2 u^2_{m,n}\\[1.2ex]
\end{align}\right. .&lt;/math&gt;

Then the explicit finite volume expressions of the original convective variables are:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, ''Fluidodinamica comprimibile'', par. 11.10: Forma differenziale: metodo dei volumi finiti, p.161&lt;/ref&gt;

\mathbf u_{m,n+1}=\mathbf u_{m,n} - \frac 1 {\rho_{m,n} V_m} \int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \oint_{\partial V_m} (\rho \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u - p \mathbf I) \cdot \hat n \, ds \, dt \\[1.2ex]

==Constraints==
It has been shown that Euler equations are not a complete set of equations, but they require some additional constraints to admit a unique solution: these are the [[equation of state]] of the material considered. To be consistent with [[thermodynamics]] these equations of state should satisfy the two laws of thermodynamics. On the other hand, by definition non-equilibrium system are described by laws lying outside these laws. In the following we list some very simple equations of state and the corresponding influence on Euler equations.

===Ideal polytropic gas===
{{see also|ideal gas}}
For an ideal polytropic gas the fundamental [[equation of state]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} Quartapelle, Autieri, Fluidodinamica comprimibile, Appendix E, p. A-61&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; e (v,s) = e_0 e^{ (\gamma - 1) m (s - s_0)} \left({v_0 \over v}\right)^{\gamma -1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the specific energy, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific volume, &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is the specific entropy, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; here is considered a constant ([[polytropic process]]), and can be shown to correspond to the [[heat capacity ratio]]. This equation can be shown to be consistent with the usual equations of state employed by thermodynamics.

{{hidden
|Demonstration of consistency with the thermodynamics of an ideal gas
|By the thermodynamic definition of temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;T(e) \equiv {\partial e \over \partial s} = (\gamma - 1) m e&lt;/math&gt;

Where the temperature is measured in energy units. At first, note that by combining these two equations one can deduce the '''[[ideal gas law]]''':

:&lt;math&gt;p v = m T&lt;/math&gt;

or, in the usual form:

:&lt;math&gt;p = n T&lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;n \equiv \frac m v&lt;/math&gt; is the number density of the material. On the other hand the ideal gas law is less strict than the original fundamental equation of state considered.

Now consider the molar heat capacity associated to a process ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;c_x = \left(m T {\partial s \over \partial T}\right)_x&lt;/math&gt;

according to the first law of thermodynamics:

:&lt;math&gt;d e(v,s)=-p dv + T \, ds&lt;/math&gt;

it can be simply expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;c_x \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_x + m p \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_x&lt;/math&gt;

Now inverting the equation for temperature T(e) we deduce that for an ideal polytropic gas the isocoric heat capacity is a constant:

:&lt;math&gt;c_v \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_v = m {d e \over dT} = \frac {1}{(\gamma -1)}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for an ideal polytropic gas the isobaric heat capacity results constant:

:&lt;math&gt;c_p \equiv m \left({\partial e \over \partial T}\right)_p + m p  \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_p = m {d e \over dT} + p \left({\partial v \over \partial T}\right)_p = \frac {1}{(\gamma -1)} + 1&lt;/math&gt;

This brings to two important [[relations between heat capacities]]: the constant gamma actually represents the '''[[heat capacity ratio]]''' in the ideal polytropic gas:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {c_p}{c_v}= \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

and one also arrives to the '''Meyer's relation''':

:&lt;math&gt;c_p = c_v+1&lt;/math&gt;

The specific energy is then, by inverting the relation T(e):

:&lt;math&gt;e(T) = \frac {mT} {\gamma - 1} = c_v m T&lt;/math&gt;

The specific enthalpy results by substitution of the latter and of the ideal gas law:

:&lt;math&gt;h(T) \equiv e(T) + (p v)(T) = c_v m T + m T = c_p m T&lt;/math&gt;

|style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%;
|headerstyle = text-align:left
}}

From this equation one can derive the equation for pressure by its thermodynamic definition:

:&lt;math&gt;p(v,e) \equiv - {\partial e \over \partial v} = (\gamma - 1) \frac e v&lt;/math&gt;

By inverting it one arrives to the mechanical equation of state:

:&lt;math&gt;e(v,p) = \frac {pv}{\gamma - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

Then for an ideal gas the compressible Euler equations can be simply expressed in the ''mechanical'' or ''primitive variables'' specific volume, flow velocity and pressure, by taking the set of the equations for a thermodynamic system and modifying the energy equation into a pressure equation through this mechanical equation of state. At last, in convective form they result:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Euler equations for an ideal polytropic gas''' (''convective form'')&lt;ref&gt;Toro, par 3.1.2 Nonconservative formulations, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

{D v \over Dt} = v \nabla \cdot \mathbf u\\[1.2ex]
\frac{D \mathbf{ u}}{D t} = v \nabla p + \mathbf{g} \\[1.2ex]
{Dp \over Dt} = - \gamma p \nabla \cdot \mathbf u
\end{align}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

and in one-dimensional quasilinear form they results:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial t} + \mathbf A \frac{\partial \mathbf y}{\partial x}  = {\mathbf 0}. &lt;/math&gt;

where the conservative vector variable is:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}v\\ u  \\p \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding jacobian matrix is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/compressible/Euler.pdf M. Zingale, Notes on the Euler equations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toro, p.92&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf A}=\begin{pmatrix}u &amp; -v &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; u &amp; v \\ 0 &amp; \gamma p &amp; u \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Steady flow in material coordinates {{anchor|Steady flow in streamline coordinates}} ===
In the case of steady flow, it is convenient to choose the [[Frenet–Serret frame]] along a [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]] as the [[coordinate system]] for describing the steady [[momentum]] Euler equation:&lt;ref name="Fay"&gt;
{{cite book
|author=James A. Fay
|title=Introduction to Fluid Mechanics
|publisher=MIT Press
|date=June 1994
|isbn=0-262-06165-1
}} see "4.5 Euler's Equation in Streamline Coordinates" pp. 150–152 &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=XGVpue4954wC&amp;pg=150&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{u} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p,
&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[flow velocity]], the [[pressure]] and the [[density]], respectively.

Let &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf e_s, \mathbf e_n, \mathbf e_b \}&lt;/math&gt; be a Frenet–Serret [[orthonormal basis]] which consists of a tangential unit vector, a normal unit vector, and a binormal unit vector to the streamline, respectively.
Since a streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the left-handed side of the above equation, the [[convective derivative]] of velocity, can be described as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla \boldsymbol{u} \\
&amp;= u\frac{\partial}{\partial s}(u\boldsymbol{e}_s)
     &amp;(\boldsymbol{u} = u \boldsymbol{e}_s ,~ 
      {\partial / \partial s} \equiv \boldsymbol{e}_s\cdot\nabla)\\
&amp;= u\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\boldsymbol{e}_s 
+ \frac{u^2}{R} \boldsymbol{e}_n &amp;(\because~ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{e}_s}{\partial s}=\frac{1}{R}\boldsymbol{e}_n),
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the streamline.

Therefore, the momentum part of the Euler equations for a steady flow is found to have a simple form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\displaystyle u\frac{\partial u}{\partial s} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial s},\\
\displaystyle {u^2 \over R}                  = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial n}    &amp;({\partial / \partial n}\equiv\boldsymbol{e}_n\cdot\nabla),\\
\displaystyle 0                              = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial b} &amp;({\partial / \partial b}\equiv\boldsymbol{e}_b\cdot\nabla).
\end{cases} 
&lt;/math&gt;

For [[barotropic]] flow &lt;math&gt;(\rho = \rho(p))&lt;/math&gt;, [[Bernoulli's equation]] is derived from the first equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial s}\left(\frac{u^2}{2} + \int \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\rho}\right) =0.
&lt;/math&gt; 
The second equation expresses that, in the case the streamline is curved, there should exist a [[pressure gradient]] normal to the streamline because the [[centripetal acceleration]] of the [[fluid parcel]] is only generated by the normal pressure gradient.

The third equation expresses that pressure is constant along the binormal axis.

==== Streamline curvature theorem ====
[[File:Streamlines around a NACA 0012.svg|frame|right|
The "Streamline curvature theorem" states that the pressure at the upper surface of an airfoil is lower than the pressure far away and that the pressure at the lower surface is higher than the pressure far away; hence the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil generates a lift force.
]]

Let &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; be the distance from the center of curvature of the streamline, 
then the second equation is written as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} = \rho \frac{u^2}{r}~(&gt;0),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{\partial / \partial r} = -{\partial /\partial n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation states:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
''In a steady flow of an [[inviscid]] [[fluid]] without external forces, the [[center of curvature]] of the streamline lies in the direction of decreasing radial pressure.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this relationship between the pressure field and flow curvature is very useful, it doesn't have a name in the English-language scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Babinsky&gt;{{citation

This "theorem" explains clearly why there are such low pressures in the centre of [[vortex|vortices]],&lt;ref name=Babinsky/&gt; which consist of concentric circles of streamlines.
This also is a way to intuitively explain why airfoils generate [[lift (force)|lift forces]].&lt;ref name=Babinsky/&gt;

A '''geometrized unit system''' or '''geometric unit system''' is a system of [[natural units]] in which the base [[unit of measurement|physical units]] are chosen so that the [[speed of light in vacuum]], ''c'', and the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', are set equal to unity.

:&lt;math&gt; c = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; G = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;

The geometrized unit system is not a completely defined or unique system: latitude is left to also set other [[Physical constants|constants]] to unity. We may, for example, also set [[vacuum permittivity]], ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the [[electric charge]], &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, to unity.

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_0 = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; e = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[reduced Planck constant]], ''ħ'', is not equal to 1 in this system ([[Stoney units]]), in contrast to [[Planck units]].

This system is useful in [[physics]], especially in the [[special theory of relativity|special]] and [[general theory of relativity|general theories of relativity]]. All [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] are identified with geometric quantities such as areas, lengths, dimensionless numbers, path curvatures, or sectional curvatures.

Many equations in relativistic physics appear far simpler when expressed in geometric units, because all appearances of ''G'' or ''c'' drop out. For example, the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of a nonrotating uncharged [[black hole]] with mass ''m'' becomes simply {{nowrap|1=''r'' = 2''m''}}. Therefore, many books and papers on relativistic physics use geometric units exclusively. An alternative system of geometrized units is often used in [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], in which {{nowrap|1=8π''G'' = 1}} instead. This introduces an additional factor of 8π into Newton's [[law of universal gravitation]] but simplifies [[Einstein's equations]], the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]], the [[Friedmann equations]] and the Newtonian [[Poisson equation]] by removing the corresponding factor.

Practical measurements and computations are usually done in [[SI]] units, but conversions are generally quite straightforward{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.

==Definition==

In geometric units, every time interval is interpreted as the distance travelled by light during that given time interval. That is, one [[second]] is interpreted as one [[light-second]], so time has the geometric units of [[length]]. This is dimensionally consistent with the notion that, according to the [[kinematics|kinematical]] laws of [[special relativity]], time and distance are on an equal footing.

[[Energy]] and [[momentum]] are interpreted as components of the [[four-momentum]] vector, and [[mass]] is the magnitude of this vector, so in geometric units these must all have the dimension of length. We can convert a mass expressed in kilograms to the equivalent mass expressed in metres by multiplying by the conversion factor ''G''/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, the [[Sun]]'s mass of {{val|2.0|e=30|u=kg}} in SI units is equivalent to {{val|1.5|u=km}}. This is half the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of a one solar mass [[black hole]]. All other conversion factors can be worked out by combining these two.

The small numerical size of the few conversion factors reflects the fact that relativistic effects are only noticeable when large masses or high speeds are considered.

==Conversions==

Listed below are all conversion factors that are useful to convert between all combinations of the SI base units, and if not possible, between them and their unique elements, because ampere is a dimensionless ratio of two lengths such as [C/s], and candela (1/683 [W/sr]) is a dimensionless ratio of two dimensionless ratios such as ratio of two volumes [kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;] = [W] and ratio of two areas [m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;] = [sr], while mole is only a dimensionless [[Avogadro number]] of entities such as atoms or particles:

==Geometrical quantities==
The components of ''curvature tensors'' such as the [[Einstein tensor]] have, in geometric units, the dimensions of [[sectional curvature]]. So do the components of the [[stress–energy tensor]]. Therefore the [[Einstein field equation]] is dimensionally consistent in these units.

''Path curvature'' is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the [[geodesic curvature|curvature vector]] of a curve, so in geometric units it has the dimension of [[inverse length]]. Path curvature measures the rate at which a nongeodesic curve bends in [[spacetime]], and if we interpret a timelike curve as the [[world line]] of some [[observation|observer]], then its path curvature can be interpreted as the magnitude of the [[acceleration]] experienced by that observer. Physical quantities which can be identified with path curvature include the components of the [[electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field tensor]].

Any [[velocity]] can be interpreted as the [[slope]] of a curve; in geometric units, slopes are evidently [[dimensionless]] ratios. Physical quantities which can be identified with dimensionless ratios include the components of the [[electromagnetic four-potential|electromagnetic potential]] four-vector and the [[four-current|electromagnetic current]] four-vector.

Physical quantities such as [[mass]] and [[electric charge]] which can be identified with the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a [[timelike vector]] have the geometric dimension of ''length''. Physical quantities such as [[angular momentum]] which can be identified with the magnitude of a [[bivector]] have the geometric dimension of ''area''.

Here is a table collecting some important physical quantities according to their dimensions in geometrized units. They are listed together with the appropriate conversion factor for SI units.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">'''Interpretivism''' is a school of thought in contemporary [[jurisprudence]] and the [[philosophy of law]]. 

==Overview==
[[File:Ronald Dworkin at the Brooklyn Book Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Dworkin]] is often associated with interpretivism.]]
The main claims of interpretivism are that 
*Law is not a set of given data, [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or physical facts, but what [[lawyer]]s aim to construct or obtain in their [[Practice_of_law|practice]]. This marks a first difference between interpretivism and [[legal positivism]]. But the refusal that law be a set of ''given'' entities opposes interpretivism to [[natural law]] too.
*There is no separation between law and [[morality]], although there are differences. This is not in accordance with the main claim of legal positivism.
*Law is not [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature nor do legal values and principles exist independently and outside of the legal practice itself. This is the opposite of the main claim of natural law theory.

In the [[English language|English]] speaking world, interpretivism is usually identified with [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s thesis on the nature of [[law]] as discussed in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', which is sometimes seen as a third way between natural law and legal positivism. 

The concept also includes continental [[legal hermeneutics]] and authors such as [[Helmut Coing]] and [[Emilio Betti]]. Legal hermeneutics can be seen as a branch of philosophical [[hermeneutics]], whose main authors in the 20th century are [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]], both drawing on [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. Hermeneutics has now expanded to many varied areas of research in the [[social sciences]] as an alternative to a conventionalist approach.

In a wider sense, interpretivism includes even the theses of, in chronological order, [[Josef Esser]], [[Theodor Viehweg]], [[Chaim Perelman]], [[Wolfgang Fikentscher]], [[António Castanheira Neves|Castanheira Neves]], [[Friedrich Müller (jurist)|Friedrich Müller]], [[Aulis Aarnio]] and [[Robert Alexy]].

'''Otto Karl Wiesenburg''' was a Mississippi statesmen, lawyer, public servant, and resident of Pascagoula, Mississippi.  He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned home to help develop [[Jackson County, Mississippi]], into a thriving industrial complex.  Wiesenburg is best known for his opposition to Governor Ross Barnett's attempt to deny the enrollment of [[James Meredith]] into the University of Mississippi.&lt;ref name = "Rubin 2002"&gt;[[Richard Rubin (writer)|Rubin, Richard]] (2002). ''Confederacy of Silence: A True Tale of the New Old South, New York, New York: Atria Books. p. 12. {{ISBN|0-671-03666-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Otto Karl Wiesenburg''' was born in Rosedale, Long Island, New York on August 1, 1911 and attended public high school in New York City.  He arrived in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] in 1931 as a radio operator on a U.S. Coast Guard vessel and spent his life there working to improve the city, Jackson County, and the State of [[Mississippi]]. He served in the Coast Guard from December 3, 1929 to December 2, 1934 advancing from apprentice seaman to Radioman 2nd Class.   While he did not complete high school before leaving New York to join the Coast Guard, he was a self-educated man who studied law by reading law books during his days at sea in the Coast Guard.  In 1933, he passed the Mississippi bar examination, was admitted to the Mississippi Bar on March 27, 1933 and practiced law in Pascagoula until the day of his death on June 18, 1990. His law practice was one of the most respected in the state and he was described as a man of integrity by the ''Mississippi Press'' newspaper.

== Military Service ==

Although he had met his military obligation with five year's service in the Coast Guard, he joined the U.S. Army after [[Pearl Harbor]] on May 2, 1942 and served overseas for 42 months in World War II as a radio operator in India, Burma, and China rising to the rank of Captain. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and The Asiatic/Pacific Medal with two combat stars.  After the war, he continued his military service in the U. S. Army Reserve serving as commanding officer of the 845th Signal Service Battalion before retiring as a Lt. Colonel in 1964.

== Public Service ==

Devoted to public service, Wiesenburg was appointed to the Pascagoula Port Commission in 1941 and served as its president. He served as city attorney to both [[Pascagoula]] and Ocean Springs and as attorney for the Pascagoula Port Authority and attorney for the Jackson County Board of Supervisors.  He also served for one term on the Pascagoula City Council.  In 1956, he was elected to the [[Mississippi Legislature]] where served until 1964. He was voted the Outstanding Freshman Legislator in 1956. During his eight years, he authored significant legislation for south Mississippi including the County Zoning Act, State Ports Act, Water Safety and Boating Act, Pat Harrison Waterway Commission Act, and the Jackson County Campus - Mississippi Gulf Coast Jr. College Act. He also authored the landmark Jackson County Port Authority Act that created the port of Pascagoula, including the industrial area of Bayou Casotte.  The Jackson County Port Authority considers him the father of the Port of Pascagoula.

== Meredith Incident ==

During the period when [[James Meredith]] entered the University of Mississippi as its first black student, over the opposition of Governor [[Ross Barnett]] and the [[Mississippi Legislature]], Wiesenburg was one of two legislators, the other being Joe Wroten of Greenville, who took a strong stand for civil rights and observance of the law. Wiesenburg stated of the Barnett administration that, "His administration will go down as the worst since Reconstruction days." &lt;ref name = "Sitton 1962"&gt;[[Claude Sitton|Sitton, Claude]] (1962). Mississippi Votes New Laws to Keep University White, The New York Times, September 20, 1962, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a five-part series of articles titled "The Oxford Disaster...Price of Defiance" that was published in the Pascagoula newspaper ''The Chronicle'' between December 17–21, 1962.&lt;ref name = "Harkey 1967"&gt;[[Ira B. Harkey, Jr.|Harkey, Ira B. Jr.]] (1967). ''The Smell of Burning Crosses; An Autobiography of a Mississippi Newspaperman, Jacksonville, Illinois: Harris-Wolf &amp; Company. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The articles detailed the applicable federal and state laws that had been violated and stated that the Governor's action had followed "the road to riot" and that the resulting bloodshed in Oxford was the "price of defiance." [[Ira B. Harkey Jr.]] editor of ''The Chronicle'' won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]] in 1963 for his anti-segregationist editorials and reporting of the [[James Meredith]] incident. Others also took notice of Wiesenburg's strong stand for the rule of law. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] wrote of Wiesenburg in a letter to the federal attorney in Oxford, "Tell [Wiesenburg] for me that he is the one who deserves a Pulitzer Prize or more.  It is all well for we in the North to talk about these matters. That takes no courage at all.  But people such as you and Mr. Wiesenburg are the ones who really carry the banner." &lt;ref name = "Schlesinger 1978"&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr.]] (1978). Robert Kennedy and His Times, New York, New York: Balentine Books. p. 351. {{ISBN|0-345-28344-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Mississippi Governor [[William Winter (politician)|William Winter]] described Wiesenburg as "one of the most courageous men he ever knew."

While he did not attend college, unknown to his family until after his death, he paid for many students to attend colleges throughout the state.  His family has established the Karl Wiesenburg Scholarship at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] to honor his commitment to education and public service.  The scholarship is available to University of Southern Mississippi students majoring in political science with preference for a student from Jackson County.

The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[aphorism]] "'''know thyself'''" ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|γνῶθι σεαυτόν}}, transliterated: ''{{lang|grc-Latn|gnōthi seauton}}''; also {{lang|grc|... σαυτόν}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|… sauton}}'' with [[crasis|the ε contracted]]), is one of the [[Delphic maxims]] and was inscribed in the [[pronaos]] (forecourt) of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo at Delphi]] according to the Greek writer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (10.24.1).&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Description of Greece, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.24&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 Paus. 10.24].&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was later expounded upon by the philosopher [[Socrates]] who taught that: 

{{quote|[[The unexamined life is not worth living]].}}

In [[Latin]] the phrase, "know thyself," is given as ''nosce te ipsum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nosce%20te%20ipsum |title=Nosce te ipsum - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''temet nosce''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |title=AllExperts.com: temet nosce |publisher=allexperts.com |date= |accessdate=17 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231172656/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Ancient-Languages-2210/Know-thyself.htm |archivedate=31 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maxim, or aphorism, "know thyself" has had a variety of meanings attributed to it in literature.

==Attribution==
According to a proposal by De Lubicz and Lamy (1956), the Greek aphorism may have been adopted from [[Ancient Egypt]]: there are two parts of the ancient [[Luxor Temple]], the External Temple, where the beginners were allowed to enter and the Internal Temple where a person was only allowed to enter after proven worthy and ready to acquire more knowledge and insights. One of the proverbs of the External Temple is "The body is the house of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie||title=Her-Bak: The Living Face of Ancient Egypt|date=1954|publisher=Hodder and Staughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Internal Temple, one of the many proverbs is "Man, know thyself, and you are going to know the gods".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Lubicz|first1=Isha Schwaller|last2=Lamy|first2=Lucie|title=Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate|date=1978|publisher=Inner Traditions International}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Greek aphorism has been attributed to at least the following [[Seven Sages of Greece|ancient Greek sages]]:
* [[Bias of Priene]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Bias of Priene]], in Plato's Protagoras (343a-343b) Socrates lists Bias as one of the seven sources of the Delphic maxims including "Know Thyself." &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Myson of Chenae]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Myson of Chenae]], in Plato's Protagoras (343a-343b) Socrates lists Myson as one of the seven sages who were sources of the Delphic maxims including "Know Thyself." &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343a&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Periander]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 10.24.1 mentions a controversy over whether Periander should be listed as the seventh sage instead of Myson.  But Socrates who is cited by Pausanias as his source supports Myson. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.24&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160 Paus. 10.24]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pittacus of Mytilene]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittacus of Mitylene]], in Plato's Protagoras (343a-343b) Socrates lists Pittacus as one of the seven sages who were sources of the Delphic maxims including "Know Thyself." &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343a&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pythagoras]]{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* [[Socrates]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates]], Socrates refers to it in Plato's Philebus 48c, and Phaedrus 229e as a saying of Delphi.  The Tufts Perseus web site shows Philebus text as: &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text=Phileb.:section=48c&amp;highlight=thyself,know&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] attributes it to Thales (''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|Lives]]'' I.40), but also notes that Antisthenes in his ''Successions of Philosophers'' attributes it to [[Phemonoe]], a mythical Greek poet, though admitting that it was appropriated by Chilon. In a discussion of moderation and self-awareness, the Roman poet [[Juvenal]] quotes the phrase in Greek and states that the precept descended ''e caelo'' (from heaven) (''[[Satires of Juvenal#Satire XI: Dinner and a Moral|Satires]]'' 11.27).  The 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia the ''[[Suda]]'' recognized Chilon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&lt;/ref&gt; and Thales&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/theta/17&lt;/ref&gt; as the sources of the maxim "Know Thyself."

The authenticity of all such attributions is doubtful; according to Parke  and Wormell (1956), "The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages."&lt;ref&gt;H. Parke and D. Wormell, ''The Delphic Oracle'', (Basil Blackwell, 1956), vol. 1, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, T., [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Cj0ueSqyVQC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Delphic Oracle: Its Early History, Influence &amp; Fall''], Oxford : B.H.

==Usage==
Listed chronologically:
===By Aeschylus===
The ancient Greek playwright [[Aeschylus]] uses the maxim "know thyself" in his play ''[[Prometheus Bound]].'' The play about a mythological sequence, thereby places the maxim within the context of Greek mythology. In this play, the demi-god [[Prometheus]] first rails at the Olympian gods, and against what he believes to be the injustice of his having been bound to a cliffside by Zeus, king of the Olympian gods.  The demi-god [[Oceanus]] comes to Prometheus to reason with him, and cautions him that he should "know thyself".&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheys Bound'', [https://el.wikisource.org/wiki/%CE%A0%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8D%CF%82_%CE%94%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%BC%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82 v. 309]: ''γίγνωσκε σαυτὸν''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, Oceanus is telling Prometheus that he should know better than to speak ill of the one who decides his fate and accordingly, perhaps he should better know his place in the "great order of things."

===By Socrates===
One of [[Socrates|Socrates's]] students, the historian [[Xenophon]], described some of the instances of Socrates's use of the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' in his history titled: ''Memorabilia.''  In this writing, Xenophon portrayed his teacher's use of the maxim as an organizing theme for Socrates's lengthy dialogue with Euthydemus.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon describes Socrates use of 'Know Thyself' in Memorabilia 4.2.24 &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0208:book%3D4:chapter%3D2:section%3D24&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===By Plato===
[[Plato]], another student of Socrates, employs the maxim 'Know Thyself' extensively by having the character of Socrates use it to motivate his dialogues.  Benjamin Jowett's index to his translation of the ''[[Dialogues of Plato]]'' lists six dialogues which discuss or explore the Delphic maxim: 'know thyself.' These dialogues (and the [[Stephanus numbers]] indexing the pages where these discussions begin) are ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'' (164D), ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' (343B), ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (229E), ''[[Philebus]]'' (48C), ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (II.923A), ''[[First Alcibiades|Alcibiades I]]'' (124A, 129A, 132C).&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], The Dialogues of Plato translated into English with Analyses and Introductions by [[Benjamin Jowett]], M.A. in Five Volumes. 3rd edition revised and corrected (Oxford University Press, 1892), (See Index: Knowledge; 'know thyself' at Delphi).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]'', Critias refers to the maxim consistently with the view expressed in the ''[[Suda]]'', with Critias saying, "for they imagined that 'Know Thyself!' was a piece of advice which the god gave and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in."&lt;ref&gt;Critias states the meaning of 'know thyself' in Plato's Charmides (165a),&lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D165a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern words Critias gives his opinion that 'Know Thyself!' was an admonition to those entering the sacred temple to remember or know their place and Critias says, " 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same.  Notice that when the words of Critias are written, 'thyself' and 'temperate' are punctuated with exclamation marks in the English translations, as if they were commands.&lt;ref&gt;Critias says 'know thyself!' and 'be temperate!' are the same in Plato's Charmides (164e), &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0176:text%3DCharm.:section%3D164e&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the balance of the ''Charmides'', Plato has Socrates lead a longer inquiry as to how we may gain knowledge of ourselves.

In Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', Socrates uses the maxim 'know thyself' as his explanation to Phaedrus to explain why he has no time for the attempts to rationally explain mythology or other far flung topics. Socrates says, "But I have no leisure for them at all; and the reason, my friend, is this: I am not yet able, as the Delphic inscription has it, to know myself; so it seems to me ridiculous, when I do not yet know that, to investigate irrelevant things."&lt;ref&gt;[[Socrates]] uses the saying 'know thyself' to explain what is important for him to know. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174:text%3DPhaedrus:section%3D229e&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', Socrates lauds the authors of [[Laconic phrase|pithy and concise sayings]] delivered precisely at the right moment and says that Lacedaemon, or [[Sparta]], educates its people to that end.  Socrates lists the Seven Sages as Thales, Pittacus, Bias, Solon, Cleobulus, Myson, and Chilon, who he says are gifted in that Lacedaemonian art of concise words "twisted together, like a bowstring, where a slight effort gives great force."&lt;ref&gt;Socrates lists the authors of Delphi's sayings. &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Prot.+343a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Socrates says examples of them are, "the far-famed inscriptions, which are in all men's mouths,--'Know thyself,' and 'Nothing too much'.".&lt;ref&gt;Socrates seeks to understand 'Know thyself' as pithy, concise wisdom.  &lt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0178:text%3DProt.:section%3D343b&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Having lauded the maxims, Socrates then spends a great deal of time getting to the bottom of what one of them means, the saying of Pittacus, 'Hard is it to be good.'  The irony here is that although the sayings of Delphi bear 'great force,' it is not clear how to live life in accordance with their meanings.  Although, the concise and broad nature of the sayings suggests the active partaking in the usage and personal discovery of each maxim; as if the intended nature of the saying lay not in the words but the self-reflection and self-referencing of the person thereof.
 
In Plato's ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue, Socrates refers back to the same usage of 'know thyself' from ''Phaedrus'' to build an example of the ridiculous for Protarchus.  Socrates says, as he did in Phaedrus, that people make themselves appear ridiculous when they are trying to know obscure things before they know themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates use of 'Know thyself' in Philebus (48c) http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Phileb.+48c&amp;fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0174&lt;/ref&gt; Plato also alluded to the fact that understanding 'thyself,' would have a greater yielded factor of understanding the nature of a human being. Syllogistically, understanding oneself would enable thyself to have an understanding of others as a result.

===Later usage===
[[File:Antropomorpha12c.png|thumb|right|Detail from the 6th edition of Linnaeus' ''Systema Naturae'' (1748). "HOMO. ''Nosce te ipsum''."]]

The ''[[Suda]]'', a 10th-century encyclopedia of Greek knowledge, says: "the proverb is applied to those whose boasts exceed what they are",&lt;ref&gt;'Know Thyself' as an admonition, in "Know Thyself". ''Suda'' On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 &lt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/333&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "know thyself" is a warning to pay no attention to the opinion of the multitude.&lt;ref&gt;'Know the value of Thyself' rightly, in  "Know Thyself". ''Suda'' On Line. Tr. Catherine Roth. 13 Aug 2002. 15 Feb 2011 &lt;http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/gamma/334&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

One work by the Medieval philosopher [[Peter Abelard]] is entitled ''Scito te ipsum'' (“know yourself”) or ''Ethica''.

From 1539 onwards the phrase ''nosce te ipsum'' and its Latin variants were often used in the anonymous texts written for [[Anatomical Fugitive Sheet|anatomical fugitive sheets]] printed in Venice as well as for later anatomical atlases printed throughout Europe. The 1530s fugitive sheets are the first instances in which the phrase was applied to knowledge of the human body attained through dissection.&lt;ref&gt;William Schupbach, The Paradox of Rembrandt's "Anatomy of Dr. Tulp (Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine: London, 1982), pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1651 [[Thomas Hobbes]] used the term ''nosce teipsum'' which he translated as 'read thyself' in his famous work, ''[[The Leviathan]]''. He was responding to a popular philosophy at the time that you can learn more by studying others than you can from reading books. He asserts that one learns more by studying oneself: particularly the feelings that influence our thoughts and motivate our actions. As Hobbes states, "but to teach us that for the similitude of the thoughts and passions of one man, to the thoughts and passions of another, whosoever looketh into himself and considereth what he doth when he does think, opine, reason, hope, fear, etc., and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know what are the thoughts and passions of all other men upon the like occasions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=The Leviathan |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |work=Civil peace and social unity through perfect government |publisher=Oregon State University: Phl 302, Great Voyages: the History of Western Philosophy from 1492-1776, Winter 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127130924/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-contents.html |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734 [[Alexander Pope]] wrote a poem entitled "An Essay on Man, Epistle II", which begins "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan, The proper study of mankind is Man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Pope]] begins his Essay on Man Epistle II "Know then thyself."&lt;http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/03/hbc-90002748&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1735 [[Carl Linnaeus]] published the first edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in which he described humans (''[[Homo]]'') with the simple phrase "''Nosce te ipsum''".&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_XUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=Linnaeus%201735%20%22nosce%20te%20ipsum%22&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1750 [[Benjamin Franklin]], in his ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'', observed the great difficulty of knowing one's self, with: "There are three Things extremely hard, Steel, a Diamond, and to know one's self." &lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Franklin]] observes that it is extremely hard to know oneself. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?id=MYkTAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Autobiography%2C%20Sayings%20of%20Poor%20Richard%2C%20Letters&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754 [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] lauded the "inscription of the Temple at Delphi" in his ''[[Discourse on the Origin of Inequality]]''.

In 1831, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote a poem entitled "Γνώθι Σεαυτόν", or Gnothi Seauton ('Know Thyself'), on the theme of 'God in thee.' The poem was an anthem to Emerson's belief that to 'know thyself' meant knowing the [[God]] which Emerson felt existed within each person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] Gnothe Seauton, Poem 1831. &lt;http://www.vcu.edu/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/poems/gnothi.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 [[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote a poem entitled "Self Knowledge" in which the text centers on the Delphic maxim 'Know Thyself' beginning, 'Gnôthi seauton!--and is this the prime And heaven-sprung adage of the olden time!--' and ending with 'Ignore thyself, and strive to know thy God!' Coleridge's text references JUVENAL, xi. 27.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel T. Coleridge]] wrote the poem 'Self Knowledge' discussing 'Gnôthi seauton' or know thyself. &lt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/37203/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] has his 16th-century alter ego in his letter to Francis Bacon mention a book he intended to call ''Nosce te ipsum''.

In 1904 Sarah Ida Shaw and Elanor Dorcas Pond founded the [[Delta Delta Delta]] fraternity. Part of their motto is Self-Knowledge, Self-Reverence, and Self-Discipline.

[[The Wachowskis]] used one of the Latin versions (''temet nosce'') of this aphorism as inscription over the Oracle's door in their movies ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999)&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Temet+Nosce%22%22The+Matrix%22+Oracle occurrences] on [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://patrickmcgrath.blogspot.it/2011/01/know-thyself-most-important-art-lesson.html#.Uk2k-NdxNok | title="Know Thyself".

"Know Thyself" is the motto of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], of [[Lyceum International School]] (Nugegoda, Sri Lanka) and of [[İpek University]] (Ankara, Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130317114755/http://www.ipek.edu.tr/ ipek.edu.tr].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nosce te ipsum'' is also the motto for the [[Thompson (surname)|Scottish clan Thompson]]. It is featured on the family crest or coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thompson Surname, Family Crest &amp; Coats of Arms |url=https://www.houseofnames.com/thompson-family-crest |website=House of Names |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus''''' (until 2014 known as '''''Lactobacillus bulgaricus''''') is the main [[bacteria]] used for the production of [[yogurt]]. It is also found in other naturally fermented products.  First identified in 1905 by the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] doctor [[Stamen Grigorov]], the bacterium feeds on [[lactose]] to produce [[lactic acid]], which is used to preserve milk.

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus'' can be found naturally in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals living in Bulgaria, but one specific strain, [[Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44|''Lactobacillus bulgaricus'' GLB44]], is extracted from the leaves of the ''[[Galanthus nivalis]]'' (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The bacterium is also grown artificially in many other countries.

It is a [[gram-positive]] rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is [[motility|non-motile]] and does not form spores. It is regarded as aciduric or [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophilic]], since it requires a low [[pH]] (around 5.4–4.6) to grow effectively. The bacterium has complex nutritional requirements.

On October 18, 2012, during the International Conference on "Biodiversity Conservation and Education for Sustainable Development - Learning to Conserve Biodiversity in a Rapidly Changing World" held at Hyderabad during CoP-11, [[Jayanthi Natarajan]], India's Minister of State for Environment and Forests, announced it as the National Microbe for India. The microbe was selected by children who had visited the [[Science Express]] Biodiversity Special, a train which has been visiting various stations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://southasia.oneworld.net/news/now-india-has-a-national-microbe&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii ''subsp.'' bulgaricus'' is commonly used alongside  ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]''&lt;ref name="courtin"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = P. | last2 = Rul | first2 = F.

== {{anchor|History of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus}} History ==

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus'' was first identified in 1905 by [[Stamen Grigorov]], who named it ''Bacillus bulgaricus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stamengrigorov.org/?current=science&amp;lang=en&amp;id_sess=0ed3jl08q0028tbboq1imdmta1 | title = Dr Stamen Grigorov Foundation | accessdate = 2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ilya Metchnikoff]], a professor at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris, researched the relationship between the longevity of [[Bulgarians]] and their consumption of yogurt. He had the idea that aging is caused by putrefactive activity, or [[proteolysis]], by microbes that produce toxic substances in the intestine.

Proteolytic bacteria such as [[clostridia]], which are part of the normal intestinal flora, produce toxic substances including [[phenols]], [[ammonia]] and [[indol]]s by digestion of [[protein]]s. These compounds are responsible for what Metchnikoff called ''intestinal auto-intoxication'', which, according to him, was the cause of the physical changes associated with old age, a concept that has no scientific basis. It was already known at that time that fermentation with [[lactic acid bacteria]] inhibits the deterioration of milk because of its low [[pH]].

Metchnikoff's research also noted that rural populations in [[Southeastern Europe]] and the Russian steppes daily consume milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and live relatively longer than other populations. Based on these data Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk seeds the intestine with harmless lactic acid bacteria increasing intestinal acidity and suppressing the growth of proteolytic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.successmakers.com/uploads/Probiotics_-_100_years_after_Elie_Metchnikoff_PhDs_Obsevations.pdf |title=Probiotics: 100 years (1907–2007) after Elie Metchnikoff's Observation |accessdate=2013-01-08 |first=Kingsley C. |last=Anukam |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004072755/http://mail.successmakers.com/uploads/Probiotics_-_100_years_after_Elie_Metchnikoff_PhDs_Obsevations.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master–slave morality''' is a central theme of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works, in particular the first essay of ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''. Nietzsche argued that there were two fundamental types of [[morality]]: "master morality" and "slave morality". Master morality values pride and power, while slave morality values things like kindness, empathy, and sympathy. Master morality weighs actions on good or bad consequences (i. e., classical virtues and vices, [[consequentialism]]), unlike slave morality, which weighs actions on a scale of [[Good and evil|good or evil]] intentions (e. g., Christian virtues and vices, [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]]).

For Nietzsche, a particular morality is inseparable from the formation of a particular culture, meaning that a culture's language, codes and practices, narratives, and institutions are informed by the struggle between these two moral structures (see [[Value theory|valuation]]).

==Master morality==
Nietzsche defined master morality as the morality of the strong-willed. Nietzsche criticizes the view (which he identifies with contemporary British ideology) that good is everything that is helpful, and bad is everything that is harmful. He argues proponents of this view have forgotten the origins of its values and it is based merely on a non-critical acceptance of habit: what is useful has always been defined as good, therefore usefulness is goodness as a value. He continues explaining that in the prehistoric state "the value or non-value of an action was derived from its consequences"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=62}} but ultimately "[t]here are no moral phenomena at all, only moral interpretations of phenomena."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=96}} For strong-willed men, the "good" is the noble, strong, and powerful, while the "bad" is the weak, cowardly, timid, and petty. 

The essence of master morality is ''nobility''. Other qualities that are often valued in master morality are open-mindedness, courage, truthfulness, trust, and an accurate sense of one's self-worth. Master morality begins in the "noble man", with a spontaneous idea of the good; then the idea of bad develops as what is not good. "The noble type of man experiences ''itself'' as determining values; it does not need approval; it judges, "what is harmful to me is harmful in itself"; it knows itself to be that which first accords honour to things; it is ''value-creating''."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=39}} In this sense, the master morality is the full recognition that ''oneself'' is the measure of all moral truths.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Insofar as something is helpful to the strong-willed man, it is like what he values in himself; therefore, the strong-willed man values such things as good because they aid him in a life-long process of [[self-actualization]] through the [[will to power]].

==Slave morality==

According to Nietzsche, masters are creators of morality; slaves respond to master morality with their slave morality. Unlike master morality, which is sentiment, slave morality is based on [[ressentiment|re-sentiment]]—devaluing that which the master values and the slave does not have. As master morality originates in the strong, slave morality originates in the weak. Because slave morality is a reaction to oppression, it vilifies its oppressors. Slave morality is the inverse of master morality. As such, it is characterized by pessimism and cynicism. Slave morality is created in opposition to what master morality values as "good". 

Slave morality does not aim at exerting one's will by strength, but by careful subversion. It does not seek to transcend the masters, but to make them slaves as well. The essence of slave morality is ''utility'':{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=122}} The good is what is most useful for the whole community, not just the strong. Nietzsche saw this as a contradiction. Since the powerful are few in number, compared to the masses of the weak, the weak gain power by corrupting the strong into believing that the causes of slavery (viz., the [[will to power]]) are "evil", as are the qualities the weak originally could not choose because of their weakness. By saying humility is voluntary, slave morality avoids admitting that their humility was in the beginning forced upon them by a master. [[Biblical]] principles of humility, charity, and pity are the result of universalizing the plight of the slave onto all humankind, and thus enslaving the masters as well. "The ''democratic'' movement is the heir to [[Christianity]]"{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=125}}—the political manifestation of slave morality because of its obsession with freedom and equality.

{{quote|...the Jews achieved that miracle of inversion of values thanks to which life on earth has for a couple millennia acquired a new and dangerous fascination - their prophets fused "rich", "godless", "evil", "violent", "sensual" into one, and were the first to coin the word "world" as a term of infamy. It is this inversion of values (with which is involved the employment of the word for "poor" as a synonym for "holy" and "friend") that the significance of the Jewish people resides: With ''them'', there begins the ''slave revolt in morals''.{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=118}}}}

==Society==

This struggle between master and slave moralities recurs historically. According to Nietzsche, ancient Greek and Roman societies were grounded in master morality. The [[Homer]]ic hero is the strong-willed man, and the classical roots of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' exemplified Nietzsche's master morality. He calls the heroes "men of a noble culture",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=153}} giving a substantive example of master morality. Historically, master morality was defeated, as the slave morality of Judaism and Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire. 

The essential struggle between cultures has always been between the Roman (master, strong) and the Judean (slave, weak). Nietzsche condemns the triumph of slave morality in the West, saying that the democratic movement is the "''collective degeneration of man''".{{sfn|Nietzsche|1973|p=127}} He claimed that the nascent democratic movement of his time was essentially slavish and weak.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Weakness conquered strength, slave conquered master, re-sentiment conquered sentiment. This [[ressentiment]] Nietzsche calls "priestly vindictiveness",{{sfn|Nietzsche|1967|p=19}} which is based on the jealous weak seeking to enslave the strong, and thus erode the basis for power itself by pulling the powerful down. Such movements were, according to Nietzsche, inspired by "the most intelligent revenge" of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Genealogy of Morals: A Polemic.

Nietzsche did not necessarily believe that everyone should adopt master morality as the "be-all, end-all" behavior. He thought that the [[Transvaluation of values|revaluation of morals]] would correct the inconsistencies in both master and slave moralities. But he asserted that for the individual, master morality was preferable to slave morality. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] disagrees that Nietzsche actually preferred master morality to slave morality. He certainly gives slave morality a more thorough critique, but this is partly because he thought of slave morality as society's more imminent danger.{{citation needed|reason=Sentence is vaguely worded and lacks documentation.|date=October 2015}}

'''Material flow''' is the description of the transportation of raw materials, pre-fabricates, parts, components, integrated objects and final products as a flow of entities. The term applies mainly to advanced modeling of [[supply chain management]].

As industrial material flow can easily become very complex, several different specialized simulation tools have been developed for complex systems. Typical tools are:
* [[AnyLogic]]
* AutoMod for logistics systems
* [[Plant Simulation]] for production system

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9132">The '''moralistic fallacy''' is the [[informal fallacy]] of assuming that an aspect of nature which has socially unpleasant consequences cannot exist. Its typical form is "if ''X'' were true, then it would happen that ''Z''!", where ''Z'' is a morally, socially or politically undesirable thing. What should be moral is assumed ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' to also be naturally occurring. The moralistic fallacy is sometimes presented as the inverse of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. However, it could be seen as a variation of the very same naturalistic fallacy; the difference between them could be considered [[Pragmatics|pragmatical]], depending on the intentions of that who uses it: naturalistic fallacy if the user wants to justify existing social practices with the argument that they are natural; moralistic fallacy if the user wants to combat existing social practices with the argument of denying that they are natural.

==Examples==
[[Steven Pinker]] writes that "[t]he naturalistic fallacy is the idea that what is found in nature is good. It was the basis for [[social Darwinism]], the belief that helping the poor and sick would get in the way of evolution, which depends on the survival of the fittest. Today, biologists denounce the naturalistic fallacy because they want to describe the natural world honestly, without people deriving morals about how we ought to behave (as in: If birds and beasts engage in adultery, infanticide, cannibalism, it must be OK)." Pinker goes on to explain that "[t]he moralistic fallacy is that what is good is found in nature. It lies behind the bad science in nature-documentary voiceovers: lions are mercy-killers of the weak and sick, mice feel no pain when cats eat them, dung beetles recycle dung to benefit the ecosystem and so on. It also lies behind the romantic belief that humans cannot harbor desires to kill, rape, lie, or steal because that would be too depressing or reactionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Q&amp;A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate'|url = http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/|website = [[UPI]]|accessdate = December 5, 2015|date = October 30, 2002|last = Sailer|first = Steve|archivedate = December 5, 2015|dead-url = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151205074319/http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/10/30/QA-Steven-Pinker-of-Blank-Slate/26021035991232/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moralistic fallacy:'''
*''Warfare is destructive and tragic, and so it is not of human nature.''
*''Eating meat harms animals and the environment, and so no one has physiological use for it.''
*''Men and women ought to be given equal opportunities, and so women and men can do everything equally well.''
*''Unfaithfulness is immoral, and so it is unnatural to feel desire for others when in a monogamous relationship.''
*''The pill I am taking should have therapeutic effects on me, and so it does have therapeutic effects on me.'' (An instance of the [[Placebo|placebo effect]].)

'''Naturalistic fallacy:'''
*''Warfare must be allowed because human violence is instinctive.''
*''Veganism is foolish because humans have eaten meat for thousands of years.''
*''Men and women should not have the same roles in society because men have more muscle mass and women can give birth.''
*''Adultery is acceptable because people can naturally want more sexual partners.''

==Effects on science and society ==

Sometimes [[basic science|basic scientific]] findings or interpretations are rejected, or their discovery or development or acknowledgement is opposed or restricted, through assertions of potential misuse or harmfulness.

In the late 1970s, [[Bernard Davis (biologist)|Bernard Davis]], in response to growing political and public calls to restrict [[basic research]] (versus [[applied research]]), amid criticisms of dangerous knowledge (versus dangerous applications), applied the term ''moralistic fallacy'' toward its present use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The moralistic fallacy |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5652 |page=390 |year=1978 |pmid=11643452 |doi=10.1038/272390a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(The term was used as early as 1957 to at least some if differing import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moore EC |title=The Moralistic Fallacy |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=29–42 |year=1957 |jstor=2022356 |doi=10.2307/2022356}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

In [[natural science]], the moralistic fallacy can result in rejection or suppression of [[basic science]], whose goal is understanding the natural world, on account of its potential misuse in [[applied science]], whose goal is the development of technology or technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The scientist's world |journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev |year=2000 |pmid=10704471 |pmc=98983 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.64.1.1-12.2000 |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This blurs ''scientific assessment'', discussed in natural sciences (like [[physics]] or [[biology]]), versus ''significance assessment'', weighed in [[social sciences]] (like [[social psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]]), or in [[behavioral sciences]] (like [[psychology]]).

Davis asserted that in basic science, the descriptive, explanatory, and thus predictive ability of information is primary, not its origin or its applications, since knowledge cannot be ensured against misuse, and misuse cannot [[falsify]] knowledge.  Both misuse of scientific work and suppression of scientific knowledge can have undesired or even undesirable effects. In the early 20th century, the development of [[quantum physics]] made possible the [[atomic bomb]] in the mid 20th century.  Without quantum physics, however, much of the technology of [[communications]] and [[Medical imaging|imaging]] might have been impossible.

Scientific theories with abundant research support can be discarded in public debates, where general agreement is central but can be utterly false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kreutzberg GW |title=Scientists and the marketplace of opinions |journal=EMBO Rep |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=393–96 |year=2005 |pmid=15864285 |pmc=1299311 |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The obligation of basic scientists to inform the public, however, can be stymied by contrasting claims from others both rousing alarm and touting assurances of protecting the public.&lt;ref name=technology&gt;Davis BD (2000), section [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/1#SEC2 "Technology"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis had indicated that greater and clearer familiarization with the uses and limitations of science can more effectively prevent knowledge misuse or harm.&lt;ref name=limited&gt;Davis BD (2000), section [http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/64/1/1#SEC4 "Limited scope of science"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural science can help humans understand the natural world, but it cannot make policy, moral, or behavioral decisions.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;  Questions involving ''values''—what people should do—are more effectively addressed through discourse in social sciences, not by restriction of basic science.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;  Misunderstanding of the potential of science, and misplaced expectations, have resulted in moral and decisionmaking impediments, but suppressing science is unlikely to resolve these dilemmas.&lt;ref name=limited/&gt;

==Seville Statement on Violence==
The [[Seville Statement on Violence]] was adopted,  in [[Seville]], Spain, on 16 May 1986, by an international meeting of scientists convened by the Spanish National Commission for [[UNESCO]].  UNESCO adopted the statement, on 16 November 1989, at the twenty-fifth session of its General Conference.

'''Negative gearing''' is a form of [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] whereby an [[investor]] borrows money to acquire an income-producing [[investment]] and the gross income generated by the investment (at least in the short term) is less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including [[depreciation]] and [[interest]] charged on the loan (but excluding capital repayments). The investor may enter into a negatively geared investment expecting [[tax]] benefits or the [[capital gain]] on the investment, when the investment is ultimately disposed of, to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is [[Tax deduction|tax-deductible]] against the investor's other taxable income and if the [[capital gain]] on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment. 

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
Negative gearing is often discussed with regard to [[real estate]], where [[rental income]] is less than [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] interest costs, but may also apply to [[Share (finance)|shares]] whose [[dividend]] income falls short of interest costs on a [[margin (finance)|margin loan]]. The tax treatment may or may not be the same between the two.

Positive gearing occurs when one borrows to invest in an income-producing asset and the returns (income) from that asset exceed the cost of borrowing. From then on, the investor must pay tax on the rental income profit until the asset is sold, when point the investor must pay capital gains tax on any profit.

When the income generated covers the interest, it is simply a geared investment, which creates [[passive income]]. A negative gearing strategy makes a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] under any of the following circumstances:

*if the asset rises in value so that the capital gain is more than the sum of the ongoing losses over the life of the investment
*if the income stream rises to become greater than the cost of interest (the investment becomes positively geared)
*if the interest cost falls because of lower [[Interest rate|interest rates]] or paying down the principal of the loan (again, making the investment positively geared)

The investor must be able to fund any shortfall until the asset is sold or until the investment becomes positively geared (income &gt; interest). The different tax treatment of planned ongoing losses and possible future capital gains affects the investor's final return. In countries that tax capital gains at a lower rate than income, it is possible for an investor to make a loss overall before taxation but a small gain after taxpayer subsidies.

Some countries, including Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries, including the US, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the UK or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/eJTR/2005/4.html#Heading447 "Quarantining Interest Deductions for Negatively Geared Rental Property Investments" &amp;#91;2005&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as [[stamp duty|stamp duties]] and [[capital gains tax]] may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2006/pdf/rdp2006-12.pdf Housing and Housing Finance: The View from Australia and Beyond, RBA &amp;#91;2006&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A negatively-geared investment property will generally remain negatively geared for several years, when the [[Renting|rental]] income will have increased with [[inflation]] to the point that the investment is positively geared (the rental income is greater than the interest cost).

The tax treatment of negative gearing (also termed "rental loss offset against other income") varies. For example:
* the United States restricts the practice to lower/middle income taxpayers who are active in managing their rental investment.
* Canada limits the practice by ensuring the investment generated a positive return over its life.
* the United States also allows interest costs against the family home to be fully tax deductible.
* countries with lower tax rates have a lower benefit from negative gearing due to a lower top rate of tax or a higher threshold for a specific tax rate.

==Negative gearing by country==
===Australia===
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}{{See also|Taxation in Australia}}

[[Australia]] allows the application of property losses arising from negative gearing against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Negative gearing by property investors reduced personal income tax revenue in Australia by $600 million in the 2001/02 tax year, $3.9 billion in 2004/05 and $13.2 billion in 2010/11.

Negative gearing is a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], during which the Labor Party proposed restricting (but not eliminating) negative gearing and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/policycheck-negative-gearing-reform-58404|title=PolicyCheck: Negative gearing reform|last=Wright|first=Danika|date=3 May 2016|newspaper=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-far-more-than-everyday-australians-analysis-shows-20151113-gkyllz.html|title=Negative gearing benefits the rich far more than everyday Australians, analysis shows|last=Hutchens|first=Gareth|date=13 November 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Treasurer of Australia|Federal Treasurer]] [[Scott Morrison]], in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that shows that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/scott-morrison-says-claims-negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-are-a-complete-and-utter-myth-20160425-goetex.html|title=Scott Morrison says claims negative gearing benefits the rich are 'a complete and utter myth'|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=26 April 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The raw numbers do not show the extent to which different professional groups benefit.)

====History====
Traditionally, Australian taxpayers have been allowed to negatively gear their investment properties, in the strict sense of investing in property at an initial loss. Negative gearing was restricted by a prohibition on the transfer of contingent property income and the property losses could not offset income from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/1987/27.pdf Avoidance, Evasion and Reform: Who Dismantled and who's rebuilding the Australian Income Tax System]&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed this applied to losses as well as income, but this is unclear in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/ INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common method of bypassing the restrictions on property losses offsetting income from labour was to convert such income into another form through the use of partnerships and other legal mechanisms. As a result, this restriction may not have been significant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} A partnership, trust or similar legal mechaninsm allowed an individual, or individuals, to pool their incomes and losses, thus allowing them to offset property losses against other incomes. This option was not available to individuals who derived their income from wages. 

In 1983, the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Deputy Commissioner of Taxation briefly denied Victorian property investors the deduction for interest in excess of the rental income, so losses could not be transferred nor moved to a future tax year. That ruling was quickly over-ruled by the federal tax commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rami|first=Hanegbi|year=2002|title=Negative Gearing: Future Directions|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/17.html#fnB21|journal=[[Deakin Law Review]]|volume=|issue=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1985, under the [[Australian Labor Party]] [[Hawke government]], negative gearing rules were changed so that property losses were no longer quarantined and instead could offset wage income. Six months later, following the tax summit in July 1985, the Hawke government undid this change, once more quarantining negative gearing interest expenses on new transactions so that they could be claimed only against rental income, not other income. (Any excess loss could be carried forward to offset property income in later years.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; That ensured that at personal level and, more importantly, at a national level, property losses would not be subsidised by income from personal exertion. In applying the formula, all previous governments thereby isolated and consequently discouraged capital speculation being subsidised from the general income tax receipts pool.

In addition, a [[capital gains tax]] (CGT) was introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985. While a separate tax, it is often associated with negative gearing.

The Hawke government's reversion to the earlier system in which property losses could not offset income from labour was unpopular with property investors. These investors claimed this reversion had caused investment in rental accommodation to dry up and rents to rise substantially. This was unsupported by evidence other than localised increases in real rents in both [[Perth]] and [[Sydney]], which also had the lowest vacancy rates of all capital cities at the time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100|title=Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?|last=ABC Fact Check|first=|date=3 March 2016|newspaper=|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in July 1987, after lobbying by the property industry, the Federal Labor government with [[Paul Keating]] as its Treasurer, reversed its decision once more, allowing negative gearing losses to be applied against income from labour.

====Taxation====
Australian tax treatment of negative gearing is as follows:

* Interest on an investment loan for an income producing purpose is fully deductible if the income falls short of the interest payable. The shortfall can be deducted for tax purposes from income from other sources, such as the wage or salary income of the investor.
* Ongoing maintenance and small expenses are similarly fully deductible.
* Property fixtures and fittings are treated as plant, and a deduction for [[depreciation]] is allowed based on effective life. When they are later sold, the difference between actual proceeds and the written-down value becomes income or further deduction.
* Capital works (buildings or major additions, constructed after 1997 or certain other dates) attract a 2.5% per annum capital works deduction (or 4% in certain circumstances). The percentage is calculated on the initial cost (or an estimate thereof) and can be claimed until the cost of the works has been completely recovered. The investor's cost base for capital gains tax purposes is reduced by the amount claimed.
* On sale, or most other methods of transfer of ownership, capital gains tax is payable on the proceeds minus cost base (excluding items treated as plant above). A net capital gain is taxed as income, but if the asset was held for one year or more, the gain is first discounted by 50% for an individual, or a third for a superannuation fund. (The discount began in 1999, prior to which an indexing of costs and a stretching of marginal rates applied instead.)

The tax treatment of negative gearing and capital gains may benefit investors in a number of ways, including:
*Losses are deductible in the financial year they are incurred and provide nearly immediate benefit.
*Capital gains are taxed in the financial year when a transfer of ownership occurs (or other less common triggering event), which may be many years after the initial deductions.
*If it is held for more than twelve months, only 50% of the capital gain is taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Esther|title=CGT exemptions, rollovers and concessions|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/capital-gains-tax/cgt-exemptions,-rollovers-and-concessions/|website=Australian Taxation Office|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transfer of ownership may be deliberately timed to occur in a year in which the investor is subject to a lower marginal tax rate, reducing the applicable capital gains tax rate compared to the tax rate saved by the initial deductions.

However, in certain situations the tax rate applied to the capital gain may be higher than the rate of tax saving because of initial deductions such as for investors who have a low marginal tax rate while they make deductions but a high marginal rate in the year the capital gain is realised.

In contrast, the tax treatment of real estate by [[owner-occupier]]s differs from investment properties. Mortgage interest and upkeep expenses on a private property are not deductible, but any capital gain (or loss) made on disposal of a primary residence is tax-free. (Special rules apply on a change from private use to renting or vice versa and for what is considered a main residence.)

====Arguments for and against====
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The economic and social effects of negative gearing in Australia are a matter of ongoing debate. Those in favour of negative gearing argue:

* Negatively-geared investors support the private residential tenancy market, assisting those who cannot afford to buy, and reducing demand on government [[public housing]].
* Investor demand for property supports the building industry, creating [[employment]].
* Tax benefits encourage individuals to invest and save, especially to help them become self-sufficient in [[retirement]].
* Startup losses are accepted as deductions for business and should also be accepted for investors since investors will be taxed on the result.
* Interest expenses deductible by the investor are income for the lender so there is no loss of tax revenue.
* Negatively-geared properties are running at an actual loss to the investor. Even though the loss may be used to reduce tax, the investor is still in a net worse position compared to not owning the property. The investor is expecting to make a profit either when the net rental income grows over time and exceeds the interest cost, or on the capital gain when the property is sold, or both. After sale, the treatment of the capital gain income is favoured by the tax system since the only half of the capital gain is assessed as taxable income if the investment is held for at least 12 months (before 2000–2001, only the real value of the capital gain was taxed, which had a similar effect). From that perspective, distortions are generated by the 50% discount on capital gains income for income tax purposes, not negative gearing.

Opponents of negative gearing argue:

* It encourages over-investment in residential property, which is an economic distortion.
* Investors inflate the residential property market, making it less affordable for first home buyers or other owner-occupiers.
* In 2007, nine out of ten negatively geared properties in Australia were existing dwellings so the creation of rental supply comes almost entirely at the expense of displacing potential owner-occupiers. Thus, if negative gearing is to exist, it should be applied only to newly constructed properties.
* It encourages [[Speculation|speculators]] into the property market, such as in the [[Australian property bubble]] that began in the mid-1990s, partly the result of increased availability of credit that occurred following the entry of non-bank lenders into the Australian mortgage market.
* Tax deductions and overall benefits accrue to those who already have high incomes, which will make the rich investors even richer and the poorer population even poorer, possibly creating and prolonging a social divide between socio-economic classes.
* Tax deductions reduce government revenue by a significant amount each year, so non-investors are subsidising investors and the government is less able to provide other programs.
* Business expenses (including interest payments) should be deductible against current or future income from that business, not against other forms of current income. Even if the tax code did not allow negative gearing offsets, the cost of operating the rental property (including interest payments) will be deductible from future net rental income or will reduce the capital gains tax at the time of sale of the property.

====Effect on rent prices====
The view that the temporary removal of negative gearing between 1985 and 1987 caused rents to rise has been challenged by Chief Economist of the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] Saul Eslake, who has been quoted as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's true, according to Real Estate Institute data, that rents went up in Sydney and Perth. But the same data doesn't show any discernible increase in the other state capitals. I would say that, if negative gearing had been responsible for a surge in rents, then you should have observed it everywhere, not just two capitals. In fact, if you dig into other parts of the REI database, what you find is that vacancy rates were unusually low at that time before negative gearing was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s991144.htm|title=Sparks fly over housing industry comments|last=|first=|date=17 November 2003|newspaper=[[Lateline]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eslake is referring to changes in inflation-adjusted rents (i.e., when [[Consumer price index|CPI]] inflation is subtracted from the nominal rent increases). These are also known as real rent changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nominal rents nationally rose by over 25% during the two years that negative gearing was quarantined. They rose strongly in every Australian capital city, according to the official [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] CPI data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6401.0Mar%202013&lt;/ref&gt; However, as nominal changes include inflation, they provide a less clear picture of how rents changed in effect, and of how changes such as disallowing property losses to offset other types of income affect rent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, it is difficult to assess the impact no longer allowing such deductions had during those two years, given that these deductions had only been allowed for six months prior to their disallowance in July 1985.

An ABC Fact check report, posted on the 3rd of March 2016 and titled "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100 Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?]" provided the following, after inflation, rental cost changes, during the period negative gearing was abolished. (Rounded to whole numbers and listed by size of city). Sydney +2% to +4%, Melbourne +2% to 0%, Brisbane -3% to -4%, Perth 0% to +6% and Adelaide +1% to -3%. All values have the effects of inflation removed, which in 1986 was [http://www.in2013dollars.com/Australia-inflation-rate-in-1986 9.18%]. 

As a comparison with house pricing, the [http://www.econ.mq.edu.au/Econ_docs/research_papers2/2004_research_papers/Abelson_9_04.pdf medium house price] in Sydney rose from $98000, in 1985, to $120025, in 1986, or after inflation, by 12.18%. In Brisbane the medium house price moved from $61550 to $63000, in the same period, or an after inflation, a change of -6.25%. The medium unit price in Sydney moved from $70500 to $72300, in the same period. An after inflation change of -6.07%. In brisbane the after inflation change for units was -0.05%.

====Effect on housing affordability====

In 2003, the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] (RBA) stated in its submission to the [[Productivity Commission]] First Home Ownership Inquiry: &lt;blockquote&gt;there are no specific aspects of current tax arrangements designed to encourage investment in property relative to other investments in the Australian tax system. Nor is there any recent tax policy initiative we can point to that accounts for the rapid growth in geared property investment. But the fact is that when we observe the results, resources and finance are being disproportionately channelled into this area, and property promoters use tax effectiveness as an important selling point.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/housing-and-housing-finance/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home/pdf/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home.pdf|title=Productivity Commission Inquiry on First Home Ownership: Submission by Reserve Bank of Australia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;They went on to say that "the most sensible area to look for moderation of demand is among investors", and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the taxation treatment in Australia is more favourable to investors than is the case in other countries. In particular, the following areas appear worthy of further study by the Productivity Commission:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;i. ability to negatively gear an investment property when there is little prospect of the property being cash-flow positive for many years;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ii. the benefit that investors receive by virtue of the fact that when property depreciation allowances are "clawed back" through the capital gains tax, the rate of tax is lower than the rate that applied when depreciation was allowed in the first place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iii. the general treatment of property depreciation, including the ability to claim depreciation on loss-making investments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Investor Lending - new vs existing to Feb 2010.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Chart 2: Investor Lending – New construction vs Existing property. Source ABS, RBA]]

In 2008, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia echoed the findings of the 2004 Productivity Commission report. One recommendation to the enquiry suggested that negative gearing should be capped: "There should not be unlimited access. Millionaires and billionaires should not be able to access it, and you should not be able to access it on your 20th investment property. There should be limits to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/hsaf/report/index|title=A good house is hard to find: Housing affordability in Australia|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report from the Senate Economics References Committee argues that, while negative gearing has an influence on housing affordability, the primary issue is a mismatch between supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Affordable_housing_2013/Report|title=Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Economics References Committee|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A submission to this committee from the Department of Social Services stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;[while] demand for housing has increased significantly over the last 30 years, the supply of new dwellings has not responded, with average annual completions of new dwellings remaining around 150,000 since the mid-1980s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The effect of negative gearing on the supply side of dwelling construction is difficult to pin down. Commentary from Eslake and others has highlighted the preponderance of negatively-geared purchases in established suburbs where the probability of a lightly-taxed capital gain exists, challenging the idea that negative gearing leads to substantial amounts of new construction. Many economists{{Who|date=February 2017}} have commented extensively on the tax subsidy being made available to speculative buyers in competition against homebuyers, who have no such tax subsidy, leading to significant social dislocation.

Additionally, the tax subsidy feeding into higher home prices adds to the wealth of those taking advantage of negative gearing. The process that crowds out domestic home owners by pushing up the price of housing also makes the successful user of negative gearing more asset rich due to the increase in land value. This allows these people to borrow further funds against equity in the previously acquired properties, resulting in further acquisitions under tax subsidy. This process can raise prices and thereby make it harder for people who wish to buy a house as an owner-occupier.

===United Kingdom===
While allowing for negative gearing in its basic form, the United Kingdom does not allow the transfer of one type of income (or loss) to another type of income. This is due to its [[schedular system of taxation]]. In this type of taxation system, the tax paid is dependent on income source. Therefore, an individual who received an income from labour and from land would pay two separate tax rates for the two relevant income sources.

Between 1997 and 2007, the [[Tax Law Rewrite Project]] changed this system by simplifying the schedules. As with the previous system, people would not be allowed to transfer incomes (or losses).

A UK government online resource on renting out property in England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/renting-out-a-property/paying-tax Renting out your property (England and Wales)]&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how to offset losses. It states that losses can be offset against "future profits by carrying it forward to a later year" or against "profits from other properties (if you have them)".

===New Zealand===
New Zealand allows negative gearing and the transfer of losses to other income streams, with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://international.harcourts.net/negative-gearing-explained/ Harcourts - “Negative Gearing” Explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rental Income Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/individualincometax/ir264-guide-rental-income.html  IRD - Rental income IR264]&lt;/ref&gt; states a loss can only be deducted against other incomes if the rental income is at market rate.

The Opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] attempted to raise negative gearing in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], but after their failure to win government the issue reduced in significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2011/05/nz-moves-to-quarantine-negative-gearing/ NZ moves to quarantine negative gearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{See also|Taxation in Canada}}
In principle, Canada does not allow the transfer of income streams. However, the most current Canadian tax form indicates this can occur in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative_gearing.asp Investopedia - Negative Gearing]&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses", interest payments from an investment designed to generate an income can be deducted:&lt;blockquote&gt;Claim the following carrying charges and interest you paid to earn income from investments: [...] Most interest you pay on money you borrow for investment purposes, but generally only if you use it to try to earn investment income, including interest and dividends. However, if the only earnings your investment can produce are capital gains, you cannot claim the interest you paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns206-236/221/menu-eng.html CRA Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other sources indicate the deduction must be reasonable and that people should contact the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] for more information. The "Rental Income Includes Form T776"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4036/t4036-e.html#P558_52811|title=Rental Income 2016: Rental losses|last=|first=|date=|website=Canada Review Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; states people can deduce rental losses from other sources of income: "You have a rental loss if your rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. If you incur the expenses to earn income, you can deduct your rental loss against your other sources of income." However, there is a caveat: the rental loss must be reasonable. What is reasonable is not defined in the "Rental Income Includes Form T776" Guide.

Based on these sources, claiming rental losses against other incomes in a given year is allowed as long as a profit is made over the life of the investment, excluding the effects of capital gains.

It should be noted that Canada has a Federal and Provincial income tax, and the above only relates to Federal income tax.

===United States===
In principle, the US federal tax does not allow the transfer of income streams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc414.html IRS Topic 414 - Rental Income and Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, taxpayers can only deduct expenses of renting property from their rental income, as renting property out is usually considered a passive activity. However, if renters are considered to have actively participated in the activities, they can claim deductions from rental losses against their other "nonpassive income".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A definition of "active participation" is outlined in the "Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses" guide:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html#en_US_2015_publink1000219121 IRS Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and ''bona fide'' sense. Management decisions that may count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and other similar decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is possible deduct any loss against other incomes, depending on a range of factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxes.about.com/od/taxhelp/a/Schedule_E.htm Rental Income and Expenses - Tips for Schedule E]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan allows tax payers to offset rental losses against other income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=4188 Authorities challenge real estate loss deduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can claim losses against rental loss with minimal restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Real_estate_income.pdf Analysis of Income (use for real estable income)]&lt;/ref&gt; but if the property was owned through a partnership or trust there are restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=3882 The Japanese taxation of real estate income for individuals]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of additional rules, such as restricting claims of losses due to Bad Debt. Additional information can be found in the Japan Tax Site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/ The Japan tax Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Taxation in Germany|German tax system]] is complex, but within the bounds of standard federal income tax, Germany does not allow the transfer of income. Rental losses can only be offset against rental income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Germany/Taxes-and-Costs Rental income tax is high in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the Global Property Guide site, "Owners can deduct any expenses from the gross receipts, which were incurred to produce, maintain and safeguard that income."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany recognizes seven sources of income:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweizer.com.au/documents/P130277_028.pdf The German tax System]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Agriculture and forestry
# Trade and business
# Independent personal services
# Employment
# Capital investment
# Rents and royalties
# "other income", as specified and strictly limited by law to certain types of income such as income from private transactions and income of a recurring nature (e.g. pensions)

The income from each of these sources is calculated separately.

Rental income is taxed as income and is subject to the [[progressive tax]] rate. Interest on loans provided to finance real estate, expenses, and property-related cost (e.g., management fees, insurance) can be deducted from the taxable rental income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germany.alphare.net/pdf/German-Property-Tax-Overview.pdf German Tax Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In principle, the [[Taxation in the Netherlands|Dutch tax system]] does not allow the transfer of income. Most citizens calculate tax, separately, in 3 income groups:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-netherlandsguide-2015.pdf Taxation and Investment in Netherlands 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Box 1 income includes income from employment and income from the primary residence
# Box 2 income, which includes income from a substantial holding in a company, as well as gains from substantial shareholdings
# Box 3 deals with income from savings and investments

However, I am unable to identify a clear definition where rental income fits in these three categories in the government taxation laws. 

Dutch resident and non-resident companies and partnerships owning Dutch property are in principle allowed to deduct interest expenses on loans from banks or affiliated companies, and property-related costs from their taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwc.fr/assets/files/pdf/2013/07/Global_real_estate/2012_netherlands.pdf Real Estate Going Global Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''one-loop Feynman diagram''' is a [[connected component (graph theory)|connected]] [[Feynman diagram]] with only one [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] ([[unicyclic graph|unicyclic]]). Such a diagram can be obtained from a connected [[Feynman_diagram|tree diagram]] by taking two external lines of the same type and joining them together into an edge.

Diagrams with loops (in graph theory, these kinds of loops are called [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]], while the word [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] is an edge connecting a vertex with itself) correspond to the quantum corrections to the classical field theory. Because one-loop diagrams only contain one cycle, they express the next-to-classical contributions called the ''[[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] contributions''.

One-loop diagrams are usually computed as the [[integral]] over one independent momentum that can "run in the cycle". The [[Casimir effect]], [[Hawking radiation]] and [[Lamb shift]] are examples of phenomena whose existence can be implied using one-loop Feynman diagrams, especially the well-known "triangle diagram":

::[[Image:Triangle diagram.svg]]

The evaluation of one-loop Feynman diagrams usually leads to divergent expressions, which are either due to:

* zero-mass particles in the cycle of the diagram ([[infrared divergence]]) or 
* insufficient falloff of the integrand for high momenta ([[ultraviolet divergence]]).

Infrared divergences are usually dealt with by assigning the zero mass particles a small mass ''λ'', evaluating the corresponding expression and then taking the limit &lt;math&gt;\lambda \to 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Ultraviolet divergences are dealt with by [[renormalization]].

==Effective Action==

The one-loop corrections lead to the following [[effective action]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma[\phi]=S[\phi]+\frac{1}{2} \mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}{\left[\log {S^{(2)}[\phi]}\right]+\dots}&lt;/math&gt;

In the second leadership contest, Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister [[Scott Morrison]] by 45 votes to 40. Following the appointment of [[Scott Morrison]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] on 24 August by the Governor-General, Morrison re-appointed Peter Dutton to the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]], but relinquished his duties and responsibilities for Immigration and Border Protection, and appointed [[David Coleman (Australian politician)|David Coleman]] as [[Immigration Minister]].

==Early years==
Dutton was born in the northern [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Boondall]], the eldest of five children, with one brother and three sisters. His mother Ailsa Leitch worked in childcare and his father Bruce Dutton was a builder. Dutton finished high school at the Anglican [[St Paul's Anglican School, Bald Hills|St Paul's School, Bald Hills]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Dutton joined the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] in 1988. He became the policy vice-chair of the Bayside Young Liberals the following year and chair of the branch in 1990. At the [[Queensland state election, 1989|1989 Queensland state election]], Dutton ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate against [[Tom Burns (Australian politician)|Tom Burns]] in the safe [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] seat of [[Electoral district of Lytton|Lytton]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterdutton.com.au/MeetPeter/MaidenSpeech.aspx|title=Peter Dutton MP - Federal Member for Dickson &gt; Meet Peter &gt; Maiden Speech|last=Dickson|first=Peter Dutton MP - Federal Member for|website=www.peterdutton.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton graduated from the Queensland Police Academy in 1990. He was a [[Queensland Police]] officer for nine years, working in the Drug Squad in Brisbane in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterdutton.com.au/MeetPeter/AboutPeter.aspx|title=About Peter Dutton|work=PetterDutton.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/guide/dick/|title=Dickson|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|work=ABC Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in the Sex Offenders Squad and the [[National Crime Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://player.whooshkaa.com/shows/sky-news-the-bolt-report|title=Sky News - The Bolt Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Whooshkaa|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second job, he worked with his father in a building business.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999, Dutton left the police force to become a businessman, completing a [[Bachelor of Business]] at the [[Queensland University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=00AKI|title=The Hon Peter Dutton MP|publisher=[[Australian Parliament House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/to-some-hes-the-messiah-to-others-a-duplicitous-polly-20091006-glh1.html|title=To some he's the messiah, to others a duplicitous polly|author=Misha Schubert|date=7 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his father founded the business Dutton Holdings, which was registered in 2000; it operated under six different trading and business names.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abr.business.gov.au/|title=ABN Lookup|last=|first=|date=2014-11-01|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000815074306/http://abr.business.gov.au/|archive-date=2000-08-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company bought, renovated, and converted buildings into childcare centres, and in 2002 sold three childcare centres to the now defunct [[ABC Learning]].

==Howard Government (2001–07)==
Dutton was elected to the [[Division of Dickson]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]], defeating Labor's [[Cheryl Kernot]]. He was elevated to the ministry after the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] as [[Minister for Employment Participation (Australia)|Minister for Workforce Participation]], a position he held until January 2006. He was then appointed [[Assistant Treasurer of Australia|Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue]]. He successfully retained Dickson at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], which saw the government lose office. However, his margin was reduced to just 217 votes more than Labor's Fiona McNamara.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/dickson.htm|title=Profile of the electoral division of Dickson|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition (2007–13)==
Following the 2007 election, Dutton was promoted to [[Shadow Cabinet of Australia|shadow cabinet]] by the new Liberal leader [[Brendan Nelson]], as Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_6dec07-22sep08.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he chose not to be present in the chamber during the apology to the [[Stolen Generations]], which enjoyed bipartisan support.&lt;ref name="age" /&gt; He said "I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Morning Herald]], Dutton said he regretted boycotting the apology: "I underestimated the symbolic and cultural significance of it."&lt;ref
name=":2" /&gt;

In September 2008, Nelson was replaced as Liberal leader by [[Malcolm Turnbull]], who appointed Dutton as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing. He retained that position when [[Tony Abbott]] succeeded Turnbull as leader in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turnbull Shadow Ministry|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/~/media/05%20About%20Parliament/54%20Parliamentary%20Depts/544%20Parliamentary%20Library/Handbook/ShadowMinistry_22sep2008-23jan2009.pdf?la=en|website=Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Dutton released the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]]'s mental health policy. It received favourable reviews, with ''[[The Australian]]'' describing it as "the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence-based investment in mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cresswell|first1=Adam|title=Experts hail a policy 'game-changer'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/experts-hail-a-policy-game-changer/story-e6frg6n6-1225886440963|agency=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton retained his seat with a positive swing at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], despite an unfavourable redistribution. In the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], he announced a range of Coalition health policies, which were received favourably by industry groups. The [[Australian Medical Association]] said "the Coalition has delivered a strong package of practical, affordable health policies that would strengthen general practice",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition has been listening on health policy|url=https://ama.com.au/media/coalition-has-been-listening-health-policy|website=AMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Cancer Council Australia]] said that "Dutton’s promise to finalise the bowel cancer screening program by 2020 would save an additional 35,000 lives over the next 40 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Health Minister Peter Dutton set to save 35,000 Australian lives, says Cancer Council|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/news/media-releases/new-health-minister-peter-dutton-set-to-save-35000-australian-lives-says-cancer-council.html|website=Cancer Council Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted seat shift===
As the 2010 election approached, it looked like Dutton would lose to the Labor candidate due to a redistribution of division boundaries that had erased his majority and made Dickson notionally Labor. To safeguard himself, Dutton sought pre-selection for the merged [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] in the safe Liberal seat of [[Division of McPherson|McPherson]] on the Gold Coast (despite not living in or near McPherson).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/doorknocking-dutton-has-work-cut-out-20091020-h75g.html|title=Door-knocking Dutton has work cut out|last=Calligeros|first=Marissa|date=2009-10-22|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some constituents complained, "The abandoning of a seat by a sitting MP halfway through a parliamentary term to contest pre-selection in a seat over 100 kilometres to the south is not looked upon favourably."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crikey.com.au/2009/09/23/constituents-not-happy-about-dutton-dumping-dickson/|title=Constituents not happy about Dutton dumping Dickson|date=2009-09-23|website=Crikey|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton lost the McPherson pre-selection to [[Karen Andrews]], reportedly due to misgivings from former Nationals in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/fed2016/dickson/ Federal Election 2016: Dickson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He then asked the LNP to "deliver him a seat for which he doesn't have to fight other preselection candidates." Liberal MP [[Alex Somlyay]] (the chief Opposition whip of the time) said that Dutton's expectation of an uncontested preselection was "unusual."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dutton-seeks-seat-without-a-struggle-20091006-glh0.html|title=Dutton seeks seat without a struggle|last=Grattan|first=Michelle|date=2009-10-07|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the state executive didn't provide Dutton an unchallenged preselection, Dutton reluctantly returned to campaign for the seat of Dickson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-20/dutton-to-fight-for-dickson/1111186|title=Dutton to fight for Dickson|date=2009-10-20|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Dickson Decides|date=2009-10-23|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-10-23/dickson-decides/1115388|language=en-AU|accessdate=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinet minister (2013–present)==
{{see also|Abbott Government|Turnbull Government}}

=== Minister for Health ===

Dutton retained his seat at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]]. He was appointed to the [[Abbott Ministry|Ministry]] by then Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], and served as [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Minister for Sport]].

As Health Minister, Dutton announced the world-leading $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. As announced, the capital and any ongoing capital gains of the Medical Research Future Fund will be preserved in perpetuity.

Under Minister Dutton, projected funding in the health portfolio increased in the 2014-15 Budget to $66.9 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent from $62.2 billion in 2012-13, the final full year of the Labor Government. Projected expenditure on Medicare increased over 9.5 percent from $18.5 billion in 2012-13 under Labor to a projected $20.32 billion in 2014-15 under Dutton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2014-15|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2014-15/content/bp1/download/BP1_combined.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Budget 2013-14|url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2013-14/content/bp1/html/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for public hospital services increased by nearly 14 percent under Dutton in the 2014-15 Budget to a projected $15.12 billion compared to $13.28 billion in the last full year of the Labor Government in 2012-13.

In a 2015 poll by ''Australian Doctor'' magazine, Dutton was voted the worst health minister in the last 35 years by 46 percent of respondents. However, only 1,100 out of the magazine's 20,000 readers voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Dutton ranked as worst health minister in 35 years in poll of doctors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/12/peter-dutton-ranked-as-worst-health-minister-in-35-years-in-poll-of-doctors|website=Guardian Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2015, Dutton denied claims made by [[Australian Greens|Greens]] Senator [[Sarah Hanson-Young]] that she was spied on
during a visit to Nauru. At the same time he called into question her
credibility saying "she's written to me on some issues which are completely fanciful when you have a look at the facts and she's got a track record of making these things up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

revealed systemic child abuse and the rape of young women on Nauru
under his watch."&lt;ref name="hanson_young" /&gt; The spying claims

====Au pair cases====
In June 2015, an [[au pair]] who was detained at Brisbane Airport made a phone call and had her tourist visa reinstated.  In November, in a second case, Dutton granted a visa to another au pair, despite his department warning him that she was at risk of breaching her work conditions on her tourist visa.  Dutton indicated that he knew neither tourist.

==== Manus Island ====
On 15 April 2017 shots were fired by the Papua New Guinea defence force into the [[Manus Regional Processing Centre|Manus Island Detention Centre]]. Dutton responded saying "There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five year old boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like, within the local PNG community." "I think there was concern about why the boy was being led or for what purpose he was being led away back into the regional processing centre. So I think it's fair to say that the mood had elevated quite quickly. I think some of the local residents were quite angry about this particular incident and another alleged sexual assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On 31 October 2017, the Papuan Government closed down the Manus Island regional processing centre. However, 600 men residing in the processing centre refused to be moved to alternative accommodation in the town of [[Lorengau]] and staged a protest. Dutton defended the closure of the processing centre and asserted that the Papuan authorities had given notice of the camp's impending closure in May 2017. He also rejected [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Nick McKim]]'s report that there was no safe alternative accommodation available as false and claimed McKim was inciting trouble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fox |first1=Liam |title=Manus Island detention centre to permanently close today, 600 men refusing to leave |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-31/manus-island-detention-centre-to-close-at-5pm-today/9102768 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]] |date=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a prolonged standoff with Papuan security forces, the remaining men were evacuated, many forcibly, to new accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baxendale|first1=Rachel |title=Manus Island: last of asylum seekers removed from detention centre |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/pm-blames-kevin-rudd-for-manus-asylum-seeker-standoff/news-story/50c63065e489390b6f38bec8a8588294|accessdate=30 November 2017 |work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrangements have been made to resettle an unspecified number of the asylum seekers in the United States.

In mid November 2017, Dutton rejected an offer by the newly-elected [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] to resettle 150 asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre in New Zealand and warned that it would have repercussions for the two countries' bilateral relations. He also claimed that New Zealand's offer would encourage people smugglers. Dutton also criticised a New Zealand offer to provide $3 million for services for asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru as a "waste of money" that could be spend elsewhere, such as displaced people in Indonesia. In addition, Dutton criticised Australia's [[List of Australian Leaders of the Opposition|Opposition Leader]] [[Bill Shorten]]'s call for Australia to accept the New Zealand offer as an attempt to appease the [[Labor Left]] with "cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Belot |first1=Henry |title=Malcolm Turnbull not accepting Jacinda Ardern's offer to resettle asylum seekers in NZ 'at this time' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-05/turnbull-wont-accept-nz-offer-to-resettle-refugees-at-this-time/9120028 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carp |first1=Paul |last2=Roy |first2=Eleanor Ainge |title=New Zealand seeks deal with Australia to resettle Manus and Nauru refugees |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/new-zealand-and-png-could-do-deal-on-refugees-peter-dutton-says |accessdate=19 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2017, Dutton was appointed the [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]] with responsibilities of overseeing the [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]] which was established on the 20 December 2017 by Administrative Arrangement Order. The Home Affairs portfolio is a major re-arrangement of national security, law enforcement, emergency management, transport security, border control, and immigration functions.

==== Immigration from New Zealand ====
As both Immigration Minister and Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has defended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 that facilitates the denial or  cancellation of Australian visas for non-citizens on "character" grounds. This stringent "character test" also affects non-citizens who have lived most of their lives in Australia or who have families living in the country.&lt;ref name="AustLII"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|ma1958118|Migration Act 1958|501}} Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand nationals living in Australia were disproportionately affected by this "character test" with over 1,300 New Zealanders having been deported from Australia in the period between January 2015 and July 2018.&lt;ref name="ABC Don't call Australia Home"&gt;{{cite news |title=Don't Call Australia Home! |url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/don%E2%80%99t-call-australia-home!/10005152 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT NZ fury"&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Regan |first1=Slyvia Varnham |title=Why New Zealand Is Furious About Australia’s Deportation Policy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/world/asia/new-zealand-australia-deportations.html |accessdate=20 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Home Affairs Department]] report, 620 New Zealanders had their visas cancelled on character grounds in 2017 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Key visa cancellation statistics |url=https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about/reports-publications/research-statistics/statistics/key-cancellation-statistics |publisher=[[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]] |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Dutton's [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] introduced a special Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa to provide a pathway for New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa to acquire Australian citizenship. The visa requires NZ nationals to have held a Special Category Visa for five years and to maintain an annual income of $53,900. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders residing in Australia are eligible for the Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa. By February 2018, 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goethe-Snape |first1=Jackson |title=Government's immigration tweak sees overseas Asians out, integrated Kiwis in |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-13/how-dutton-slowed-immigration/9646602 |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Karp |first1=Paul |title=Visa pathway for New Zealanders resident in Australia will cut migrant intake |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/13/visa-pathway-for-new-zealanders-resident-in-australia-will-cut-migrant-intake |accessdate=21 July 2018 |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=13 April 1018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa was criticised by Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim as a stealth means of favouring "English-speaking, white and wealthy" migrants.&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2018" /&gt;

In early July 2018, Dutton ordered the deportation of controversial New Zealand [[Baptists|Baptist]] Pastor Logan Robertson, who had disrupted services at two mosques in [[Kuraby, Queensland|Kuraby]] and [[Darra, Queensland|Darra]] in Brisbane. Dutton approved Robertson's visa cancellation on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his visa, stating that "we have a wonderful tradition in our country of freedom of speech, but we're not going to tolerate people going to a place of worship and harassing others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crockford |first1=Toby |title=NZ pastor to be deported from Australia after public nuisance charges |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/105319868/nz-pastor-to-be-deported-from-australia-after-public-nuisance-charges |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Small |first1=Zane |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson shows no remorse for harassing 'sissy' Muslims |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/07/deported-nz-pastor-logan-robertson-shows-no-remorse-for-harassing-sissy-muslims.html |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Deported NZ pastor Logan Robertson doesn't regret harassing Muslims |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12097253 |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson had early drawn controversy in New Zealand for his [[homophobia|homophobic]] remarks and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bath |first1=Brooke |title=Auckland pastor goes on rant, says gay people should be shot |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/95818245/auckland-pastor-goes-on-antigay-rant?rm=m |accessdate=29 July 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 August 2018, Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] called a snap ballot of the leadership of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] following several days of feverish leadership speculation, of which Dutton was at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/20/04/28/peter-dutton-malcolm-turnbull-national-energy-guarantee-leadership-challenge|title=Peter Dutton leadership challenge speculation grows|date=20 August 2018|work=9 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton responded to Turnbull's ballot call by formally challenging for the leadership of the party and won 35 of 83 votes available, 7 short of a majority.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2018/aug/21/liberal-leadership-dutton-turnbull-energy|title=Dutton resigns after Turnbull survives Liberal leadership spill 48-35 – politics live|first1=Amy|last1=Remeikis|first2=Gareth|last2=Hutchens|first3=Katharine|last3=Murphy|first4=Christopher|last4=Knaus|date=21 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutton then resigned from the Ministry despite being offered by Turnbull to retain his position of [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]], and the media speculated that Dutton and his conservative backers in the party were likely to challenge for the leadership again in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.afr.com/news/peter-duttons-backers-vow-its-not-over-for-malcolm-turnbull-20180820-h148mw|title=Peter Dutton's backers vow it's not over for Malcolm Turnbull|work=Australian Financial Review|date=21 August 2018|first=Phil|last=Coorey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, Dutton called for another leadership spill, and [[Malcolm Turnbull]] tendered his resignation to the Governor-General. Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister [[Scott Morrison]] by 45 votes to 40.

Doubts surrounding Dutton's eligibility to be elected to parliament emerged on the grounds of [[Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia#(v) Pecuniary interest in an agreement with the Commonwealth|section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution]], as the [[family trust]] owned by Dutton operated a [[child care]] centre that received over $5.6 million in funding from the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]], in a situation similar to [[Re Day (No 2)|Bob Day's case]].  Although Dutton had received legal advice stating that he was not in breach of section 44(v), Labor had received contrary advice;  at Turnbull's request, the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] referred the matter to the [[Solicitor-General of Australia|Solicitor-General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-refers-dutton-s-eligibility-to-solicitor-general-20180822-p4zyy6.html |title=Government refers Dutton's eligibility to Solicitor-General |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=22 August 2018 |last1=Loussikian |first1=Kylar |last2=McCauley |first2=Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 23 August, Labor attempted to move a motion to refer Dutton's eligibility as an MP to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], in a similar manner to referrals made during [[2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis|the recent parliamentary citizenship crisis]].

In March 2017, 31 CEOs signed a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling for a free vote in the Australian Parliament on same-sex marriage. In response to this letter, on 16 March 2017, Dutton said that the CEOs "shouldn't shove their views down our throats" and that CEOs who were "doing the wrong thing" should "be publicly shamed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Dutton’s comments were heavily criticised as an attempt to censor
expressions of support for same-sex marriage, with some commenters
also accusing him of hypocrisy given his support for changing

===Negative gearing===
Dutton, who owns six properties with his wife, including a shopping centre in [[Townsville]], opposes any changes to [[negative gearing]] which currently offers tax breaks to property investors, stating that changing it would harm the economy.&lt;ref name="cadzow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cadzow|first1=Jane|title=Peter Dutton: 'I'm just not impacted by that hatred'|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/good-weekend/peter-dutton-im-just-not-impacted-by-that-hatred-20170516-gw5pt1.html|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutton married his first wife when he was 22 years of age; however, the marriage ended after a few months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Polymorphous perversity''' is a [[psychoanalytic]] concept proposing the ability to gain [[sexual gratification]] outside [[social norm|socially normative]] sexual behaviors. [[Sigmund Freud]] used this term to describe the sexual disposition from infancy to about age five.

==Freud's theory==

Freud theorized that some are born with unfocused pleasure / [[libido|libidinal]] drives, deriving pleasure from any part of the body. The objects and modes of pleasurable satisfaction are multifarious, directed at every object that might provide pleasure. Polymorphous perverse sexuality continues from infancy through about age five, progressing through three distinct developmental stages: the [[oral stage]], [[anal stage]], and [[Genital stage|genital / phallic stage]]. Only in subsequent developmental stages do children learn to constrain drives towards pleasure-satisfaction to socially accepted norms, culminating in adult [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] behavior focused on the genitals and reproduction or sublimations of the procreative drive.

Freud taught that during this stage of undifferentiated impulse for pleasure, [[incest]]uous and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] urges are normal. Lacking knowledge that certain modes of gratification are forbidden, the polymorphously perverse child seeks gratification wherever it occurs. In the earliest phase, the oral phase, the child forms a libidinal bond with the mother via the inherent pleasure gained from [[breastfeeding|suckling at the breast]].

For Freud, "perversion" is a non-judgmental term. He used it to designate behavior outside the socially acceptable norms of his era.

In the first edition of the ''Theory of Justice'', these goods are supposed to be desirable for every human being, just as they are also useful for them. Thus, primary goods are the common base for the unanimous selection of the justice principle in the [[original position]].

Primary goods are subdivided in two categories:
* ''Natural primary goods'': this category includes intelligence, imagination, health, speed etc. 
* ''Social primary goods'': this category includes rights (civil rights and political rights), liberties, income and wealth, the social bases of self-respect, etc.

In the second edition of the ''Theory of Justice'', primary goods are stated to be those that the citizens need as free people and as members of the society.

Priming works best when the two stimuli are in the same [[modality (semiotics)|modality]]. For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues. But priming also occurs between modalities,&lt;ref&gt;Several researchers, for example, have used cross-modal priming to investigate [[Syntax|syntactic]] deficits in individuals with damage to [[Broca's area]] of the brain.

==Types==
===Positive and negative priming===
The terms ''positive'' and ''negative'' priming refer to when priming affects the speed of processing. A positive prime speeds up processing, while a negative prime lowers the speed to slower than un-primed levels.&lt;ref name=neg&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1027/0044-3409.215.1.35 |title=Negative Priming as a Memory Phenomenon: A Review of 20 Years of Negative Priming Research | last1=Mayr | first1=Susanne | first2=Axel | last2=Buchner | year=2007 | journal=Journal of Psychology | pages=35–51 | volume=215 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive priming is caused by simply experiencing the stimulus,&lt;ref name=reis&gt;Reisberg, Daniel: ''Cognition: Exploring the Science of the Mind'' (2007), page 255, 517.&lt;/ref&gt; while negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then ignoring it.&lt;ref name=neg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.17.6.1136 | first1=Ewald| last1=Neumann| first2=Brett G.| last2=DeSchepper| title=Costs and Benefits of Target Activation and Distractor Inhibition in Selective Attention | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume=17 | issue=6| year=1991 | pages=1136–1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive priming effects happen even if the prime is not consciously seen.&lt;ref name=reis/&gt; The effects of positive and negative priming are visible in [[Event-related potential|event-related potential (ERP)]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Shlomo| last1=Bentin| first2=Gregory| last2=McCarthy| first3=Charles C.| last3=Wood | title=Event Related Potentials, Lexical Decision and Semantic Priming | journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume=60 | year=1985 | doi=10.1016/0013-4694(85)90008-2 | pages=343–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive priming is thought to be caused by spreading activation.&lt;ref name=reis/&gt; This means that the first stimulus activates parts of a particular representation or [[association (psychology)|association]] in [[memory]] just before carrying out an action or task. The representation is already partially activated when the second stimulus is encountered, so less additional activation is needed for one to become consciously aware of it.

Negative priming is more difficult to explain. Many models have been hypothesized, but currently the most widely accepted are the distractor inhibition and episodic retrieval models.&lt;ref name=neg/&gt; In the distractor inhibition model, the activation of ignored stimuli is inhibited by the brain.&lt;ref name=neg/&gt; The episodic retrieval model hypothesizes that ignored items are flagged 'do-not-respond' by the brain. Later, when the brain acts to retrieve this information, the tag causes a conflict. The time taken to resolve this conflict causes negative priming.&lt;ref name=neg/&gt; Although both models are still valid, recent scientific research has led scientists to lean away from the distractor inhibitor model.&lt;ref name=neg /&gt;

===Perceptual and conceptual priming===
The difference between ''perceptual'' and ''conceptual'' primes is whether items with a similar ''form'' or items with a similar ''meaning'' are primed, respectively.

Perceptual priming is based on the form of the stimulus and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. Perceptual priming is sensitive to the modality and exact format of the stimulus. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete word in a [[Indirect tests of memory#Word Stem Completion .28WSC.29 Task|word-stem completion test]]. The presentation of the visual prime does not have to be perfectly consistent with later testing presentations in order to work. Studies have shown that, for example, the absolute size of the stimuli can vary and still provide significant evidence of priming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Size Invariance in Visual Object Priming | last1=Biederman| first1=Irving | first2=Eric E. | last2=Cooper | year=1992| journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance| volume=18 | issue=1| doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.18.1.121 | pages=121–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual priming is based on the meaning of a stimulus and is enhanced by semantic tasks. For example, ''table'', will show priming effects on ''chair'', because ''table'' and ''chair'' belong to the same category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://svalz.stanford.edu/docs/paper14.pdf | title=Dissociation between two forms of conceptual priming in Alzheimer's disease | last1=Vaidya | first1=Chandan L. | first2=Laura A. | last2=Monti | first3=John D.E. | last3=Gabrieli | first4=Jared R. | last4=Tinklenburg | first5=Jerome A. | last5=Yesevage | year=1999 | journal=Neuropsychology | volume=13 | issue=4 | pmid=10527059 | pages=516–24 | doi=10.1037/0894-4105.13.4.516 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719200220/http://svalz.stanford.edu/docs/paper14.pdf | archivedate=July 19, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repetition===
''[[Repetition priming]]'', also called ''direct priming'', is a form of positive priming. When a stimulus is experienced, it is also primed. This means that later experiences of the stimulus will be processed more quickly by the brain.&lt;ref name=forster&gt;{{cite journal | title=Repetition Priming and Frequency Attenuation | last1=Forster | first1=Kenneth I. | first2=Chris | last2=Davis | year=1984| journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition| volume=10 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been found on words in the [[Indirect tests of memory#Lexical Decision Task .28LDT.29|lexical decision task]].

===Semantic===
[[File:Priming Web Diagram.svg|thumb|300px|This image shows a priming web built from different types of priming. The lines in this web indicate associations that an individual might have. If two words are more closely linked in the web, then they are more likely to be more quickly recognized when primed with a nearby word. The dotted lines indicate morpheme primes, or primes from words that sound similar to each other, while the straight lines indicate semantic primes or words that have meanings or associations that relate to each other.]]

In ''semantic priming'', the prime and the target are from the same semantic category and share features.&lt;ref&gt;Ludovic Ferrand and Boris New: Semantic and associative priming in the mental lexicon, found on: boris.new.googlepages.com/Semantic-final-2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the word ''dog'' is a semantic prime for ''wolf'', because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized to work because of [[spreading activation]] within associative networks.&lt;ref name=reis /&gt; When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even if they are not words, [[morpheme]]s can prime for complete words that include them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Morphology and Meaning in the English Mental Lexicon | last1=Marslen-Wilson | first1=William | first2=Lorraine Komisarjevsky | last2=Tyler | first3=Rachelle | last3=Waksler | year=1994 | journal=Psychological Review | volume=101 | issue=1 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.101.1.3 | pages=3–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.

In support with further detail, when an individual processes a word sometimes that word can be affected when the prior word is linked semantically. Previous studies have been conducted, focusing on priming effects having a rapid rise time and a hasty decay time. For example, an experiment by Donald Frost researched the decay time of semantic facilitation in lists and sentences. Three experiments were conducted and it was found that semantic relationships within words differs when words occur in sentences rather than lists. Thus, supporting the ongoing discourse model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028582900202|title=A discourse on semantic priming|last=Foss|first=Donald|date=April 23, 1982|access-date=|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(82)90020-2|volume=14|journal=Cognitive Psychology|pages=590–607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Associative priming===
In ''associative priming'', the target is a word that has a high probability of appearing with the prime, and is "associated" with it but not necessarily related in semantic features. ''dog'' is an associative prime for ''cat'', since the words are closely associated and frequently appear together (in phrases like "raining cats and dogs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Junko | last1=Matsukawa | first2=Joan Gay | last2=Snodgrass | first3=Glen M. | last3=Doniger | title=Conceptual versus perceptual priming in incomplete picture identification | journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research | volume=34 | issue=6 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar effect is known as ''context priming''. Context priming works by using a context to speed up processing for stimuli that are likely to occur in that context. A useful application of this effect is reading written text.&lt;ref name=stano&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Keith E. | last1=Stanovich | first2=Richard F. | last2=West | title=On Priming by a Sentence Context | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume=112 | issue=1 | year=1983 | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.112.1.1 | pmid=6221061 | pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grammar and vocabulary of the sentence provide contextual clues for words that will occur later in the sentence. These later words are processed more quickly than if they had been read alone, and the effect is greater for more difficult or uncommon words.&lt;ref name=stano /&gt;

===Response priming===
In the psychology of visual perception and motor control, the term ''[[response priming]]'' denotes a special form of visuomotor priming effect. The distinctive feature of response priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klotz | first1 = W. | last2 = Wolff | first2 = P. | year = 1995 | title = The effect of a masked stimulus on the response to the masking stimulus | url = | journal = Psychological Research | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 92–101 | doi=10.1007/bf00571098| pmid = 7480512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klotz | first1 = W. | last2 = Neumann | first2 = O. | year = 1999 | title = Motor activation without conscious discrimination in metacontrast masking | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 976–992 | doi=10.1037/0096-1523.25.4.976}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a speeded motor response is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response priming is its independence from visual awareness of the prime: For example, response priming effects can increase under conditions where visual awareness of the prime is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;Vorberg, D., Mattler, U., Heinecke, A., Schmidt, T., &amp; Schwarzbach, J. ''Different time courses for visual perception and action priming.'' In: ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'', 100, 2003, p. 6275-6280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, T., &amp; Vorberg, D. ''Criteria for unconscious cognition: Three types of dissociation.'' In: ''Perception &amp; Psychophysics'', 68, 2006, p. 489-504.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masked priming===
The masked priming paradigm has been widely used in the last two decades in order to investigate both [[orthography|orthographic]] and [[phonological]] activations during [[visual word recognition]].
The term "masked" refers to the fact that the prime word or pseudoword is masked by symbols such as ###### that can be presented in a forward manner (before the prime) or a backward manner (after the prime). These masks enable to diminish the visibility of the prime. The prime is usually presented less than 80 ms (but typically between 40-60 ms) in this paradigm.
In all, the short SOA (Stimuli Onset Asynchrony, i.e. the time delay between the onset of the mask and the prime) associated with the masking make the masked priming paradigm a good tool to investigate automatic and irrepressive activations during visual word recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.4.680 |title=Repetition priming and frequency attenuation in lexical decision | last1=Forster | first1=K.I. | last2=Davis | first2=C. | year=1984 | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | pages=680–698 | volume=10 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forster has argued that masked priming is a purer form of priming, as any conscious appreciation of the relationship between the prime and the target is effectively eliminated, and thus removes the subject's ability to use the prime strategically to make decisions. Results from numerous experiments show that certain forms of priming occur that are very difficult to occur with visible primes. One such example is form-priming, where the prime is similar to, but not identical to the target (e.g., ''nature''-''mature'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0749-596X(91)90008-8 |title=The density constraint on form-priming in the naming task: Interference effects from a masked prime | last1=Forster | first1=K.I. | last2=Davis | first2=C. | year=1984 | journal=Journal of Memory and Language | pages=1–25 | volume=30 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1080/14640748708401785 | title=Masked priming with graphemically related forms: Repetition or partial activation? | last1 = Forster | first1=K.I. | last2=Davis | first2=C. | last3=Schoknecht | first3=C. | last4=Carter | first4=R. | year=1987 | journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology A: Human Experimental Psychology | pages=211–251 | volume=39A | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindness priming===
[[Kindness priming (psychology)|Kindness priming]] is a specific form of priming that occurs when a subject experiences an act of kindness and subsequently experiences a lower threshold of activation when subsequently encountering positive stimuli. A unique feature of kindness priming is that it causes a temporarily increased resistance to negative stimuli in addition to the increased activation of positive associative networks.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;Carlson, Charlin, Norman, http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/55/2/211/, Positive mood and helping behavior: A test of six hypotheses, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring the effects of priming==
Priming effects can be found with many of the [[Indirect tests of memory|tests of implicit memory]]. Tests such as the [[Indirect tests of memory#Word Stem Completion .28WSC.29 Task|word-stem completion task]], and the [[Indirect tests of memory#Word Fragment Completion .28WFC.29|word fragment completion task]] measure [[#Perceptual_and_conceptual_priming|perceptual priming]]. In the word-stem completion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word "stems" consisting of 3 letters with the first word that comes to mind. A priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with novel words. The word fragment completion task is similar, but instead of being given the stem of a word, participants are given a word with some letters missing. The [[Indirect tests of memory#Lexical Decision Task .28LDT.29|lexical decision task]] can be used to demonstrate [[#Types Of Priming|conceptual priming]].&lt;ref name=MS71 /&gt;&lt;ref name="SM73"&gt;{{Citation|title=Attention and performance IV|year=1973|last1=Schvaneveldt|last2=Meyer|first1=R.W.|first2=D.E.|pages=395–409|chapter=Retrieval and comparison processes in semantic memory|place=New York|publisher=Academic Press|editor-last=Kornblum|editor-first=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this task, participants are asked to determine if a given string is a word or a nonword. Priming is demonstrated when participants are quicker to respond to words that have been primed with semantically-related words, e.g., faster to confirm "nurse" as a word when it is preceded by "doctor" than when it is preceded by "butter". Other evidence has been found through brain imaging and studies from brain injured patients. Another example of priming in healthcare research was studying if safety behaviors of nurses could be primed by structuring [[Change-of-shift report|change of shift report]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Groves|first=Patricia S.|last2=Bunch|first2=Jacinda L.|last3=Cram|first3=Ellen|last4=Farag|first4=Amany|last5=Manges|first5=Kirstin|last6=Perkhounkova|first6=Yelena|last7=Scott-Cawiezell|first7=Jill|date=October 19, 2016|title=Priming Patient Safety Through Nursing Handoff Communication: A Simulation Pilot Study|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0193945916673358|journal=Western Journal of Nursing Research|volume=39|issue=11|language=en|pages=0193945916673358|doi=10.1177/0193945916673358|issn=0193-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot [[simulation]] study found that there is early evidence to show that safety behaviors can be primed by including safety language into report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects of brain injuries==
===Amnesia===
[[Amnesia|Amnesic]] patients are described as those who have suffered damage to their [[Temporal lobe|medial temporal lobe]], resulting in the impairment of explicit recollection of everyday facts and events. Priming studies on amnesic patients have varying results, depending on both the type of priming test done, as well as the phrasing of the instructions.

Amnesic patients do as well on [[#Types Of Priming|''perceptual priming'']] tasks as healthy patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(85)90063-6 | last1=Cermak | first1=L.S. | last4=Wolbarst |first4=L.R. | last2=Talbot | first2=N. | last3=Chandler | first3=K. | title=The perceptual priming phenomenon in amnesia | journal=Neuropsychologia | volume=23 | pages=615–622 | year=1985 | pmid=4058707 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they show some difficulties completing [[#Types Of Priming|''conceptual priming'']] tasks, depending on the specific test. For example, they perform normally on category instance production tasks, but show impaired priming on any task that involves answering general knowledge questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shimamura | first1=A.P.| last2=Squire | first2=L.R. | title=Paired-associate learning and priming effects in amnesia: a neuropsychological approach | year=1984 | journal=J. Exp. Psychol. | volume=113 | pages=556–570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=T.A. | last1=Blaxton | year=1992 | title=Dissociations among memory measures in memory-impaired subjects: evidence for a processing account of memory | journal=Mem. Cogn. | volume=15 | pages=549–562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrasing of the instructions associated with the test has had a dramatic impact on an amnesic's ability to complete the task successfully. When performing a [[Indirect tests of memory#Word Stem Completion .28WSC.29 Task|word-stem completion]] test, patients were able to successfully complete the task when asked to complete the stem using the first word that came to mind, but when explicitly asked to recall a word to complete the stem that was on the study list, patients performed at below-average levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=P. | last1=Graf | first2=L.R. | last2=Squire | first3=G. | last3=Mandler | year=1984 | title=The information that amnesic patients do not forget | journal=J. Exp. Psychol. | volume=10 | pages=164–178 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.10.1.164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, studies from amnesic patients indicate that priming is controlled by a brain system separate from the medial temporal system that supports [[explicit memory]].

===Aphasia===
Perhaps the first use of semantic priming in neurological patients was with stroke patients with [[aphasia]]. In one study, patients with Wernicke's aphasia who were unable to make semantic judgments showed evidence of semantic priming, while patient with Broca's aphasia who were able to make semantic judgments showed less consistent priming than Wernicke's aphasics or normal controls (Milberg and Blumstein 1981).  This dissociation was extended to other linguistic categories such phonology and syntactic processing by Blumstein, Milberg and their colleagues.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Dementia===
Patients with [[Alzheimers|Alzheimer's disease (AD)]], the most common form of dementia, have been studied extensively as far as priming goes. Results are conflicting in some cases, but overall, AD patients show ''decreased'' priming effects on [[Indirect tests of memory#Word Stem Completion .28WSC.29 Task|word-stem completion]] and [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] tasks, while retaining normal performance on [[Indirect tests of memory#Lexical Decision Task .28LDT.29|lexical decision tasks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF01108841 | last1=Carlesimo | first1=G.A. | last2=Oscarberman | first2=M. | year=1992 | title=Memory deficits in Alzheimer's patients: a comprehensive review | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=119–169 | pmid=1300219}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results suggest that AD patients are impaired in any sort of priming task that requires semantic processing of the stimuli, while priming tasks that require visuoperceptual interpretation of stimuli are unaffected by Alzheimers.

Priming while improving performance decreases neural processing in the [[cerebral cortex]] of sensory stimuli with stimulus repetition. This has been found in single-cell recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = L | last2 = Miller | first2 = EK | last3 = Desimone | first3 = R. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 1993 | title = The representation of stimulus familiarity in anterior inferior temporal cortex | url = | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 69 | issue = 6| pages = 1918–29 | pmid = 8350131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) upon [[gamma wave]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 11919002 | year = 2002 | last1 = Gruber | first1 = T | last2 = Müller | first2 = MM | title = Effects of picture repetition on induced gamma band responses, evoked potentials, and phase synchrony in the human EEG | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–92 | journal = Brain Research.

This leads to a more selective activation of neurons representing objects in higher cognitive areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moldakarimov | first1 = S | last2 = Bazhenov | first2 = M | last3 = Sejnowski | first3 = TJ. |name-list-format=vanc| year = 2010 | title = Perceptual priming leads to reduction of gamma frequency oscillations | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 12| pages = 5640–5645 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0907525107 | pmid = 20212165 | pmc = 2851786 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.5640M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual priming===
Conceptual priming has been linked to reduced blood flow in the left [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J.B. | last1=Demb | first2=J.E. | last2=Desmond | first3=J.D.E. | last3=Gabrieli | title=Semantic encoding and retrieval in the left inferior prefrontal cortex: a functional MRI study of task difficulty and process specificity | year=1995 | journal=J. Neurosci. | volume=15 | pages=5870–5878 | pmid=7666172 | last4=Vaidya | first4=CJ | last5=Glover | first5=GH | last6=Gabrieli | first6=JD | issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left prefrontal cortex is believed to be involved in the semantic processing of words, among other tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.3.906 | first1=J.D.E. | last1=Gabrieli | first2=R.A. | last2=Poldrack | first3=J.E. | last3=Desmond | year=1998 | title=The role of left prefrontal cortex in language and memory | journal=PNAS | volume=95 | pages=906–913 | pmid=9448258 | issue=3 | pmc=33815| bibcode=1998PNAS...95..906G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that perceptual priming is controlled by the extrastriate cortex while conceptual priming is controlled by the left prefrontal cortex is undoubtedly an oversimplified view of the process, and current work is focused on elucidating the brain regions involved in priming in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.casra.ch/teaching/2002/cns/doc/Dehaene_et_al_1998.pdf | pmid = 9783584 | year = 1998 | last1 = Dehaene | first1 = S | last2 = Naccache | first2 = L | last3 = Le Clec'h | first3 = G | last4 = Koechlin | first4 = E | last5 = Mueller | first5 = M | last6 = Dehaene-Lambertz | first6 = G | last7 = Van De Moortele | first7 = PF | last8 = Le Bihan | first8 = D | title = Imaging unconscious semantic priming | volume = 395 | issue = 6702 | pages = 597–600 | doi = 10.1038/26967 | journal = Nature | bibcode = 1998Natur.395..597D | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706222851/http://www.casra.ch/teaching/2002/cns/doc/Dehaene_et_al_1998.pdf | archivedate = July 6, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In daily life==
Priming is thought to play a large part in the systems of stereotyping.
&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite journal | first1=John A. | last1=Bargh | first2=Mark | last2=Chen | last3=Burrows | first3=Laura| year=1996 | title=Automaticity of Social Behavior: Direct Effects of Trait Construct and Stereotype Activation on Action | journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume=71 | issue=2 | pmid=8765481 | pages=230–44 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because attention to a response increases the frequency of that response, even if the attended response is undesired.
&lt;ref name=auto /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(see [[Ironic process theory]] for a more in-depth discussion of this phenomenon)&lt;/ref&gt; The attention given to these response or behaviours primes them for later activation.&lt;ref name=auto /&gt; Another way to explain this process is [[automaticity]]. If trait descriptions, for instance "stupid" or "friendly", have been frequently or recently used, these descriptions can be automatically used to interpret someone's behavior. An individual is unaware of this, and this may lead to behavior that may not agree with their personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bargh | first1=J.A. | last2=Williams | first2=E.L. | title=The Automaticity of Social Life| year=2006 | journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume=15| issue= 1 | pages=1–4 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00395.x| pmid=18568084 | pmc=2435044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can occur even if the subject is not conscious of the priming stimulus.&lt;ref name=auto /&gt; An example of this was done by [[John Bargh|Bargh]] et al. in 1996. Subjects were implicitly primed with words related to the stereotype of elderly people (example: Florida, forgetful, wrinkle). While the words did not explicitly mention speed or slowness, those who were primed with these words walked more slowly upon exiting the testing booth than those who were primed with neutral stimuli.&lt;ref name=auto /&gt; Similar effects were found with rude and polite stimuli: those primed with rude words were more likely to interrupt an investigator than those primed with neutral words, and those primed with polite words were the least likely to interrupt.&lt;ref name=auto /&gt; A [[Yale university|Yale]] study showed that something as simple as holding a hot or cold beverage before an interview could result in pleasant or negative opinion of the interviewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Williams | first1=Lawrence | last2=Bargh | first2=John | title=Experiencing physical warmth promotes psychological warmth| year=2008 | journal= Science | volume=322| issue= 5901| pages=606–607 | doi=10.1126/science.1162548| bibcode=2008Sci...322..606W }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been a serious lack of replication (see below).

These findings have been extended to therapeutic interventions. For example, Cox et al. (2012) suggest that presented with a depressed patient who "self-stereotypes herself as incompetent, a therapist can find ways to prime her with specific situations in which she had been competent in the past... Making memories of her competence more salient should reduce her self-stereotype of incompetence."&lt;ref

The replicability and interpretation of goal-priming findings has become controversial.&lt;ref name="Bower2012"&gt;B. Bower. (2012).

Priming is often considered to play a part in the success of [[sensory branding]] of products and connected to ideas like [[crossmodal correspondencies]] and [[sensation transference]]. Known effects are e.g. consumers perceiving lemonade suddenly as sweeter when the logo of the drink is more saturated towards yellow.&lt;ref name="Sensory Marketing Aspects"&gt;Peter Lintelle, [http://vik.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/07/0256090916652045.full.pdf Sensory Marketing Aspects (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention relational aggression has received has been augmented by the help of popular media, including movies like ''[[Mean Girls]]'' and books like ''[[Odd Girl Out (novel)|Odd Girl Out]]'' by R. Simmons (2003), [[Nesthäkchen and the World War]] by [[Else Ury]] (1916), and ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'' by R. Wiseman (2003). Relational aggression can have various lifelong [[Relational aggression#Consequences of victimization|consequences]]. Relational aggression has been primarily observed and studied among girls, following pioneering research by psychologist [[Nicki R. Crick]].&lt;ref name="Underwood" /&gt;

== Overview ==

A person's [[Adolescence#Peers|peers]] become increasingly significant in adolescence and are especially important for adolescents' healthy psychological development. Peers provide many new behavioral models and feedback that are essential for successful identity formation and for the development of one's sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. B., Clasen, D. R., &amp; Eicher, S. A. (1986). An adolescent's peers also have a large impact on peer pressure, peer conformity, dispositions, and self-reported behavior. ''Developmental Psychology'', 22(4), 521-530. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.22.4.521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B. (2004) Adolescents' relationships with peers. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions with peers encourage positive practice of autonomy and independent decision-making skills.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, J. &amp; Holmbeck, G. (1986) Attachment and autonomy during adolescence. In G. Whitehurst (Ed.), ''Annals of child development''. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt; They are also essential for healthy [[Adolescence#Romance and sexual activity|sexual development]] including the development of the capacity for intimate friendships and learning appropriate sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, H. S. (1953a) ''The interpersonal theory of psychiatry''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; Peer relationships are also very important for determining how much adolescents value school, how much effort they put into it, and how well they perform in class.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, J. (1983b) The influence of friends on achievement and affective outcomes. In J. Epstein &amp; N. Karweit (Eds.), ''Friends in school''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, A.M. (2001) The peer group as a context for the development of young adolescent motivation and achievement. ''Child Development, 72''(4), 1135-1150&lt;/ref&gt;
However, quite frequently adolescents take part in peer relationships that are harmful for their psychological development. Adolescents tend to form various [[clique]]s and belong to different [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowds]] based on their activity interests, music and clothing preferences, as well as their cultural or ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., &amp; Mounts, N. (1989, April). Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; Such groups differ in their sociometric or popularity status, which often create unhealthy, aggression-victimization based dynamics between groups. Different forms of aggression can also be used to control dynamics and sociometric status within a group. Sometimes aggression is directed to an individual rather than to any apparent social group. Primary reasons for victimization include looks and speech; adolescents are also frequently bullied because of a disability, particular ethnicity, or religion.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007"&gt;Klomek, A.

=== Definition ===

Relational aggression is defined as a type of aggression that is "intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships".&lt;ref name="Sternberg 2001"&gt;{{Cite book|page=100|title= Study Guide for Use with Adolescence|last1= Steinberg | authorlink = Laurence Steinberg |first1= Laurence D.|last2= Reyome |first2= Nancy Dodge|last3= Bjornsen |first3= Christopher A.|isbn=9780072414615|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWXtbGYpAu4C|date=2001|publisher= McGraw-Hill Higher Education |quote=relational aggression&amp;nbsp;– intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relational aggression, according to Daniel Olweus&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991"&gt;Olweus, D. (1991). Bully/victim problems among schoolchildren: Basic facts and effects of a school based intervention program. In D. J. Pepler &amp; K. H. Rubin (Eds.), ''The development and treatment of childhood aggression'' (pp. 441-448). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of [[bullying]]. Bullying in general, is defined as physically or psychologically violent re-occurring and not provoked acts, where the bully and victim have unequal physical strength or/and psychological power.&lt;ref&gt;Olweus, D. (1999). Sweden. In P. K. Smith, Y. Morita, J. Junger-Tas, D. Olweus, R. Catalano, &amp; P.Slee (Eds.), The nature of school bullying: A cross-national perspective (pp. 7-27). New York:Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These key conditions apply to all types of bullying: [[Verbal abuse|verbal]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], relational.&lt;ref name="Olweus 1991" /&gt;

== Types ==
Relational aggression may be either covert or direct, and is distinct from other forms of indirect aggression.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."&gt;
{{Cite journal |first1=Diana|last1=Murray-Close |first2= Jamie M. |last2= Ostrov |first3= David A. |last3= Nelson |first4= Nicki R. |last4= Crick |first5= Emil F. |last5= Coccaro |title= Proactive, reactive, and romantic relational aggression in adulthood: Measurement, predictive validity, gender differences, and association with Intermittent Explosive Disorder |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |date=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.09.005|pmc=2849926 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be proactive (planned and goal-oriented) or reactive (in response to perceived threats, hostility, or anger), and it can be, for instance, peer-directed or romantic.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;
Several studies have indicated substantive differences between proactive and reactive relational aggression. Reactive aggression is associated with a tendency to assume that others' intentions are hostile ([[hostile attribution bias]]).&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt;

Most studies of relational aggression have involved children or adolescents; the study of relational aggression in adults presents problems.&lt;ref name="Murray-Close et al."/&gt; Relational aggression is a common aspect of [[workplace bullying]], and is a characteristic behaviour of [[Psychopathy in the workplace|psychopaths in the workplace]], so it is commonplace amongst adults as well as children.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Manifestations ==
Manifestations of relational aggression include:&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008"&gt;[[Laurence Steinberg|Steinberg, L.]] (2008). Adolescence, 8th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excluding others from social activities;
* Damaging victim's reputations with others by spreading rumors and [[gossip]]ing about the victim, or [[humiliating]] him/her in front of others;
* Withdrawing attention and friendship.

[[Psychological manipulation]] and [[coercion]] can also be considered as a type of relational aggression.

Most recent research has been focusing on [[cyber-bullying]], which is a relatively new yet increasingly popular way of engaging in both verbal and relational aggression due to growing importance of various communication and technology devices in modern societies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberbullying.org/&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that internet meanness is more common among girls than boys.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==

Many studies in the U.S. and Europe show that at least 30% of students report having been bullied in one or another way.{{Citation needed|reason=What studies?|date=August 2013}} Some studies indicate even higher percentages of victimization.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt; Bullying in schools happens in all forms and at various ages, although peer bullying has the highest prevalence in 6th-8th grades.&lt;ref&gt;Jankauskiene, R., Kardelis, K., Sukys, S., &amp; Kardeliene, L. (2008). Associations between school bullying and psychosocial factors. Social Behavior and Personality, 36(2), 145-162&lt;/ref&gt; The most common forms of bullying are verbal with relational, or various forms of ostracism, coming in second.&lt;ref&gt;Valeckiene, D. (2005). Priekabiavimo kaip vienos dazniausiai naudojamos agresijos formos mokykloje raiSkos analiz (The analysis of bullying as one of the most prevalent form of aggression at schools). Sveikatos ir socialiniu mokslu taikomieji tyrimai: sandura ir saveika, 1, 49-65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===

Although it can be used by both genders, relational aggression is more commonly associated with girls.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001"&gt;Nansel, Tonja R., et al. "Bullying behaviors among US youth: Prevalence and association with psychosocial adjustment." JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association, v. 285 issue 16, 2001, p. 2094-2100&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of a study by Rivers and Smith&lt;ref&gt;Rivers I, Smith PK. Types of bullying behaviour and their correlates. Aggressive Behav. 1994;20:359-368.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that while verbal aggression occurs with similar frequency in both sexes, direct [[Physical abuse|physical aggression]] is more common among boys and indirect aggression is more common among girls. In another study by Baldry&lt;ref&gt;Baldry AC. Bullying among Italian middle school students. Sch Psychol Int. 1998;19:361-374.&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that boys are more likely to engage in bullying behaviors such as threats, physical harm, rejection, and name-calling, while girls are most likely to use name-calling, teasing, rumors, rejection, and taking personal belongings. Based on these findings, girls do seem to use relational aggression more than boys.

In addition, recent international research shows that both genders tend to use relational aggression, but girls are more aware and distressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;French, D. C., Jansen, E. A., &amp; Pidada, S. (2002). United States and Indonesian children's and adolescents' reports of relational aggression by disliked peers. Child Development, 73(4), 1143-1150. {{doi|10.1111/1467-8624.00463}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galen, B. R., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1997).

A., &amp; Underwood, M. K. (1999). Gender differences in young adolescents' experiences of peer victimization: Social and physical aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 45(2), 242-266.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study by Horn&lt;ref&gt;Horn, S.S.(2003). Adolescents' reasoning about exclusion from social groups. ''Developmental psychology, 39''(1), 71-84.&lt;/ref&gt; found that girls are more likely to say that it is morally wrong to exclude someone based on their crowd membership.

Some research shows that there are certain implications when boys and girls engage in gender-atypical aggression, as girls who are more physically aggressive or boys who are highly relationally aggressive are more maladjusted than their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Nicki R. "Engagement in gender normative versus nonnormative forms of aggression: Links to social–psychological adjustment." Developmental Psychology, v. 33 issue 4, 1997, p. 610-617.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociometric status ==

[[Sociometric status]], commonly referred as [[popularity]], is one of the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, A., Bukowski, W. M., Hymel, S., &amp; Sippola, L. K. (2000). Coping with daily hassles in the peer group during early adolescence: Variations as a function of peer experience. Journal of Research on Adolescence, 10(2), 211-243. {{doi|10.1207/SJRA1002_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukowski, W. M., Sippola, L. K., &amp; Newcomb, A. F. (2000). Variations in patterns of attraction of same- and other-sex peers during early adolescence. Developmental Psychology, 36(2), 147-154. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodkin et al. (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Rodkin, P. C., Farmer, T. W., Pearl, R., &amp; Van Acker, R. (2000). Heterogeneity of popular boys: Antisocial and prosocial configurations. Developmental Psychology, 36(1), 14-24. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.36.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, describes two types of popular boys: "model" boys, who are "physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive."&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Second type is described as "tough" and such adolescents are "aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.".&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use instrumental aggression and not reactive aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Little, T. D., Brauner, J., Jones, S. M., Nock, M. K., &amp; Hawley, P. H. (2003). Rethinking aggression: A typological examination of the functions of aggression. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 343-369. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prinstein, M. J., &amp; Cillessen, A. H. N. (2003). Forms and functions of adolescent peer aggression associated with high levels of peer status. Merrill-Palmer Quarterly: Journal of Developmental Psychology, 49(3), 310-342. {{doi|10.1353/mpq.2003.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental aggression is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt;
Relational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Ojala, K., &amp; Nesdale, D. (2004). Bullying and social identity: The effects of group norms and distinctiveness threat on attitudes towards bullying. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 22(1), 19-35.&lt;/ref&gt; found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying.
Using relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status.&lt;ref&gt;Merten, D.(1997). The meaning of meanness: Popularity, competition, and conflict among junior high school girls. ''Sociology of Education, 70,''175-191&lt;/ref&gt;
Amanda Rose (2004)&lt;ref name="Rose 2004"&gt;Rose, A. J., Swenson, L. P., &amp; Waller, E. M. (2004). Overt and Relational Aggression and Perceived Popularity: Developmental Differences in Concurrent and Prospective Relations. Developmental Psychology, 40(3), 378-387. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.40.3.378}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being "successful" at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to "read" people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc.&lt;ref name="Steinberg 2008" /&gt; The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.

== Different participation roles ==

Research shows that there are three types of rejected or [[unpopularity|unpopular]] adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Wargo, J. B. (1995). Predicting the longitudinal course associated with aggressive-rejected, aggressive (nonrejected), and rejected (nonaggressive) status.

Developmental Psychology, 28(2), 231-241. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.231}}&lt;/ref&gt; First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who are more likely to be victims; third- aggressive- withdrawn- type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also very shy and nervous about initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully-victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer and/or assistant, and outsiders.

=== Victims ===

Victims or the unpopular withdrawn children are excessively anxious, lack social skills needed to initiate new contacts or break into a group activity.&lt;ref name="Rubin 1990"&gt;Rubin, K., LeMare, L., &amp; Lollis, S. (1990). Social withdrawal in childhood: Developmental pathways to peer rejection. In S. Asher &amp; J. Coie (Eds.), ''Peer rejection in childhood,'' pp. 217-249.

Stability and change of behavior in connection with bullying in schools. Aggressive Behav. 1998;24:205-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common underlying reasons for bullying include low socioeconomic status, disability, and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, L. J., Wolke, D., Page, A. S., Horwood, J. P., &amp; the ALSPAC Study Team (2006). Obesity and bullying: Different effects for boys and girls.

Associations between overweight and obesity with bullying behaviors in school-aged children. Pediatrics, 113, 1187-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singer, E. (2005). The strategies adopted by Dutch children with dyslexia to maintain their self-esteem when teased at school. Journal of Learning Disabilities, 38, 411-423.&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows that in comparison with other adolescents victims often use worse problem solving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, T. (2009) Bullying and victimisation in school children: the role of social identity, problem-solving style, and family and school context. Social Psychology of Education, 12(1), 63 - 76.&lt;/ref&gt; They often score less than their bullies and defenders in the tests of moral competence and [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Gini 2011"&gt;Gini, G., Pozzoli, T., &amp; Hauser, M. (2011). Bullies have enhanced moral competence to judge relative to victims, but lack moral compassion. Personality and Individual Differences, 50(5), 603-608.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral competence refers to the ability to carefully consider both the consequences and prior beliefs in determining how morally right or wrong one's actions are. Victims seemed to focus primarily on the outcomes and not being as good in integrating the moral beliefs. They have difficulties in social skills, and social problem solving, as well as emotional regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Champion, K., Vernberg, E., &amp; Shipman, K. (2003). Nonbullying victims of bullies: Aggression, social skills, and friendship characteristics. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24(5), 535-551.&lt;/ref&gt; And because of their lack of social competence, victims score low on peer acceptance and popularity.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996"&gt;Salmivalli, C., Lagerspetz, K., Bjorkqvist, K., Osterman, K., &amp; et al. (1996). Bullying as a group process: Participant roles and their relations to social status within the group. Aggressive Behavior, 22(1), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994"&gt;Boulton, M. J., &amp; Smith, P. K. (1994). Bully/victim problems in middle-school children: Stability, self-perceived competence, peer perceptions and peer acceptance. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 12(3), 315-329.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are often overly sensitive to being rejected, which might originate in their relationships with parents.&lt;ref&gt;Downey, G., Lebolt, A., Rincon, C., &amp; Freitas, A. L. (1998). Rejection sensitivity and children's interpersonal difficulties. Child Development, 69(4), 1074-1091. {{doi|10.2307/1132363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bullies ===

Bullies, despite being quite morally competent, tend to engage in morally wrong behaviors because of several reasons, including a lack of moral compassion.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; In general, bullies seem to engage in a kind of cold cognition and have a good theory of mind. They also have an average to good social intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; These skills seem to be especially important in order to use relational aggression in an instrumental manner—for achieving specific social goals.
As mentioned previously, male and female bullies usually score differently on sociometric measures. Male bullies often fall in the socially rejected category&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulton 1994" /&gt; while female bullies tend to fall in the controversial category. They can be popular yet not liked.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Hostile attributional bias ====

Many unpopular aggressive kids seem to engage in hostile attributional bias when analyzing the actions of others: they are more likely to interpret other children's behavior as hostile while it is not,&lt;ref&gt;Crick, N. R., &amp; Dodge, K. A. (1994). A review and reformulation of social information-processing mechanisms in children's social adjustment. Psychological Bulletin, 115(1), 74-101. {{doi|10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, K. A., &amp; Coie, J. D. (1987). Social-information-processing factors in reactive and proactive aggression in children's peer groups. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53(6), 1146-1158. {{doi|10.1037/0022-3514.53.6.1146}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can cause the perpetuation of their aggressive behaviors.

=== Bully-victims ===

Bully- victims are people who have both experienced aggression directed towards them and have themselves engaged in [[bullying]]. They often choose to be [[Relational aggression#Bystanders|bully assistants or reinforcers]].&lt;ref name="Oh 2009"&gt;Oh, I., &amp; Hazler, R. J. (2009). Contributions of personal and situational factors to bystanders' reactions to school bullying. School Psychology International, 30(3), 291-310.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing others victimized can serve as a buffer against some psychological problems, for which these people are at risk (see  [[#Consequences of victimization|Consequences of victimization]] below). In comparison to all other groups, bully-victims are the worst off regarding their psychological adjustment and problems. They are least liked among the peers.&lt;ref name="Nansel 2001" /&gt;

=== Bystanders ===

Although early research has mostly focused on victims and bullies, currently more and more attention has been given to the roles of other students, or bystanders: bully-reinforcer's and assistants, victim-defenders, and outsiders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;

==== Bully-reinforcers and assistants ====

Bully-reinforcers and assistants do not normally initiate aggressive actions themselves, but they support, reinforce, and/or assist the bully. They often have rather large friendship networks when compared to outsiders, victims, and their defenders.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; These individuals are similar to bullies in regards of their personal characteristics. Female bully- reinforcers and assistants usually score low on social acceptance and high on rejection by their peers while male bully assistants have average scores on both and bully- reinforcers are often quite popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; The characteristic that is common among all these individuals across both genders is low level of empathy.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt;

==== Victim-defenders ====

Victim-defenders are individuals who stand up for the victim. They are usually popular among their peers,&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; although occasionally rejected and victimized adolescents take on the defender's role.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders like to befriend other defenders and usually belong to the smallest social network of all other previously mentioned groups.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt; Defenders have both advanced moral competence and high level of compassion. They also score high on the theory of mind tests. They are usually very morally engaged, have a high sense of responsibility, and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name="Gini 2011" /&gt; They are also good at emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Maede, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Outsiders ====

Outsiders are adolescents who like to stay away from the conflict situations, participate in spreading rumors, or actively support either side. They usually befriend other outsiders. Both male and female outsiders usually score below average on both social acceptance and rejection by their peers.&lt;ref name="Salmivalli 1996" /&gt;
In general, the best predictor for whether an adolescent will choose to be a defender or an outsider in a particular situation is their relationship to the victim and/or bully.&lt;ref name="Oh 2009" /&gt; Occasionally, adolescents will feel more comfortable to intervene if they are friends of the offender.&lt;ref&gt;Tisak, M. S., &amp; Tisak, J. (1996). Expectations and judgments regarding bystanders' and victims' responses to peer aggression among early adolescents. Journal of Adolescence, 19(4), 383-392.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general they will take the side of the bully or victim based on who they know better.&lt;ref&gt;Chaux, E. (2005). Role of Third Parties in Conflicts Among Colombian Children and Early Adolescents. Aggressive Behavior, 31(1), 40-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Bullies are more likely to be friends of other bullies, as well as their reinforcers, and assistants, while victims befriend other victims.

== Consequences of victimization ==

{{Main|Victimization}}
There are serious negative consequences associated with being involved in any aggressive behaviors. And while problems with peers might be a result of one's poor [[social skills]] and maladjustment, difficulty making friends, and regular experience of aggression can also be a cause of many short and long term negative consequences on one's [[mental health]] and academic and professional achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Bagwell, C., Newcomb, A., &amp; Bukowski, W. (1998). Preadolescent friendship and peer rejection as predictors of adult adjustment. ''Child Development, 69'', 140-153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brendgen, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M.

Paper presented at biennial meetings of Society for Research in Child Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;
Experience of relational aggression, peer rejection, and unpopularity are shown to be linked to various problems in adolescence, which are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Morison, P., &amp; Masten, A. S. (1991).

* poor [[social skills]];
* lack of close peer relationships;
* difficulties in academic performance;
* low school engagement;
* [[Social undermining|undermined]] feelings of competence;
* low [[self-esteem]]

C., &amp; Brethour, J. R. (2006). Teachers Who Bully Students: A Hidden Trauma. International Journal of Social Psychiatry, 52(3), 187-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some negative effects persist into adulthood. In a longitudinal study, Dan Olweus (2003)&lt;ref name="Olweus 2003" /&gt; found that young adults, who were victims of bullying in adolescence, had more symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem than did their non-victimized peers. Victims are also much more likely to engage in heavy smoking later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Niemelä, S., Brunstein-Klomek, A., Sillanmäki, L., Helenius, H., Piha, J., Kumpulainen, K., ,...Sourander, A.

=== Differences in consequences of victimization for victims and bully-victims ===

There are differences in consequences among the children who are rejected and aggressive, also known as [[Relational aggression#Bully-victims|bully-victims]], and children who are rejected and withdrawn, also referred to as simply [[Relational aggression#Victims|victims]]. Aggressive individuals often have [[Conduct disorder|conduct problems]] and are involved in [[Antisocial behavior|antisocial activity]].;&lt;ref name="French 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, S.

=== Suicide ideation and attempts ===

Although victims respond to bullying in various ways, some of the most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur.&lt;ref&gt;Batsche, G. M., &amp; Knoff, H. M. (1994). Bullies and their victims: Understanding a pervasive problem in the schools. School Psychology Review, 23(2), 165-174.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of [[Suicide ideation|suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, M. K., Finkelhor, D., &amp; Kantor, G. K. (2007). Multiple victimization experiences of urban elementary school students: Associations with psychosocial functioning and academic performance. Child Abuse &amp; Neglect, 31(5), 503-515. {{doi|10.1016/j.chiabu.2006.12.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigby, K., &amp; Slee, P. (1999). Suicidal ideation among adolescent school children, involvement in bully–victim problems, and perceived social support. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 29(2), 119-130.&lt;/ref&gt; and are more likely to have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, M. E., Neumark-Sztainer, D., &amp; Story, M. (2003). Associations of weight-based teasing and emotional well-being among adolescents. Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine, Î51, 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim 2005"&gt;Kim, Y. S., Koh, Y. J., &amp; Leventhal, B.(2005). School bullying and suicidal risk in Korean middle school students. Pediatrics, IIS, .Í57-363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills, C, Guerin, S., Lynch, E., Daly, 1., &amp; Eitzpatrick, C. (2004). The relationship between bullying, depression and suicidal thoughts/behaviour in Irish adolescents. Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine, 21, 112-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005)&lt;ref name="Kim 2005" /&gt; found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation.
Further research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of aggression. Relational or indirect aggression was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders.&lt;ref&gt;van der Wal, M. F., de Wit, C. A., &amp; Hirasing, R. A. (2003). Psychosocial health among young victims and offenders of direct and
indirect bullying, fpi/wfna, ÎÎÎ, 1312-1317.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Brustein and Klomek (2007),&lt;ref name="Klomek 2007" /&gt; victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Kaltiala-Heino R, Rimpela M, Marttunen M, Rimpela A, Rantanen P. (1999).Bullying, depression, and suicidal ideation in Finnish adolescents: school survey. BMJ. 1999;319:348-351.&lt;/ref&gt; found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.

== Environmental buffers and prevention programs ==

Some adolescents are more resilient to victimization due to their personal characteristics, but there are some environmental factors such as having a best friend or great family support can decrease the risk for many negative consequences associated with victimization.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, E. V. E., Boivin, M., Vitaro, F., &amp; Bukowski, W. M. (1999). The power of friendship: Protection against an escalating cycle of peer victimization. Developmental Psychology, 35(1), 94-101. {{doi|10.1037/0012-1649.35.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research shows that support from teachers can be a significant environmental factor for higher academic achievement and school engagement. It can also increase general [[Emotional well-being|well- being]] in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Brewster, A. B., &amp; Bowen, G. L. (2004). Teacher Support and the School Engagement of Latino Middle and High School Students at Risk of School Failure. Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work Journal, 21(1), 47-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher attitudes towards bullying were found to moderate the extent to which victims internalize and feel distressed and express it by avoiding school and similar behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Flaspohler, P. D., Elfstrom, J. L., Vanderzee, K. L., Sink, H. E., &amp; Birchmeier, Z. (2009). Stand by me: The effects of peer and teacher support in mitigating the impact of bullying on quality of life. ''Psychology in the Schools, 46''(7), 636-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Close teacher- student relationship moderates perceived safety in the classroom, and higher perceived safety is directly linked to better classroom concentration and improved coping strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, M. J., Duke, E., Holman, G., Laxton, E., Nicholas, B., Spells, R., ,...Woodmansey, H. (2009). Associations between being bullied, perceptions of safety in classroom and playground, and relationship with teacher among primary school pupils. Educational Studies, 35(3), 255-267.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, supportive friends, family, and teachers can be great buffers for victimized students against all negative effects of victimization.
Witnessing the harassment of others can also reduce some harmful effects of being victimized:&lt;ref&gt;Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (2005). Daily Reports of Witnessing and Experiencing Peer Harassment in Middle School. Child Development, 76(2), 435-450. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8624.2005.00855.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; victims-only feel more humiliated and angry than victims-witnesses on the same day. Being singled out and picked on feels worse than being one of many victimized students. This explains why in ethnically diverse schools victimized students experience worse psychological outcomes when their ethnic group is in majority, because then they are more likely to attribute it to their personal shortcomings and not to their group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S., Bellmore, A., Nishina, A., &amp; Juvonen, J. (in press)."It must be me": Ethnic context and attributions for peer victimization.''Child Development''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention programs ===

There are many prevention programs, which have been designed to improve social skills of the unpopular and victimized adolescents. Prevention programs usually focus on one of the three strategies:
# teaching social skills like self-expression, leadership, and questioning of others about themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, J., &amp; de Armaa, A. (1989). Social relationships in adolescence: Skill development and training. In J. Worell &amp; F. Danner (Eds.), ''The adolescent as decision-maker.'' San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Repinski, D., &amp; Leffert, N. (1994, February). Adolescents' relations with friends: The effects of a psychoeducational intervention. Paper presented in the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt;
# have unpopular adolescents participate in group activities together with the popular adolescents under supervision of psychologists;
# some programs focus on training on how to combine and use one's [[Cognition|cognitive]] and behavioral abilities, including social [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Kusche, C. A. &amp; Greenberg, M. T. (1994, 2011, 2012). The PATHS Curriculum. South Deerfield, MA: Channing-Bete Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissberg, R. P., Caplan, M., &amp; Harwood, R. L. (1991). Promoting competent young people in competence-enhancing environments: A systems-based perspective on primary prevention. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 59(6), 830-841. {{doi|10.1037/0022-006X.59.6.830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Different types of programs have shown to have somewhat different effects: the first type seems to best improve adolescent's ability to get along with others while the second type has shown to improve adolescents' [[self-conception]]s and their acceptance by others.&lt;ref&gt;Bierman, K. L., &amp; Furman, W. (1984). The effects of social skills training and peer involvement on the social adjustment of pre-adolescents. Child Development, 55(1), 151-162. {{doi|10.2307/1129841}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the examples of the programs using the third approach is [http://www.channing-bete.com/prevention-programs/paths/paths.html PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies)] teaches skills needed for successfully analyzing social situations, controlling one's negative emotions, and making more [[Rationality|rational]] social decisions. It has been shown to successfully reduce behavioral problems among elementary school children.&lt;ref&gt;Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group (1999). Initial impact of the Fast Track Prevention Trial for Conduct Problems, II: Classroom effects. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,'' 67, 648-657&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it is difficult to prevent relational aggression from happening as often adolescents who use it are seen to be more popular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Rose 2004" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14280">'''Renewable fuels''' are [[fuel]]s produced from renewable resources.  Examples include: [[biofuels]] (e.g. [[Vegetable oil used as fuel]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol fuel|methanol]] from [[Carbon Recycling International|clean energy and carbon dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or biomass, and biodiesel) and [[Hydrogen fuel]] (when produced with renewable processes).  This is in contrast to [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] fuels such as [[natural gas]], [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] ([[propane]]), [[petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]].  Renewable fuels can include fuels that are synthesized from [[renewable energy]] sources, such as wind and solar.  Renewable fuels have gained in popularity due to their [[sustainability]], [[Carbon neutral|low contributions]] to the [[carbon cycle]], and in some cases lower amounts of [[greenhouse gas]]es.  The geo-political ramifications of these fuels are also of interest, particularly to industrialized economies which desire [[Oil dependency|independence]] from [[Middle Eastern]] oil.

==Rationale for renewable fuels==
The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked,
would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a part to play, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and CO2 savings benefits, are variable. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with food production for land, water, and other resources. Greater efforts are required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol|ligno-cellulosics]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and other products from non-edible plant materials.&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2007/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbert's [[Hubbert peak theory|peak oil theory]] suggests that petroleum is a [[finite resource]] that is rapidly depleting. Of the worldwide total remaining petroleum reserves of approximately {{convert|1277702000000|oilbbl|km3}} (about one half of the original virgin reserves) and a worldwide usage rate of {{convert|25000000000|oilbbl|km3}} per year, only about 50 years worth of [[petroleum]] is predicted to remain at the current depletion rate. Petroleum is imperative for the following industries: [[fuel]] (home heating, jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, etc.) [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[plastics]]/resins, man-made fibers, [[synthetic rubber]], and [[explosives]]. If the modern world remains reliant on petroleum as a source of energy, the price of crude oil could increase markedly, destabilizing economies worldwide. Consequently, renewable fuel drivers include: high oil prices, imbalance of trade, instability in oil exporting regions of the world, the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], the potential for windfall profits for American farmers and industries, avoidance of economic depression, avoidance of scarcity of products due to a volatile ‘[[peak oil]]’ scenario expected to begin as early as 2021,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July05/ethanol.toocostly.ssl.html Biomass for biofuel isn't worth it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (though peak oil is not a new idea) and a slowing of [[global warming]] that may usher in unprecedented [[climate change]].

Furthermore, the global debate on [[climate change]], along with regional geopolitical instabilities have challenged nations to act to develop both alternative and [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] sources of energy. Renewable fuels are therefore becoming attractive to many governments, who are beginning to see sustainable energy independence as a valuable asset.

On December 19, 2007, President Bush signed into law the [[Energy Independence and Security Act]], establishing a requirement that at least {{convert|36|e9USgal|m3}} of renewable fuel be used in the marketplace by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsonline.com/NACS/Government/MotorFuels/Pages/RenewableFuels.aspx Issue Update: Renewable Fuels Retailer Liability]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=2007-09-28 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated [[energy crop]]s, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007).

==Biofuel==
{{main|Biofuel}}

[[Image:Soybeanbus.jpg|right|thumb|A bus fueled by [[biodiesel]]]]
Biofuel is a type of fuel whose energy is derived from biological [[carbon fixation]]. Biofuels include fuels derived from [[biomass]] conversion, as well as  [[Biofuel#Solid biofuels|solid biomass]], [[liquid fuels]] and various [[biogas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. .| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although [[fossil fuel]]s have their origin in ancient [[carbon fixation]], they are not considered biofuels by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been "out" of the carbon cycle for a very long time. Biofuels are gaining increased public and scientific attention, driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]], the need for increased [[energy security]], concern over [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s, and support from [[Ethanol fuel in the United_States#Tax_credits|government subsidies]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugar cane]].  [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[biofuel in the united states|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe.

In 2010 worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons US), up 17% from 2009, and biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's fuels for road transport, a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/biofuels-make-comeback-despite-tough-economy|title=Biofuels Make a Comeback Despite Tough Economy|publisher=[[Worldwatch Institute]]|date=2011-08-31|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global [[ethanol fuel]] production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons US) in 2010, with the United States and Brazil as the world's top producers, accounting together for 90% of global production. The world's largest biodiesel producer is the [[European Union]], accounting for 53% of all biodiesel production in 2010.&lt;ref name=Biofuels2010/&gt; As of 2011, mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states/provinces.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6017103 |title=IEA says biofuels can displace 27% of transportation fuels by 2050 Washington |author= |date=20 April 2011 |work=Platts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pyrolysis oil]] is another type of fuel derived from the [[Lignocellulosic biomass|lignocellulosic]] fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen ([[pyrolysis]]), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable bio-oil. As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=George|title=Breaking the Chemical and Engineering Barriers to Lignocellulosic Biofuels: Next Generation Hydrocarbon Biorefineries|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen fuel==
[[Image:Photo praxair plant.hydrogen.infrastructure.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hydrogen fuel requires the development of a specific infrastructure for processing, transport and storage.]]
{{main|Hydrogen economy}}
[[Hydrogen fuel]] refers to the use of [[hydrogen]] gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as an energy carrier. Broadly speaking, the production of renewable [[hydrogen fuel]] can be divided into two general categories: biologically derived production, and chemical production.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production"&gt;National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2003 ''Research Review'': "[http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf New Horizons for Hydrogen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192032/http://www.nrel.gov/hydrogen/pdfs/49923.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}."&lt;/ref&gt; This is an area of current research, and new developments and technologies are causing this field to evolve rapidly.

The biological production of hydrogen fuel has been a topic of research since at least the 1970s. Hydrogen gas can be produced from biomass sources like agricultural and forest residues, consumer waste and other specific agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Specifically, hydrogen fuel is produced by a process called [[gasification]], where biomass is processed into a combustible gas and then burned, or by [[pyrolysis]], a related process which can lead to hydrogen gas suitable for fuel-cell applications. One continuing subject of research regards the production of unwanted co-products in both of these processes. The presence of other contaminant gases often depend on specific composition of the biomass source, which can be difficult to control.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt; Another source for biological production of hydrogen fuel is [[algae]]. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref name="wiredSwamp"&gt;Wired, ''[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 It Came from the Swamp: Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|algae farms]] are attempting to make algae an economically feasible energy source.&lt;ref name="registerAlgae"&gt;The Register, ''[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/02/24/pond_scum_breakthrough/ Pond life: the future of energy],'' accessed September 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several physico-chemical methods for producing hydrogen; most of these methods require electrolysis of water. When this process draws its power from renewable energy sources like [[wind turbines]] or [[photovoltaic cells]], the production requires little consumption of non-renewable resources. Hydrogen fuel, when produced by renewable sources of energy like wind or solar power, is a renewable fuel.&lt;ref name="nrelH2production" /&gt;

==Processed engineered fuel==
PEF is a partial replacement for fossil fuels in cement kilns. It has significant calorific value and can be used as a fuel substitute for coal and gas in high-combustion facilities. PEF facilities typically divert waste from landfill, reducing demand for non-renewable coal and reducing waste to landfill.

'''SAMPL''', which stands for '''"Stochastic [[AMPL]]"''', is an [[algebraic modeling language]] resulting by expanding the well-known language [[AMPL]] with extended syntax and keywords. It is designed specifically for representing [[stochastic programming]] problems&lt;ref name="ExtendingAlgebraicLanguages"&gt;
{{cite journal | author=Christian Valente, Gautam Mitra, Mustapha Sadki and Robert Fourer| title=Extending algebraic modelling languages for stochastic programming| journal=INFORMS Journal on Computing| year=2009| volume=21| issue=1| pages=107–122| url=http://joc.journal.informs.org/content/21/1/107.abstract| doi=10.1287/ijoc.1080.0282}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and, through recent extensions, problems with chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and [[robust optimization]] problems. 
It can generate the deterministic equivalent version of the instances, using all the solvers AMPL connects to,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampl.com/solvers.html&lt;/ref&gt; or generate an [[MPS (format)#extensions|SMPS]] representation and use specialized decomposition based solvers, like [[FortSP]].

== Language Features ==

SAMPL shares all language features with AMPL, and adds some constructs specifically designed for expressing scenario based [[stochastic programming]] and [[robust optimization]].

=== Stochastic programming features and constructs ===

To express scenario-based SP problems, additional constructs describe the tree structure and group the decision variable into stages. Moreover, it is possible to specify which parameter stores the probabilities for each branch of the tree and which set represents the scenario set. Other constructs to easily define chance constraints and integrated chance constraint in an SP problem are available as well.
Using these language constructs allows to retain the structure of the problem, hence making it available to the solvers, which might exploit it using specialized decomposition methods like [[Benders' decomposition]] to speed-up the solution.

=== Robust optimization constructs ===

SAMPL supports constructs to describe three types of robust optimization formulations:

== Availability ==

SAMPL is currently available as a part of the software AMPLDev (distributed by [http://www.optirisk-systems.com www.optirisk-systems.com]). It supports many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including [[Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A free evaluation version with limited functionality is available.&lt;ref&gt;http://optirisk-systems.com/products_ampldevSP.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== A stochastic programming sample model ==

The following is the SAMPL version of a simple problem (Dakota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Higle, Julia L, Wallace, Stein W| title=Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty in linear programming| journal=Interfaces| year=2003| volume=33| number=4| pages=53–60| publisher=INFORMS| doi=10.1287/inte.33.4.53.16370}}&lt;/ref&gt;), to show the SP related constructs. It does not include the data file, which follows the normal AMPL syntax (see the [[AMPL#example|example]] provided in the AMPL Wikipedia page for further reference).
 
 set Prod;
 set Resource;
 
 ''# Scenarios (future possible realizations)''
 '''scenarioset''' Scen;
 
 ''# Definition of the problem as a two-stage problem''
 '''tree''' Tree := '''twostage''';
 
 ''# Demand for each product in each scenario''
 '''random param''' Demand{Prod, Scen};
 
 ''# Probability of each scenario''
 '''probability''' P{Scen};	
 
 ''# Cost of each unit of resource''
 param Cost{Resource};
 
 ''# Requirement in terms of resources units to produce one unit of each product''
 param ProdReq{Resource,Prod};
 
 ''# Selling price of each product''
 param Price{Prod};
 
 ''# Initial budget''
 param Budget;
 
 ''# Amount of resources to buy''
 var buy{r in Resource} &gt;= 0, '''suffix stage''' 1;
 
 ''# Amount of each product to produce''
 var amountprod{p in Prod, s in Scen} &gt;= 0, '''suffix stage''' 2;
 
 ''# Amount of each product to sell''
 var amountsell{p in Prod, s in Scen} &gt;= 0, '''suffix stage''' 2;
 
 ''# Total final wealth, as expected total income from sales minus costs for the resources''
 maximize wealth: sum{s in Scen} P[s] * 
  (sum{p in Prod} Price[p] * amountsell[p,s] - sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r]);
 
 subject to 
 ''# Make sure you have enough resources to produce what we intend to''
 balance{r in Resource, s in Scen}: 
  buy[r] &gt;= sum{p in Prod} ProdReq[r,p] * amountprod[p, s];
 ''# Make sure we do not sell what we did not produce''
 production{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= amountprod[p,s];
 ''# Make sure we do not sell more than the market demand''
 sales{p in Prod, s in Scen}: amountsell[p,s] &lt;= Demand[p,s];
 ''# Respect initial budget''
 budgetres: sum{r in Resource} Cost[r] * buy[r] &lt;= Budget;

== Solvers connectivity ==

SAMPL instance level format for SP problems is SMPS, and therefore the problem can be solved by any solver which supports that standard. One of such solvers (FortSP) is included in the standard SAMPL distribution. Regarding robust optimization problems, the needed solver depend on the specific formulation used, as Ben-Tal and Nemirovski formulation need a [[Second-order cone programming|second-order cone]] capable solver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9720">{{technical|date=March 2016}}In [[mathematical logic]], '''satisfiability''' and '''[[Validity (logic)|validity]]''' are elementary concepts of [[semantics]]. A [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] is ''satisfiable'' if it is possible to find an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] ([[model theory|model]]) that makes the formula true.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Boolos and Jeffrey, 1974, chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  A formula is ''valid'' if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are '''unsatisfiability''' and '''invalidity''', that is, a formula is ''unsatisfiable'' if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and ''invalid'' if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to [[Aristotle]]'s [[square of opposition]].

The four concepts can be raised to apply to whole [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]]: a theory is satisfiable (valid) if one (all) of the interpretations make(s) each of the [[axiom]]s of the theory true, and a theory is unsatisfiable (invalid) if all (one) of the interpretations make(s) each of the axioms of the theory false.

It is also possible to consider only interpretations that make all of the axioms of a second theory true. This generalization is commonly called [[satisfiability modulo theories]].

The question whether a sentence in [[propositional logic]] is satisfiable is a [[decidable problem]]. In general, the question whether sentences in [[first-order logic]] are satisfiable is not decidable.  In [[universal algebra]] and [[equational theory]], the methods of [[term rewriting]], [[congruence closure]] and [[unification (computer science)|unification]] are used to attempt to decide satisfiability.  Whether a particular [[theory (logic)|theory]] is decidable or not depends whether the theory is [[variable-free]] or on other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Franz Baader]]|author2=[[Tobias Nipkow]]|title=Term Rewriting and All That|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-77920-0|pages=58–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction of validity to satisfiability==
For [[classical logic]]s, it is generally possible to reexpress the question of the validity of a formula to one involving satisfiability, because of the relationships between the concepts expressed in the above square of opposition.  In particular φ is valid if and only if ¬φ is unsatisfiable, which is to say it is not true that ¬φ is satisfiable. Put another way, φ is satisfiable if and only if ¬φ is invalid.

For logics without negation, such as the [[List of logic systems#Positive propositional calculus|positive propositional calculus]], the questions of validity and satisfiability may be unrelated. In the case of the [[List of logic systems#Positive propositional calculus|positive propositional calculus]], the satisfiability problem is trivial, as every formula is satisfiable, while the validity problem is [[Co-NP-complete|co-NP complete]].

==Propositional satisfiability==
{{main|Propositional satisfiability}}
In the case of [[classical propositional logic]], satisfiability is decidable for propositional formulae.  In particular, satisfiability is an [[NP-complete]] problem, and is one of the most intensively studied problems in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Satisfiability in first-order logic==
Satisfiability is [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] and indeed it isn't even a semidecidable property of formulae in [[first-order logic]] (FOL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/content/institutes/thi/algi/lehre/SS12/AL12/skript/script120413.pdf |title= Chapter 1.3 Undecidability of FOL |accessdate= 21 July 2012 &lt;!-- at 13:25  --&gt; |author= Baier, Christel |year= 2012 |work= Lecture Notes&amp;nbsp;— Advanced Logics |publisher= Technische Universität Dresden&amp;nbsp;— Institute for Technical Computer Science |pages= 28–32 }}{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact has to do with the undecidability of the validity problem for FOL. The question of the status of the validity problem was posed firstly by David Hilbert, as the so-called [[Entscheidungsproblem]]. The universal validity of a formula is a semi-decidable problem. If satisfiability were also a semi-decidable problem, then the problem of the existence of counter-models would be too (a formula has counter-models iff its negation is satisfiable). So the problem of logical validity would be decidable, which contradicts the Church-Turing theorem, a result stating the negative answer for the [[Entscheidungsproblem]].

==Satisfiability in model theory==
In [[model theory]], an [[atomic formula]] is satisfiable if there is a collection of elements of a [[structure (logic)|structure]] that render the formula true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wilifrid Hodges|title=A Shorter Model Theory|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-58713-1|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''A'' is a structure, φ is a formula, and ''a'' is a collection of elements, taken from the structure, that satisfy φ, then it is commonly written that

:''A'' ⊧ φ [a]

If φ has no variables, that is, if φ is an [[atomic sentence]], and it is satisfied by ''A'', then one writes

:''A'' ⊧ φ

In this case, one may also say that ''A'' is a model for φ, or that φ is ''true'' in ''A''.  If ''T'' is a collection of atomic sentences (a theory) satisfied by ''A'', one writes

:''A'' ⊧ ''T''

==Finite satisfiability==

A problem related to satisfiability is that of '''finite satisfiability''', which is the question of determining whether a formula admits a ''finite'' model that makes it true. For a logic that has the [[finite model property]], the problems of satisfiability and finite satisfiability coincide, as a formula of that logic has a model if and only if it has a finite model. This question is important in the mathematical field of [[finite model theory]].

Nevertheless, finite satisfiability and satisfiability need not coincide in general. For instance, consider the [[first-order logic]] formula obtained as the [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] of the following sentences, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are [[logical constant|constants]]:

* &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_0)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x y (R(x, y) \rightarrow \exists z R(y, z))&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x y z (R(y, x) \wedge R(z, x) \rightarrow x = z))&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting formula has the infinite model &lt;math&gt;R(a_0, a_0), R(a_0, a_1), R(a_1, a_2), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;, but it can be shown that it has no finite model (starting at the fact &lt;math&gt;R(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and following the chain of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; [[atomic formula|atoms]] that must exist by the third axiom, the finiteness of a model would require the existence of a loop, which would violate the fourth axiom, whether it loops back on &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; or on a different element).

The [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of deciding satisfiability for an input formula in a given logic may differ from that of deciding finite satisfiability; in fact, for some logics, only one of them is [[decidability (logic)|decidable]].

== Numerical constraints ==
{{further|Satisfiability modulo theories|Constraint satisfaction problem}}
Numerical constraints often appear in the field of [[mathematical optimization]], where one usually wants to maximize (or minimize) an objective function subject to some constraints. However, leaving aside the objective function, the basic issue of simply deciding whether the constraints are satisfiable can be challenging or undecidable in some settings. The following table summarizes the main cases.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Constraints !! over reals !! over integers
|-
| Linear || [[PTIME]] (see [[linear programming]]) || [[NP-complete]] (see [[integer programming]])
|-

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{buddhism}}
{{nihongo|'''''Satori'''''|悟り}} ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:悟|悟]]|p=wù}}; {{lang-ko|오}} ''o''; {{lang-vi|ngộ}}) is a [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhist]] term for [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], "comprehension; understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=&amp;eng=satori&amp;dict=edict Denshi Jisho — Online Japanese dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Japanese verb [[satoru]].{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A|p=88}}

In the [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] tradition, ''satori'' refers to the experience of ''[[kenshō]]'',&lt;ref name="Kapleau"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kapleau|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; "seeing into one's true [[Buddha-nature|nature]]". ''Ken'' means "seeing," ''shō'' means "nature" or "essence".&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt;

''Satori'' and ''kenshō'' are commonly translated as [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], a word that is also used to translate [[bodhi]], [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]] and [[buddhahood]].

==Definition==
[[D. T. Suzuki]], a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were influential in the West, described ".... looking into one's nature or the opening of satori";{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-B|p=259}} and said "This acquiring of a new point of view in our dealings with life and the world is popularly called by Japanese Zen students 'satori' (''wu'' in Chinese). It is really another name for Enlightenment (''[[Enlightenment in Buddhism#Buddha's awakening|"Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi"]]'')".{{sfn|Suzuki-1994-B|p=229}}{{refn|group=note|D. T. Suzuki has been criticised for his highly idealised and inaccurate picture of Japanese Zen.{{sfn|MacRae|2003}} "Annuttara-samyak-sambodhi" is the highest state of realisation and awakening. Satori, or kensho, is a first glimpse into "nature", to be followed by further training.}}

==''Satori'' and ''kenshō''==
[[File:Satori.svg|thumb|left|70px|[[Japanese language|Japanese]] character for ''satori'']]
''Satori'' is often used interchangeably with ''kenshō''.&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt; ''Kenshō'' refers to the perception of the [[Buddha-Nature]] or [[Sunyata|emptiness]]. According to some authors, ''kenshō'' is a brief glimpse, while ''satori'' is considered to be a deeper spiritual experience.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Distinct from this first insight, [[Daigo (Zen)|daigo-tettei]] is used to refer to a "deep" or lasting realization of the nature of existence.&lt;ref name="Kapleau" /&gt;

==Importance==
According to D. T. Suzuki,
{{quote|''Satori'' is the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of [[Zen]], without which Zen is not Zen. Therefore every contrivance, disciplinary and doctrinal, is directed towards ''satori''.{{sfn|Suzuki|1994-A}}}}
This view is typical of [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]], which emphasizes ''satori''. The [[Sōtō|Sōtō school]] rejects this emphasis, and instead emphasizes "silent illumination" through the practice of [[zazen]].

==Attaining ''satori''==
''Satori'' is considered a "first step" or embarkation toward [[Buddhahood]]:
{{quote|Ch'an expressions refer to enlightenment as "seeing your self-nature". But even this is not enough. After seeing your self-nature, you need to deepen your experience even further and bring it into maturation. You should have enlightenment experience again and again and support them with continuous practice. Even though Ch'an says that at the time of enlightenment, your outlook is the same as of the Buddha, you are not yet a full Buddha.{{sfn|Yen|2006|p=54)}}}}

The student's mind must be prepared by rigorous study, with the use of [[koan]]s, and the practice of [[meditation]] to concentrate the mind, under the guidance of a teacher. Koans are short anecdotes of verbal exchanges between teachers and students, typically of the [[Song dynasty]], dealing with Buddhist teachings. The Rinzai-school utilizes classic collections of koans such as the [[Mumonkan|Gateless Gate]]. The Gateless Gate was assembled by the early 13th-century Chinese Zen master [[Wumen]] Hui-k'ai (無門慧開).

Wumen struggled for six years with koan "[[Mu (negative)|Zhaozhou’s dog]]", assigned to him by Yuelin Shiguan (月林師觀; Japanese: Gatsurin Shikan) (1143–1217), before attaining ''kenshō''. After his understanding had been confirmed by Yuelin, Wumen wrote the following enlightenment poem:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;A thunderclap under the clear blue sky
All beings on earth open their eyes;
Everything under heaven bows together;
[[Sumeru|Mount Sumeru]] leaps up and dances.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''Sensemaking''' is the process by which people give [[semantics|meaning]] to their collective experiences. It is often formally defined as "the ongoing retrospective development of plausible images that rationalize what people are doing" ([[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, Sutcliffe, &amp; Obstfeld, 2005, p. 409]]). The concept was introduced to [[organizational studies]] by [[Karl E. Weick]] in the 1970s and has affected both theory and practice. The concept was intended to encourage a shift away from the traditional focus of organization theorists on [[decision-making]] and towards the processes that constitute the meaning of the decisions that are enacted in behavior.

==Roots in social psychology==

In 1966, [[Daniel Katz (psychologist)|Daniel Katz]] and [[Robert L. Kahn]] published their highly influential book ''The Social Psychology of Organizations'' ([[#Reference-Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. 1966|Katz &amp; Kahn, 1966]]). In 1969, Karl Weick played on this title in his seminal ''The Social Psychology of Organizing'', shifting the focus from organizations as entities to organiz''ing'' as an activity. It was especially the second edition, published ten years later ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1979|Weick, 1979]]) that established Weick's approach in organization studies.

==Properties==

Weick identified seven properties of sensemaking ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]):

# ''Identity'' and identification is central&amp;nbsp;– who people think they are in their context shapes what they enact and how they interpret events ([[#Reference-Pratt, M.G. 2000|Pratt, 2000]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick, et al., 2005]]; [[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 2009|Watson, 2009]]).
# ''Retrospection'' provides the opportunity for sensemaking: the point of retrospection in time affects what people notice ([[#Reference-Dunford, R., &amp; Jones, D. 2000|Dunford &amp; Jones, 2000]]), thus attention and interruptions to that attention are highly relevant to the process ([[#Reference-Gephart, R. P. 1993|Gephart, 1993]]).
# People ''enact'' the environments they face in dialogues and narratives ([[#Reference-Bruner, J. 1991|Bruner, 1991]]; [[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1998|Watson, 1998]]; [[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]). As people speak, and build narrative accounts, it helps them understand what they think, organize their experiences and control and predict events ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]) and reduce complexity in the context of change management ([[#Reference-Kumar, P. and Singhal, M. 2012|Kumar &amp; Singhal, 2012]]).
# Sensemaking is a ''social'' activity in that plausible stories are preserved, retained or shared ([[#Reference-Isabella, L. A. 1990|Isabella, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Maitlis, S. 2005|Maitlis, 2005]]). However, the audience for sensemaking includes the speakers themselves ([[#Reference-Watson, T. J. 1995|Watson, 1995]]) and the narratives are "both individual and shared...an evolving product of conversations with ourselves and with others" ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]: 565).
# Sensemaking is ''ongoing'', so Individuals simultaneously shape and react to the environments they face. As they project themselves onto this environment and observe the consequences they learn about their identities and the accuracy of their accounts of the world ([[#Reference-Thurlow, A., &amp; Mills, J. 2009|Thurlow &amp; Mills, 2009]]). This is a feedback process so even as individuals deduce their identity from the behaviour of others towards them, they also try to influence this behaviour. As Weick argued, "The basic idea of sensemaking is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]: 635).
# People ''extract cues'' from the context to help them decide on what information is relevant and what explanations are acceptable ([[#Reference-Salancick, G., &amp; Pfeffer, J. 1978|Salancick &amp; Pfeffer, 1978]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D., Stacey, P., &amp; Nandhakumar, J. 2007|Brown, Stacey, &amp; Nandhakumar, 2007]]). Extracted cues provide points of reference for linking ideas to broader networks of meaning and are 'simple, familiar structures that are seeds from which people develop a larger sense of what may be occurring." ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 50).
# People favour ''plausibility over accuracy'' in accounts of events and contexts ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]; [[#Reference-Brown, A. D. 2005|Brown, 2005]]; [[#Reference-Abolafia, M. 2010|Abolafia, 2010]]): "in an equivocal, postmodern world, infused with the politics of interpretation and conflicting interests and inhabited by people with multiple shifting identities, an obsession with accuracy seems fruitless, and not of much practical help, either" ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995]]: 61).

Each of these seven aspects interact and intertwine as individuals interpret events. Their interpretations become evident through [[narrative]]s&amp;nbsp;– written and spoken&amp;nbsp;– which convey the sense they have made of events ([[#Reference-Currie, G., &amp; Brown, A. 2003|Currie &amp; Brown, 2003]]), as well as through [[diagrammatic reasoning]] and associated material practices ([[#Reference-Huff, A. S. 1990|Huff, 1990]]; [[#Reference-Stigliani, I., &amp; Ravasi, D. 2012|Stigliani &amp; Ravasi, 2012]]).

==From decision-making to sensemaking==

The rise of the sensemaking perspective marks a shift of focus in organization studies from how decisions shape organizations to how meaning drives organizing ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick, 1993]]). The aim was to focus attention on the largely cognitive activity of framing experienced situations as meaningful. It is a collaborative process of creating shared awareness and understanding out of different individuals' perspectives and varied interests.

==From planning to action==

Sensemaking scholars are less interested in the intricacies of planning than in the details of action ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1995|Weick, 1995, p. 55]]).

==Uncertainty, ambiguity, and crisis==
The sensemaking approach is often used to provide insight into factors that surface as organizations address either uncertain or ambiguous situations ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1988|Weick 1988]], [[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|1993]]; [[#Reference-Weick, K., Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Obstfeld, D. 2005|Weick et al., 2005]]). Beginning in the 1980s with an influential re-analysis of the Bhopal disaster, Weick's name has come to be associated with the study of the situated sensemaking that influences the outcomes of disasters ([[#Reference-Weick, K. 1993|Weick 1993]]).

== Categories and related concepts ==

A 2014 review of the literature on sensemaking in organizations identified a dozen different categories of sensemaking and a half-dozen sensemaking related concepts ([[#Reference-Maitlis, S. &amp; Christianson, M. 2014|Maitlis &amp; Christianson, 2014]]). The categories of sensemaking included: constituent-minded, cultural, ecological, environmental, future-oriented, intercultural, interpersonal, market, political, prosocial, prospective, and resourceful. The sensemaking-related concepts included: sensebreaking, sensedemanding, sense-exchanging, sensegiving, sensehiding, and sense specification.

==Other applications==

Sensemaking is central to the conceptual framework for military [[network-centric operations]] (NCO) espoused by the [[United States Department of Defense]] ([[#Reference-Garstka, J. and Alberts, D. 2004|Garstka and Alberts, 2004]]). In a joint/coalition military environment, sensemaking is complicated by numerous technical, social, organizational, cultural, and operational factors. A central hypothesis of NCO is that the quality of shared sensemaking and collaboration will be better in a "robustly networked" force than in a platform-centric force, empowering people to make better decisions. According to NCO theory, there is a mutually-reinforcing relationship among and between individual sensemaking, shared sensemaking, and collaboration.

In defense applications, sensemaking theorists have primarily focused on how shared awareness and understanding are developed within [[command and control]] organizations at the operational level. At the tactical level, individuals monitor and assess their immediate physical environment in order to predict where different elements will be in the next moment. At the operational level, where the situation is far broader, more complex and more uncertain, and evolves over hours and days, the organization must collectively make sense of enemy dispositions, [[intention]]s and capabilities, as well as anticipate the (often unintended) effects of own-force actions on a complex [[system of systems]].

Sensemaking has been studied in the patient safety literature ([[#Reference-Battles, et al. 2006|Battles, et al. 2006]]). It has been used as a conceptual framework for identifying and detecting high risk patient situations. For example, [[#Reference-Rhodes, et al. 2015|Rhodes, et al. (2015)]] examined sensemaking and the co-production of safety of primary medical care patients. A [[Configurational analysis|configurational approach]] in the form of [[Qualitative comparative analysis|QCA]] has been proposed by Sukhov et al. (2018) for studying sensemaking in individual's decisions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SUKHOV|first=ALEXANDRE|last2=SIHVONEN|first2=ANTTI|last3=OLSSON|first3=LARS E.|last4=MAGNUSSON|first4=PETER R.|date=2018-11-28|title=THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME: OPENNESS TO CHANGE AND SENSEMAKING IN IDEA SCREENING|url=https://doi.org/10.1142/S1363919618400091|journal=International Journal of Innovation Management|language=en|pages=1840009|doi=10.1142/s1363919618400091|issn=1363-9196}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to explain how different individuals combine together different cues to make sense of and decide on the goodness of ideas.

'''SHYSTER''' is a [[legal expert system]] developed at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]] in 1993.  It was written as the doctoral dissertation of [[James Popple]] under the supervision of Robin Stanton, Roger Clarke, [[Peter Drahos]], and Malcolm Newey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD thesis|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1993|publisher=Australian National University|isbn=0-7315-1827-6|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/theses/phd.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|jyQ2xnmAhXkC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A full technical report of the expert system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: The Program|year=1993|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-93-13|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-93-13.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-TheProgram|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|8PjkWBjFy4gC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book&lt;ref name="Popple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1996|publisher=Dartmouth (Ashgate)|series=Applied Legal Philosophy Series|isbn=1-85521-739-2|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/books/shyster.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=28 December 2006|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|ZyfNAgAAQBAJ|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further detailing its development and testing have also been published.

SHYSTER emphasises its pragmatic approach, and posits that a legal expert system need not be based upon a complex model of legal reasoning in order to produce useful advice.  Although SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments.  SHYSTER is of a general design, permitting its operation in different legal domains.  It was designed to provide advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a legal expert using a bespoke [[specification language]].  Its knowledge of the law is acquired, and represented, as information about cases. It produces its advice by examining, and arguing about, the similarities and differences between cases.  It derives its name from [[Shyster]]: a slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law and politics.

==Methods==
SHYSTER is a specific example of a general category of legal expert systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems.  [[Artificial intelligence and law|Legal AI]] systems can be divided into two categories: legal retrieval systems and legal analysis systems.  SHYSTER belongs to the latter category of legal analysis systems.  Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and legal expert systems.  SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of legal expert systems.  A [[legal expert system]], as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer:  “AI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be legal expert systems; a legal expert system must exhibit some legal expertise itself."&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Designed to operate in more than one legal domain, and be of specific use to the common [[law of Australia]], SHYSTER accounts for [[statute law]], [[case law]], and the doctrine of [[precedent]] in areas of [[private law]].  Whilst it accommodates statute law, it is primarily a case-based system, in contradistinction to rule-based systems like [[MYCIN]].  More specifically, it was designed in a manner enabling it to be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid system.  Although case-based reasoning possesses an advantage over rule-based systems by the elimination of complex [[semantic network]]s, it suffers from intractable theoretical obstacles: without some further theory it cannot be predicted what features of a case will turn out to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Greinke, A. (1994): [http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v1n4/greinke14.txt ‘Legal Expert Systems: A Humanistic Critique of Mechanical Human Inference’] ''E-Law: Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'' Volume 1, Number 4 (December 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Users of SHYSTER therefore require some legal expertise.

[[Richard Susskind]] argues that “jurisprudence can and ought to supply the models of law and legal reasoning that are required for computerized [sic] implementation in the process of building all expert systems in law.”&lt;ref&gt;Susskind, R. (1987): ‘Expert Systems in Law’ (Oxford) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Popple, however, believes [[jurisprudence]] is of limited value to developers of legal expert systems.  He posits that a lawyer must have a model of the law (maybe unarticulated) which includes assumptions about the nature of law and legal reasoning, but that model need not rest on basic philosophical foundations.  It may be a pragmatic model, developed through experience within the legal system. Many lawyers perform their work with little or no jurisprudential knowledge, and there is no evidence to suggest that they are worse, or better, at their jobs than lawyers well-versed in jurisprudence.  The fact that many lawyers have mastered the process of legal reasoning, without having been immersed in jurisprudence, suggests that it may indeed be possible to develop legal expert systems of good quality without jurisprudential insight.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}  As a pragmatic legal expert system SHYSTER is the embodiment of this belief.

A further example of SHYSTER’s pragmatism is its simple [[knowledge representation]] structure.  This structure was designed to facilitate specification of different areas of case law using a specification language.  Areas of case law are specified in terms of the cases and attributes of importance in those areas.  SHYSTER weights its attributes and checks for dependence between them.  In order to choose cases upon which to construct its opinions, SHYSTER calculates distances between cases and uses these distances to determine which of the leading cases are nearest to the instant case.  To this end SHYSTER can be seen to adopt and expand upon [[nearest neighbor search]] methods used in [[pattern recognition]].  These nearest cases are used to produce an argument (based on similarities and differences between the cases) about the likely outcome in the instant case. This argument relies on the doctrine of precedent; it assumes that the instant case will be decided the same way as was the nearest case.  SHYSTER then uses information about these nearest cases to construct a report.  The report that SHYSTER generates makes a prediction and justifies that prediction by reference only to cases and their similarities and differences: the calculations that SHYSTER performs in coming to its opinion do not appear in that opinion.  Safeguards are employed to warn users if SHYSTER doubts the veracity of its advice.

==Results==
SHYSTER was tested in four different and disparate areas of case law.  Four specifications were written, each representing an area of Australian law: an aspect of the law of [[trover]]; the meaning of “authorization [sic]” in [[Australian copyright law]]; the categorisation of employment contracts; and the implication of [[natural justice]] in administrative decision-making.  SHYSTER was evaluated under five headings: its usefulness, its generality, the quality of its advice, its limitations, and possible enhancements that could be made to it.  Despite its simple knowledge representation structure, it has shown itself capable of producing good advice, and its simple structure has facilitated the specification of different areas of law.

Appreciating the difficulties encountered by legal expert systems developers in adequately representing legal knowledge can assist in appreciating the shortcomings of [[digital rights management]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A. (2005): ‘Rights Expression on Digital Communication Networks: Some Implications for Copyright’ ''International Journal of Law and Information Technology'' 2005 13(1) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough to permit exceptions to copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Maillard, T. (2004): ‘Towards Digital Rights and Exemptions Management Systems’ ''Computer law and Security Report ''20 (4), pp. 281–287.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end SHYSTER's attempt to model “authorization [sic]” in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act]] can be viewed as pioneering work in this field.  The term “authorization [sic]” is undefined in the Copyright Act.  Consequently, a number of cases have been before the courts seeking answers as to what conduct amounts to authorisation.  The main contexts in which the issue has arisen are analogous to permitted exceptions to copyright currently prevented by most digital rights management technologies: “home taping of recorded materials, photocopying in educational institutions and performing works in public”.&lt;ref&gt;McKeough, J., Bowery, K. and Griffith, P. (2002): ‘Intellectual Property: Commentary and Materials’ (third edition), Lawbook Co. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  When applied to one case concerning [[compact cassette]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=CBS Songs v. Amstrad|court=UKHL|year=1988|num=15|date=12 May 1988|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; SHYSTER successfully agreed that Amstrad did not authorise the infringement.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|186}}

==SHYSTER-MYCIN==
Popple highlighted the most obvious avenue of future research using SHYSTER as the development of a rule-based system, and the linking together of that rule-based system with the existing case-based system to form a hybrid system.  This intention was eventually realised by Thomas O’Callaghan, the creator of SHYSTER-MYCIN: a hybrid legal expert system first presented at ICAIL '03, 24–28 June 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=Popple|first2=James|authorlink2=James Popple|last3=McCreath|first3=Eric|title=SHYSTER-MYCIN: A Hybrid Legal Expert System|date=26 June 2003|conference=Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-03)|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|place=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=103-104|ISBN=1581137478|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/software/shyster/tom/icail-03.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MYCIN]] is an existing medical expert system, which was adapted for use with SHYSTER.  MYCIN’s controversial “certainty factor” is not used in SHYSTER-MYCIN.  The reason for this is the difficulty in scientifically establishing how certain a fact is in a legal domain.  The rule-based approach of the MYCIN part is used to reason with the provisions of an Act of Parliament only.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"&gt;{{cite book|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=McCreath|first2=Eric|last3=Popple|first3=James|authorlink3=James Popple|title=Building and Testing the SHYSTER-MYCIN Hybrid Legal Expert System|year=2003|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-03-01|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-03-01.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hybrid system enables the case-based system (SHYSTER) to determine open textured concepts when required by the rule-based system (MYCIN).&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The ultimate conclusion of this joint endeavour is that a hybrid approach is preferred in the creation of legal expert systems where “it is appropriate to use rule-based reasoning when dealing with statutes, and…case-based reasoning when dealing with cases”.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The '''southeastern Iberian script''', also known as '''Meridional Iberian''', was one of the means of written expression of the [[Iberian language]], which was written mainly in the [[northeastern Iberian script]] and residually by the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]]. About the relation between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, it is necessary to point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs; however it is clear that they had a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script derives from southeastern Iberian script. In fact, the southeastern Iberian script is very similar, both considering the shape of the signs or their values, to the [[Southwest script|Southwestern script]] used to represent an unknown language usually named [[Tartessian language|Tartessian]]. The main difference is that southeastern Iberian script does not show the vocalic redundancy of the syllabic signs. Unlike the [[northeastern Iberian script]] the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not yet complete, because there are a significant number of signs on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus. Although it is believed that the southeastern Iberian script does not show any system to differentiate between [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and [[unvoiced]] [[occlusive]]s, unlike the [[northeastern Iberian script]], a recent paper (Ferrer i Jané 2010) defends the existence of a dual system also in the southeastern Iberian script.

==Typology and variants==
All the [[paleohispanic scripts]], with the exception of the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]], share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic value for the [[occlusives]], and monophonemic value for the rest of the [[consonants]] and [[vowels]].  From the [[writing systems]] point of view they are neither [[alphabets]] nor [[syllabaries]]; rather, they are mixed scripts that normally are identified as [[semi-syllabaries]]. There is no agreement about how the [[paleohispanic scripts |paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]] originated; some researchers conclude that their origin is linked only to the [[Phoenician alphabet]], while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] exercised some influence.

==Location of findings==
The inscriptions that use the southeastern Iberian script had been found mainly in the southeastern quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: eastern [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]], [[Albacete]], [[Alicante]], and [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. The southeastern Iberian inscriptions were made on different object types ([[silver]] and [[bronze]] [[coins]], silver and [[ceramic]] recipients, [[lead]] plaques, stones, etc.), but they number around 50 and represent more or less only 2% of the total found. Between them there are the lead plaque from Gador ([[Almeria]]) and the lead plaque from La Bastida de les Alcuses ([[Moixent]], [[València]]). The inscriptions that use this script almost always use the right to left direction of writing. The oldest inscriptions in southeastern Iberian script date to the 4th century BCE, and the modern ones date from the end of the 2nd century BCE.

==Background==

=== Straight pride as an appeal to ridicule ===
{{see also|White pride}}

The concept of [[LGBT pride]] originates as a movement which seeks to [[Self-affirmation#Self-affirmation at the collective level|challenge the negative images]] of LGBT people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f,2.html|title=Kameny, Frank|website=glbtq.com}} "Kameny [...] coined the slogan 'Gay is Good'."&lt;/ref&gt; by being openly identified with a culturally [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group; as such, it creates a discomfort.&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele|author2=Schope, Robert |title=Shifting Sands or Solid Foundation? Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Identity Formation|journal=The Health of Sexual Minorities|year=2007|volume=1 |pages=3–26|doi=10.1007/97803873133441|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}} "Not surprisingly, individuals in the pride stage are most criticized not only by heterosexual persons but also many LGBT individuals, who are uncomfortable forcing the majority to share the discomfort. Heterosexual individuals may express bewilderment at the term “gay pride,” arguing that they do not talk about “straight pride”".&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the terms ''straight pride'' and ''heterosexual pride'' exist as an argument criticizing gay pride as unnecessary, stating by contrast with [[heterosexuality]] that heterosexuals "don't talk about straight pride",&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"/&gt; don't have "straight pride rallies",&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt; and would be seen as ridiculous if they were to "band together and have a heterosexual pride [...] parade".&lt;ref name="kainz"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRYkYduABiQC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;f=false|author=[[Howard Kainz|Howard P. Kainz]]|title=Politically Incorrect Dialogues: Topics Not Discussed in Polite Circles|isbn=978-9042006867|year=1999}}, p.39. One of the two fictional philosophers in the dialogs states: "If, for example, heterosexuals were to band together and have a 'heterosexual pride' (or '"straight" pride') parade, it would be recognized immediately as dumb and ridiculous."&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''[[appeal to ridicule]]'' argument expresses the idea that showing pride for a homosexual orientation is equally absurd. Analysts of LGBT rights state as a counter-argument that mainstream culture offers many [[heteronormativity|approved social venues]] (weddings, baptism, family reunions...) for heterosexuals to express and celebrate their sexual orientation in public, while homosexuals usually feel isolated and [[pride parade]]s offer them support and an opportunity for socializing.&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt;

=== Straight pride events ===
[[File:Man-and-woman-icon.svg|thumb|100px|right|An image often used on Straight Pride T-shirts]]
"Heterosexual pride" parades exist as a response to societal acceptance of LGBT visibility, and originated in campuses in the 1990s as a backlash tactic.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts.

"A relatively recent tactic used in the backlash opposing les/bi/gay/trans campus visibility is the so-called "heterosexual pride" strategy".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ChicagoTribune1"/&gt;

Incidents where the slogan or concept of "Straight pride" caused controversy have occurred since the late 1980s. In 1988, for example, [[Vermont]] Republican John Burger asked the state's Governor to establish a "Straight Pride Day".&lt;ref name="vermont1988"/&gt;  In 1990, rallies in support of Straight Pride were held at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (organized by the group Young Americans for Freedom) and nearby [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref name="straigh1"&gt;(6 May 1990).

*'''Yellowknife, NWT (2005)''':  In May 2005, the northern Canadian city of [[Yellowknife]] announced that it would mark both a gay and straight pride day.&lt;ref name = "Yellowknife"&gt;{{cite news | title = Yellowknife to mark gay and straight pride | work = CBCnews Canada | date = May 25, 2005 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2005/05/25/yellowknife-gaypride050525.html | accessdate = 2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the mayor proclaimed June 10, 2005 as Gay Pride Day, Councillor Alan Woytuik proposed that there be a Heterosexual Day.  The mayor agreed and set it for June 9.  Woytuik defended the proposal for Heterosexual Day by stating that "recognizing the contributions of heterosexuals is just as legitimate as recognizing the contributions of gay and lesbian communities."  The group seeking the Gay Pride Day designation was dismayed, asking if Black History Month would be partnered with White Heritage Month and whether days marking heart disease and strokes should be paired with days celebrating good health&lt;ref name = "Yellowknife" /&gt;  Woytuik's request for Heterosexual Day was widely reported on.  Shocked by the attention, he withdrew his request for the proclamation and apologized.  He referred to his request as a simple one seeking to treat everyone the same which was blown out of proportion.  The city subsequently rescinded its proclamation of Heterosexual Day.&lt;ref name = "rescinded" &gt;{{cite news | title = 'Shocked' councillor withdraws Straight Pride motion | work = CBC News North | date = May 30, 2005 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/story/2005/05/30/yellowknife-gay-day-30052005.html | accessdate = 2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Woodbury High School (Minnesota)|Woodbury High School]] in [[Woodbury, Minnesota]], a suburb of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], created homophobia-free areas called "safe zones" designated by an inverted [[pink triangle]] and intended for LGBT students.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|title=Student wins right to show 'straight pride'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1381953/Student-wins-right-to-show-straight-pride.html|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Student Elliot Chambers reacted by wearing a makeshift sweatshirt with the slogan "Straight Pride" and the image of male and female [[stick figure]]s holding hands.   In light of previous anti-LGBT incidents, the school's principal ordered Chambers to remove the shirt, and a court case ensued.&lt;ref name="Ayres" /&gt;  A court upheld Chambers' complaint that his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights had been violated, and that the principal's decision was unjustified.&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ayres | first1 = Ian | last2 = Brown | first2 = Jennifer Gerarda | title = Straightforward: how to mobilize heterosexual support for gay rights (Google eBook) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | location = Princeton, NJ

In 2010, in response to local suicides amongst LGBT adolescents, an [[Ally Week]] was held at [[St. Charles North High School]] in [[St. Charles, Illinois]].  On the first day of this Ally Week, though, three students arrived wearing "Straight Pride" t-shirts.  The back of these t-shirts displayed "[[s:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:13]]", the verse stating that those who perform homosexual acts should be put to death.  While the school did not force the students to remove their t-shirts, it did persuade them to remove the bible quotation.  The following day two different students arrived wearing "Straight Pride" t-shirts minus the Bible quotations and were consequently asked to remove their shirts.&lt;ref name="dailyherald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=James|title=‘Straight Pride' shirts become free speech fight at St. Charles North|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101110/news/711119792/|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rightseducation&gt;&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/12/chicago-high-school-uses-straight-pride-shirts-rights-education/  Chicago High School Uses 'Straight Pride' Shirts for Rights Education

===Balancing freedom of expression vs. protection of students===

In school environments, straight pride expressions and events have been reviewed within a framework of balancing freedom of expression with protection of other students.  In some situations, schools take actions against students who are open about or encourage hiding homosexuality, or limit clothing that has references to sexual orientation.  Such may prompt lawsuits.&lt;ref name = SchoolLegal/&gt; In the  Minnesota Chambers v. Babbitt case, "The court noted that maintaining a school community of tolerance includes tolerance of such viewpoints as expressed by 'Straight Pride' as well as tolerance of homosexuality."&lt;ref name = SchoolLegal&gt;http://www.iog.unc.edu/pubs/electronicversions/pg/pgspsm06/article2.pdf Schools’  Legal Obligations to Gay Students by  Laurie L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14566">'''T_Visionarium''' is an art installation by [[Neil Brown (artist)|Neil Brown]], [[Dennis Del Favero]], [[Jeffrey Shaw]] and [[Peter Weibel]] developed through the [[iCinema]] Centre for Interactive Cinema Research at The [[University of New South Wales]] in co-operation with [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Center for Art and Media]], Karlsruhe.

In contrast to conventional cinema, where viewers passively watch a singular linear story unfold on a flat screen, T_Visionarium allows viewers to explore and edit a multitude of stories, in 3 dimensions, on a 360-degree fully surrounding screen.

T_Visionarium takes two forms. The first version, T_Visionarium I (2003), is set within an inflatable dome, named EVE or the Extended Virtual Environment, 12 metres wide and 9 metres high. This immersive environment was invented by Shaw in 1993. Once inside EVE viewers wear a head mounted position tracking device and headphones and step onto a control platform in the middle of the dome. This interface device enables the viewer's head movements to control the movement of the projection system. By moving the direction of their head, and hence their gaze, viewers navigate around the images projected onto the interior of the dome.

The second version, T_Visionarium II (2008), is set within AVIE, or the Advanced Visualisation and Interaction Environment. AVIE is the world's first 360 degree stereoscopic projection cinema &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. AVIE is a 120-square metre circular screen that surrounds the audience and provides the environment for a wholly immersive three-dimensional cinematic experience. AVIE allows audiences to wander at will through the projection space without having to sit in a fixed location as in a conventional cinema or to stand on a control platform as in T_Visionarium I, interacting with the projected information as if they are really there &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Viewers wearing three-dimensional glasses step inside a cylindrical cinema screen measuring four metres high and 10 metres in diameter. Twelve digital projectors create a high-resolution stereoscopic 3D image on this screen, and the audio is spatially enhanced via a 24- channel surround sound system.

==iCinema==
The Director of the Centre is Dennis Del Favero. It was founded in 2002 by Jeffrey Shaw, Dennis Del Favero and Neil Brown and is a unique multi-disciplinary joint venture of the College for Fine Arts, the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at The University of New South Wales. The iCinema Centre comprises over 20 research staff and 16 research students working together across the disciplines of [[new media]], [[aesthetics]], [[experimental art]], [[film theory]], multimedia design, [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] engineering.

The iCinema research program focuses on research into digital interactivity for benchmark applications across the arts, culture and industry. This includes research into: 
* Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the theoretical and experimental investigation of the differentiated structures of narrative brought about by the digital;
* Immersive Visualisation Systems, involving the research and development of mixed reality environments;
* Distributed Interface Systems, involving the integration of distributed multi-user environment within networked systems; and
* Theories of Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the inquiry into digital systems in the context of the contemporary world.

==Funding==
The T_Visionarium project was funded by an [[Australian Research Council]] Discovery Grant, and co-produced with the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Center for Art and Media]], Karlsruhe, Germany
.

==Exhibitions==
T_Visionarium I was premiered at EuroLille, Lille, France, as part of the 2004 European Cultural Capital Lille Festival. Since then the work has been exhibited at Casa Dell'Architettura, Rome, Italy, as part of the 2006 La Rivoluzione Algorithmica exhibition. T_Visionarium II was premiered at the iCinema Scientia Facility at The University of New South Wales in January 2008 as part of the [[Sydney Festival]]. In November 2009, T_Visionarium was exhibited in Amsterdam, at the [[Zuiderkerk]].

==T_Visionarium I and T_Visionarium II==
For the T_Visionarium I project researchers at iCinema captured 24 hours of European television, for T_Visionarium II 28 hours of digital free to air [[Australian]] television, both over a period of one week. This footage was segmented and converted into a massive database, in the latter case containing over 20,000 video clips.

Each video clip was then tagged with descriptors known as [[metadata]], which define the properties of the clip. Information can be encoded such as the gender of the actors, the dominant emotions they are expressing, the pace of the scene, and specific actions such as standing up, lying down, or telephoning. Having the video data segmented in this way deconstructs the television's original linear narrative into components that then become building blocks that the viewer can associate and re-assemble in an infinite number of ways &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

In T_Visionarium I, the viewer is able to search this database of television recordings via a touch screen menu using a keyword search. The software then reassembles these clips over the entire projection surface of EVE, generating relationships between clips based on the viewer's keyword search.

In T_Visionarium II over three hundred video clips are simultaneously displayed and distributed around AVIE's circular screen. Using a specially designed interface, the viewer can trigger and reassemble clips from the database by selecting a particular video clip from those displayed. The archive of video clips then reassembles themselves within the 3D immersive space of AVIE based on their relationship to this selection. Those clips with the strongest relationship to the selection are triggered from the archive and cluster around the particular clip, whilst those with weaker relationships shift away from the clip &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

Rather than the keyword search of T_Visionarium I, T_Visionarium II allows for associative and affective searches. This latter search is based on the visual or emotional characteristics of the clip selected, rather than based on semantic information.

The decontextualisation of the television clips fractures the medium's imaging of the world. Rather than the definite representation of the world proposed by television's linear narrative logic, in T_Visionarium, the viewer is confronted with a world represented as a complex of data, of emergent narrative events, rather than mediated as a prefabricated linear narrative &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Aesthetics==
The T_Visionarium project is framed by the concept of aesthetic transcription, that is, the way new meaning can be produced is based on how content moves from one expressive medium to another &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is seen throughout art history where an artist recreates motifs from another artist's work (for an instance of this one can cite the apparent evolution from the goddess figure, say Venus, in archaic Greek sculpture to its conception in the classical period through to its appearance in renaissance oil painting). The concept of aesthetic transcription treats each adoption of techniques or cultural data as differentiated in itself, as something new, rather than as an imitation of what went before &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;.  In T_Visionarium, the digital allows the transcription of televisual data, decontextualising the original data, and reconstituting it within a new artifact. In other words, the archiving abilities of the digital allow data to be changed from its original conception as firstly, new narrative relationships generated between the multitudes of archived data and secondly, as meaningful narrative events that emerge as a result of viewer interaction.

Following [[Roland Barthes]]' famous essay "The Death of the Author", this work, rather than being the product of a single author, allows aesthetic negotiations to occur between audience and text. It enables an emergent bond between artist, audience, and the work. In this way, T_Visionarium provides not just a recognition of the artist and the audience's part in the formation of art, but also the constitutive role of the particular media &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;. In T_Visionarium, the artist sets the initial conditions for interaction and the viewer and the technology are responsible for the formation of the art event.

The T_Visionarium project also proposes a re-evaluation of narrative in the digital. Del Favero, Brown, Shaw and Weibel have explained that traditionally narrative is conceptualized as mono-temporal and linear whereas interactive narrative is commonly understood as non-linear. In contrast to this, in T_Visionarium narrative is to be understood as "multi-temporal", a concept that alleviates the sharp distinction between linear and non-linear narratives &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;. They explain this concept as the mingling of virtual time and real time. This occurs in T_Visionarium as the viewer searches the televisual database in virtual time and experiences the consequences of this navigation in real time. Tim Barker builds on this description to situate the "multi-temporal" in T_Visionarium as the consequence of the viewer's ability to access multiple temporal episodes simultaneously. As each television clip represents different time periods, the result of accessing these all at once is what he refers to as a "multi-temporal duration", a duration of time that is made up of multiple and differentiated representations of time &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;. In this model of interaction, the viewer and the database form "…a digital ecology able to generate unprecedented aesthetic and social meanings" &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, the viewer and the database of T_Visionarium collaborate to generate the narrative events that constitute T_Visionarium.

==Applications==
The unique way that T_Visionarium uses AVIE to navigate and articulate vast amounts of audiovisual data is significant for the cultural, entertainment, education and industrial sectors &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. Particular examples of this are the licensing of AVIE systems to Mines Rescue Pty Ltd as a mines safety training device &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25272">In [[mathematics]], [[logic]], and [[computer science]], '''type theory''' is a branch of [[computational logic]] that studies types, which informally, are attributes that objects can possess. In type theory, each object is a "term" of a definite type and operations on objects are restricted to those which are definitely terms of the relevant types. As a [[formal system]], some type theories contend to be simultaneously an alternative [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]] to [[set theory]], a [[programming language]] and a calculus for [[category theory]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Type theory is closely related to (and in some cases overlaps with) [[type system]]s, which are a [[programming language]] feature used to reduce [[bug (computer programming)|bug]]s. Type theory was created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.

Two well-known type theories that can serve as mathematical foundations are [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[typed lambda calculus|typed λ-calculus]] and [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]].

==History==
{{Main|History of type theory}}
Between 1902 and 1908 [[Bertrand Russell]] proposed various "theories of type" in response to his discovery that [[Gottlob Frege]]'s version of [[naive set theory]] was afflicted with [[Russell's paradox]]. By 1908 Russell arrived at a "ramified" theory of types together with an "[[axiom of reducibility]]" both of which featured prominently in [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' published between 1910 and 1913. They attempted to resolve Russell's paradox by first creating a hierarchy of types, then assigning each concrete mathematical (and possibly other) entity to a type. Entities of a given type are built exclusively from entities of those types that are lower in their hierarchy, thus preventing an entity from being assigned to itself. In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]] and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] proposed an unramified type theory, now known as the "theory of simple types" or "simple type theory", that collapsed the hierarchy of the types in the earlier ramified theory and as such did not require the axiom of reducibility.

The common usage of "type theory" is when those types are used with a [[term rewrite system]]. The most famous early example is [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Church's theory of types&lt;ref name="church"&gt;[[Alonzo Church]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2266170 ''A formulation of the simple theory of types''], The Journal of Symbolic Logic 5(2):56&amp;ndash;68 (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; helped the formal system avoid the [[Kleene–Rosser paradox]] that afflicted the original untyped lambda calculus. Church demonstrated that it could serve as a foundation of mathematics and it was referred to as a [[higher-order logic]].

Some other type theories include [[Per Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]], which has been the foundation used in some areas of [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructive mathematics]] and for the proof assistant [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]]. [[Thierry Coquand]]'s [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are the foundation used by [[Coq]] and others. The field is an area of active research, as demonstrated by [[homotopy type theory]].

==Basic concepts==
In a system of type theory, each '''[[term (logic)|term]]''' has a '''type'''.  For example, &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; are all separate terms with the type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt; for natural numbers.  Traditionally, the term is followed by a colon and its type, such as &lt;math&gt;2 : \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.

Type theories have explicit computation and it is encoded in rules for rewriting terms. These are called '''conversion rules''' or, if the rule only works in one direction, a '''reduction rule'''. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; are syntactically different terms, but the former reduces to the latter. This reduction is written &lt;math&gt;2 + 2 \twoheadrightarrow 4&lt;/math&gt;.

Functions in type theory have a special reduction rule: the argument of the function call gets substituted for every occurrence of the parameter in the function definition.  Let's say the function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\lambda x . x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using Church's lambda notation) or &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x+x &lt;/math&gt; (using a more modern notation).  Then, the function call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt; would be reduced by substituting &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; for every copy of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the body of the function definition.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2 \twoheadrightarrow 2+2&lt;/math&gt;.

The type of a function is denoted with an arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; from the parameter type to the function's resulting type. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double} : \mathrm{nat} \to \mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;.   Calling or "[[apply]]ing" a function to an argument may be written with or without parentheses, so &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}(2)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{double}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;. Not using parentheses is more common, because multiple argument functions can be defined using [[currying]].

==Difference from set theory==
There are many different set theories and many different systems of type theory, so what follows are generalizations.
* Set theory is built on top of logic. It requires a separate system like [[predicate logic]] underneath it. In type theory, concepts like "and" and "or" can be encoded as types in the type theory itself.
* In set theory, an element can belong to multiple sets, either to a subset or to a superset. In type theory, terms (generally) belong to only one type. (Where a subset would be used, type theory tends to use a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate function]] that returns true if the term is in the subset and returns false if the value is not.  The union of two types can be done by creating a new type called a [[Tagged union|sum type]], which contains new terms.)
* Set theory usually encodes numbers as sets.  (0 is the empty set, 1 is a set containing the empty set, etc.  See [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]].) Type theory can encode numbers as functions using [[Church encoding]] or more naturally as [[Intuitionistic type theory#Inductive types|inductive types]].  Inductive types create new constants for the [[Successor function|successor function]] and zero, and closely resembles [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]].
* Set theory allows [[Set-builder notation|set builder notation]].
* Type theory has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].  It can be connected to logic by the [[Curry Howard isomorphism]].  And some type theories are closely connected to [[Category theory]].

==Optional features==
===Normalization===
The term &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; reduces to &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; cannot be reduced further, it is called a '''normal form'''. A system of type theory is said to be '''[[Normalization property (abstract rewriting)|strongly normalizing]]''' if all terms have a normal form and any order of reductions reaches it. '''Weakly normalizing''' systems have a normal form but some orders of reductions may loop forever and never reach it.

For a normalizing system, some borrow the word '''element''' from set theory and use it to refer to all closed terms that can reduce to the same normal form. A '''closed term''' is one without parameters. (A term like &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; with its parameter &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called an '''open term'''.) Thus, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3 + 0&lt;/math&gt; may be different terms but they are both from the element &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;.

A similar idea that works for open and closed terms is convertibility. Two terms are '''convertible''' if there exists a term that they both reduce to. For example, &lt;math&gt;2 + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + 2&lt;/math&gt; are convertible. As are &lt;math&gt;x + (1 + 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 2&lt;/math&gt;. However, &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 + x&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a free variable) are not because both are in normal form and they are not the same. [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|Confluent]] and weakly normalizing systems can test if two terms are convertible by checking if they both reduce to the same normal form.

===Dependent types===
{{Main|Dependent types}}
A '''dependent type''' is a type that depends on a term or on another type. Thus, the type returned by a function may depend upon the argument to the function.

For example, a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 4 may be a different type than a list of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;s of length 5. In a type theory with dependent types, it is possible to define a function that takes a parameter "n" and returns a list containing "n" zeros. Calling the function with 4 would produce a term with a different type than if the function was called with 5.

Dependent types play a central role in [[intuitionistic type theory]] and in the design of [[functional programming languages]] like [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]].

{{anchor|Equality types}}

===Equality types===

Many systems of type theory have a type that represents equality of types and of terms. This type is different from convertibility, and is often denoted '''propositional equality'''.

In intuitionistic type theory, the equality type (also called the identity type) is known as &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; for identity. There is a type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a type and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are both terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. A term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ A\ a\ b&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as meaning that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

In practice, it is possible to build a type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4&lt;/math&gt; but there will not exist a term of that type. In intuitionistic type theory, new terms of equality start with reflexivity. If &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. More complicated equalities can be created by creating a reflexive term and then doing a reduction on one side. So if &lt;math&gt;2+1&lt;/math&gt; is a term of type &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{nat}&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ (2+1)&lt;/math&gt; and, by reduction, generate a term of type &lt;math&gt;I\ \mathrm{nat}\ (2+1)\ 3&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in this system, the equality type denotes that two values of the same type are convertible by reductions.

Having a type for equality is important because it can be manipulated inside the system. There is usually no judgement to say two terms are ''not'' equal; instead, as in the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], we map &lt;math&gt;\neg(a = b)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(a = b) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bottom type]] having no values. There exists a term with type {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 4) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;,}} but not one of type &lt;math&gt;(I\ \mathrm{nat}\ 3\ 3) \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Homotopy type theory]] differs from [[intuitionistic type theory]] mostly by its handling of the equality type.

===Inductive types===
{{main|Inductive type}}
A system of type theory requires some basic terms and types to operate on. Some systems build them out of functions using [[Church encoding]]. Other systems have '''inductive types''': a set of base types and a set of [[type constructor]]s that generate types with well-behaved properties. For example, [[Structural induction|certain recursive functions]] called on inductive types are guaranteed to terminate.

'''Coinductive type''' are infinite data types created by giving a function that generates the next element(s). See [[Coinduction]] and [[Corecursion]].

'''[[Induction-induction]] ''' is a feature for declaring an inductive type and a family of types that depends on the inductive type.

'''[[Induction-recursion (type theory)|Induction recursion]]''' allows a wider range of well-behaved types, allowing the type and recursive functions operating on it to be defined at the same time.

===Universe types===
Types were created to prevent paradoxes, such as [[Russell's paradox]]. However, the motives that lead to those paradoxes—being able to say things about all types—still exist. So, many type theories have a "universe type", which contains all ''other'' types (and not itself).

In systems where you might want to say something about universe types, there is a hierarchy of universe types, each containing the one below it in the hierarchy. The hierarchy is defined as being infinite, but statements must only refer to a finite number of universe levels.

Type universes are particularly tricky in type theory. The initial proposal of intuitionistic type theory suffered from [[Girard's paradox]].

===Computational component===
Many systems of type theory, such as the [[simply-typed lambda calculus]], [[intuitionistic type theory]], and the [[calculus of constructions]], are also programming languages. That is, they are said to have a "computational component". The computation is the reduction of terms of the language using [[rewriting|rewriting rules]].

A system of type theory that has a well-behaved computational component also has a simple connection to constructive mathematics through the [[BHK interpretation]].

Non-constructive mathematics in these systems is possible by adding operators on continuations such as [[Call/cc#Relation to non-constructive logic|call with current continuation]]. However, these operators tend to break desirable properties such as [[canonicity (type theory)|canonicity]] and [[parametricity]].

==Type theories==
===Major===
* [[Simply typed lambda calculus]] which is a [[higher-order logic]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]];
* [[system F]];
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is often used to define other type theories;
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives.

===Minor===
* [[Automath]];
* [[ST type theory]];
* some forms of [[combinatory logic]];
* others defined in the [[lambda cube]];
* others under the name [[typed lambda calculus]];
* others under the name [[pure type system]].

===Active===
* [[Homotopy type theory]] is being researched.

==Practical impact==
===Programming languages===
{{Main|Type system}}
There is extensive overlap and interaction between the fields of type theory and type systems. Type systems are a programming language feature designed to identify bugs. Any static program analysis, such as the type checking algorithms in the semantic analysis phase of [[compiler]], has a connection to type theory.

A prime example is [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]], a programming language which uses [[intuitionistic type theory]] for its type system. The programming language [[ML (programming language)|ML]] was developed for manipulating type theories (see [[Logic for Computable Functions|LCF]]) and its own type system was heavily influenced by them.

===Mathematical foundations===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
The first computer proof assistant, called [[Automath]], used type theory to encode mathematics on a computer. Martin-Löf specifically developed [[intuitionistic type theory]] to encode ''all'' mathematics to serve as a new foundation for mathematics. There is current research into mathematical foundations using [[homotopy type theory]].

Mathematicians working in [[category theory]] already had difficulty working with the widely accepted foundation of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]. This led to proposals such as Lawvere's [[Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets]] (ETCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=ETCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homotopy type theory continues in this line using type theory. Researchers are exploring connections between dependent types (especially the identity type) and [[algebraic topology]] (specifically [[homotopy]]).

===Proof assistants===
{{main|Proof assistant}}
Much of the current research into type theory is driven by [[Automated proof checking|proof checkers]], interactive [[proof assistant]]s, and [[Automated theorem proving|automated theorem provers]]. Most of these systems use a type theory as the mathematical foundation for encoding proofs, which is not surprising, given the close connection between type theory and programming languages:
* [[Logical framework|LF]] is used by [[Twelf]], often to define other type theories;
* multiple type theories falling under [[higher-order logic]] are used by the [[HOL (proof assistant)|HOL family of provers]] and [[Prototype Verification System|PVS]];
* [[intuitionistic type theory]] is used by [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]] which is both a programming language and proof assistant;
* computational type theory is used by [[NuPRL]];
* [[calculus of constructions]] and its derivatives are used by [[Coq]] and [[Matita]].

Multiple type theories are supported by [[LEGO (proof assistant)|LEGO]] and [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]]. Isabelle also supports foundations besides type theories, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. [[Mizar system|Mizar]] is an example of a proof system that only supports set theory.

===Linguistics===
Type theory is also widely in use in [[formal semantics (linguistics)|formal theories of semantics]] of [[natural language]]s, especially [[Montague grammar]] and its descendants. In particular, [[categorial grammar]]s and [[pregroup grammar]]s make extensive use of type constructors to define the types (''noun'', ''verb'', etc.) of words.

The most common construction takes the basic types &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for individuals and [[truth-value]]s, respectively, and defines the set of types recursively as follows:
* if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are types, then so is &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;;
* nothing except the basic types, and what can be constructed from them by means of the previous clause are types.

A complex type &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the type of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] from entities of type &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to entities of type &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus one has types like &lt;math&gt;\langle e,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; which are interpreted as elements of the set of functions from entities to truth-values, i.e. [[indicator function]]s of sets of entities. An expression of type &lt;math&gt;\langle\langle e,t\rangle,t\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is a function from sets of entities to truth-values, i.e. a (indicator function of a) set of sets. This latter type is standardly taken to be the type of [[Generalized quantifier|natural language quantifiers]], like '' everybody'' or '' nobody'' ([[Richard Montague|Montague]] 1973, [[Jon Barwise|Barwise]] and Cooper 1981).

===Social sciences===
[[Gregory Bateson]] introduced a theory of logical types into the social sciences; his notions of [[double bind]] and [[logical levels]] are based on Russell's theory of types.

==Relation to category theory==
Although the initial motivation for [[category theory]] was far removed from foundationalism, the two fields turned out to have deep connections. As [[John Lane Bell]] writes: "In fact categories can ''themselves'' be viewed as type theories of a certain kind; this fact alone indicates that type theory is much more closely related to category theory than it is to set theory." In brief, a category can be viewed as a type theory by regarding its objects as types (or sorts), i.e. "Roughly speaking, a category may be thought of as a type theory shorn of its syntax." A number of significant results follow in this way:&lt;ref name="Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of the History of Logic. Volume 6. Sets and Extensions in the Twentieth Century|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-093066-4| author=John L. Bell|chapter=Types, Sets and Categories | url = http://publish.uwo.ca/~jbell/types.pdf |editor=Akihiro Kanamory}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cartesian closed category|cartesian closed categories]] correspond to the typed λ-calculus ([[Lambek]], 1970);
* [[C-monoid]]s (categories with products and exponentials and a single, nonterminal object) correspond to the untyped λ-calculus (observed independently by Lambek and [[Dana Scott]] around 1980);
* [[Locally cartesian closed category|locally cartesian closed categories]] correspond to [[Martin-Löf type theory|Martin-Löf type theories]] (Seely, 1984).

The interplay, known as [[categorical logic]], has been a subject of active research since then; see the monograph of Jacobs (1999) for instance.

'''Self and Identity''' is a subfield of [[psychology]]. As the name implies, it deals with topics pertaining to both [[self (psychology)|self]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]]. Key areas of investigation include [[self-concept]], [[self-esteem]], and [[self-control]].

What distinguishes self and identity as a discipline is its [[science|scientific]] character. Emphasis is placed on the empirical testing of systematic theories about relevant phenomena. Hence, its methodological approach differs from both [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]].
 
Self and Identity incorporates elements from different areas of psychology. However, it owes particularly large debt to [[personality psychology]] and [[social psychology]].

==Individual level analysis of the self==
There are levels of analysis that one can look at self and identity. One level of analysis is the self on the individual level, for example, self-states, self-motives, [[self-esteem]], [[self-efficacy]], etc. Self-states are self-process that include unbiased self-awareness. However, self-motives are more serious impulses to action, something that is innate and Societal or cultural analysis of the self.
The other level of analysis is on the societal or cultural level, for example, the cultural conception of a person, cultural arrangements that make the person who they are and the cultural concept of self. &lt;ref&gt;Ashmore, R. D., &amp; Jussim, L. (Eds.). (1997). Self and Identity: Fundamental Issues. Cary, NC, USA: Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://www.ebrary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Self and identity are highly contingent upon culture. In industrialized Western cultures, the concept of self is based solely on independence.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, D. G. (2015). Exploring Social Psychology, 7th Edition. New York: McGraw Hill Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''windmill''' is a mill that converts the [[wind power|energy of wind]] into [[rotational energy]] by means of vanes called [[windmill sail|sails]] or blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Mill |title=Mill definition |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/windmill |title=Windmill definition stating that a windmill is a mill or machine operated by the wind |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries ago, windmills usually were used to [[mill (grinding)|mill]] grain ([[gristmill]]s), pump water ([[windpump]]s), or both.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gregory, R. The Industrial Windmill in Britain. Phillimore, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of modern windmills take the form of [[wind turbine]]s used to generate electricity, or [[windpump]]s used to pump water, either for land drainage or to extract [[groundwater]].

== Windmills in antiquity ==
[[File:Heron's Windwheel.jpg|thumb|[[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]]'s wind-powered [[Organ (music)|organ]].]]

The windwheel of the [[Ancient Greek technology|Greek]] engineer [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the first century is the earliest known instance of using a wind-driven wheel to power a machine.&lt;ref name="Lohrmann 10f."&gt;Dietrich Lohrmann, "Von der östlichen zur westlichen Windmühle", ''Archiv für Kulturgeschichte'', Vol. 77, Issue 1  (1995), pp.1-30 (10f.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drachmann"&gt;A.G. Drachmann, "Heron's Windmill", ''Centaurus'', 7 (1961), pp. 145-151&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of a wind-driven wheel was the [[prayer wheel]], which has been used in [[Tibet]] and [[China]] since the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Lucas2006"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been claimed that the [[Babylonia]]n emperor [[Hammurabi]] planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the seventeenth century BCE.&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sathyajith|first=Mathew|title=Wind Energy: Fundamentals, Resource Analysis and Economics|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-30905-5|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Horizontal windmills ==

The first practical windmills had sails that rotated in a horizontal plane, around a vertical axis.&lt;ref name="Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills pp125-145"&gt;Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills. London, Transactions of the Newcomen Society vol.XL 1967-68 pp125-145&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, these [[panemone windmill]]s were invented in eastern [[Greater Iran|Persia]], or [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], as recorded by the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Persian]] geographer [[Estakhri]] in the ninth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=3609 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619044301/http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=3609 |date=June 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Hassan, Hill, p.54f."&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986). ''Islamic Technology: An illustrated history'', p. 54. [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-521-42239-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Ferdinand, “The Horizontal Windmills of Western Afghanistan,” Folk 5, 1963, pp. 71-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The authenticity of an earlier anecdote of a windmill involving the second [[caliph]] [[Umar]] (AD 634–644) is questioned on the grounds that it appears in a tenth-century document.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich Lohrmann, "Von der östlichen zur westlichen Windmühle", ''Archiv für Kulturgeschichte'', Vol. 77, Issue 1 (1995), pp.&amp;nbsp;1–30 (8)&lt;/ref&gt; Made of six to 12 sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grain or draw up water, and were quite different from the later European vertical windmills. Windmills were in widespread use across the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]], and later spread to China and [[Indian subcontinent|India]] from there.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;64–69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar type of horizontal windmill with rectangular blades, used for irrigation, can also be found in thirteenth-century China (during the [[Jurchen Jin dynasty]] in the north), introduced by the travels of [[Yelü Chucai]] to [[Turkestan]] in 1219.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 560"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal windmills were built, in small numbers, in Europe during the 18th and nineteenth centuries,&lt;ref name="Wailes, R. Horizontal Windmills pp125-145"/&gt; for example [[Fowler's Mill]] at [[Battersea]] in London, and Hooper's Mill at [[History of Margate#Windmills|Margate]] in Kent. These early modern examples seem not to have been directly influenced by the horizontal windmills of the Middle and Far East, but to have been independent inventions by engineers influenced by the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, R L. Power from Wind: A History of Windmill Technology. Cambridge University Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertical windmills ==
Due to a lack of evidence, debate occurs among historians as to whether or not Middle Eastern horizontal windmills triggered the original development of European windmills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Shadows in the Desert|first=Kaveh|last=Farrokh|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2007|isbn=1-84603-108-7|page=280|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr. ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 86 &amp; p. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |pages=106–7 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=History of, and Recent Progress in, Wind-Energy Utilization|author=[[Bent Sørensen (physicist)|Bent Sorensen]]|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|volume=20|issue=1|pages=387–424|date=November 1995|doi=10.1146/annurev.eg.20.110195.002131|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In northwestern [[Europe]], the horizontal-axis or vertical windmill (so called due to the plane of the movement of its sails) is believed to date from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the triangle of northern France, eastern England and [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. I: The Structure of Everyday Life|page=358|authorlink=Fernand Braudel|first1=Fernand|last1= Braudel|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=9780520081147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest certain reference to a windmill in Europe (assumed to have been of the vertical type) dates from 1185, in the former village of Weedley in Yorkshire which was located at the southern tip of the [[The Wolds|Wold]] overlooking the [[Humber Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurence Turner|first=Roy Gregory|title=Windmills of Yorkshire|year=2009|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|location=Catrine, East Ayrshire|isbn=9781840334753|page=2|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk/books/view_book.php?ref=687}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of earlier, but less certainly dated, twelfth-century European sources referring to windmills have also been found.&lt;ref name="Price2005"&gt;Lynn White Jr., ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
These earliest mills were used to [[gristmill|grind cereals]].&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006" /&gt;

=== Post mill ===
{{main|Post mill}}
The evidence at present is that the earliest type of European windmill was the post mill, so named because of the large upright post on which the mill's main structure (the "body" or "buck") is balanced. By mounting the body this way, the mill is able to rotate to face the wind direction; an essential requirement for windmills to operate economically in north-western Europe, where wind directions are variable. The body contains all the milling machinery. The first post mills were of the sunken type, where the post was buried in an earth mound to support it. Later, a wooden support was developed called the [[trestle (mill)|trestle]]. This was often covered over or surrounded by a roundhouse to protect the trestle from the weather and to provide storage space. This type of windmill was the most common in Europe until the nineteenth century, when more powerful [[tower mill|tower]] and [[smock mill]]s replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Power from wind: a history of windmill technology, (1996), 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hollow-post mill ====
In a hollow-post mill, the post on which the body is mounted is hollowed out, to accommodate the drive shaft.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This makes it possible to drive machinery below or outside the body while still being able to rotate the body into the wind. Hollow-post mills driving scoop wheels were used in the Netherlands to drain wetlands from the fourteenth century onwards.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Tower mill ===
{{main|Tower mill}}
[[File:Molinos de Consuegra.jpg|right|thumb|Tower mills in Spain]]
By the end of the thirteenth century, the masonry [[tower mill]], on which only the cap is rotated rather than the whole body of the mill, had been introduced. The spread of tower mills came with a growing economy that called for larger and more stable sources of power, though they were more expensive to build. In contrast to the post mill, only the cap of the tower mill needs to be turned into the wind, so the main structure can be made much taller, allowing the sails to be made longer, which enables them to provide useful work even in low winds. The cap can be turned into the wind either by winches or gearing inside the cap or from a winch on the tail pole outside the mill. A method of keeping the cap and sails into the wind automatically is by using a [[Windmill fantail|fantail]], a small windmill mounted at right angles to the sails, at the rear of the windmill. These are also fitted to tail poles of post mills and are common in Great Britain and English-speaking countries of the former British Empire, Denmark, and Germany but rare in other places. Around some parts of the Mediterranean Sea, tower mills with fixed caps were built because the wind's direction varied little most of the time.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== Smock mill ===
{{main|Smock mill}}
[[File:Greetsieler Zwillingsmühlen 2010.jpg|thumb|Two [[smock mill]]s with a stage in [[Greetsiel]], [[Germany]]]]

The smock mill is a later development of the tower mill, where the masonry tower is replaced by a wooden framework, called the "smock", which is thatched, boarded or covered by other materials, such as [[roofing slate|slate]], [[sheet metal]], or [[tar paper]]. The smock is commonly of octagonal plan, though there are examples with different numbers of sides. The lighter weight than tower mills make smock mills practical as drainage mills, which often had to be built in areas with unstable subsoil. Smock mills originated for drainage, but are also used for other purposes. When used in a built-up area it is often placed on a masonry base to raise it above the surrounding buildings.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

== Mechanics ==

=== Sails ===
{{main|Windmill sail}}
[[File:Kuremaa mõisa tuuleveski.jpg|thumb|Windmill in [[Kuremaa]], [[Estonia]]]]

Common sails consist of a lattice framework on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according to the wind and the power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound in and out of a ladder type arrangement of sails. Later mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag" /&gt; The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In all cases, the mill needs to be stopped to adjust the sails. Inventions in Great Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to sails that automatically adjust to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, culminating in patent sails invented by [[William Cubitt]] in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In France, [[Pierre-Théophile Berton]] invented a system consisting of longitudinal wooden slats connected by a mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning. In the twentieth century, increased knowledge of aerodynamics from the development of the airplane led to further improvements in efficiency by German engineer Bilau and several Dutch millwrights.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}
The majority of windmills have four sails. Multiple-sailed mills, with five, six or eight sails, were built in Great Britain (especially in and around the counties of [[Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire]]), Germany, and less commonly elsewhere. Earlier multiple-sailed mills are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece, parts of Romania, Bulgaria, and Russia.&lt;ref name=Sailno&gt;{{Citation | first = Rex| last = Wailes| authorlink= Rex Wailes| year = 1954| month = | title = The English Windmill| pages = 99–104| publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul| location = London | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mill with an even number of sails has the advantage of being able to run with a damaged sail by removing both the damaged sail and the one opposite, which does not unbalance the mill.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In the Netherlands the stationary position of the sails, i.e. when the mill is not working, has long been used to give signals. A slight tilt of the sails before the main building signals joy, while a tilt after the building signals mourning. Across the Netherlands, windmills were placed in mourning position in honor of the Dutch victims of the 2014 [[Malaysian Airlines Flight 17|Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 shootdown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In somber ceremony, Dutch receive the first remains of MH17 victims|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/23/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Machinery ===
{{Main|Mill machinery}}

Gears inside a windmill convey power from the rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and rear bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth in the side of the rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In [[grist mill]]s, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each [[millstone]]. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.
The machinery differs if the windmill is used for other applications than milling grain. A [[windpump|drainage mill]] uses another set of gear wheels on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or [[Archimedes' screw]]. [[Sawmill]]s use a crankshaft to provide a reciprocating motion to the saws. Windmills have been used to power many other industrial processes, including [[papermill]]s, [[threshing]] mills, and to process oil seeds, wool, paints and stone products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the 14th century windmills became popular in Europe; the total number of wind-powered mills is estimated to have been around 200,000 at the peak in 1850, which is modest compared to some 500,000 waterwheels.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/10/history-of-industrial-windmills.html |title=Wind powered factories: history (and future) of industrial windmills |work=Low-tech Magazine |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were applied in regions where there was too little water, where rivers freeze in winter and in flat lands where the flow of the river was too slow to provide the required power.&lt;ref name="lowtechmag"/&gt; With the coming of the [[industrial revolution]], the importance of wind and water as primary industrial energy sources declined, and they were eventually replaced by steam (in [[steam mill]]s) and [[internal combustion]] engines, although windmills continued to be built in large numbers until late in the nineteenth century. More recently, windmills have been preserved for their historic value, in some cases as static exhibits when the antique machinery is too fragile to put in motion, and in other cases as fully working mills.&lt;ref name="Victorian Farm"&gt;''Victorian Farm'', Episode 1. Directed and produced by Naomi Benson. BBC Television&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 10,000 windmills in use in the Netherlands around 1850,&lt;ref name="Stockhuyzen"&gt;Endedijk, L and others. Molens, De Nieuwe Stockhuyzen. Wanders. 2007. {{ISBN|978-90-400-8785-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 1,000 are still standing. Most of these are being run by volunteers, though some grist mills are still operating commercially. Many of the drainage mills have been appointed as backup to the modern pumping stations. The [[Zaanse Schans|Zaan district]] has been said to have been the first industrialized region of the world with around 600 operating wind-powered industries by the end of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="Stockhuyzen" /&gt; Economic fluctuations and the industrial revolution had a much greater impact on these industries than on grain and drainage mills, so only very few are left.

Construction of mills spread to the [[Cape Colony]] in the seventeenth century. The early tower mills did not survive the gales of the [[Cape Peninsula]], so in 1717 the [[Heeren XVII]] sent carpenters, masons, and materials to construct a durable mill. The mill, completed in 1718, became known as the ''Oude Molen'' and was located between Pinelands Station and the Black River. Long since demolished, its name lives on as that of a Technical school in [[Pinelands, Cape Town|Pinelands]]. By 1863, Cape Town had 11 mills stretching from Paarden Eiland to [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=53 |title=Local Windmills |publisher=Mostertsmill.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808134216/http://mostertsmill.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=53 |archivedate=2013-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[wind turbine]] is a windmill-like structure specifically developed to generate electricity. They can be seen as the next step in the development of the windmill. The first wind turbines were built by the end of the nineteenth century by [[Prof James Blyth]] in [[Scotland]] (1887),&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc|title=World First for Scotland Gives Engineering Student a History Lesson|last=Shackleton|first=Jonathan|publisher=The Robert Gordon University|accessdate=20 November 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063550/http://www.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BlythProject.doc|archivedate=17 December 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles F.

La Cour's mill from 1896 later became the local powerplant of the village Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators in Denmark, ranging from 5 to 25&amp;nbsp;kW. By the 1930s, windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed, built by companies such as [[Jacobs Wind]], Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline, and Winpower. The Dunlite Corporation produced turbines for similar locations in Australia.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

The development of these 13 experimental wind turbines pioneered many of the [[wind turbine design]] technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, and partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities.  The modern [[wind power industry]] began in 1979 with the serial production of wind turbines by Danish manufacturers Kuriant, [[Vestas]], [[NEG Micon|Nordtank]], and [[Siemens|Bonus]]. These early turbines were small by today's standards, with capacities of 20–30&amp;nbsp;kW each. Since then, commercial turbines have increased greatly in size, with the Enercon E-126 capable of delivering up to 7 MW, while wind turbine production has expanded to many countries.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

As the 21st century began, rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]]. Worldwide, many thousands of wind turbines are now operating, with a total [[nameplate capacity]] of 194,400&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;Global wind energy council&lt;/ref&gt; [[wind power in Europe|Europe]] accounted for 48% of the total in 2009.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

== Windpumps ==
{{Main|Windpump}}
[[File:Old Windmill.jpg|thumb|[[Aermotor Windmill Company|Aermotor]]-style windpump in [[South Dakota]], USA]]
Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wind pumps became widespread across the [[Muslim world]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[East Anglia]] area of [[Great Britain]], from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

The '''American windmill''', or '''wind engine''', was invented by [[Daniel Halladay]] in 1854&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html |title=fnal.gov |publisher=fnal.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger versions were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html|title=Historic Turns in The Windmill City|last=Clements|first=Elizabeth|work=Ferimi News|publisher=Office of Science/US Dept of Energy|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a [[tankhouse]]. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction.  At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123-127&lt;/ref&gt; Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, [[Eclipse windmill|Eclipse]], [[Fairbanks-Morse]], [[Dempsters|Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company]] and [[Aermotor Windmill Company|Aermotor]] became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.

In Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at [[Toowoomba]] manufactured windmills of the American pattern from 1876, with the trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903. These became an icon of the Australian rural sector by utilizing the water of the [[Great Artesian Basin]].&lt;ref name= BM&gt;Bruce Millet, ''[http://www.oocities.org/ozwindmills/SouthernCross.htm Triumph of the Griffiths Family]'' (1984) (retrieved 10-12-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known maker was [[Frederick Metters|Metters Ltd.]] of [[Adelaide]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Sydney]].

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}

The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Oceania''' was a [[Radical feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and continued through the early 1980s. Influenced by the movement which sought to make personal issues political and bring discussion of [[sexism]] into the political discourse in the United States and elsewhere, women in Australia and New Zealand began forming WLM groups in 1969 and 1970. Few organisations formed in the [[Pacific Islands]], but both Fiji and Guam had women affiliated with the movement.

Quickly adherents spread throughout Australia and New Zealand. Their primary issue was autonomy for women in all spheres of life, including focus on child care centers, equal opportunity for and pay and employment, objectification of women, reproductive rights, sexuality and sexual abuse. Most importantly, they wanted a fundamental change in the way society perceived women. Rejecting that reforming existing laws would change women's place in society without an accompanying change in the thoughts about women, liberationists participated in public protests, published information on issues, and held meetings to organise lobbying efforts.

In 1969, [[Martha Ansara]], who had relocated after a divorce from the United States that year to [[Sydney]], joined with [[Margaret Eliot (feminist) |Margaret Eliot]], [[Sandra Hawker]], and [[Coonie Sandford]] to form a discussion group about materials on the Women's Liberation Movement that she had brought from the States. They decided to host a meeting on the topic and prepared a pamphlet ''Only the Chains Have Changed'' to announce the January 1970 meeting.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=25–26}} That same year, Warren Osmond, a tutor at the [[University of Adelaide]] had read about the protest over the Miss America Pageant and wrote an article in ''[[On Dit]]'', the student newspaper drawing parallels with the university's "Miss Fresher" Pageant. In March 1970, a group of Adelaide Women's Liberation adherents picketed the contest.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=26}} By May, the first nationwide conference on Women's Liberation, profiling "Female Conditioning" was organised in Melbourne, spreading the movement quickly across Australia.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=27}}{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}}

After police raided the Heatherbrae Clinic, an abortion referral facility in 1970, the Sydney Women's Liberation group organised a protest in July and wrote about it in their newsletter. Throughout the September trial, they demonstrated at the court, advocating for legal abortion. The WLM organised a motorcade and petition drive for abortion in October. In January 1971, the Gay Liberation affiliate of the Sydney WLM was formed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}} Hungry for information on the theory and philosophy of the movement, such texts as, ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' (1970) by [[Germaine Greer]], an Australian-born woman living in Britain;{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' (1970) by American [[Kate Millett]]; ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'' (1970) by Canadian-American [[Shulamith Firestone]]; and ''[[Woman's Estate]]'' (1971) by British [[Juliet Mitchell]] became widely read and discussed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=106}} The mixture of texts from various countries as well as from different political backgrounds resulted in a commitment to collectivity and divergent ideas on how issues which involved women should be addressed.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=106}} 

Initially, men participated in the WLM in Australia, but in the period between 1970 and 1971, women began to oust men from their organisations because they tended to dominate the narrative and inform the women participants of how they should proceed.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=27–28}} One of the earliest journals, ''MeJane'', produced by the MeJane Collective of Sydney was founded in 1971 and produced by women like [[Suzanne Bellamy]] and [[Joyce Stevens]].{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=105–108}} As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small groups of consciousness-raising with a limited organisational structure were the norm{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=29–30}} and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Prominent in the movement were women like [[Eva Cox]], who would become a professor and social commentator; Justice [[Elizabeth Evatt]], first chief justice of the [[Family Court of Australia]];{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} [[Eileen Haley]] of Adelaide; [[Anne Summers]],{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=30}} who would write ''Damned Whores and God's Police'' in 1975, which became widely influential;{{sfn|Arrow|2015}}{{sfn|Magarey|2014b}} [[Pat Turner (Aboriginal activist)|Pat Turner]], an aboriginal activist and civil servant;{{sfn|Henningham|2012}} and [[Biff Ward]], a writer and social activist.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=30}} 

In 1972, the Melbourne Women's Liberation set up a center at 16 Little La Trobe Street which became a gathering place for members of the movement. They produced the ''Women's Liberation Newsletter'' on a [[gestetner]] and provided a community referral service to women.{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=91–92}} In the run-up to the elections that year, two of the WLM groups in Melbourne met to strategise over the federal candidates who might be favorable to women's issues. Out of these strategy sessions, the [[Women's Electoral Lobby]] (WEL) was founded and began lobbying the [[Australian Labour Party]] to address their concerns.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=110}} When Labour won, with [[Gough Whitlam]] being elected [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], WEL began lobbying for fulfillment of the promises made in exchange for their support. Whitlam appointed [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]] as an advisor on women's affairs. The reaction from other liberationists was clear, when a statement was issued in ''MeJane'' denouncing not only the illegitimacy of a man choosing a woman to be a spokesperson for women, but of choosing a single person to represent diverse points of view.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|pp=110–111}} From that point, there was a fissure in the relationship of WLM and WEL.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}

Two groups formed in Tasmania in the early 1970s both from the women at the [[University of Tasmania]]. The Tasmanian University Union Women's Liberation group formed in 1971 and as one of their main initiatives worked to establish a much-needed Child Care Center for students on campus.{{sfn|Pearce|2017}} The other group, the Hobart Women's Action Group (HWAG) formed in 1972 with members like Kay Daniels and her partner Shirley Castley. That same year they founded the widely-read journal ''Liberaction''.{{sfn|Pearce|2017}}{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=44}} ''Liberaction'' was intellectual but simultaneously irreverent and brought a different spin to WLM literature being produced in Australia. One example of the type of article it produced was their "Feminist Food Guide", which took on the stereotypes of women dining out without male companions. Public perception held that women without male escorts were not only not respectable, but incapable of ordering a meal or critiquing it. The members of HWAG visited various restaurants evaluating the atmosphere, the service, the prices and the food, reporting on their experiences.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|pp=50–52}} To those who complained that food was not a feminist issue, HWAG commented that they were missing the point{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=54}} that they were a group of women, dining out without children or men, had income and control of their own finances and were able to evaluate their treatment by businesses on their own.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=51}}

In 1974, the [[Elsie Refuge]], Australia's first [[women's shelter]] was established by Carole Baker, Jennifer Dakers, Anne Summers and other Sydney WLM activists. Influenced by [[Erin Pizzey]]'s book ''Scream Quietly or the Neighbours Will Hear'', they approached the Church of England in [[Glebe]], which owned many unoccupied properties in search of a suitable dwelling.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=128}} When the church failed to respond, the activists selected two derelict houses on Westmoreland Street in Glebe and asserted [[squatter's rights]] over the properties after they had renovated them to make them habitable and opened to women and their children.{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=131}} Sybylla Press was established in 1976{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|p=93}} and published all the feminist tracts of the WLM of Victoria including ''Lesbian News'', ''Scarlet Woman'' and ''Vashti'', among others, until it ceased operations in 1988.{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|p=95}} That same year, the WLM of Canberra reported that in the six years since their group was formed they had established a meeting house; developed a Women's Centre on Lobelia Street which provided a referral service, abortion counseling and bookstore; a refuge house; and rape crisis center.{{sfn|Magarey|2014a|p=57}}

Though WLM groups were still functioning in 1979, factionalism in the [[Feminism in Australia|women's movement]] and a perception by society at large that they were anti-male, had caused liberationists to withdraw from public demonstration to focus on issues such as education, family law, reproductive rights and employment discrimination.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}

=== Sydney ===
The [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] (WLM) in [[Sydney]] began in 1969 with small meetings of women in [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] and [[Glebe, Sydney|Glebe]], as part of the explosive development of Women's Liberation politics and organisation that occurred internationally from the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s.{{sfn|Allan|1999}}

Talking to each other about experiences previously regarded as belonging only in the domain of 'private life' — such as rape, domestic violence, incest, and abortion — gatherings of women at 67 Glebe Point Road and very soon elsewhere, discovered the commonality of these experiences. These collective conversations about such previously taboo subjects became known as 'Consciousness-raising' and one of the key political differences between older forms of political organising and the new liberation movement. The understanding of women's experiences as universal and systemic, rather than individual and idiosyncratic, became summarised as 'The Personal is Political' and one of the key insights of the Women's Liberation Movement.{{sfn|Bellamy|1987|p=189}}

== New Zealand ==
Influenced by the developments in the United States and Britain, women's liberation groups began to form in [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]] in 1970,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} when Therese O'Connell started the Women's Liberation Front Club at [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] and Women for Equality emerged in Auckland. Some of their first actions were to invade the "males only" Bistro Bar at the Great Northern Hotel and demonstrate at the Miss New Zealand Beauty Pageant.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2016|p=198}} Membership grew quickly, expanding to [[Dunedin]], [[Christchurch]] and other areas in [[New Zealand]]. Subjects which had previously not been viewed as political, such as childcare, health, housework, and sexuality, became part of public debate as a result of the movement's drive to recognise that the "personal is political".{{sfn|Cook|2011}} In response to Women's Liberation demands, the government of New Zealand established the [[Society for Research on Women (SROW)]] in 1970 and hosted series of United Women's Conventions, which covered issues such as [[violence against women]], women's health and abortion.{{sfn|Ministry for Women|2016}} This confirmed that the influence of the movement extended beyond those actively engaged in the WLM, as their aims were not to reform laws and make a place for women in society, but rather create fundamental change in the way women were perceived and society was organised.{{sfn|Cook|2011}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}}

In 1971, [[Ngahuia Te Awekotuku]] ([[Te Arawa]]-[[Tūhoe]]) and [[Sue Kedgley]] participated in a protest with other women from the [[University of Auckland]], in [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]], to demonstrate the lack of progress for women with a mock [[funeral procession]]. Attracting wide media attention, the women were mocked but the coverage sparked a surge of interest and encouraged many women to become involved.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}}{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018b}} The Dunedin Collective for Woman formed in 1971 focusing on the issues of change in society's perception of women, access to child care, equal pay, and women's authority over their own bodies. The group functioned as an [[umbrella organization|umbrella organisation]] for WLM groups around [[Dunedin]] to develop [[Consciousness raising|consciousness-raising]] cells, network with other groups, participate in collective protests, and produce materials on women's issues.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=96}} Liberationists avoided hierarchical organisation striving for consensus among the membership,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} which was inclusive of all women. Adopting the "sisterhood is powerful" concept that all women were united in their oppression as women, liberationists membership included students, housewives, working women, as well as lesbians, [[Māori people|Māori women]] and other Pacific Islanders.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} The broad spectrum of members created divisions and fissures began to erupt between [[socialist feminists]], [[liberal feminists]] and liberationists.{{sfn|Cook|2011}}

In 1972, Kedgley published along with Sharyn Cederman ''Sexist Society'', which examined the stereotypes of men and women's roles in society and marked her exit from liberationist ideals.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018b}}{{sfn|Pool|Du Plessis|2011}} That same year, [[Connie Purdue]] assisted in organising a New Zealand tour by [[Germaine Greer]], a noted feminist from Australia.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018c}} Te Awekotuku and other liberationists protested Greer's appearance, dressing as witches and calling attention to the exclusion of indigenous people, lesbians and undesirables from her welcome.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} Purdue's response was that Te Awekotuku had "set the movement back 50 years".{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} Kedgley and Purdue, then turned away from radical ideals and formed the National Organisation for Women, based on the United States organisation and begin working on reform policies.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018c}} In Wellington, the first National Women's Liberation Conference was held in April 1972. Attended by over 500 women and men, the agenda discussed equal opportunities in education and employment, lesbian and reproductive rights, childcare support and the launch of women's studies programmes in university.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=64}} That same year, [[Anne Else]] co-founded ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'' with [[Sandra Coney]], which would become the most prominent feminist journal in New Zealand.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018d}} Among its editors were Coney, [[Claire-Louise McCurdy]], and [[Pat Rosier]].{{sfn|Cook|2011}}{{sfn|Auckland Museum|n.d.}}
 
As many members had children, quality child care was an issue and a focus of liberationist groups was to establish centers where women could meet and childcare was provided. The establishment in 1974 in Dundin of women's center which shared space for a pre-school was typical. Liberationists also established bookstores and [[women's shelter]]s to provide refuge for women in abusive situations.{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=96–97}} When they began, shelters in New Zealand created a "'parallel development' model that involved sharing power between [[Māori people|Māori]] and ‘''tauiwi''’ (all people who arrived after Māori) in decision-making, use of funds, public presentations and staffing",{{sfn|Cook|2011}} but by 1973, Māori and lesbian groups began to separate themselves to focus on their different issues.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018a}} One of these groups, first formed in Christchurch, was [[Sisters for Homophile Equality]] (SHE) which aimed to politicise the issues faced by women and [[gay liberation]]ists. Because their issues had differences from mainstream WLM and from the men in the LGBT movement, ''SHE'' focused on the dual discrimination faced by its members. The organisation soon spread to Wellington, where the magazine ''[[Lesbian Feminist Circle|The Circle]]'' was founded to allow lesbians from throughout the country to network and share ideas.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=559}}

Radical feminist caucuses were held beginning in 1975 and fostered the development of a network which met between 1976 and 1978.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}} The last three-day conference on the subject of women's liberation took place in Auckland in February 1978 and highlighted the various types of feminist views ranging from anarchy and socialism to racism and lesbianism. Some exchanges grew heated over whether women's oppression stemmed from class differences, racial differences, social differences, a combination of several issues, or were systemic.{{sfn|Rogers|1978}} The divisions pointed to fractures which would eventually split [[Feminism in New Zealand|feminists]] into groups focusing on specific interests.{{sfn|Cook|2011}} Liberationists continued to operate in New Zealand into the early 1980s, but as its early members moved on to other commitments, groups dispersed.{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=97, 554}}

==Pacific Islands==
In general, many women from the Pacific Islands, which includes some 20,000 islands lying between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=515}} did not identify with feminism which they thought of as a "[[Western philosophy]]", as in their cultures, women had defined positions of power.{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} Women in the era often identified with the [[decolonialisation]] movement and saw their oppression in terms of having been colonised.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=515}} Pockets of groups affiliated with Women's Liberation appeared in the region, such as a group which formed in [[Fiji]], at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in 1971{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} and a cooperative ''Guam Women Unite'' formed that same year in [[Guam]].{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6773">'''Zoosadism''' is [[pleasure]] derived from [[cruelty to animals]]. It is part of the [[Macdonald triad]], a set of three behaviors that are considered a precursor to [[Psychopathy|psychopathic behavior]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. MacDonald|title=The Threat to Kill|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=120|issue=2|pages=125–130|year=1963|doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Some studies have suggested that individuals who are [[cruel to animals]] are more likely to be violent to humans. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'':

{{cquote|The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appear in its computer records of [[Serial rape|serial rapists]] and [[Serial killer|murderers]], and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals as a diagnostic criterion for [[conduct disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Goleman | first = Daniel | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Child's Love of Cruelty May Hint at the Future Killer | newspaper = New York Times | pages = | year = | date = 7 August 1991 | url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Helen Gavin wrote however in ''Criminological and Forensic Psychology'' (2013):

{{cquote|This is not a universal trait, though. [[Dennis Nilsen]] had difficulty initiating social contact with people, but loved his faithful companion, Bleep, a mongrel bitch. After his arrest, he was very concerned for her welfare, as she was taken to the police station too.&lt;ref name="Helen Gavin 2013 120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Gavin|title=Criminological and Forensic Psychology|pages=120|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alan R. Felthous reported in his paper "Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People" (1980):

{{cquote|A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well, including one patient who had murdered a boy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Felthous | first = Alan R. | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Aggression Against Cats, Dogs, and People | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 10 | pages = 169–177 | date = | year = 1980 | url = | doi = 10.1007/bf01433629| id = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a commonly reported finding, and for this reason, [[cruelty to animals]] is often considered a warning sign of potential violence towards humans.

==Legal status==
In the [[United States]], since 2010, it has been a federal offense to create or distribute "obscene" depictions of "living non-human mammals, birds, reptiles, or amphibians ... subjected to serious bodily injury".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruthann Robson|Robson, Ruthann]] (2010-12-14) [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html Animal Porn - Criminalized by Federal Law Again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415045939/http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html |date=2011-04-15 }}, ''Constitutional Law Prof Blog''&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced an overly broad 1999 statute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|title=18 U.S. Code § 48 - Animal crush videos|author=|date=|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121143325/http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/48.html|archivedate=21 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]''.

==Criticism of alleged link to violence against humans==
Critics of the concept of a propensity for cruelty to humans cite the fact that animals can be cruel to some animals yet caring to other animals, combined with [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s studies using metronomes at different rates to test conditioned learning showing that humans can discriminate in fine ways that animals cannot,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Catania, A.C.|year=1994|title=Query: Did Pavlov's research ring a bell?|journal=Psycoloquy Newsletter, June 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conclude that there is no such general basis. The exact way these critics explain studies that seems to show links varies, but most of them state that psychiatric and criminological studies are subject to [[institutional bias]] and [[self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill, 2002 RobertWhitaker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique by Lieberman, P 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is also pointed out that [[correlation does not prove causation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|title=The Case for Animal Experimentation: An Evolutionary and Ethical Perspective|first=Michael Allen|last=Fox|date=23 April 1986|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=23 April 2018|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605032616/https://books.google.com/books?id=yTfNH3cScKAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKcllSdfAA&amp;sig=826Am1ASKt9YyAHmMsyIsm_2ZS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwial8TV5ZHYAhUUWmMKHeCCBncQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cruelty+to+animals+humans+correlation+causation&amp;f=false|archivedate=5 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Piers Beirne]], a professor of [[criminology]] at the [[University of Southern Maine]], has criticized existing studies for ignoring socially accepted practices of violence against animals, such as [[animal slaughter]] and [[vivisection]], that might be linked to violence against humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021521/http://digitalcommons.usm.maine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=criminology |archivedate=2017-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
