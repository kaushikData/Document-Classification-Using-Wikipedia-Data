'''Advanced Placement (AP) Physics 1''', along with [[AP Physics 2]], is a year-long [[Advanced Placement|AP]] course whose first exam was given in 2015. The course is intended to proxy a one-semester algebra-based university course.  Topics covered include forces and motion, conservation laws, waves, and electricity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2011/07/ap-physics-1-and-2-redesign-as-it.html Jacobs Physics: AP Physics 1 and 2 Redesign (as it stands now) and Honors Physics I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The heavily computational AP Physics B course served for four decades as the College Board's algebra-based offering.  As part of the College Board's redesign of science courses, AP Physics B was discontinued and AP Physics 1 and 2 were created with guidance from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 | Advances in AP&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The course covers material of a first-[[semester]] [[university]] [[undergraduate]] [[physics]] course offered at American universities that use best practices of physics pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Greg|title=What does a 5 on the AP Physics 1 Exam mean?  It still means an A, but read on...|url=https://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2016/01/what-does-5-on-ap-physics-1-exam-mean.html|website=Jacobs Physics|publisher=Greg Jacobs|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first AP Physics 1 classes had begun in the 2014-2015 school year, with the first AP exams administered in May 2015.

==Curriculum==
AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course that includes topics such as Newtonian mechanics; work, energy, and power; mechanical waves and sound; and introductory, simple circuits.  The College Board published a curriculum framework that includes seven big ideas on which the new AP Physics courses are based, along with "enduring understandings" students will be expected to acquire within each of the big ideas.:&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf AP Physics 1: Algebra-based and AP Physics 2: Algebra-based Curriculum Framework 2014–2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927033758/http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/2012advances/11b_4615_AP_Physics_CF_WEB_120910.pdf |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions for the exam are constructed with direct reference to items in the curriculum framework.  Student understanding of each topic is tested with reference to multiple skills -- that is, questions require students to use quantitative, semi-quantitative, qualitative, and experimental reasoning in each content area.

The '''Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama''' ('''APGRD''') is a research project based at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]], founded in 1996 by [[Edith Hall]] and [[Oliver Taplin]].&lt;ref name="APGRD"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/about-us/history | title = APGRD website - About us  - History }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Director is [[Fiona Macintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/about-us/people|title=People {{!}} APGRD|website=www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The APGRD's focus is the study of performances of ancient drama and epic worldwide, ranging from the original performances in antiquity to the present day.&lt;ref name="APGRD"/&gt; It also runs a number of programmes promoting new writing and performance, including the 2005–2011 '''Onassis Programme''', which commissioned, developed and produced professional work from artists from around the world, including [[Seamus Heaney]] and [[Derek Walcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.onassis.ox.ac.uk/Onassis%20Past%20Events.html | title = The Onassis Programme, Past Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APGRD was praised by Oxford University for its engagement with authors, directors and other theatre practitioners, and was selected as one of the university's ''Impacts'' showcase projects for helping to "sustain the distinctive and dynamic nature of the UK theatre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/research/research_impact/oxford_impacts/theatre.html | title= Oxford Impacts: Influencing Contemporary Theatre Practice | publisher= [[Oxford University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s publications have been described as playing "a pivotal role in establishing the parameters and methodologies of the study of the reception of Classical drama in performance".&lt;ref&gt;Hallie Rebecca Marshall, ''[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2006/2006-09-11.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]'', 11 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation''' was a private, independent organization created by an act of the [[Parliament of Canada]] in 1998. It received an initial endowment of $2.5 billion from the federal government to provide awards annually for ten years. The foundation distributed $325 million in the form of bursaries and scholarships each year throughout [[Canada]] in support of [[post-secondary education]]. As well, the foundation conducted research into post-secondary access, via the Millennium Research Program.

==Overview==

The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation was created by an Act of Parliament in 1998 by the then [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government under [[Jean Chrétien]]. Branded as Canada's way to marking the new millennium, the Foundation was endowed with CAD$2.5 billion and was given the mandate to 1) improve access to post-secondary education for all Canadians, especially those facing economic or social barriers, to 2) encourage a high level of student achievement and engagement in Canadian society; and to 3) build a national alliance of organizations and individuals around a shared post-secondary agenda.

Since 2000, the Foundation delivered more than half a million bursaries and scholarships worth more than $1.5 billion to students across Canada. Its two best-known scholarship programs were:
* The Millennium Bursary Program, which targeted students with the greatest financial need.
* The Millennium Excellence Award Program, which provided scholarships based on merit (including leadership, innovation, academic achievement and [[community service]]). Separate sets of awards were provided to entrance and in-course post-secondary students.

==Millennium Bursary Program==
The Millennium Bursary Program represented 95% of the awards distributed by the Foundation. The value of the Foundation's millennium bursaries was approximately $3,000 on average, but ranged from $1,000 to $4,993.

==Millennium Excellence==

The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation also issued merit-based scholarships through its Millennium Excellence Awards Program to deserving youths entering post-secondary studies for the first time. Laureates of these awards all exhibited excellence in community involvement, innovation, leadership and academic achievement. The MEAP was unique because of its Canada-wide reach - whether a student lived in a major metropolitan area or in a remote village, anyone could apply and be evaluated based on their contribution to their community. Excellence Awards represented only 5% of the total scholarship sum awarded by the Foundation. More than 10,000 Excellence Awards were issued since 2000.

The MEAP provided laureates with more than a cheque. Laureates were invited to participate in regional or national conferences hosted by the Foundation. Laureates also had access to project seed money through the Millennium Grants Program.

The Excellence Awards were divided into two groups, the Entrance Awards geared towards students entering their first year of post-secondary education, and the In-Course Awards for those already enrolled in post-secondary studies.

===Entrance Awards===

As of 2008, there were three different levels of Entrance Awards:

* Local awards: one-time awards of $4,500
* Provincial/territorial awards: $16,000 award, disbursed in annual allotments
* National awards: $20,000 award, disbursed in annual allotments

===In-Course Awards===
As of 2008, there were three different level of In-Course Awards

* Up to 100 awards of $5,000, renewable for up to one additional year, for a total of $10,000
* Up to 200 awards of $4,000, renewable for up to one additional year, for a total of $8,000
* Up to 900 one-time awards of $4,500.

Exceptional laureates were also allowed to apply for an additional Millennium grant of $2,500 towards a community building project.

==Millennium Research Program==
The [[Millennium Research Program]] was launched in 2001 to assist the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation in carrying out its mandate to improve access to post-secondary education in Canada and provide students with the educational opportunities they need to prepare themselves for the future. The Research Program advanced the study of barriers to post-secondary education and the impact of policies and programs designed to alleviate them. It ensured that policy-making and public discussion about opportunities in higher education in Canada were informed by rigorous analysis and empirical evidence.

==Dissolution and legacy==

In February 2008, the federal government decided not to renew the CMSF at the end of its 10-year mandate.  It was replaced with the Canada Student Grants Program, which will distribute $350 million per year to post-secondary education students.  Much controversy has come to light since the government has announced this program, in which 250,000 students will now benefit per year, as opposed to the approximately 100,000 that are receiving money from the CMSF.  Although the amount of money that the federal government will be putting towards post-secondary education has not changed dramatically, the average student award decreased from about $3000 per year to about $1250 per year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Before the decision was made, Canada's two largest national post-secondary student organizations, the [[Canadian Federation of Students]] (CFS) and the [[Canadian Alliance of Student Associations]] (CASA), took dramatically different views on the fund's future. While CASA fully endorsed the foundation's renewal, on the basis that non-renewal would constitute a significant cut to student financial assistance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grantsreloaded.ca CASA's CMSF-renewal campaign site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227080200/http://grantsreloaded.ca/ |date=2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CFS had called for the organization to be replaced with a system of grants based purely on financial need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfs-fcee.ca/html/english/campaigns/millennium.php CFS website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020182543/http://www.cfs-fcee.ca/html/english/campaigns/millennium.php |date=2007-10-20 }} (Student Financial Assistance section)&lt;/ref&gt; After the announcement was made, the CFS noted that the new grant program was just "splitting the same amount of grant money among more students".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=7f0bc15b-4baa-4685-b903-658771591372 CanWest News Service: New student grant program has little new money; February 26, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104144052/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=7f0bc15b-4baa-4685-b903-658771591372 |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Millennium Excellence Awards Program, the merit-based component of the scholarship program, was not renewed, thus ending one of the two Canada-wide merit scholarships in existence, with only the [[Loran Scholars Foundation]] remaining. However, as of 2009, alumni of the MEAP founded the [[Millennium Network]], a non-profit organization that is part alumni association, part community action group that aims to help build capacity of existing community actors.

'''Maria del Carmen Perez Jimenez Barradas''' (18 March 1888 – 12 May 1963) was a [[Uruguay]]an pianist, composer, and choral teacher.

==Life==
Maria del Carmen Pérez Jiménez was born in [[Montevideo]], the daughter of Spanish residents Santos Rojas and still life painter Antonio Pérez Giménez Barradas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www3.elpais.com.uy/suplemento/cultural/Una-vanguardia-olvidada/cultural_682609_121221.html |title=A forgotten art |author=SantosMelgarejo, Adriana |accessdate=26 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232506/http://www3.elpais.com.uy/suplemento/cultural/Una-vanguardia-olvidada/cultural_682609_121221.html |archivedate=26 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She first studied with Antonio Frank, but ended the study after her father died in 1898. With support from friends and family, she later continued with Aurora Pablo and M. Lopes Vicente at the Conservatorio del Uruguay, receiving her diploma in 1915. Following the example of her younger brother, the painter [[Rafael Barradas]], she adopted the stage name Carmen Barradas. Her youngest brother was writer and poet [[:es:Antonio De Ignacios|Antonio De Ignacios]].

After World War I, Rafael Barradas found he was unable to return from Spain to Uruguay, so in 1916 Barradas' family moved to [[Spain]]. The family struggled to get there, having to apply for entry as laborers. Once in Spain, Carmen and her mother supported themselves by making toys. However, Carmen also developed as a composer and actively participated in the artistic life of Barcelona. In 1917 she gave a concert of her own works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International encyclopedia of violin-keyboard sonatas and composer|author=Pedigo, Alan|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barradas lived and composed in Spain until 1922, then returned with her family to Montevideo in 1928, where she took a position teaching at the Institutos Normales.

The concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer using [[cinematography]]''' recognizes that films with carefully crafted and verified content, using graphics, animations and live-action video, can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people and healthcare professionals.

==History of medical cinematography==

===Late 19th century===

The use of cinematography to enhance healthcare practice and delivery dates back to the late 19th century in Western Europe. [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] (French scientist and physiologist), [[Eugène-Louis Doyen]] (French surgeon), [[Bolesław Matuszewski]] (Polish cameraman, in France his first name was written as Boleslas), and [[Gheorghe Marinescu]] (Romanian neurologist) are some of the pioneers of medical cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Arthur Van Gehuchten takes neurology to the movies. NEUROLOGY 2002;59:1612–1618&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Doyen had his surgeries captured on film. His films were brought into disrepute by the fact that they were copied and shown on fairgrounds. The resulting social prejudice may explain the slow take-off of medical cinematography.  For example, in 1910 someone said the following regarding Doyen’s videos: ,“These pictures savoured of advertisement, and were never popular, save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession.” &lt;ref&gt;Roentgen Cinematography. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2603 (Nov. 19, 1910), p. 1645&lt;/ref&gt;  Doyen’s work, however, marked the distinction between the concepts of ‘film for entertainment’ versus ‘film for medicine’.

In 1893 Marey used the technique to study human physiology and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lKItGNuiY movement]. In 1898 Boleslas Matuszewski recorded medical films in Paris (at the time, the world’s neurologic capital). At [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière and Pitié hospitals]] he filmed surgeries and cases of persons affected by nervous and mental disorders.

Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) studied under renowned French professor [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and returned to Bucharest as Chief Physician at Pantelimon Hospital. Between 1898–1902 he conducted a cinematographic project, recording and analyzing a series of neurological conditions in patients. He perfected the application of filming techniques to clinical [[neurology]] and published five articles based on cinematographic analysis. Marinescu wrote that the role of cinematography is “to complement and even replace, in whatever measure possible, the descriptive exposition of phenomena by more rigorous, more exact analysis, which consists of recording movement with the help of special procedures” &lt;ref&gt;Barboi A C, Goetz C, Musetoiu R. The origins of scientific cinematography and early medical applications. NEUROLOGY 2004;62:2082–2086&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Arthur Van Gehuchten]] (Belgian anatomist and neurologist) began to film neurologic patients and built up a collection of films for teaching purposes. His collection is exceptional both quantitatively and qualitatively.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Idem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century: medical cinematography as [[propaganda]]===

In 1910 [[Thomas Edison]] produced the first ever public [[health education]] film, raising awareness about the prevention of [[tuberculosis]]. The view at the time was that “propagandists saw education as limited to providing facts. Propaganda was designed to control opinions and actions, without having to use direct force. Propaganda appealed to most progressive health reformers as a way of providing genuine popular democratic support for the trained medical elite.

Dr. H. E. Kleinschmidt of the Tuberculosis Association defined good propaganda as ‘mental inoculation’ whose avowed goal was ‘will-control through education’. The goal of health propagandists was not simply to inform but to persuade, to control individual thoughts and actions.” &lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Thomas Edison's Tuberculosis Films: Mass Media and Health Propaganda. The Hastings Center Report, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jun., 1978), pp. 21-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison’s film came under criticism for “the distortions, exaggerations, and inaccuracies inherent in the [[melodrama]] format. The films clearly exaggerated the power of medicine to deal with tuberculosis; and they greatly over dramatized the effects and symptoms of the disease.” &lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

During World War I, the use of medical propaganda appealed to the US government and private agencies, which worked together “to produce and distribute anti-[[venereal disease]] motion pictures, including the feature-length melodramas [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010131/ Fit to Fight] and The End of the Road and other lesser-known films. These movies, originally made for military trainees and war workers, were revised for showing to civilians, as evidence mounted that many soldiers had been infected prior to induction.” &lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Sex Education Films. Isis, Vol. 84, No. 4 (Dec., 1993), pp. 766-768&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical cinematography employed in healthcare===

The 1930s saw the rise of medical cinematography employed to reach goals of [[public health]]. In 1933, the Journal of Communication published an article regarding [[immunization]] propaganda in the US: “Dr. Nash has enlisted the cinematograph film. He has noticed that American films illustrating immunization never show the instant of puncture, so that spectators are left to infer something disagreeable. But in the 16 mm. film taken by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak Ltd.]] in his own clinic the whole operation is photographed, and although now and then there may be a grimace or a hint of nervousness, there is certainly no crying or resistance. The children in the film, quite unrehearsed, behave perfectly. It is an excellent film and should do much to dispel parental apprehensions.” &lt;ref&gt;Immunization Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3769 (Apr. 1, 1933), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1935 issue of the [[British Medical Journal]], one could read the following advice regarding the use of films in public health: “If the medical profession wanted, for example, to introduce widespread [[Preventive healthcare|prophylaxis]] against [[diphtheria]] it could take a leaf out of Papworth's book and tell a story on the films that would help to wipe out diphtheria in a few years' time. It is no good trying to persuade people of the Tightness of this or that measure of health with the sweet voice of reason. It is the emotional appeal that wins the day; reason follows humbly after. The film, with its forcible assault upon both eye and ear, is a powerful weapon of propaganda. And it could be used with effect for ‘putting across’ to the public the idea of preventive medicine. Perhaps the Minister of Health, [[Sir Kingsley Wood]], a master of propaganda, might enlist the help of the moving picture in his campaign for the improved health of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Papworth and Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3911 (Dec. 21, 1935), pp. 1213-1214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer==

By the 1980s, medical films had become an established vehicle of both medical and patient training. A 1987 issue of the [http://journals.lww.com/AJNOnline/pages/default.aspx American Journal of Nursing] contained a full-page section on Films &amp; Tapes covering broad topics such as Aids to Daily Living for the elderly, working moms, AIDS, alcohol abuse and even emotional fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Film listings. The American Journal of Nursing, Vol. 87, No. 12 (Dec., 1987), p. 1713&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer''' recognizes that film clips (with carefully crafted and verified content, and using graphics, animations and live-action video), can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people (patients, families, and friends), and healthcare professionals.

Traditionally the transfer of generic information (i.e. non patient-specific information) tends to happen on a somewhat ad-hoc, live, one-to-one basis, that is generally less well structured, less comprehensive, and thus less successful (whilst also being more expensive and less time efficient).

However, in order to be efficient and effective, the quality of the film’s content must be very high. A patient’s understanding of conditions and treatments is important to their care and well-being, so it is useful for carefully crafted clips to be available 24/7. It also helps patients when attending the all-important one-to-one consultations that are the bedrock of good healthcare. If patients are better informed and better prepared they can focus on their own case rather than generic issues.

The literature in this area also contains examples of what can happen when the film content is not particularly well crafted and presented. In 2000, a UK cancer study highlights the impact of poor quality video. The authors acknowledge that “not all [[Randomized controlled trials|randomised trials]] of video education, however, have had similarly consistent results. A randomised trial in patients undergoing [[colonoscopy]] reported increased knowledge and satisfaction but failed to demonstrate a reduction in anxiety. A similar study in patients receiving [[genetic counseling]] reported similar benefits but again no reduction in anxiety. Two further randomised trials, the first in patients having breast surgery and the second in patients undergoing [[coronary angioplasty]], failed to show any improvement in satisfaction or anxiety. The variation in these trial results suggests that, like all educational materials, the quality of the content is paramount and how it is used is vital to success. Involving patients in the development and showing patients recounting their personal experience undoubtedly helps. Using respected TV personalities offers the familiar face of respectability and professionalism. Above all, most studies fail to take advantage of the role which video has to play in continuing the educational process at home with their carers and friends, but instead ask patients to watch it in the unfamiliar environment of the clinic.” &lt;ref&gt;Thomas R et al. Forewarned is forearmed - benefits of preparatory information on video-cassette for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy - a randomised controlled trial. European Journal of cancer 36 (2000) 1536-1543).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the widespread use of the internet since the late 1990s, there is a tremendous potential for health-related films to be made available, free at the point of need, over the internet. Moreover, the 21st century sees an expanding integration of [[social media]] and [[mobile devices]] into our lives, thus enabling an even wider adoption of film-based health knowledge transfer.

==Case studies of healthcare knowledge transfer via cinematography==

A recent slate of long-form films includes ‘Outreach’ - a film about the workings of a specialist spinal injury unit, [http://www.spinalinjury.tv The Spinal Injury Patient Film], an award-winning film for new patients with spinal cord injuries, [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a Wheelchair], a film about the correct protocol of wheelchair assessment and procurement for individual patients, and several films on [[cancer survivorship]].

===[http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a wheelchair]: case study in the UK===

The 55 minute production is set to help improve well-being and long-term outcomes for Britain's 1.2 million wheelchair users. Too many people do not understand the importance of getting the right wheelchair; the right set-up and support, and the appropriate pressure relief.  UK provision is patchy, indeed there is - surprisingly - no qualification requirement for a wheelchair services provider/specifier in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

The [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com film] includes leading experts and practitioners in this area, plus case studies, and even an introductory history of the wheelchair. It thus provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of best practice and assessment, and is supported by many voices of experience.
For the NHS the long-term cost benefits of proper provision in an aging population are very considerable.

===[http://www.spinalinjury.tv Spinal injury patient film]===

Newly injured [[Spinal Cord Injury]] (SCI) patients are anxious about what is happening to them and the related long-term implications. When a patient is admitted to hospital with an SCI it is traumatic for their family, friends and loved ones too. One challenge faced by clinicians is communicating with a patient’s ‘advocates’, people who may know little of spinal cord injury, the care process, nor the problems of prognosis. They may be understandably overwhelmed, they want answers… “doctor, will he/she walk again?”.

Inspired by patient feedback, award-winning director [[Marcus Dillistone]], has created the film [http://www.spinalinjury.tv “From Darkness Into Light”], to help explain the core issues with SCI and to provide patient insight. The film is designed not to replace face-to-face discussion, but to complement it.

The [http://www.spinalinjury.tv film] was conceived as a ‘prescriptive’ communications tool in hospitals, with the decision of when (and if) to introduce the film to the patient or their advocates being made by the clinical team.

===Cancer survivorship films===

When a person is diagnosed with cancer, treatment is often the focus of discussion among patients, health care providers and family. However, the next phase of care, [[cancer survivorship]], is much less discussed. The 2005 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report “From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition” &lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine: From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation. 2005, National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; raised the awareness of the issue. Survivors of cancer face unique challenges, while health care providers do not always have the time, resource and training to provide counseling and assistance.

A 2005 randomized controlled study, Moving Beyond Cancer Trial,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, A. L., et al., Outcomes from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational, randomized controlled trial with breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol, 2005. 23(25): p. 6009-18.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a peer-modeling video as a psychoeducation tool is more effective than print materials in recovery of energy/vitality in post-treatment breast cancer patients. This 23-minute film, now available on the [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast/beyond-cancer-video National Cancer Institute website], addressed re-entry challenges in four life domains: physical health, emotional well-being, interpersonal relations, and life perspectives. Designed to promote adaptive peer modeling, the film observes four breast cancer survivors as they describe their experience in each of the four domains, as well as active coping skills they used to meet associated challenges. The film also includes commentary by an oncologist expert in breast cancer on the re-entry experience and on active methods for approaching problems during re-entry.

Since then, many video resources have been made available on the internet to cancer survivors and their care providers. Examples include a general education video on the issues of cancer survivorship produced by the IOM, a  video series by [[Living Beyond Breast Cancer]], a national education and support organization, addressing specific and sometimes sensitive issues during breast cancer survivorship.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=I Am a Young Woman With Breast Cancer|url=http://www.lbbc.org/Audiences/Young-Women/Let-s-Talk-About-It-Video-Series|website=Living Beyond Breast Cancer|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''community cohesion''' was established in the [[United Kingdom]] following a number of [[2001 England riots (disambiguation)|riots and disturbances in England in 2001]].&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; Although the term had been used in different contexts previously (in [[Canada]], for example), the first report to employ the term and to propose a new policy framework around it, was ''Community Cohesion: The Report of The Independent Review Team'' (http://dera.ioe.ac.uk/14146/1/communitycohesionreport.pdf).&lt;ref&gt;Cantle, T. (2001) Community Cohesion: A Report of the independent Review Team (London: Home Office)&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the riots in a number of towns in northern England in the summer of that year. The Report considered the national and wider dimensions of community relations and reviewed both those areas that had not suffered disturbances, as well as those that had. The Report’s findings represented a fundamental challenge to the then multicultural model and became best known for identifying the parallel lives of minority and majority communities, but also proposed a wide range of new policies which were subsequently adopted by government and other agencies.

The Cantle Report was supported by three local reviews of the three towns most affected by the riots. These were: for [[Bradford]], the ''[[Ouseley Report]]''  (2001); for [[Oldham]], the ''Ritchie Report''  (2001) and; for [[Burnley]], the ''Clarke Report''  (2001) (the Ouseley Report was commissioned prior to the disturbances in Bradford). The Government responded with ''Building Cohesive Communities, a Report of the Ministerial Group on Public Order'' (The "Denham Report") which set out a wide range of proposed actions.

The concept of community cohesion was subsequently widely adopted in the UK and some of the ideas and approaches have also been taken up in other countries. Government, local government, public service and voluntary agencies widely embraced the new policy direction, many establishing community cohesion officers and teams to develop strategies and implement the new approach. While the Welsh Government continues with its strategy, in England, the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|Coalition Government elected in 2010]] preferred to build their strategy around the idea of integration, though many policies have remained the same.

==Conceptual and practical development==
There have been at least three formal national definitions of the concept, each building upon the other over the six-year period from 2002 to 2008. All refer, however, to the need for strong and positive relationships between people from different backgrounds, tackling inequalities and developing a positive climate of opinion to support diversity. There are also a large number of local definitions, which draw upon the formal national definitions but tend to add a local context.

The first and most widely used, built directly on the Cantle and Denham reports, and was constructed by the co-authors of the ''Guidance on Community Cohesion'', the Local Government Association, the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Commission of Racial Equality and the Inter-Faith Network:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A cohesive community is one where:
* There is common vision and a sense of belonging for all communities;
* The diversity of people’s different backgrounds and circumstances are appreciated and positively valued;
* Those from different backgrounds have similar life opportunities; and
* Strong and positive relationships are being developed between people from different backgrounds in the workplace, in schools and within neighbourhoods." -- Local Government Association et al, 2002&lt;ref&gt;Local Government Association, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Commission for Racial Equality, The Inter-Faith Network (2002) 'Guidance on Community Cohesion' London: LGA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some five years later the Commission for Integration and Cohesion proposed a number of amended and additional points, which offered a more complex and somewhat convoluted definition and sought to add concepts of ‘trust’, ‘rights’ and ‘responsibilities’ – perhaps owing more to ideas about citizenship which was a Government pre-occupation at the time. Three 'ways of living together' were added by the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) in response to the CIC report, but both these additions added little to the original and tended to blur the focus of cohesion based on belonging, equal opportunities and positive interaction.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The policy domain was however particularly productive in producing guidance and less reliance was perhaps placed on the formal definition and more upon the emerging practice.{{fact|date=July 2018}} The most influential guidance was that issued by the LGA et al.  to support local government and partner agencies{{fact|date=July 2018}}. This emphasised the importance of ‘common values’ and cross community and cross disciplinary working, as well as the need to continue to tackle inequalities and disadvantage. Moreover, a Community Cohesion Unit was established in 2002 to co-ordinate national work and implement practice where necessary.  This was supported by an independent panel of practitioners who helped to develop guidance and best practice on cohesion. Its work concluded with a final report The End of Parallel Lives that stressed the importance of mainstreaming cohesion into local government services. Much of this thinking was brought together by the Home Office publication Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society in 2005. Building community cohesion was one of the four key themes alongside addressing inequality, promoting inclusiveness and tackling racism and extremism.

Guidance was produced on a wide range of policy areas. These included:

==Academic critique==
In contrast to the policy literature, academic publications were initially few and far between. On the whole they tended to be critical of the concept of community cohesion, though some of the more recent works have been much more supportive.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

The first academic textbook, produced by a proponent of the concept and author of the Cantle Report was supportive and attempted to build a substantial and theoretical underpinning for community cohesion. ''Community Cohesion: A New Framework for Race and Diversity'' was first published in 2005, with an updated version in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Cantle, T (2008) 'Community Cohesion: A New Framework for Race and Diversity' Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis suggested that multicultural policy and practice had contributed to separateness and segregation and built on the idea of the ‘parallel lives’ of the earlier Cantle Report. However, it also sought to establish a broader sense of difference, in which identity was not limited to the multicultural paradigm of race and suggested that cohesion was concerned with identity based on sexual orientation, gender, faith, disability, nationality and other forms of identities, as well as that of ethnicity.

Other academics claimed that community cohesion was being used as part of a new politically inspired approach to, firstly, shift the agenda towards one of assimilation of minorities and, secondly, move away from the focus on inequalities and disadvantage. McGhee (2005), for example, challenged the notion of the cosmopolitan identities and associated it with the then politics of New Labour. He suggests that "identity, culture and tradition are seen as conducive to prejudice, antagonism, polarization, mistrust, hatred and overt (fanatical) loyalty associated with preservationist or past-orientated orientations"&lt;ref name="McGhee"/&gt; and that emotionally hot patterns of identity are being replaced by "a calmer cosmopolitan mentality which is characterised by flexibility, ‘cool’ loyalties and thin patterns of solidarity."&lt;ref name="McGhee"&gt;McGhee, D. (2005) Intolerant Britain? Hate, Citizenship and Difference. (Maidenhead: McGraw-Hill Education) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett (2004) &lt;ref&gt;Burnett, J. (2004) ‘Community Cohesion and the State’ in Race and Class, January 200. Institute of Race Relations 0306-3968 Vol. 45(3) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;saw the debate in the same political terms as McGhee and similarly detected assimilationist tendencies in the reform of the notion of identity and suggested that the then New Labour Government used both the idea of community cohesion and the idea of communitarianism as a "bridge between the concept of citizenship (and its obligations) and ever widening notions of criminality."{{cite quote|date=December 2013}} He believed this amounted to the conjuring up of a fear of a "new moral order." Burnett’s later comments (Burnett, 2006), however, acknowledged that community cohesion policies did also put an emphasis on the need for majority White majority communities to change. McGhee (2008, p53)is also concerned about what this change of direction means in practice and for example, sees attempts to develop the use of English language on a more pervasive basis as an extension of the Government’s ‘linguistic nationalism’ which focuses on the "easiest signifier of sameness and difference,"&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, D. (2008) ‘A past built on difference, a future which is shared’ – a critical examination of the recommendations made by the Commission on Integration and Community Cohesion. (People, Place &amp; Policy Online (2008): 2/2, pp. 48-64)&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being a means by which diverse communities can communicate and interact. Harrison (2005)takes a similar view, fearing assimilation "in which the entrenched barriers and values of white communities pass relatively unchallenged (Harrison, 2005, p. 91)."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, H. (2005) ‘From Community Cohesion to an Inclusion and Co-operation Agenda’ in Housing, Race and Community Cohesion, Harrison et al. (Oxford: Chartered Institute of Housing).&lt;/ref&gt;

The same approach has been taken by activists and commentators that support the race based conceptions of a divided society. Kundnani, for example, claims that the changing nature of debates on ‘race’ has helped to shift the imperative to integration and by building shared norms, common identity and stable communities, diverse groups would be expected to ‘buy into’ British institutions, organisations and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kundnani, A.,(2002) ''The Death of Multiculturalism'' London:IRR&lt;/ref&gt; Lentin and Titley (2011) also believe that the development of community cohesion was a means of reining back race relations policies on the part of Government.&lt;ref&gt;Lentin, A. and Titley, G. (2011) The Crises of Multiculturalism: Racism in a Neo-Liberal Age. (London: Zed Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the 2001 reports did draw attention to structural inequalities and disadvantage faced by communities and made recommendations for addressing them, it was nevertheless suggested that the community cohesion agenda failed to take full account of socio-economic factors and has been a means of diverting attention away from them.

Indeed, ''Promoting Social Cohesion: Implications for policy and practice''&lt;ref&gt;''Promoting Social Cohesion: Implications for policy and practice''(Eds. Ratcliffe and Newman, 2011){{full citation needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes as its starting point the need to reconceptualise community cohesion as social cohesion in order to emphasise structural conditions and equality targets. The suggestion that community cohesion did not take full account of inequalities from the outset is contradicted by the formal definition adopted by the LGA (see above). The idea of a simplistic link between disadvantage and prejudice and discrimination is also contested by Cantle (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Cantle, T. (2012) Interculturalism: The New Era of Cohesion and Diversity (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also contested by Thomas who dismisses this charge in the first academic study based upon real evidence from the operation of cohesion in local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, P. (2011) Youth, Multiculturalism and Community Cohesion (Palgrave Macmillan: Basingstoke)&lt;/ref&gt; The assertions were also contradicted by the Government policy commitments given during the earlier development, particularly the annual series of ''Building Opportunity, Strengthening Society'' reports from 2005. The commitment to tackling inequalities and "making social justice visible" was also reaffirmed by the review of community cohesion conducted by the Commission for Integration and Cohesion in 2007 and in the Government’s response to it made the following year.

In challenging the earlier assertions about community cohesion, Thomas (2011) suggests that whilst it had been out of step with most academic analysis, that analysis had been "completely free of empirical evidence, resting instead on national governmental reports and discourse"(Thomas, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;4). Thomas’s study is based on evidence from the areas which have the "profound ethnic segregation, and the separate, oppositional and potentially dangerous ethnic and religious identities" (Thomas, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;4) that community cohesion policy was concerned with. Indeed, Thomas chides the critiques of cohesion for developing ‘evidence free’ views and for ignoring the empirical data that had been produced (Thomas, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;92).

Further, Thomas (2011) dismisses the charges that cohesion was in some way a return to assimilationism or a shift away from tackling inequalities. He found that community cohesion was simply "a critique of particular forms of multiculturalism policy formation and operation that have focused exclusively on the needs, identities and concerns of each separate ethnic group without consideration of relations, links and experiences shared between those groups"(Thomas, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;91). Thomas also found that, rather than promote assimilation, "community cohesion practice accepts and works with distinct ethnic and social identities, whilst augmenting them with overarching identities based on common connections, needs and experiences" (Thomas, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;168).

In addition, Delanty (2011) &lt;ref&gt;Delanty, G. (2011), Cultural diversity, democracy and the prospects of cosmopolitanism: a theory of cultural encounters. The British Journal of Sociology, 62: 633–656. doi: 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2011.01384.x P.642&lt;/ref&gt; goes to the heart of the academic critique by pointing out that "The notion of a cultural encounter has been a surprisingly neglected topic in sociology and has hardly been addressed in related fields", in other words, the central concern of community cohesion had simply not been seriously considered in previous race relations theory, casting doubt on the validity of the previous academic concerns.

More than sixteen years since the concept of 'parallel lives' was expounded in the Cantle Report, Thomas et al, (2017) &lt;ref&gt;Thomas, P., J. Busher, G. Macklin, M. Rogerson &amp; Kris Christmann (2017) Hopes and Fears: Community Cohesion and the ‘White Working Class’ in One of the ‘Failed Spaces’ of Multiculturalism. Sociology, Online First http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038038516676775&lt;/ref&gt; has found clear evidence of their continued existence in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, an area previously identified as a 'failed space' of multiculturalism and one which has much in common with many other English Northern towns ans cities. From an extensive study of the local area, Thomas et al concluded that '‘parallel lives’ are a lived reality' in which 'discourses focused around racial and religious differences ‘saturate’ everyday life – they are the lens through which social and political life is read by many local people' and that this was particularly the case for White British residents. Again, this suggests that empirical study supports the thesis of community cohesion.

Austin &amp; Hunter (2013)&lt;ref&gt;Austin, R. &amp; Hunter, W. (2013), Online Learning and Community Cohesion: School Links, (New York: Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed school-based projects internationally that use online communication technologies to promote community cohesion by bringing children from diverse communities (often, communities in conflict or post conflict situations). They particularly focused on active projects in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Israel and noted the relative absence of such programs in North America. They argue that online technologies may serve to provide the kind of positive contact called for in research on the [[contact hypothesis]], especially in environments where face-to-face contact may be deemed unsafe, impractical or expensive. They speculate that increasing use of [[social media]] in schools may serve to increase the potential for projects that seek to promote community cohesion using [[information and communications technology]].

In addition, there are a number of related policy areas which provide overwhelming support for the practice and process of community cohesion.

These include: 
* In respect of intergroup relations and contact theory, a number of academic studies, building on earlier work of Allport and others, have clearly demonstrated that prejudice and intolerance can be reduced by direct contact and interaction. 
* The academic and practical work on peace and reconciliation has demonstrated that inter group relations can be re-built by going through painful processes of discussing and resolving differences. 
* The work on social capital developed by Putnam in 2000, demonstrates the importance of ‘bridging social capital’. Whilst some aspects of Putnam’s work is contested, there is little dispute about the short-term impact of population churn and the impact of diversity upon its development. This leads on to the important considerations of the role of citizenship and the development of shared values.
* Communitarian theories have been developed with a new emphasis upon shared identities and ideas about interculturalism have begun to gain currency.

==Prospects==
Whilst the debate surrounding community cohesion will no doubt continue, there is little disagreement that the breaking down of barriers between communities and the building of trust and understanding is a desirable objective. The use of 
community cohesion programmes to disconfirm stereotypes and misconceptions about the ‘other’, has had some success and is used to promote good relations between a wide range of communities. In some cases, there are clear and measurable impacts of such programmes and generally measure attitudinal and behavioural change in the programme participants, or in the wider local community.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In addition to the small-scale programmes focused on divided communities, community cohesion has also developed at a citywide or area level to develop support a broader consensus in support of diversity. These often included high-profile campaigns featuring people from a range of backgrounds who all belong and contribute to the economic and cultural life of the area. These campaigns were important in that they tried to present a new positive picture of diversity and whilst recognising the value of cultural heritage and distinctiveness, it placed a new emphasis on the commonalities between groups and thereby contributed to a less defensive and more progressive form of multiculturalism, or towards the idea of interculturalism.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

'''Curriculum Theory''' ('''CT''') is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] devoted to examining and shaping educational [[curriculum|curricula]]. There are many interpretations of CT, being as narrow as the dynamics of the [[Learning|learning process]] of one child in a [[classroom]] to the [[lifelong learning]] path an individual takes. CT can be approached from the [[education]]al, [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Sociology|sociological]] perspectives. James MacDonald states "one central concern of theorists is identifying the fundamental unit of curriculum with which to build conceptual systems. Whether this be [[Rationality|rational decisions]], action processes, language [[pattern]]s, or any other [[potential]] unit has not been agreed upon by the [[Theory|theorists]]."&lt;ref&gt;J.B. MacDonald (1971). Curriculum Theory. The Journal of Educational Research, 64, 5, 195-200.&lt;/ref&gt; Curriculum theory is fundamentally concerned with [[Value (ethics)|values]],&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Kliebard (1989). Problems of Definition of Curriculum. Journal of Curriculum and Supervision, 5, 1, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Historiography|historical analysis]] of curriculum, ways of viewing current educational curriculum and policy decisions, and theorizing about the curricula of the future.&lt;ref&gt;J.J. Wallin (2011). What is ?Curriculum Theorizing: for a People Yet to Come. Stud Philos Educ, 30, 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Pinar defines the contemporary field of curriculum theory as "the effort to understand curriculum as a [[Symbolics|symbolic]] representation".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mention of the word "curriculum" in [[university]] records was in 1582, at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]], [[Holland]]: "having completed the curriculum of his studies".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton (1989) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; However, curriculum theory as a [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]] is thought to have been initiated with the publication of The [[Yale University|Yale]] Report on the Defense of the Classics in 1828, which promoted the study of a classical curriculum, including [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], by rote [[memorization]].&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faculty psychology ==
The school of [[faculty psychology]], dominating the field from 1860-1890 in the [[United States]], believed that the [[brain]] was a [[muscle]] that could be improved by the exercise of [[memorization]] (with [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] a secondary consideration).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Curriculum: An Introduction to the Study of Historical and Contemporary Curriculum Discourses|last=Pinar|first=William|last2=Reynolds|first2=William|last3=Slattery|first3=Patrick|last4=Taubman|first4=Peter|publisher=Peter Lang|year=1995|isbn=9780820426013|location=New York|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the classical theory, which previously emphasized a method of teaching school subjects using memorization and recitation as primary instructional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curriculum Development in the Postmodern Era|last=Slattery|first=Patrick|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|year=2006|isbn=9780415953375|location=New York|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory itself claims three constituent faculties or power:

* the presence of [[Volition (psychology)|will]] or volition, which enables  human beings to act;
* the [[Emotion|emotions]], which pertains to the affections and passions that enable human beings to experience pleasure, pain, love, and hate; and,
* the [[intellect]] or understanding, which is the foundation of human [[rationality]] that enables him to make judgments and comprehend meanings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Education and Human Development|last=Farenga|first=Stephen|last2=Ness|first2=Daniel|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780765612687|location=Oxon|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that education should expand the faculty of the mind and this is achieved through the key concepts of discipline and furniture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faculty theory, which steered curriculum policy for [[Elementary school|elementary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]], and high schools, was institutionalized by three committees appointed by the [[National Education Association]] (NEA) in the 1890s to follow faculty [[psychology]] principles:&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee of Ten]] on Secondary School Studies (1893), the [[Committee of Fifteen]] on Elementary Education (1895) and the Committee on College Entrance Requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== The Herbartians ==
Different schools of Curriculum Theory developed as a reaction to the [[classicism]] of [[faculty psychology]], including the Herbartians, who organized the Herbart Club in 1892, and later the National Herbart Society (1895-1899). Their philosophy was based on the thoughts of Johann Frederich Herbart, a German [[philosopher]], [[psychologist]] and [[Teacher|educator]], who believed that "the mere memorizing of isolated facts, which had characterized school instruction for ages, had little value of either educational or moral ends".
&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The social efficiency movement ==
The publication of [[John Franklin Bobbitt|John Bobbitt]]'s The Curricula in 1918 took the prevalent industrial revolutionary concepts of [[Experiment|experimental science]] and [[Social welfare function|social efficiency]] and applied them to the classroom. He believed that "curriculum must directly and specifically prepare students for tasks in the [[Adult World|adult world]]".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that "[[Life expectancy|human life]]...consists in the performance of specific activities. Education that prepares for life is one that prepares definitely and adequately for these specific activities." &lt;ref&gt;Smith, M. K. (1996, 2000) ‘Curriculum theory and practice' the encyclopaedia of informal education, www.infed.org/biblio/b-curric.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; From this idea, he suggested that curriculum was a series of experiences that children have in order to meet "[[Strategic planning|objectives]]," or abilities and habits that people need for particular activities.

Other famous theorists of this movement included [[Edward Thorndike|Edward L. Thorndyke]] (1874-1949), the father of experimental psychology in education, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] (1856-1915), with his theory of scientific management, [[David Snedden]], an educational sociologist who promoted social efficiency and vocational education, and W.W. Charters (1875-1952), a teacher educator who felt that "curriculum was {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} those methods by which objectives are determined".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; By using education as an efficiency tool, these [[Theory|theorists]] believed that society could be controlled. Students were scientifically evaluated by testing (such as [[Intelligence quotient|IQ tests]]), and educated towards their predicted role in society. This involved the introduction of [[Vocational education|vocational]] and junior high schools to address the curriculum designed around specific life activities that correlated with each student's determined [[Society|societal]] future. The socially efficient curriculum consisted of minute parts or tasks that together formed a bigger concept.

== The progressive reform movement ==
The progressive reform movement began in the late 1870s with the work of Colonel Francis Parker, but is most identified with [[John Dewey]], and also John Mayer Rice and [[Lester Frank Ward]]. Dewey's 1899 book [[The School and Society]] is often credited with starting the movement.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 90-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These reformers felt that curriculum should be child driven and at the child's present capacity level. To aid in understanding the relationship of curriculum and child, Dewey described curriculum as, "a map, a summary, an arranged and orderly view of previous experiences, serves as a guide to future experience; it gives direction; it facilitates control; it economizes effort, preventing useless wandering, and pointing out the paths which lead most quickly and most certainly to a desired result". He envisioned "the child and the curriculum are simply two limits which define a single process".&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1902). The Child and the Curriculum (pp. 1-31). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Efficiency and Progressive Reform movements were rivals throughout the 1920s in the United States, with the 1930s belonging to the Progressives, or a curriculum combining aspects of both.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 116-142.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph W. Tyler]]'s Basic Principles of Curriculum and Instruction (1949) swung the pendulum of curriculum theory away from child centeredness toward more generalized behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 148-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyler's theory was based on four fundamental questions which became known as the ''Tyler Rationale'':
# What educational purposes should the school seek to attain?
# What educational experiences can be provided that are likely to attain these purposes?
# How can these educational experiences be effectively [[Organization|organized]]?
# How can we determine whether these purposes are being attained?

== The multicultural education movement ==

There is a racial crisis in [[United States|America]], which is exacerbated by the widening gap between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation. The Journal of Negro Education, 64(4), 390–400&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address this gap within the [[multicultural education]] movement there is a [[body of knowledge]] which argues for the need to reconceptualise, re-envision, and rethink American schooling.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Banks, C. A., &amp; Banks, J. A. (1995). Equity pedagogy: An essential component of multicultural education. Theory into Practice, 34(3), 152–158&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[author]]s advocate the need for fundamental changes in the [[Education|educational system]] which acknowledges that there is a plurality within teaching and learning for students of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, G. (2002). Preparing for culturally responsive teaching. JOURNAL OF TEACHER EDUCATION-WASHINGTON DC-, 53(2), 106–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013). The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. Teaching in Higher Education, 1–13. doi:10.1080/13562517.2012.725221&lt;/ref&gt; Current research suggests that educational structure is oppressive to students &lt;ref&gt;Freire, P. (2000). Pedagogy of the oppressed. Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; of diversity and is an obstacle to integration into society and student achievement. Current multicultural education theory suggests that curriculum and institutional change is required to support the development of students from diverse [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] and [[Culture|cultural]] backgrounds. This is a controversial view &lt;ref&gt;d'Souza, D. (1991). Illiberal education: The politics of race and sex on campus. Simon and Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; but multicultural education argues &lt;ref&gt;Banks, J. A. (1995). Multicultural education and curriculum transformation. The Journal of Negro Education, 64(4), 390–400&lt;/ref&gt; that traditional curriculum does not adequately represent the history of the non dominant group.&lt;ref&gt;Sabry, N. S., &amp; Bruna, K. R. (2007). Learning from the experience of Muslim students in American schools: Towards a proactive model of school-community cooperation. Multicultural Perspectives, 9(3), 44–50&lt;/ref&gt; Nieto (1999) &lt;ref&gt;Nieto, S. (1999). The Light in Their Eyes: Creating Multicultural Learning Communities. Multicultural Education Series. ERIC.&lt;/ref&gt; supports this concern for students who do not belong to the dominant group and seem to have challenging curriculum experiences that conflict with their personal cultural identity and their wider community reference groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jabbar, A., &amp; Hardaker, G. (2013). The role of culturally responsive teaching for supporting ethnic diversity in British University Business Schools. Teaching in Higher Education, 1–13. doi:10.1080/13562517.2012.725221. http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/15029/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sputnik and the National Defense Act ==
The launch of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957 created a focus on science and math  in the United States curriculum. [[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Hyman Rickover]] accused the American public of indifference to intellectual achievement. "Our schools must return to the tradition of formal education in [[Western culture|Western civilization]]-transmission of [[cultural heritage]], and preparation for life through rigorous intellectual training of young minds to think clearly, logically, and independently".&lt;ref&gt;H. Rickover (1959) in W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a return to curricula similar to the classicists of the 1890s and the modern birth of the traditionalists, with massive federal funding for curriculum development provided by the National Defense Act of 1958.

== Reconceptualized curriculum ==
Joseph J. Schwab was instrumental in provoking curriculum developers to think beyond the traditionalist approach. In his 1969 paper "The Practical: A Language for Curriculum" he declared the curriculum field "moribund".&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus the social unrest of the 1960s and '70s stirred a new movement of "reconceptualization" of curricula. A group of theorists, including James Macdonald, [[Dwayne Huebner]], Ross Mooney, Herbert M. Kliebard, Paul Klohr, Michael Apple, W.F. Pinar, and others, created ways of thinking about curriculum and its role in the [[academy]], in [[school]]s, and in [[society]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kliebard (2004). The Struggle for the American Curriculum,1893-1958. New York, NY: RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach included perspectives from the [[social]], [[Race (human categorization)|racial]], [[gender]], [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]], [[Politics|political]], [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] and [[Theology|theological]] points of view.

== &lt;font color="#777777"&gt;T&lt;/font&gt;oday ==
W.F. Pinar describes the present field "balkanized...divided into relatively separate fiefdoms or sectors of scholarship, each usually ignoring the other except for occasional criticism."&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Pinar (2004). Understanding Curriculum. New York, NY: Peter Lang Publishing, Inc., p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The top-down governmental control of educational curriculum in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world, including the United States, has been criticized as being "ahistorical and atheoretical, and as a result prone to difficult problems in its implementation".&lt;ref&gt;M.

'''DPubS''' ('''Digital Publishing System'''), developed by [[Cornell University]] Library and [[Penn State University]] Libraries, is a free [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publication management software.  DPubS arose out of Project Euclid, an electronic publishing platform for journals in mathematics and statistics.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;Thomas, S. (2006).  Publishing solutions for contemporary scholars: The library as innovator and partner. Library Hi Tech, 24(4), 563-573.&lt;/ref&gt; DPubS is [[free software]] released under [[Educational Community License]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/dpubs/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Cornell University Library’s involvement in digital publishing dates back to the 1980s.  In partnership with the Xerox Corporation and the Commission on Preservation and Access, Cornell developed an early digital imaging project to preserve books in a fragile condition.&lt;ref&gt;New developments in library automation. (1990). American Libraries, 21(9), 903-904.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially focused upon republishing mathematics titles, this effort expanded to include projects in agricultural history, home economics and [[American studies]].&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt; 

The “serials crisis” in the 1980s and 1990s likely encouraged Cornell University Library and other academic libraries and institutions to investigate such possibilities.  In the 1980s libraries noticed that their journal subscription prices were increasing alarmingly.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R.H. (2000).  Electronic resources and academic libraries, 1980-2000: A historical perspective.  Library Trends, 48(4), 645.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, many solutions were being explored, with cancellations being significant among them; in one dramatic case, LSU cancelled $650,000 in subscriptions in 1992-93.&lt;ref&gt;Hamakar, C.A. (1996).  Redesigning research libraries: First step toward the 21st century. In S. H. Lee (Ed.), Access, resource sharing and collection development (pp. 33-48). New York: Haworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other alternatives emerged, however, involving the use of new technologies – such as those that enabled Cornell’s digital imaging project – and the increasing availability of the Internet. 
    
One such method of increasing access, [[Project MUSE]], was initiated by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].  Initially, Project Muse was intended to allow electronic access to titles published by Johns Hopkins University Press, but it has expanded to include the “full text of more than 300 journals from 60 different publishing groups worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Dye, J.L. (2005).  Project Muse celebrates 10 years.  Information Today, 22(9), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another such project, developed by Cornell University Library and influenced by Project Muse, is [[Project Euclid]], an electronic gathering of mathematics and statistics journals.&lt;ref name=carlson&gt;Carlson, S. (2004). Cornell will offer open-source package for producing electronic journals. Chronicle of Higher Education, 51(6), A35.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005 it was delivering “40 journals to libraries and individuals under subscription, hosting, or open access delivery plans."&lt;ref name=ehling&gt;Ehling, T. (2005).  DPuBs: The development of an open source publishing system.  
Publishing Research Quarterly, 20(4), 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Project Euclid was developed out of the code used to create NCSTRL, “a distributed network of Computer Science technical reports” in Cornell’s Computer Science department.&lt;ref name=org&gt;[http://dpubs.org DPubS Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers an opportunity for “low-cost independent and society journals” to take advantage of the benefits of inclusion in an online database “without sacrificing their intellectual or economic independence or commitment to low subscription prices."&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University Library (2007). Mission and goals. Project Euclid.  Retrieved April 11, 2007. [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?Service=UI&amp;version=1.0&amp;verb=Display&amp;handle=euclid&amp;page=about&amp;aboutPage=about_mission]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Several pricing options are available: Euclid Prime (EP), Euclid Select (ES), Euclid Direct (ED), and Open Access (OA).&lt;ref&gt;McKiernan, G. (2004).  Project Euclid: Mathematics and statistics journals.  [[The Charleston Advisor]], 6(1), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;     

Developed with the help of two grants from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Project Euclid, named after ancient mathematician [[Euclid|Euclid of Alexandria]], launched in 2003.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  As did their experience developing the digital imaging project, Project Euclid afforded Cornell University Library the opportunity to learn a great deal.  Specifically, the library discovered much about functioning as a digital press that it was previously unfamiliar with, such as “marketing or handling subscription requests . . . editorial management procedures and the ability to negotiate contracts with journal owners."&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  While Euclid has been successful thus far – reported as “healthy and growing” in early 2006 – Cornell’s heavy investment in the project and the ever-changing nature of the academic journal field where “sustainability is a moving target” has led to the exploration of other publishing avenues.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;

Another initiative with relevance to the development of DPubS, [[arXiv]], came to Cornell along with its initial developer Paul Ginsparg in 2001.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  Institutional repositories, which serve as a central database of scholarly work such as [[preprint]]s and [[postprint]]s of journal articles, have become increasingly popular: [[OpenDOAR]], an online directory of open access repositories, has shown an increase from 350 to 850 repositories included in its database since mid-2006.&lt;ref&gt;Growth of the OpenDOAR Database – Worldwide. (2007). Directory of Open Access Repositories. Retrieved April 11, 2007, from http://www.opendoar.org/find.php?format=charts&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of arXiv has been described as “intense,” averaging about 4,000 submissions per month in 2005.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  Though many repositories – including all of those listed in OpenDOAR – are open access, they “have not substituted for traditional publications, and thus have not had a substantial impact on the journals pricing situation."&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  However, the success of open access repositories such as arXiv could indicate a growing willingness on the part of scholars to make use of non-traditional methods of publishing for their work.        

Apart from Cornell’s own desire to inquire further into unconventional approaches to publishing, there was an additional motivator.  One of the results of the release of Project Euclid was interest in the software used to produce it.  Cornell decided that they would eventually release this software, renaming it DPubS, but that it needed further development in order to be utilized by others.&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt;  It was in 2004 that the [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] became involved – expressing interest in the software that was used to develop Project Euclid – and the first project in developing DPubS was making available the journal Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies.&lt;ref name=ehling /&gt;  This journal has been published since 1934 and is an official publication of the Pennsylvania Historical Association (PHA).&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University Library (2005).  Press release: June 21, 2005.  Retrieved April 24, 2007 from http://dpubs.org/CUL-DPubS-Release20050621.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

Also in 2004, Terry Ehling, the Director of the Center for Innovative Publishing at Cornell University Library addressed four goals for developing the software used to create Project Euclid into DPubS.  These goals included: broadening the software’s applicability by expanding its flexibility, including improving its ability to be used for monographs and other “non-serial literature”; “provide on-line editorial management services to support ‘peer review’ activities”; further developing “the administrative functionality and interface”; and “provide interoperability with institutional repository systems."&lt;ref name=ehling /&gt;  Furthermore, the DpubS website states the following as the development goals of Cornell University Library and Penn State University Libraries: “generalizing the platform beyond a single discipline and document format (serials); adding administrative interfaces for non-technical staff; allowing a level of interoperability between DPubS and institutional repository systems, specifically Fedora and DSpace and developing editorial services to support the peer review process.”  

==Features==

After two years of development, DPubS was released in November 2006, also with thanks to a grant of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.&lt;ref name=atl&gt;Cornell, Penn State release DPubS software. (2006). Advanced Technology Libraries, 35(12), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its user interface utilizes XML (Extensible Markup Language) and XSLT (eXtensible Style Sheet Language Transformations) which enable a high-level of adjustment for the design of the Web appearance for publications supported by DPubS.&lt;ref name=atl /&gt; Additionally, it has the following features: “scalable, single platform for electronic publishing,” allowing for the publication of several formats from one place; “rich presentation features,” due to the inclusion of XML; “multiple business models,” allowing both publications that are open access and those that are fee-based to utilize the software; “greater exposure and visibility of publications,” due to the use of OAI-MHP 2.0 (Open Access Initiative Metadata Harvesting Protocol) to allow metadata to be harvested from the content supported by DPubS and shared with users through services such as Google Scholar; “administrative management tools for non-technical staff”; “interoperability with institutional repositories” such as Fedora and DSpace (the latter forthcoming as of April 2007); “flexible and extensible handling of file and metadata formats,” allowing the easy use of PDFs, HTML, Microsoft Word files, PowerPoint presentations, etc.; and a “modular architecture allowing easy extension and customization.&lt;ref name=org /&gt;
Cornell and Penn State seem to have been largely successful in addressing most of the goals stated by Ehling, particularly in its customizability.  As intended, the software used to develop Project Euclid has been expanded in order to encompass non-journal publications such as books and conference proceedings.&lt;ref name=atl /&gt;  Furthermore, the DpubS software can be adapted in order to be used with other formats.  This aspect of DpubS results from it being open source, meaning that the software’s coding has been made available, enabling programmers to develop additions and modifications of the software for their own and others purposes.&lt;ref name=atl /&gt;  While the administrative tools have been included, the editorial management services will wait for “future releases.”&lt;ref name=atl /&gt; 

Toward the goal of further development, Cornell University Library and The Pennsylvania State University Libraries has partnered with several institutions that will be using DPubS and providing feedback.  As of April 2007, these partners were: Australian National University, Bielefeld University – Germany, University of Kansas, University of Utah, University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Vanderbilt University.&lt;ref name=org /&gt;  Along with Pennsylvania History mentioned above, other journals being supported by DPubS include: Medieval Philosophy and Theology, “a semi-annual, peer-reviewed journal . . . of medieval philosophy, including logic and natural science, and in medieval theology, including Christian, Jewish, and Islamic”; Indonesia, “a semi-annual journal published by the Cornell Southeast Asia Program . . . of Indonesia’s culture, history, government, economy, and society from 1966 to the present”; and Cornell Technical Reports and Papers, “a collection of publications from the Cornell Theory Center, the Cornell Computer Science Department, and other departments and units."&lt;ref name=org /&gt; 

DPubS has been designed with the opinion that “libraries should get involved in publishing."&lt;ref name=org /&gt;  As mentioned above, the traditional model of journal publication and the dissemination of scholarly information has been through those titles published by commercial publishers.  Over time, the reputations of scholars have become strongly linked with the appearance of their work in these journals to the exception of publications outside of the commercial realm; some groups of scholars initially reacted to Project Euclid in a “skittish” manner due to concerns over the unfamiliar nature of its model.&lt;ref name=thomas /&gt;  The creators of DPubs believe that libraries are uniquely positioned to play an important role in alternating this status quo.&lt;ref name=org /&gt;  Efforts such as Project Muse, Project Euclid, arXiv, DPubS and other endeavors represent the kind of efforts that can be made by libraries and university presses to combat the challenges rising journal prices have presented to their budgets.  Furthermore, due to issues of profitability, an increasing amount of scholarship does not get printed.&lt;ref name=org /&gt;  

DPubS’ potential to contain the “cycle of knowledge creation and dissemination . . . within the academy and its close collaborators” could have a significant impact on academic publishing.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;  DPubS positions itself to “encourage” libraries to take upon a new role with new responsibilities in order to alter some of the regrettable developments in the accessibility of scholarship over the past several decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpubs.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The hope is that it will help to increase access through electronic publishing by offering for free software that could easily cost six figures “for the initial licensing."&lt;ref name=carlson /&gt;

The '''Doctor of Management''' (D.M., D.Mgt. or DMan) is a [[doctoral degree]] focusing on advanced study and research in the applied science and practice of professional [[management]].&lt;ref name=Herts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/dmanma-by-research|title=Professional Doctorate in Management|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and focus==
The D.M. was introduced at [[Case Western Reserve]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; and several universities have since developed their own programs. In the UK, the Doctor of Management (DMan) was introduced at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=DMan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0018/25209/CMGdman-brochure2011.docx|title=Doctor of Management/Master of Arts|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|date=December 2010|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.M. program is an applied professional practice doctorate including a similar strong emphasis on research to the academically-equivalent [[PhD in management]], but with a focus on the application of management theories rather than on developing and extending those theories.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132958/http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx| archive-date=20 December 2017|format=PDF|url=http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx | title=D.M. or Ph.D. in Management?| accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, it is focused on developing the talents, skills and abilities of organization executives and experienced management professionals.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=6624 | title=A Degree of Difference: A Doctorate in Management| accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.M. versus Ph.D.===
In most cases, the distinction between the degrees is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.M. further emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of this theoretical knowledge. The Ph.D. thus prepares students for careers in academia, while the D.M. is more aimed at those seeking a career in management.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"/&gt; Some D.M. programs require a [[dissertation]], while others have replaced this with a number of applied research projects.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; 

The British DMan is a professional doctorate with the same academic status as a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=DMan/&gt; The U.S. Doctor of Management is also a professional doctorate but is not (as of the report ''Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014'') recognised as a Ph.D.-equivalent research doctorate by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/technotes.cfm|title=Technical Notes|work= Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014 |date=December 2015|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doctorate is sometimes viewed as a variant of the Ph.D. in Management (especially when a dissertation is required in the program).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Program structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
To be admitted as a doctoral management student in the U.S., one must hold a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|management-related]] [[master's degree]], have sufficient managerial experience, and pass a comprehensive entrance exam or doctoral essay. In the UK (and in many programs in the U.S.), there is a minimum of five years of management or professional consulting experience required. In the UK, an [[honours degree]] plus a relevant master's degree is preferred.&lt;ref name=Herts/&gt; The student must then complete necessary [[coursework]] (typically focused on [[Management#Management skills|leadership]] and [[business strategy|strategy]], and including training in [[research methodology]]), perform independent original [[thesis|research]] under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], pass the doctoral dissertation or doctoral [[thesis defense]], and in some cases, teach examinable courses.

Although it can be completed in as little as three years, the D.M. typically takes 4–6 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two years of the program are usually focused on intensive doctoral-level coursework and generally at least one research practicum (near the end of core courses, residencies, and research and writing training). It may be followed by a comprehensive examination (comps) at this point if the candidate has successfully reached this stage.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the PhD, the subsequent dissertation completion phase for the D.M. can take an additional two or more years. In some programs where the candidate has a good deal of professional management practical experience, the D.M. can be completed in as little as three years if the candidate has proven capable of taking a full load of credits each term, as well as successful completion of the required dissertation and its defense.

===Research methodologies===
Common research methodologies used in management studies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches such as: [[Business model|Modeling]], [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, Descriptive and Field Studies, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]], [[Case Study]], [[Action Research]] or [[Mixed Methods]] strategies of inquiry.

==Scholarship Programme==
GBS has 25% of students studying on a scholarship basis. The annual budget is around 10 million rupees, which is met from sponsoring agencies and individual donors. The major sponsoring donor agencies include FELM Finland, BMS UK, P.C of Ireland and some donors from USA and Australia. The Government of Nepal provides 1 million rupees annually through the Ministry of Education to support the scholarship program. A full scholarship costs 1400 USD per year. A partial scholarship is also awarded.

Scholarships are awarded to economically disadvantaged but intelligent students. The number of students studying on scholarship is 180.  They represent various ethnic groups and are from various districts of the country. Every year,during January/February scholarship entrance exams are conducted in eight centers across the Western Region of Nepal to select deserving students. Home visits are made to verify information and confirm the scholarship.

The scholarship program has been a part of GBS and GCES for many years. Through the program, the lives of  children from poor and disadvantaged families have been transformed.

===Dr P.V Chandy GBS Scholarship Trust===
Although the scholarship programme is continuing with the financial support of donor agencies, individual donors and the government of Nepal, it seemed imperative to open a trust in order to provide a strong financial security to the scholarship programme even after the UMN withdraws its support to the school. For this reason, Dr. P. V Chandy GBS Trust was established at the initiation of UMN expatriate Principal, Dr. P. V Chandy with the approval of the GBS Management committee and the United Mission to Nepal. The trust has been registered with the Government of Nepal, District Administration office, Kaski.

Dr. P. V Chandy is the chief patron of this trust, and a committee consisting of 10 members has been formed under the chairperson of EX. Rt Hon. Member of the Raj Parisad Standing Committee, Mr. Ganesh Bahdur Gurung. 48.5 million (4.85 crore) rupees has been raised and deposited at fixed accounts. Its mission is to raise the fund up to 10 million (10 crore) rupees so that the scholarship programme can continue to survive from the interest of the trust even after the withdrawal of the UMN's involvement.

Global studies is oriented around the study of [[globalization]] as it relates to intercontinental politics, the global economy, international law, market relations, the movement of people and resources, global communications, the effect of human activity on the environment, and many more topics. Global studies is often used to map global change and is both [[Microeconomics|micro]] and [[Macroeconomics|macro]] in scope. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines global studies as ''"the study of political, economic, and social situations in the world"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge English Dictionary: Global Studies|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/global-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global studies tackles the aforementioned topics by examining global power structures influenced by perspectives such as [[Orientalism]] and [[Eurocentrism]]. Global studies is distinguished from international studies by its broader focus – [[international studies]] is only one aspect of global studies. In cases such as international studies or [[international relations]], the concept of 'national' confines the meaning of those fields of study. By comparison, global studies has a broader reach, from the global to the local.

== History and context ==
{{See also|Globalization}}
The development of global studies in secondary and tertiary education is arguably a product of globalization, and its consequent results on the international community. In the late 20th century, an unprecedented rise in communications technologies and computerization occurred around the world, again enhancing the processes of globalization: “it is a shift in our very life circumstances ... the speed of change is closely allied to the growth of communication, and development in information and communication technologies have been exponential ... globalization is a fact of life from which we cannot retreat.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The consequences of modernity|last=Giddens|first=Anthony|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this constantly changing global community, education providers began to see a need for the introduction of global studies into secondary school curricula (i.e. introduction of  [[global issues]]  through already existing subjects), and to create global studies degrees for tertiary students (i.e. sole degrees with a global focus).

According to Jan Nederveen Pieterse, Mellichamp Professor of Global Studies and Sociology at The University of California, Santa Barbara:&lt;blockquote&gt;The first Global Studies conference took place at the University of Illinois Chicago in 2008; the 2009 conference was held in Dubai on the theme Views from Dubai: The Gulf and Globalization. The 2010 conference was in Busan, South Korea under the heading Global Rebalancing: East Asia and Globalization; the 2011 conference took place in Rio de Janeiro on Emerging societies and Emancipation; the 2012 conference was at Moscow University on the theme of Eurasia and  Globalization: Complexity  and Global studies; and the 2013 conference took place in New Delhi on the theme of Social Development in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/assets/downloads/global/E14FinalProgram.pdf|title=Seventh Global Studies Conference Program|last=|first=|date=|website=onglobalization.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Global Studies Journal was founded in 2008 and is "devoted to mapping and interpreting new trends and patterns in globalization".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onglobalization.com/journal|title=Journal – Global Studies Research Network|website=onglobalization.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of global studies ==

=== Global vs. international studies ===
There can be much confusion about the use of the terms, "global studies" and "international studies."

They are at times used interchangeably and differences in meaning are not evident, however, both disciplines are concerned with political, social and cultural issues, with the main focus of study being placed on international community interaction. However, subtle distinctions can be made between the two phrases. International studies generally looks at exchanges between states, multilateral or bilateral agreements, diplomacy and how issues are handled between two or more states. Global studies, in contrast, focuses on globally shared issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalstudies.unc.edu/masters/|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that there are [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] connotations to each phrase, international studies being preferred by the right wing (i.e. relations between states) and global studies preferred by the left (i.e. issues affecting all global citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Andrew|title=Liberal Theories of International Relations: A Primer|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~amoravcs/publications.html|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms have also been described as such:

&lt;blockquote&gt;International studies might be called the grandfather of global education. It often includes the study of countries, world religions, languages and international relations ... (global studies) is centred on the concept of connectedness – recognizing local/ global connections, the commonalities all humans share, and how understanding how national borders have become practically irrelevant for many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;Merryfield, M 2004 ‘The importance of a global education,’ ''Outreach World'', viewed 5/10/10 at: http://www.outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207103229/http://outreachworld.org/article.asp?articleid=77 |date=2011-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
Five defining characteristics of global studies were identified by scholars at the first annual meeting of the [[Global Studies Consortium]] in Tokyo in 2008:&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Juergensmeyer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXhfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Conference+2008+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAnRbWAD4e&amp;sig=3h2899QfrUezZ9coblAqlLLTUfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5Izjj_HKAhVF7yYKHchxBpcQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Conference%202008%20Tokyo&amp;f=false ''Thinking Globally: A Global Studies Reader'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wikt:transnational|Transnational]]
* [[Interdisciplinary]]: global studies scholarship can involve politics, economics, history, geography, anthropology, sociology, religion, technology, philosophy, health as well as the study of the environment, gender, and race.
* [[Contemporary]] and [[historical]] examples range from the transnational activity of the Greek and Roman Empires to modern European colonialism.
* [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial]] and [[Critical theory|Critical]]: global studies often emphasizes a postcolonial perspective, and attempts to analyze global phenomena through a critical, multicultural lens.

== Subjects of interest ==
The field of global studies revolves around the impacts of globalization and the growing interdependence of states, economies, societies, cultures, and people. This necessitates that students are well versed and capable of critical analysis when it comes to global issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Education Policies and Practices," Peace Corps. {{cite web |url=http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612210639/http://peacecorpsconnect.org/global-education-policies-and-practices |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the most pressing issues in global studies are [[national security]] and [[diplomacy]], effective [[citizenship]] in a [[participatory democracy]], global [[competitiveness]] in a world market and the desire to enter the aid and development sector.

=== National security ===
The first major funding for international education was the 1966 International Education Act in the US.  It provided funding to institutions of higher education to create and strengthen international studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Digest for Education Statistics, 2004 – Chapter 4: Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities." National Center for Education Statistics (2004), http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d04/ch_4.asp, accessed September 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Created at the time of the [[Cold War]], this act stressed the need for all citizens (with a focus on USA citizens) to understand global issues in order to build skills for diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;International Education Act: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Education of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, United States Senate, Eighty-Ninth Congress, Second Session on S. 2874 and H.R. 14643. Publication date: 1966, Accessed through ERIC, http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED093756&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED093756.&lt;/ref&gt;”The importance of diplomacy as a driving force for political development is well known and understood. It is of great importance as a long term instrument for conflict prevention.”&lt;ref&gt;Skylakakis, T 2010, ‘The importance of economic diplomacy,’ The Bridge Magazine, viewed 24/9/10 at:  http://www.bridgemag.com/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=38&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of issues and crisis on a global scale such as international terrorism, climate change and environmental degradation, pandemics (such as ebola), and the [[Great Recession]] have convinced policymakers of the importance of global studies and international education to national security and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Korry, Elaine. "Bush Expected to Hike Funding for Language Training," National Public Radio Broadcast, January 5, 2006, Accessed online https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5127944&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global economy ===

A second motivation for global studies is facilitating a better understanding of the [[global marketplace]].  Many international companies have identified the need for a workforce that has the skills to work cross-culturally and identify and serve the needs of a global market.&lt;ref&gt;Groennings, Sven. "Economic Competitiveness and International Knowledge.  A Regional Project on the Global Economy and Higher Education in New England.  Staff Paper II."  New England Board of Higher Education. October 28, 1987. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Some international companies, such as Microsoft, have taken the lead in convening policymakers and key stakeholders to demand additional investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;"ECS, ISTE and [[Microsoft]] to Sponsor Global Education Competitiveness Summit." http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/jun09/06-23gecs2009nrpr.mspx, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US state and federal governments have also placed global studies as a key priority for preparing a competitive workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Putting the World into World Class Education.  West Virginia Department of Education. http://wvconnections.k12.wv.us/documents/GlobalAwarenessPresentation062408_001.ppt, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2002 the Australian federal government (through its development body AusAID) used some of its funding to introduce a ‘Global Education Program.’ This program aims to increase understanding of development and international issues among Australian students. It provides teachers with professional development opportunities with NGOs and thorough curriculum support. The program “informs and encourages teachers to introduce students to global issues in a classroom setting.”&lt;ref&gt;Gallus, C 2002 ‘Global Studies Statement Launch,” AusAID, viewed 2/10/10 at:  {{cite web |url=http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923153626/http://ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Speech&amp;ID=9768_9422_1276_9667_8426 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education institutions have closely followed with integrating international studies across disciplines.  It is rare to find a leading business school without an international focus.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School. http://www.hbs.edu/global/, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yale Business School. http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925054608/http://mba.yale.edu/MBA/curriculum/core/international.shtml |date=2009-09-25 }}, Accessed September 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global citizenship and rights ===
A third motivation for global studies is the creation of an effective citizenry.  In the US, the National Council of Social Studies states that the purpose of social studies is to “teach students the content knowledge, intellectual skills, and civic values necessary for fulfilling the duties of citizenship in a participatory democracy.”  A key goal of the NCSS is “global education”.&lt;ref&gt;"About National Council for the Social Studies." The National Council for Social Studies, http://www.socialstudies.org/about, Accessed September 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As globalization causes the lines between national and international to become blurred, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to understand global relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Lapayese, Yvette. "Review:Toward a Critical Global Studies Education" Comparative Education Review, Vol. 47, No. 4 (Nov., 2003), pp. 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of effective [[Global citizenship]] results in people who are willing to, and have the capacity to become involved in local and global issues. In the UK, local government research conducted in the surrounding areas of London has found that citizens must have the opportunity to become involved and then possess the skill, knowledge and confidence to take part. The outcomes are often very positive, leading to an improvement in services, better quality of democratic participation and community education.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Cowell, Downe, Martin 2006 ‘Promoting effective citizenship and community empowerment,’ Office of the Deputy PM, London, viewed at: {{cite web |url=http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725151250/http://www.cdhn.org/documentbank/uploads/PromotingEffectiveCitizenship.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;    
To achieve effective citizenship, students must be educated in ways that engage and place emphasis on the importance of global issues. By studying a subject such as global studies, students can gain the knowledge required to become effective citizens.

Some critical scholars note that beyond content, students must be taught "global cognition" in order to truly understand global perspectives.  These scholars believe that in order to fully understand world issues, students must recognize that their perspective is not necessarily shared by others and understand the social forces that influence their views.&lt;ref&gt;Hanvey, Robert. "An Attainable Global Perspective." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Charlotte. "Global Education in the Classroom." Theory into Practice, Vol. 21, No. 3, Global Education (Summer, 1982), pp. 168–76&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives encourage engagement with new promises and threats for the promotion of human rights, social justice, and political participation.

=== International Institutions ===
By 2006, the international development sector had expanded exponentially, with the “NGO sector now being the 8th largest economy in the world ... employing nearly 19 million paid workers."&lt;ref&gt;Hall-Jones, P 2006, ‘The rise and rise of NGOs,’ Public Services International, viewed 23/9/10 at: http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727122306/http://www.world-psi.org/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=11738&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm |date=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financing health projects used to be the biggest issue in global aid, but private and public organizations like the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] have helped overcome such problems. The issue now is making sure that the money is used in a proper manner to help those in need of the primary essentials of life.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Laurie. 2007. "The Challenge of Global Health," ''Foreign Affairs'' '''86''' (1):14-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying global studies may lead to involvement in the aid and [[International development|development]] sector in multiple ways. These can include working in post-conflict or natural disaster zones, improving public services in developing communities (health, education, infrastructure, agriculture) or aiding private sector growth through business and market models.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey International Development, 2010 ‘Work that makes a difference,’ Coffey, viewed 24/9/10 at: http://www.coffey.com/our-businesses/coffey-international-development/our-expertise/sectors/overview{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through studying global studies, students can be equipped with cross cultural knowledge, field experience and an awareness of global issues. Many students are now studying global studies in order to enter this sector.

== Learning outcomes and job prospects ==
Learning outcomes for global studies vary depending on the institutes curriculum and students individual focuses. Although, introductory courses are designed to cover a wide range of topics in a single semester, students are expected to delve into a specific phenomenon or area of study for their academic career.   there are some generic outcomes that students are expected to develop over the duration of study. These include, but are not limited to:
*Cultural awareness
*Ability to analyze the interconnectedness of the global and local
*Skills in ethical research and analysis with specific policy implications
*Awareness of current affairs
*Ability to communicate effectively in a range of situations
*Increase in cross cultural competence
*potentially improve proficiency in a foreign language

Global studies scholars are eligible for a myriad of professions, tackling political, social, and economic issues on an international scale that work to improve the human condition.
*International relations
*Foreign affairs
*NGOs
*Local, national, and international government 
*Environmental research
*Historical Analysis

'''Group piano''' is the study of how to play the piano in a group setting. This contrasts with the more common individual/private lesson. Group piano originated at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and continues to be a widely-used method of piano instruction. Group lesson formats include [[Master class|master classes]], university classes, and pre-college music lessons. These classes typically have between 3 and 16 students. Benefits of the group lesson format include the development of independent learning, ensemble playing, critical listening skills, and exposure to a wide range of repertoire. Group piano instruction may require more space and equipment, increased preparation per class, and more attention to scheduling and group interaction than when teaching individual/private lessons.  

== History ==
Group piano instruction can be traced to [[Johann Bernhard Logier]] (1777-1846). Logier, an Irish business man, developed a system of teaching that increased income for teachers while lowering the cost of lessons for students. His classes accommodated up to thirty students of differing skill levels. The focus of the class was developing music theory and keyboard theory rather than developing advanced technique. Due to the affordability of Logier's class format, it quickly gained traction in Great Britain, India, Ireland, and the United States. 

Master classes were often taught by well-known pianist/composers. [[Clara Schumann]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Carl Tausig]], [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Theodor Kullak|Theodore Kullak]], and [[Hans von Bülow]] were some of the most famous teachers to teach in this format.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/38665/Chiu_washington_0250E_16696.pdf?sequence=1|title=A Comparative Evaluation of Group and Private Piano Instruction on the Musical Achievements of Young Beginners|last=Chiu|first=Pai-Yu|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These classes occurred in the homes of teachers as well as in newly-formed [[Music school#Conservatory|conservatories]].

The Industrial Revolution and ensuing rise of the middle class in the 19th century provided increased opportunities for leisure activities and created a high demand for pianos. By the end of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the United States was a world leader in the production of pianos, and families all over the country owned a piano and sought music instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/amcm/hd_amcm.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century Classical Music|last=Dobney|first=Jayson Kerr|date=2004|website=www.metmuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1889 the U.S. Office of Education promoted class piano programs in elementary schools as a viable way for students to get an affordable music education. The first group piano classes in public schools launched in 1913 and grew until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, method books for teaching piano in the classroom began to be published. These included ''Young Student’s Piano Course'' by Earhart and Boyd (1918), ''Public School Class Method for Piano'' (1919) by Giddings and Gilman, and ''Steps for the Young Pianist'' (1919) by Hazel Kinsecella. By the end of the 1920s, over eight hundred elementary schools in the United States offered class piano programs, creating a demand for teacher training courses and certificate programs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Piano in Groups|last=Fisher|first=Christopher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-533703-7|location=New York, New York|pages=3-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, interest in elementary class piano programs began to decline due in part to the great depression and the second world war.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As group piano declined in public elementary schools, group lessons in the college setting began to gain momentum. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, [https://mtr.arcade-museum.com/MTR-1952-111-6/index.php?page_no=12 Raymond Burrows], a professor at Columbia University Teachers College, pioneered collegiate group piano instruction using piano labs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamic Group Piano Teaching|last=Pike|first=Pamela|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-138-24142-8|location=New York, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1952, Burrows calculated that 256 universities in the United States provided group piano classes. These courses were designed to provide music majors with functional keyboard skills that would aid them in their musical careers; these classes focused on harmonization, transposition, and sight-reading. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because most university piano teachers were more familiar with the individual/private lesson format, universities began to offer [[iarchive:elementarypianoi00burr|courses]] in teaching group piano.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Group piano lessons in the college setting continued to expand with the invention of the electronic keyboard laboratory, first achieved by [[Ball State University]] in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haddon|first=Elizabeth|date=2017|title=Piano Performance: Group Classes for the Life Long Learner|url=|journal=Research Studies in Music Education|volume=39|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Independent pre-college piano studios continued to implement the group piano format. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Robert Pace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iptfonline.org/Piano%20Lessons.pdf|title=Piano Lessons - Private or Group?|last=Pace|first=Robert|date=1978|website=International Piano Teaching Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, James Bastien, and [[Frances Clark]] began to write books encouraging partner lessons, group lessons, and various combinations of group and private instruction. By the end of the 1970s, group piano was established as profitable format for instruction. The [[Music Teachers National Association]] (MTNA) and the National Piano Foundation (NPF) began to provide training on teaching in groups, and journals such as ''American Music Teacher, Piano Quarterly'', ''Keyboard Companion'', and ''Clavier'' began publishing articles related to teaching in groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Student populations ==

=== Pre-college ===
Pre-college group piano classes are designed for students ranging in age from 4-18. Groups are usually created based on student experience and skill level. Pre-college group piano lessons may take place in a private studio with multiple keyboards or a piano lab in a school. Lessons may include a mixture of playing piano and activities away from the piano. There are group piano method books available and most methods can be adapted to fit group lessons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== College ===
Most North American university music departments provide group piano classes. The [[National Association of Schools of Music|National Association of Schools of Music (NASM)]], the principal U.S. accreditation organization of approximately 643 institutions educational programs in music and music-related disciplines, includes “keyboard competency” in their handbook as a necessary requirement for music students to graduate. Group piano classes are the most widely-used format for teaching keyboard competency to college students due to its efficiency and the advantages of group learning. Advocates for collegiate group piano have stated that it is the “most effective and efficient tool” for enabling students to be independent learners so they can continue to make music for a lifetime.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amoriello|first=Laura|date=September 2016|title=Student Perspectives on Secondary Piano|url=|journal=MTNA E-Journal|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NASM does not define "keyboard competency", there is a general consensus among universities that competency should include functional piano skills such as the playing of repertoire, harmonization, transposition, sight-reading, open score reading, and improvisation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Margaret|date=February 2016|title=A National Survey of University-Level Group Piano Programs|url=|journal=MTNA E-Journal|volume=|pages=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Margaret|date=2013|title=University-Level Group Piano Instruction and Professional Musicians.|url=|journal=Music Education Research|volume=Vol 15|pages=59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The structure of college level group piano classes varies by university. Group piano sequences typically involve 2 to 6 semesters, situated within the first 2 or 3 years of study. Goals of the group piano sequence include introducing and reinforcing functional keyboard skills, bringing students with varying musical background to a competent level by the end of the course, and nurturing enthusiasm for music in general and the piano specifically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At the end of the course sequence, music majors must often take a piano proficiency exam. Most piano proficiency exams require students to transpose, harmonize, sight-read, and perform a piece of solo piano repertoire. 

=== Adults ===
Group piano lessons are often taken by adults as a hobby and for personal development. They may take place in a private studio with multiple keyboards or a piano lab in a college community program. Because of the wide range of students, groups should be formed based upon students’ life span development stage or level of experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These lessons are often more flexible than pre-college and collegiate classes and involve more collaborative decision making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The relatively new field of [[andragogy]] can inform teachers that engage in the teaching of adult group piano. Sponsored by the National Piano Foundation (NPF) and the [[National Association of Music Merchants]] (NAMM), Recreational Music-Making (RMM) is an approach to teaching adults that recognizes personal, social, and health-based benefits to music study in addition to the development of musical skills and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jutras|first=PJ|date=2006|title=The Benefits of Adult Piano Study as Self-Reported by Selected Adult Piano Students.|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=54 (2)|pages=97-110|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dillon|first=Brenda|date=2007|title=Recreational Music Making|url=|journal=American Music Teacher|volume=57 (1)|pages=21-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Class formats ==

=== Partner lessons ===
Partner lessons take place when two students share a lesson. They may share an entire lesson, or their lesson times may overlap. One student may come for 20 minutes of private instruction and then be joined by another student for 20 minutes of partnered instruction. After the partner time, the second student will receive 20 minutes of private instruction. In this way, each hour lesson provides opportunity for collaboration with a peer as well as private instruction from the teacher.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Hybrid ===
Hybrid piano lessons are any other combination of private and group piano lessons. This may include biweekly, monthly, or more occasional group meetings for students that are otherwise taking individual/private lessons. These types of lessons are often used as reinforcement of secondary or functional skills such as music history and music theory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Occasional master classes, where students perform and receive feedback publicly, may also supplement individual/private instruction. This provides students with performance opportunities and a chance to observe and learn from their peers. 

== Advantages ==
Because students do not receive constant individualized attention in group lessons, they may learn to become independent learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|title=Group Lessons a Plus?|url=|journal=Keyboard Companion|volume=17 (2)|pages=3-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environment requires students to problem-solve and internalize practice techniques. Group lessons provide ample opportunities for discussion, critical listening, [[Musical analysis|structural analysis]], study of historical contexts, and collective decision-making. Collective decision-making allows students to solve the problem on their own with guidance from both the teacher and peers. This social learning can assist with developing independent learning. 

Group piano lessons also expose students to a wider range of experiences through repertoire, performance opportunities, and ensemble playing. Students not only become familiar with their own repertoire, they have the opportunity to learn and think critically of the music being learned by their peers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This format may also help alleviate performance anxiety. Students have an audience on a weekly basis, which establishes a learning environment in which playing music for others is a natural part of the learning process. Group lessons provide an environment in which ensemble skills may be developed. Students may play duets, trios, and more.

Some teachers have found that the group lesson format may increase motivation in piano students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gipson|first=Ann M.|date=2005|title=Group Lessons = Positive Results|url=|journal=American Music Teacher|volume=55 (3)|pages=18-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be motivated by their fellow peers and develop more appreciation of the music through modeling. Peer learning might also create a sense of accountability within the cohort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Terry Lynn|date=November 2012|title=Group Teaching Thoughts|url=|journal=MTNA e-Journal|volume=4 (2)|pages=14-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive peer pressure encourages students to feel like they should master their piece for the class, either to avoid embarrassment or to contribute to the group.

== Disadvantages  ==
Piano labs, multiple keyboards, headphones, and a conference system require more space and upfront cost than individual/private lessons. Group lessons also require more planning and preparation for teachers, as they teach multiple students at once and for longer time periods. Another disadvantage that may occur with group piano teaching is complications in developing and scheduling cohorts with similar experience levels and background.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].

Homeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes.  Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for.  Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

{{InfoMaps}}
'''Information mapping''' is a research-based method for writing clear and user focused information, based on the audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method is applied primarily to designing and developing business and technical communications. It is used as a content standard within organizations throughout the world.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

== Overview of the information mapping method ==
The information mapping method is a research-based methodology used to analyze, organize and present information based on an audience's needs and the purpose of the information. The method applies to all subject matter and media technology. Information mapping has close ties to [[information visualization]], [[information architecture]], [[graphic design]], [[information design]], [[data analysis]], [[experience design]], graphic [[user interface design]], and [[knowledge management]] systems.

== Components of the method ==
Information mapping provides a number of tools for analyzing, organizing and presenting information.

=== Information types ===
Some of [[Robert E. Horn]]'s best-known work was his development of the theory of information types. Horn identified six types of information that account for nearly all the content of business and technical communications. The types categorize elements according to their purpose for the audience:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"!
!Information Type
!Description
|-
|'''Procedure'''
|A set of steps an individual performs to complete a single task
|-
|'''Process'''
|A series of events, stages or phases that occurs over time and has a specific outcome
|-
|'''Principle'''
|A statement designed to dictate, guide or require behavior
|-
|'''Concept'''
|A class or group of things that share a critical set of attributes
|-
|'''Structure'''
|A description or depiction of anything that has parts or boundaries
|-
|'''Fact'''
|A statement that is assumed to be true
|}

=== Research-based principles ===
The information mapping method proposes six principles for organizing information so that it is easy to access, understand, and remember:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
{| class="wikitable"
!Principle
!Description
|-
|'''Chunking'''
|Break up information into small, manageable units
|-
|'''Relevance'''
|Limit each unit of information to a single topic
|-
|'''Labeling'''
|Label each unit of information in a way that identifies its contents
|-
|'''Consistency'''
|Be consistent in use of terminology as well as in organizing, formatting and sequencing information
|-
|'''Accessible detail'''
|Organize and structure information so those who need detail can access it easily, while those who don't can easily skip it
|-
|'''Integrated graphics'''
|Use graphics within the text to clarify, emphasize and add dimension
|}

=== Units of information ===
Documents written according to information mapping have a modular structure. They consist of clearly outlined information units (''maps'' and ''blocks'') that take into account how much information a reader is able to assimilate.

There is an essential difference between an information unit and the traditional text paragraph. A ''block'' is limited to a single topic and consists of a single type of information. Blocks are grouped into ''maps'', and each map consists only of relevant blocks. The hierarchical approach to structuring information greatly facilitates electronic control of content via [[content management system]]s and knowledge management systems.

== Advantages of information mapping ==
The information mapping method offers advantages to writers and readers, as well as to an entire organization.

=== Advantages for writers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for writers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* An easily learned systematic approach to the task of writing that once learned, enables writers to minimize down time and start writing immediately
* A subject-matter independent approach that can be applied to all business-related or technical content
* A content standard that greatly facilitates team writing and management of writing projects
* Enhanced writer productivity, with less time required for both draft development and review, and
* Easy updating and revision of content throughout its life cycle

=== Advantages for readers ===
Information mapping offers these advantages for readers:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Quick, easy access to information at the right level of detail, even for diverse audiences
* Improved comprehension
* Fewer errors and misunderstandings
* Fewer questions for supervisors, and
* Shorter training cycles, less need for re-training

=== Advantages for organizations ===
Also an entire organization can benefit from using a content standard like information mapping if the method is used with the following objectives in mind:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
* Revenue growth by reducing time to create content and accelerating time to market
* Cost reduction by capturing employee knowledge, increasing operational efficiency, reducing support calls, and decreasing translation costs
* Risk mitigation by increasing safety and compliance

== History ==
Information mapping was developed in the late 20th century by [[Robert E. Horn]], a researcher in the cognitive and behavioral sciences. Horn was interested in visual presentation of information to improve accessibility, comprehension and performance. Horn's development of the information mapping method has won him recognition from the [[International Society for Performance Improvement]] and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].{{cn|date=March 2016}}

=== Review of research ===
Many independent studies have confirmed that applying the information mapping method to business and technical communications results in quicker, easier access to information, improved comprehension and enhanced performance. It also facilitates repurposing for publication in different formats.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Doubts have been raised over the strength of the research Horn uses to justify some of his principles. For instance, his chunking principle requires lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections in a document to contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Horn, ''Developing Procedures, Policies &amp; Documentation'', Info-Map, Waltham, 1992, page 3-A-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Horn does not state where he got this principle, but an Information Mapping website stated that the principle is "based on George A. Miller's 1956 research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/themethod/Mapping_FAQs |title=Mapping FAQs |work=Infomap.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218043241/http://www.infomap.com/index.cfm/TheMethod/Mapping_FAQs |archivedate=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2017-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller did write a paper in 1956 called "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information", but its relevance to writing is tenuous.&lt;ref name="Marnell"&gt;Geofrey Marnell, ''Essays on Technical Writing'', Burdock Books, Brighton, 2016, pp. 111–155).&lt;/ref&gt; Miller himself said that his research had nothing to do with writing.&lt;ref&gt;See http://members.shaw.ca/philip.sharman/miller.txt, Viewed 14 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Insisting that lists, paragraphs, sub-sections and sections throughout  a document contain no more than 7±2 chunks of information paradoxically assumes that the size of what is not read in a document can influence a reader's ability to comprehend what they do read.&lt;ref name="Marnell"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Reservoir (Jordan University of Science and Technology).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The university reservoir as seen with the Engineering Buildings Complex in the background.]]
A total of 2,300 students were enrolled in 1986. As of the academic year 2017/2018, about 25,000 [[undergraduate]] students and 2,500 [[graduate school|graduate]] students were enrolled at the university, representing 51 nationalities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-businessreport.com/article/weve-obtained-20-projects-from-eu-funds-khresat/ |title=“We’ve obtained 20 projects from EU funds” |publisher=The Business Report  |accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the university grants over 3000 Bachelor and Master [[academic degree|Degrees]]. The university started with 110 [[teacher|faculty]] members; now it hosts 750 faculty, of which 109 are full professors. The steady enrollment of the student body is grounded on the university's vision to raise and maintain the standards of higher education in Jordan, in parallel with national educational policies.

Having its roots at [[Yarmouk University]] in Irbid, JUST emerged as an independent university on September 1, 1986. JUST detached five faculties from Yarmouk University to form its academic nucleus. These faculties were: Faculty of Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Nursing and Faculty of Engineering. Consecutively added to these faculties are Faculty of Science and Arts, Faculty of Medical Applied Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Computer and Information Technology, and Faculty of Agriculture.&lt;ref name="History of Jordan University of Science and Technology"/&gt;

==Campus==

The [[university campus]] is located in [[Ar Ramtha]], 70&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Amman]], the capital, and 20&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Irbid]], the second largest Metropolis in Jordan.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loc2"/&gt; It covers an area of approximately 11&amp;nbsp;km², constructed according to modern architectural designs suitable to the nature of its faculties. The main campus is surrounded by a green cover of 135m².&lt;ref name="just.edu.jo"/&gt; In addition to academic buildings and the [[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Library|JUST Library]], the campus includes the university farm, 12 auditoriums, a concert hall, fine arts galleries and museums, as well as comprising athletic facilities including a 7000-seat soccer stadium, a multipurpose indoor arena, a swimming pool, a [[squash (sport)|squash]] court, and a gym.

[[File:Medical Halls (Jordan University of Science and Technology).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Medical halls of JUST as seen with [[King Abdullah University Hospital|KAUH]].]]The university campus is divided into two sections, known as the '''[[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Medical Faculties Complex|Medical Faculties Complex]]''', a group of buildings in the northern part of the university, comprising the faculties of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Applied Medical Sciences, Pharmacy and Science and Arts, and the '''[[Jordan University of Science and Technology#Engineering Faculties Complex|Engineering Faculties Complex]]''', a group of buildings in the southern part of the university, compromising the faculties of Agriculture, Computer and Information Technology, Engineering, Architecture and Design and Veterinary Medicine. Students can use available buses to move from one complex to the other. Although there is a mini train on campus, it is not often used, and due to the relatively short distance between the two complexes many students prefer walking.

There are two libraries in JUST, one in the Engineering Faculties Complex and the other is in the Medical Faculties Complex. While both libraries give the students an appropriate and suitable place for reading and studying, the two-floor library at the Medical Faculties Complex is relatively larger, also contains 115,000 books, and 45,000 volumes of back issues of [[periodicals]], which makes it the main library at the university.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/library/default.aspx|title=The Library at Jordan University of Science and Technology|author=|date=|website=just.edu.jo|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the present time, a third library is being constructed in the area between the Engineering Faculties Complex and the Medical Faculties Complex which is larger in size than both existing libraries and is set to become the largest library in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;http://oldwww.just.edu.jo/library/|JUST Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the employees and guests restaurants, there are also three restaurants for students; one in each main campus, and one located near the soccer stadium.

Every department has a [[computer laboratory]] for the students to use. There are also two open labs one in each campus. Moreover, six additional labs are available for the [[graduate school|graduate]] and [[undergraduate]] computer science students and students who are taking related courses at the PH building located at the Medicine Faculties Building. The campus is covered by a secure [[wireless internet]] connection ([[WLAN]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000001061|title=Microsoft Customers|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
''Jordan University of Science and Technology'' is home to twelve faculties.&lt;ref name='academics'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/faculty/index.aspx|title=Faculties at Jordan University of Science and Technology|author=|date=|website=just.edu.jo|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium of teaching at the university; lectures, exams, and tuition, are primarily in [[English language]], with [[Arabic]] being used mainly to facilitate student understanding as the greater majority of students are of [[Arab]] background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qahwasaada.blogspot.com/2010/08/its-my-life.html|title=Qahwa Saada: It's My Life|first=Yazan|last=Mousa|date=30 August 2010|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medicine====
The JUST Faculty of Medicine, the second [[medical school]] in Jordan, was established in [[Yarmouk University]] at the northern city of Irbid in 1984; the faculty then branched out into Jordan University of Science and Technology in 1986.&lt;ref name="mededucation"&gt;"Medical education in Jordan." AHMAD FALEH TAMIMI(1) &amp; FALEH TAMIMI(2); (1)Jordan University, Jordan, (2)McGill University, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The faculty is closely associated with [[King Abdullah University Hospital]], the [[teaching hospital]] where [[postgraduate]] students undergo their residencies.&lt;ref name="med"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/facultiesanddepartments/facultyofmedicine/Pages/default.aspx|title=Faculty of Medicine|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the faculty’s main teaching hospital, KAUH provide students with the opportunity to attend lectures, tutorials, clinics, ward rounds, and surgeries. Medical students graduating from JUST are widely renowned for their achievements in the United States Medical Licensing Examination ([[USMLE]]), gaining postgraduate positions in well-known global institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Faisal Bakaeen MD on Jordan's Medical Field | Jordan Business | Issue 54 | June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Faculty of Medicine has been an active participant in medical research and has hosted numerous international events and conferences, with focus on subjects in relation to [[myocardial]] protection and research, [[pediatrics]], [[anesthesia]], and [[internal medicine]]. As of September 2011, the faculty will be hosting the [[Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists]] (FRC Path) Part 1 written exams in all Pathology specialties, which will enable Jordanian and Arab Pathologists to sit the exam outside the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/News/Lists/Activities/display.aspx?List=525a663d-304f-4420-a708-6adc93023c93&amp;ID=175&amp;RootFolder=/News/Lists/Activities&amp;Web=79c410a4-cba9-460c-a9bb-dbc13ce3ee34|title=The Royal College of Pathologists in the United Kingdom has approved JUST as a host centre for the FRCPath Part 1 written exams in all Pathology specialties|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nature of the Medical Program=====
The Faculty of Medicine awards the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] (MBBS) after completion of six years comprising three years of [[medical sciences]] and three clinical years. Students are admitted to medicine based solely on their grade point average in their high school national general exam ([[Tawjihi]]); there are neither entrance interviews nor psychometric exams. The cutoff average used for admissions into medicine is the highest among all the other disciplines offered by universities. For example, the cutoff average used over the past five years has been: 94.9 (2005), 96.3 (2006), 97 (2007), 96.8 (2008), and 97.7 (2009). Although in the minority, the faculty of medicine accepts students from [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]], Arab states of the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Malaysia]], and other countries. Tuition is significantly higher for the foreign students. Initially, the faculty at JUST accepted 50 students into the program, but that number has grown to more than 200 in recent years.&lt;ref name='dabbo'&gt;Medicine in Jordan: A Cross-Cultural Elective Experience | Samer Dabbo (1T1), Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Jordan University of Science and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first year and a half of their program, students are taught basic science in a traditional format. In an integrated
module fashion, the next year and half is devoted to studying nine [[body systems]]: [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[hematopoietic]], [[digestion|digestive]], [[endocrine]], [[musculoskeletal]], [[neuroscience]] 1 and 2, and [[reproductive]] and [[urinary]]. Towards the end of the third year students begin direct contact with patients in hospital settings. The last three years are spent in supervised inpatient and outpatient settings to develop their diagnostic and treatment competencies; the clinical years begin fully at the beginning of year 4 where students rotate through various areas of general clinical medicine. Year 5 continues this pattern focusing more on specialized areas of medicine and surgery.&lt;ref name="mededucation"/&gt; In total, students are required to complete 257 hours of classes divided among compulsory and elective courses. After completion of their 6th year, students are required to complete internship (imtiaz), which is a one-year term in general practice for which they are not compensated for.&lt;ref name='dabbo'/&gt;

Evaluations are based primarily on written exams (marks are based on two midterms and one end of term exam) and percentage grades appear on transcripts. Practical exams are solely based on an [[objective structured clinical examination]] (OSCE) type of standardized exams. In the final year, the school of medicine invites external examiners (from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], among others) to participate in student evaluations and to benefit from the experience of others.&lt;ref name='dabbo'/&gt;

=====Residency=====
Students looking to specialize can apply for residency programs after completion of imtiaz (internship). Most residency programs are four years in length, but notable exceptions include [[neurosurgery]] (6 years), [[general surgery]] (5 years), [[orthopedic surgery]] (5 years), and [[urology]] (5 years). Residency programs are divided into two broad groups: major and minor specialties. Major programs include internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, while the rest are considered minor. This division reflects the number of available seats and thus the competitiveness of each specialty.&lt;ref name='dabbo'/&gt; [http://www.just.edu.jo/faculty/welcome.aspx?fac_id=3 Faculty of Medicine]

===Research===
Since its establishment, JUST has given its utmost priority to academic research. In this vein, the '''Deanship of Research''' commenced its activities at the early stages of the university establishment during the academic year 1986/1987. Research, basic and applied, is amongst the principal priorities of the university. Training and supervision in research methodology, especially for postgraduate students, is reinforced by several research centers, such as the [[Queen Rania]] Center for Environmental Science and Technology, Consultative Center for Science and Technology, Energy Center, Pharmaceutical Research Center, [[Princess Haya Biotechnology Center]], and the Agricultural Center for Research &amp; Production.&lt;ref name="res"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just.edu.jo/Deanships/DeanshipofResearch/Pages/Highlights.aspx|title=Highlights|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research funding has steadily grown since the establishment of JUST in 1986, and an average of 200 research projects are sponsored and funded each year. As testimony to this development,  JUST was ranked as the top [[research university]] in Jordan, and amongst the top 3% universities in the [[Islamic world]], according to a study carried out by the Ankara-based Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Center for Islamic Countries (SESRTCIC).&lt;ref name="research"/&gt;

[[Nature (journal)|Nature Journal]] has reported Jordan as having the highest number of researchers in [[research and development]] per million people among all the 57 countries members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC). In Jordan there are 2,000 researchers per million people, while the average among the members of OIC is 500 researchers per million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444026a.html|title=Islam and Science: The data gap|first=Declan|last=Butler|date=2 November 2006|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=26–27|accessdate=24 November 2016|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/444026a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the number of researchers per population in Jordan, is higher than Italy, [[Israel]] and Greece and just close to the number in [[United Kingdom]] and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_res_in_ram_per_mil_peo-amp-d-per-million-people&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordaninvestment.com/BusinessandInvestment/PeopleDemographicsLabor/ResearchDevelopment/tabid/171/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126074649/http://www.jordaninvestment.com/BusinessandInvestment/PeopleDemographicsLabor/ResearchDevelopment/tabid/171/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deanship of Research at JUST is the administrative and technical body that facilitates, regulates and observes the processes concerning research. It works in a collaborative and complementary manner with other faculties and administrative bodies of the university. Any research on humans should be approved by the Institutional Research Board (IRB) and any research on animals should be approved by the university Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) before being funded.&lt;ref name="res"/&gt; [http://www.just.edu.jo/Deanships/DeanshipofResearch/Pages/welcome.aspx Deanship of Research]

The five-megawatt (MW) nuclear research reactor, which was inaugurated in December 2016,&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"&gt;http://www.tradingmarkets.com/news/press-release/erc_s-korea-consortium-wins-deal-to-build-research-reactor-for-jordan-879751.html&lt;/ref&gt; will become the focal point for a '''Nuclear Science and Technology Center (NSTC)''' in JUST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Korean_consortium_for_Jordans_first_reactor-0712097.html|title=Korean consortium for Jordan's first reactor|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/120_56698.html|title=Korea to Build Nuclear Research Reactor in Jordan|date=4 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing the primary role in educating and training the upcoming generations of [[nuclear engineering|nuclear engineers]] and scientists, and providing [[irradiation]] services in support of the Jordanian industrial, agricultural and health/medical infrastructures.&lt;ref name="tradingmarkets.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/news/jordan-unveils-nuclear-energy-strategy.html|title=Jordan unveils nuclear energy strategy|first=|last=SciDev.Net|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[nuclear research]] reactor center will include [[radioisotope production]] and training facilities, future expansion of the center will include a fuel fabrication plant, as well as radioactive waste and cold neutron facilities. The reactor, which will be upgradeable to 10MW, will facilitate the training of nuclear operators and technicians as well as advanced nuclear research in neutron sciences and the commercial production of [[radioisotopes]], it will also allow for practical experience for Jordanians in [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], reactor physics, [[radiochemistry]] and [[radiation protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=28679|title=Jordan Times|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[research reactor]] is considered by [[Jordan Atomic Energy Commission|Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC)]] officials to be an important precursor to Jordan's first [[nuclear power plant]], a 750-1,000MW Generation III reactor to be built in an area in [[Mafraq Governorate|Mafraq]] 40 kilometers northeast of [[Amman]] and 15 kilometers away from the [[Hashemite University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=32645 JAEC changes nuclear reactor site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greenenergy-jo.com/keynote%20speakers/Dr.Khaled.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2010, the university inaugurated the first Internet Reactor Laboratory in the country. The reactor laboratory links the university's nuclear engineering department with the [[U.S]] [[Pulstar (nuclear reactor)|PULSTAR]] research reactor at [[North Carolina State University]], making it the first U.S research nuclear reactor to be used for educational purposes outside the United States. The new laboratory will enable JUST nuclear engineering students to use the PULSTAR reactor and observe the reactor's behavior under certain conditions via a virtual control panel. The project was set up in cooperation with the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission, [[U.S Department of State]], and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=10448|title=Jordan inaugurates Internet Reactor Laboratory  - Culture &amp; Society - Ammon News|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almadenahnews.com/newss/news.php?c=127&amp;id=60561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrai.com/pages.php?news_id=366567|title=صحيفة الرأي :: الرئيسية|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a visit to the university in November 2010, [[King Abdullah II|King Abdullah]] unveiled a model for the 5-megawatt Jordanian research and training facility, calling for creating institutional frameworks to increase investments in research, encourage and support innovative individuals, and lauding the university for the advanced level it has achieved in various sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ammonnews.net/article.aspx?articleNO=10933|title=King opens Jordan Nuclear Research Center - Business - Ammon News|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Center of Excellence for Service Science Innovation===
International Business Machines Corp. ([[IBM]]) and the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) are set to create a '''Center of Excellence for Service Science Innovation''' at the university's campus in Irbid. The new centre will deliver teaching resources and technology expertise to students over a [[cloud computing]] infrastructure - the first system of its kind in the [[Middle East]]. IBM consultants will also support JUST with curriculum development and provide expertise in the area of [[service science, management and engineering]] (SSME).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32738.wss|title=Jordan University of Science and Technology Partners with IBM to Build New Cloud Computing Centre|date=13 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tradingmarkets.com/news/stock-alert/ibm_jordan-university-of-science-and-technology-partners-with-ibm-to-build-new-cloud-computing-centre-1235199.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution will be based on IBM's CloudBurst, which is an integrated service delivery platform that includes [[BladeCenter]] technology, storage, networking, virtualization and service management software. The workload-optimized system will provide JUST with a private cloud environment as a platform for innovation. IBM will also help to coordinate the centre and assist JUST in developing new curricula on key technology areas such as Service Oriented Architecture ([[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]]), Business Processes Management ([[Business process management|BPM]]), [[Business Analytics]], Business Processes Optimization (BPO), Service Science and Cloud Computing. IBM will use its expertise in these areas and draw on skills from its research and development laboratories to help develop educational resources and run workshops, courses, internships and certification programs. The initiative will support the university in driving skills and expertise in services science to the benefit of national schools, higher education and research establishments in Jordan and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itp.net/582101-ibm-and-just-to-create-service-science-centre|title=IBM and JUST to create Service Science Centre -  - ITP.net|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalprintmonitor.com/en/gpm-technology/cloud/35067-jordan-university-of-science-and-technology-partners-with-ibm-to-build-new-cloud-computing-centre-|title=globalprintmonitor.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''McGill University Non-Academic Certified Association (MUNACA)''' is a [[Trade union|labour union]] at [[McGill University]] representing roughly 1700 non-academic support staff.

==History==
===Formation===

MUNACA was formed in 1992 and certified as a union by the Quebec Labour Relations Commission in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;David Roseman, representing MUNACA Executive Board&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first president, Allan Youster, was a former president of the non-unionized McGill University Non-academic Staff Association (MUNASA) for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New members of McGill's board|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2810/board.htm|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First collective agreement===

MUNACA tabled its proposal for a first collective agreement in August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Daniel|title=Agreeing to Disagree|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2915/youster.html|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late summer 1996, MUNACA requested the appointment of a conciliator due to stalled negotiations and a multi-year salary freeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Eric|title=Unions United|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2903/unions.htm|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conciliation began on September 17, 1996, but the conciliator stated that an impasse had been reached on April 9, 1997 over issues of salary and job security, leading McGill to call in an arbitrator with the authority to set the terms of an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Daniel|title=Agreeing to Disagree|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2915/youster.html|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1998, MUNACA members voted to engage in pressure campaign, including sizeable protests supported by fellow unions [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU Local 800]] (property services) and [[Association of Graduate Students Employed at McGill|AGSEM]] ([[teaching assistant]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Daniel|title=Union Mounts Pressure Campaign|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3015/munaca.html|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Eric|title=Unions United|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2903/unions.htm|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, attrition reduced the size of the union by 500.  In February 1999, MUNACA members voted overwhelmingly in favor of a contract which included a retroactive 3.5% salary increase with 1% progression followed by a 1.5% increase with 1.5% progression.  The contract eliminated discretionary merit increases, placed greater (but not exclusive) weight on seniority in job selection, and included a compromise on employment security.  Non-unionized staff also received largely the same salary increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Daniel|title=Union Deal Struck|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3111/munaca.html|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second collective agreement===

Negotiations began for a second collective agreement in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mark|title=MUNACA negotiations|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/36/02/munaca/|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2003, the university added a new demand to the table: increasing work hours for MUNACA members without additional compensation.  In response, MUNACA members authorized pressure tactics, including a protest, and suspended talks until the demand was rescinded.  Concern about overwork of MUNACA members was raised by faculty and MUNASA members at the McGill Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilner|first=Josh|title=MUNACA negotiations at a standstill|url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/2.12363/munaca-negotiations-at-a-standstill-1.1634407|work=McGill Tribune|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McGill later withdrew the demand for increased working hours and the parties entered conciliation at McGill's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilner|first=Josh|title=MUNACA in conciliation with university|url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/2.12363/news-briefs-1.1634104|work=McGill Tribune|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2003, MUNACA members overwhelmingly rejected McGill's offer and authorized a strike.  They also participated in a voluntary half-day walkout and demonstration.  Partly at issue were floating holidays and summer Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mark|title=MUNACA Votes for Action|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/36/07/munaca/|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in December, MUNACA members voted to accept a contract offering 2% scale increases and 2.2-2.5% progressions, along with compensation for the loss of summer Fridays and an increase in salary minima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Mark|title=MUNACA deal|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/reporter/36/08/munaca/|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim===

As MUNACA was not affiliated with any [[List of federations of trade unions|larger union]], several attempts were made by both members and external unions to affiliate, sometimes leading to strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUNACA Raided by CUPE &amp; Local 800 (SEU)|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20031102-executive-takes-a-stand.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should MUNACA pursue the issue of affiliation with a major union organization at this time?|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20040426-executive-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUNACA IS STILL YOUR UNION!|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20070705-munaca-is-still-your-union.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, MUNACA was forced to deal with representatives sending messages judged prejudicial to the good name of the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T Council Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20050210-t-council-bulletin.pdf|work=T Council Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUNACA Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20050324-t-council-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUNACA EXPELS L-COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20070619-L-council-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2005, MUNACA raised dues by 10% to implement a [[strike fund]] in preparation for the next round of negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strike Fund Implementation|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20050406-executive-bulletin.pdf|work=Executive Bulletin|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third collective agreement===

Negotiations for a third collective agreement began on December 17, 2007.  The university originally offered annual scale increases of 2% and progression of 2.5% and reiterated requests for increased work hours and reform of summer Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiation Bulletin - Proposals|work=MUNACA Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20080215-negotiation-bulletin-feb.pdf|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, on February 7, 2008, the university tabled new demands, reducing its salary offer to scale increases of 1% and progression of 1-1.5% and requesting an end to employment security for newer employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiation Committee Bulletin|work=MUNACA Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20080215-negotiation-bulletin-feb.pdf|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After reaching an impasse, the union called a general meeting on August 28, 2008, days before the start of the school year, to vote to reject McGill's offer and authorize pressure tactics, up to and including a strike, in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice - Special Meeting of the MUNACA General Assembly|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20080820-AGM-special-meeting.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the room filled to capacity and some workers denied entry by security guards due to fire codes, a fire alarm was pulled, forcing an evacuation and preventing the strike vote from taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markowitz|first=Jennifer|title=Fire alarm prevents MUNACA strike vote|url=http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2008/09/fire_alarm_prevents_munaca_strike_vote/|work=McGill Daily|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, an agreement in principle between the negotiation teams was reached including 1-2% scale increases and 1.5% progression, status quo on summer Fridays, night and weekend premiums, and lump sum payments for members at their pay maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20080829-agreement-details.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, 62% of MUNACA members rejected this proposal at a general assembly, largely due to the disparity in wage increase compared to other jobs at McGill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klasa|first=Adrienne|title=MUNACA snubs another McGill proposal|url=http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2008/09/munaca_snubs_another_mcgill_proposal/|work=McGill Daily|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 23, 2008, MUNACA filed for conciliation after the university signaled it would not change its offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiation Update Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20081001-negotiation-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 14, 2008, the university responded by offering 2% scale increases and 1% progression for four years, a better offer for employees at their pay maximum.  MUNACA rejected this offer after meeting with its Council representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiation Update Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20081017-negotiation-update-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the university responded by offering an 8.5% increase over three years, on December 4, 2008, the general membership voted 68.4% to formally reject the university's offer and 65.1% to authorize pressure tactics up to an including a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MUNACA rejects contract offer|publisher=McGill Reporter|url=http://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2008/12/munaca-rejects-contract-offer/|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Bulletin|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20081204-results-of-special-meeting-of-general-assembly.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, MUNACA held several demonstrations and printed several full page ads in major Montreal newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negotiation Update|url=http://www.munaca.com/sites/data/bulletins/20081222-negotiation-update-bulletin.pdf|work=MUNACA Bulletin|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conciliator recommended a 9% salary increase over three years.  Perhaps partly due to fear of striking during an economic downturn, MUNACA members voted 84% to accept the offer, though the recommendation was accepted "without enthusiasm", according to then-President Maria Ruocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quail|first=Thomas|title=MUNACA and McGill reach labour agreement|url=http://www.mcgilltribune.com/2.12329/munaca-and-mcgill-reach-labour-agreement-1.1627011#.TpEmaMlmJHo|work=McGill Tribune|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Courtney|title=MUNACA compromises on settlement|url=http://www.mcgilldaily.com/2009/04/munaca_compromises_on_settlement/|work=McGill Daily|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction of University Administration - Removal of Senate Representation===

Members of MUNACA became ineligible to sit on the McGill Senate upon unionizing, due to regulations permitting staff representation to only non-unionized staff.  Because the formation of MUNACA reduced non-unionized staff from 2,719 to 781, the Senate Steering Committee considered the case.  The Steering Committee recommended against allowing union members to sit on Senate, partly for fear they would vote as a bloc, and further recommended reducing non-unionized staff representation from six members to three.  The recommendation to reduce staff representation was defeated, but MUNACA members remain ineligible to sit on Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jarosiewicz|first=Karl|title=Senate Highlights|url=http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2810/sen0131.htm|work=McGill Reporter|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Melikian-Ouzounian School''', established in 1921, was the first [[Armenia]]n School in [[Cyprus]]. It was named after two prominent families, [[Melikian]] and [[Ouzounian]]. Education was closely linked to the [[Armenian Church]] [[Notre Dame de Tyre]]. In 1963, the Melikian-Ouzounian School was taken over by the [[Turkish people|Turks]] after inter-communal fighting between the [[Greek Cypriots]] and [[Turkish Cypriots]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/21770562/The-Armenians-of-Cyprus&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[psychology]] of [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] [[consciousness]] was elaborated by [[Antoine de la Garanderie]] from the analysis of [[mental habit]]s of numerous subjects.

== History ==

The '''Mental Management''' theory was elaborated from numerous [[pedagogical dialogue]]s since the 1970s.

It is linked to several previous theories, including the works on [[introspection]] by [[Jean Martin Charcot]], [[Alfred Binet]], [[Marie François Pierre Gontier de Biran|Maine de Biran]], the German school of [[History of psychology#Würzburg School|Würzburg]] ([[Henry Jackson Watt|Watt]], {{ill|August Messer|lt=Messer|de}}, [[Karl Bühler|Bühler]]) and [[Albert Burloud]], who was [[Antoine de la Garanderie]]'s professor.

== Theory ==

The fundamental concepts of '''Mental Management''' are [[evocation]] and [[mental project]].

Although it doesn't have a [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] goal, '''Mental Management''' is based on several concepts of characterization of evocation :
* the ''nature'' (or ''language'') of the evocation : visual, auditive, verbal, etc.
* the ''parameters'' used : concrete (P1), codes (P2), logical links (P3) or new links (P4)
* the ''coding'' : first or third person
* the ''place of meaning'' : spatial

a great application is the game of capsule, likely played in the 6th floor of the X building{{explain|date=April 2016}}

Aside this Mental management is used to organize therapeutical wealth in business organisation,

and also to have a clear Mind for working and to strengthen working methods for the social problems at work.

The '''National Association of School Psychologists''' ('''NASP''') is the major national [[Professional association|professional organization]] for  [[School psychology|school psychologists]] in the [[United States]]. Its [[Mission statement|stated mission]] is to "represent and support school psychology through leadership to enhance the [[mental health]] and educational competence of all children." The vision of NASP is that all children and youth access the learning, behavior, and mental health support needed to thrive in school, at home, and throughout life. The four main purpose of this organization is "a) to actively promote the interests of school psychology; b) to advance the standards of the profession; c) to help secure the conditions necessary to the greatest effectiveness of its practice; and d) to serve the mental health and educational interest of all children and youth" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the National Association of School Psychologists: The First Decade |url=http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-8/volume-8-issue-2/history-of-the-national-association-of-school-psychologists-the-first-decade |website=National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) |accessdate=1 December 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

NASP provides standards for ethics and practice, and approves graduate training programs that sufficiently adhere to its training guidelines. NASP is a constituent member of the [[National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education]] (NCATE) and although NCATE accredits units (such as [[School of education|colleges of education]]), not programs, it does provide "national recognition" status to NASP-approved programs located in units accredited by NCATE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasponline.org/certification/NASPapproved.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305032505/http://www.nasponline.org/certification/NASPapproved.html |archivedate=2006-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization also offers an opportunity for those who have successfully completed their graduate coursework, participated in a 1200-hour internship with at least 600 hours in a school setting, and received a score of at least 660 on the School Psychologist Praxis II Examination to apply for [[National Certification in School Psychology]].

While the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) serves similar purposes through Division 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~div16/|title=Indiana University Bloomington|website=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt; one way that NASP differs fundamentally from the APA is in that it officially recognizes the [[specialist degree]] as the entry-level degree for the field, as opposed to the [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]]. The two organizations, however, are more complementary than competing. Many view NASP as the governing body for sub-doctoral school psychologists and the APA as the governing body for doctoral-level school psychologists, although there are many doctoral-level school psychologists who belong to NASP. Further, NASP approval of graduate programs does not compete with APA accreditation; the APA does not accredit non-doctoral programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/accreditation/schoolpsy.html|title=APA-Accredited Programs|website=apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NASP will more quickly approve programs that have already been APA-accredited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasponline.org/certification/APA_programs.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Association of School Psychologists distributes two journals: ''School Psychology Review'', which is the second-largest psychology academic journal and includes research and theory related to school psychology, and  ''School Psychology Forum: Research in Practice'', an electronic publication. NASP also publishes ''Communiqué'', which is the official newspaper of NASP, covering news, events, innovative practices, legislative developments, and other topics relevant to the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5885">From 2004, the '''New Zealand Scholarship''' is a [[New Zealand]] secondary school award gained at the end of Year 13, and provides financial support for study at a New Zealand university. &lt;!-- It replaces the scholarships from the University Entrance, Bursaries and Scholarships Examinations ("UEBS") which were awarded for the last time in 2003. --&gt;It is intended for the top students of [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] Level 3, the main secondary school leaving qualification.

==About==
The first scholarship examination by the University of New Zealand was held in May 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beaglehole | first = J. C. | authorlink = John Cawte Beaglehole | title = The University of New Zealand: A historical study | year = 1937 | publisher = New Zealand Council for Educational Research | id = {{LCC|LG735.B365}} | pages = 85 | chapter =  | quote = … there were already thirty-five entries for the first scholarship examination in May 1872…}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="par70"&gt;{{cite book | last = Parton | first = Hugh | title = The University of New Zealand | year = 1979 | publisher = University Grants Committee, New Zealand | isbn = 0-19-647973-8 | pages = 98 | quote = The first scholarship examination was held in May 1872…}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1962, scholarships were awarded by the Universities Entrance Board. The [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] took over the work of the Universities Entrance Board in 1991.

From 1989 to 2003 scholarships were awarded to the top 3-4% of [[New Zealand University Bursary|Bursary]] students. In response to the removal of separate scholarship examinations a group of teachers set up their own scholarship exam, later becoming the [[New Zealand Educational Scholarships Trust]] (NZEST).[https://web.archive.org/web/20051228142034/http://nzest.ac.nz/about.html]

A "NCEA Level 4" qualification was proposed in the 1998 Cabinet paper "Qualifications for Young People Aged 16 to 19 Years" and the discussions that ensued concluded that there be an external examination and that scholarships be awarded. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060630090835/http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/scholarship/background.html] New Zealand Scholarship exams started in 2004. NZEST stopped its examinations and now provides financial assistance for students studying at NZ universities.

The 2004 examinations, in line with the NCEA, were criterion-referenced and produced some unexpected results distributions. Several reviews of the award and a media and political debate followed. The Scholarship examination was largely revamped. Scholarships in 2005 were awarded to the top three per cent of NCEA Level 3 candidates in the subject, given that examiners are satisfied a worthy standard has been met. Monetary awards were restructured and credit value was removed from the examinations.

==Assessment==
The Scholarship is awarded by standards-based three-hour external examinations, which are mostly written exams. The grades are ''No Award'', ''Scholarship'' and ''Outstanding Scholarship''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224033/http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/scholarship/results-subject.html Example of result table at NZQA]

The 2004 examination of the New Zealand Scholarship by the [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority]] was marred by controversy, most notably the irregular pass rates (e.g. 0.9% pass rate for Biology 2004). The head of the Authority later resigned over this and allied issues.

==Monetary Awards==
{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}

:''All monetary values are in the [[New Zealand dollar]].
The monetary awards are tenable at any New Zealand [[university]], and all except single subject awards last for three years as long as a 'B' average is maintained.  Candidates must gain at least three scholarships to be eligible for the Scholarship, Outstanding and Premier awards. All candidates are eligible for only one of the following monetary awards, except that up to two single subject awards can be awarded to a candidate, and a winner of a Top Subject Scholar Award who also passes a second scholarship subject is eligible for the additional $500 award. 

*The ''Premier Award'' is awarded to the top five to ten candidates who gain three or more scholarship subjects with at least three at outstanding level, and is worth $10,000 per year for three years.
*An ''Outstanding Scholar Award'' is awarded to the top 40 to 60 candidates (usually around the top 0.3% of the number of Level 3 students sitting the subject, but more for the less common subjects) who gain three scholarship subjects with two at outstanding level or gain more than three scholarship subjects with at least one at outstanding level, and is worth $5,000 per year for three years.
*A ''Scholarship Award'' is awarded to all candidates who gain three or more scholarship subjects, and is worth $2,000 per year for three years.
*A ''Top Subject Scholar Award''' is awarded to candidates who are top of a subject, and did not receive one of the above prizes. It is worth $2,000 per year for three years.
*A single subject award is awarded to candidates who gain one or two scholarship subjects and did not top the subject(s). It is worth $500 per subject for one year only.

'''Pass.ng''' is a self-testing online platform in Nigeria which allows users to practice for national exams through interactive modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: SAMSON ABIOYE, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, PASS.NG|url=http://innovation-village.com/qa-samson-abioye-ceo-and-co-founder-pass-ng/|publisher=innovation-village.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Startups|url=http://440.ng/startups/|website=440|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evolution of a Startup Helping Students Hack Standardized Tests: Samson Abioye on Pass.ng {{!}} TechCabal|url=http://techcabal.com/2015/07/15/the-evolution-of-a-startup-helping-students-hack-standardized-tests-samson-abioye-on-pass-ng/|publisher=techcabal.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2012 as Jamb-cbt.com, It won the airtel's ''Catapult-a-Startup'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TELECOMAirtel Empowers Seven Startups|url=http://nigeriacommunicationsweek.com.ng/airtel-empowers-seven-startups/|website=nigeriacommunicationsweek|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''AAI pitch-fest competition''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAI PitchFest Video testimonial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcGl1i3tQ2I|website=youtube|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''West Africa Mobile Awards (WAMAS)'' in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pass.ng, Genii Games, Jason Njoku among WAMAS winners|url=http://disrupt-africa.com/2016/04/pass-ng-genii-games-jason-njoku-among-wamas-winners/|publisher=disrupt-africa.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also got an endorsement from [[Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board]] in 2015.

==Background==
In an interview with Outliers Magazine, [[Samson Abioye]] said he got the idea for pass.ng after learning that over 70% of those who sit for national exams fail in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outliers Magazine interview with the founders of Pass.ng|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saJ2bjDHvRk|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thereafter pitched the idea to his fellow undergraduates during their Industrial Training program with the ICT Unit of [[Ladoke Akintola University]]. He was joined by Abayomi Akanji, Imole Oluyemi and Joshua Adebagbo and they registered the new startup as Pass.ng. Abayomi went on to become the Head of mobile development and, Imole was the Product Design Lead, Joshua the Chief technology officer and Abioye Samson the [[Chief executive officer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=440.NG Investor Day 2014 - Pass Pitch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTZ6nuBcrRA|website=youtube|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
Pass.ng functions on a [[freemium]] pricing model. A limited amount of preparatory questions can be attempted for free, after which further usage requires loading a recharge card of the intended subscription price. During the initial stage, users had to go to the bank to pay the amount of their intended subscription (which most times is  very little). The process was said to be tedious, time wasting and reportedly drove a lot of intending paying subscribers away. A model of sending the recharge card of the intended subscription was also developed but also wasn't helpful either as the founders got loads of recharges without knowing what to do with them. They have since decided to work with some of Nigerians telecom agent on a model of allowing the user to recharge on their lines the amount they wish to subscribe which will be deducted by the telcoms themselves and a percentage paid to pass.&lt;ref name="aa" /&gt;

==Awards and recognition==

* Pass.ng has been endorsed by the exam conducting body - [[Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board]] in 2015.
* Pass.ng won the [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]] Catapult-a-Startup entrepreneurship development program. This included a cash prize of 1 million [[Nigerian naira|naira]] and promotion opportunity from Airtel. 
* Pass.ng is listed as a service on Airtel's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pass.ng|url=http://www.africa.airtel.com/wps/wcm/connect/africarevamp/Nigeria/Home/personal/Internet/Services/pass#|website=africa.airtel|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Pass.ng won the 2015 edition of the AAI pitch-fest competition.
* Pass.ng was among the 2016 winners of the West Africa Mobile Awards (WAMAS).

'''Preservation administrators''' are librarians who are trained in the management of [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] in libraries and archives. The term is often used as a parallel term to [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]], an allied profession that is focused primarily on the corrective repair of artefacts. The term "preservationist" has fairly wide usage as a synonym for "preservation administrator" or a broader term for anyone active in the fields of conservation or preservation, but has never found professional favor.

'''Pseudo-scholarship''' (from [[pseudo-]] + [[Scholarly method|scholarship]]) is a work (e.g., publication, lecture) or body of work that is presented as, but is not, the product of rigorous and objective study or research; the act of producing such work; or the pretended learning upon which it is based.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome V.

===Publications, awards and honours===
Scientists at the IMP publish 60 to 90 papers in international peer-review journals per year: between 1985 and 2017, more than 2,000 research papers were published. 93 patents were filed based on discoveries made at the institute since 1985. IMP faculty was awarded 16 [[European Research Council|ERC Grants]] since the establishment of this grant scheme in 2007. Four IMP faculty members received [[Wittgenstein-Preis|Wittgenstein Awards]] since 1996. About one third of the faculty are elected members of [[European Molecular Biology Organization|EMBO]].&lt;ref name="IMPHistory" /&gt; In 2017, [[Kim Nasmyth]] received the [[Breakthrough Prize]] in life sciences for work on [[cohesin]] that he had done at the IMP. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imp.ac.at/news/detail/article/breakthrough-prize-awarded-to-kim-nasmyth/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
IMP maintains a suite of in-house facilities, maintained in cooperation with IMBA, that provide support and scientific services to the scientists at IMP.&lt;ref name="CoresIMP"&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome to Core Facilities | website=IMP | url=http://cores.imp.ac.at/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the four research institutes of the Vienna Biocenter maintain a number of shared services jointly called "VBC Core Facilities" (VBCF). The services offered are available to all VBC scientists including IMP staff.&lt;ref name="VBCF 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=VBCF | website=VBCF | date=2018-02-01 | url=http://www.vbcf.ac.at/home/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The establishment of the IMP was a joint venture by [[Boehringer Ingelheim]] and [[Genentech]] and initiated in 1985. Under the directorship of [[Max Birnstiel]], the first institute building was opened in 1988.

In 1992, three institutes of the faculties of science and medicine of the [[University of Vienna]] moved into a nearby building, today's [[Max F. Perutz Laboratories]] (MFPL). This created the basis for referring to the area as the "Vienna Biocenter" (VBC).

In 1993, Boehringer Ingelheim took over the IMP shares of Genentech. Following Max Birnstiel's retirement in 1997, [[Kim Nasmyth]] became scientific director. 

In 2006, two institutes of the Austrian Academy of Sciences were opened in the vicinity of the IMP: the [[Institute of Molecular Biotechnology]] (IMBA) and the [[Gregor Mendel Institute]] (GMI). The three institutes cooperate closely by maintaining shared facilities. In the same year, [[Barry Dickson]] became the IMP's scientific director.

Since 2013, [[Jan-Michael Peters]] is scientific director of the IMP. In late 2016, the IMP moved into its new building, which was formally opened on 1 March 2017.&lt;ref name="IMPHistory"&gt;{{cite web | title=History | website=The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology | url=https://www.imp.ac.at/about/history/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PhD program==
The "VBC PhD Programme" is an international PhD training program carried out jointly by the four Vienna Biocenter research institutes (IMP, IMBA, GMI and MFPL). Acceptance into the program is competitive and based on a formal selection procedure. There are two selections each year, deadlines are April 30 and November 15. Participation in the program is a condition for doing a PhD at the IMP.&lt;ref name="VBCPhDProgramme"&gt;{{cite web | title=Home | website=Vienna Biocenter PhD Programme | url=http://www.vbcphdprogramme.at/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:IMP-outside.jpg|thumb|Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), outside view.]]
The current IMP building at Campus-Vienna-Biocenter 1 was opened in 2017. It comprises 15,000 square meters of gross floor space and 8,000 square meters of net area, spread over eight levels. 

The building contains 3,000 square meters for laboratories and 2,000 square meters for offices; its lecture hall seats up to 280 people. The buildings has six seminar rooms and technical facilities. Some facilities such as cafeteria, but also scientific services, are open to staff from other Vienna Biocenter entities and the IMP building is connected to the neighboring Institute of Molecular Biotechnology building through a bridge. 

[[File:Spit-levels.jpg|thumb|Split-level architecture blending different floors and functions of the new IMP building.]]

Several features of the building refer to biological research: the facade features stripes should resemble [[DNA]] bands as seen in [[gel electrophoresis]]; the central elevator's glass covers are coated with [[Dichroic filter|dichroic foils]] which are also used in filters for light microscopy. The project costs of 52 million Euros were born by the IMP's main sponsor Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;ref name="LISAvienna 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=IMP: New IMP Building: International Research Center Opens in Vienna | website=LISAvienna | date=2017-03-01 | url=http://lisavienna.at/en/news/imp-new-imp-building-international-research-center-opens-vienna | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Advisory Board==
In order to maintain a high standard of research, the IMP employs a process of continuous review and feedback. The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), consisting of distinguished scientists, meets once a year and discusses the quality, significance, and main focus of research conducted at the IMP. The SAB is chaired by [[Leslie Vosshall]] of [[Rockefeller University]]. Its other members are [[Angelika Amon]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]); [[Hans Clevers]] ([[Hubrecht Institute]]); [[Michael Hausser]] ([[University College London]]); Norbert Kraut (Boehringer Ingelheim); [[Dan Littman]] ([[New York University]] Langone Medical Center); [[Ruslan Medzhitov]] ([[Yale School of Medicine]]/[[Howard Hughes Medical Institute|HHMI]]); [[Tom Rapoport]] ([[Harvard Medical School]]); [[Dirk Sch&amp;uuml;beler]] ([[Friedrich Miescher Institute]]).&lt;ref name="IMPBoard"&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Advisory Board | website=The Research Institute of Molecular Pathology | url=https://www.imp.ac.at/about/advisory-board/ | access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The operating budget of the IMP is provided largely by Boehringer Ingelheim. Support comes from grants awarded to individual scientists and projects by national and international funding agencies such as the [[Austrian Science Fund]] (FWF), Austrian Industrial Research Promotion Fund (FFG), the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF), Zentrum für Innovation und Technologie (ZIT), the City of Vienna, the Austrian federal government, the Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP), and the European Union (EU).

The '''Safe Schools Coalition Australia''' ('''SSCA''') is a national network of organisations working with school communities to create safer and more inclusive environments for [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], intersex and gender diverse students, staff and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/who-we-are  |title=The Safe Schools Coalition Australia |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to November 2017, SSCA functioned as a group of organisations in Australia focused on [[LGBTIQ]] people in schools. Its mission is to create [[Gay-friendly|safe and inclusive]] schools for students, families and staff who are in these groups.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/who-we-are |title=Who are we |last1=Safe Schools Coalition Australia |publisher=Safe Schools Coalition Australia |accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary activity of the SSCA is the Safe Schools Program that was developed to give support to teachers and schools who had been seeking assistance in the creation of a more inclusive environment for LGBTIQ students and their families.&lt;ref name="fafa"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fya.org.au/2016/02/12/fast-facts-about-safe-schools-coalition-australia/ |title=Fast Facts About Safe Schools Coalition Australia |author=Maggie Hill |publisher=The Foundation for Young Australians |accessdate=12 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program began in Victorian schools in 2010 and expanded nationwide in 2013. The Program was the first of its kind in Australia. Schools are encouraged to customise the implementation of resources which are provided.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fafa"/&gt; The SSCA is managed by [[The Foundation for Young Australians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/early-warning-over-roz-ward-attack/news-story/00c31eb3691619dcb6c8f6660e2c55c3 |title=Early warning over Roz Ward attack |author=Urban, Rebecca|date=29 August 2016|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by various state governments. In October 2016 the federal government said that it would not renew its funding for the program.&lt;ref name = "SSC contact"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CraigComrie"/&gt; In December 2016, the [[Department of Education and Training (Victoria)|Education Department]] took control of the program in Victoria.&lt;ref name= "SSCV"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "DESPOGI"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SSCV2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/no-backing-down-on-safe-schools-education-minister-james-merlino-tells-parents-20170211-guar7z.html |title=No backing down on Safe Schools, Education Minister James Merlino tells parents |author=Tomazin, Farrah|date=11 February 2017|work=[[The Age]]|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSCA initially received bipartisan support from government. There is opposition to the program relating to [[sexuality]] and [[gender]] concepts being taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/safe-schools-rainbow-ideology-fuels-sex-switches/news-story/54bf9f6eac7010b01818f0c5ea9cc28f |title=Safe Schools: ‘rainbow ideology’ fuels sex switches |author=Balogh, Stefanie |date=2 September 2016 |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response an independent review was conducted in 2016. While some changes have been made since the review's findings were published, it recommended no major changes to the program and found that it was consistent with the [[Australian Curriculum|national curriculum]].&lt;ref name=sbs/&gt; The report recommended an increase in the availability of guidance on the use of included materials. Other changes recommended and subsequently implemented include making the program only available to high schools, removing role playing activities and the requirement for [[parental consent]] before participation.&lt;ref name=sbs/&gt;

In 2017 the SSCA program ceased in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory pulled out (and with Tasmania to pull out) of the Safe Schools Coalition Australia program, with each developing their own programs. As of July 2017, 54 schools in WA, Tas and NT were nominated as SSCA members.&lt;ref name ="July 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/safe-schools/ |title=Join Us: Is your school a member |work=Safe Schools Coalition Australia|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The members of the Safe Schools Coalition Australia are The Foundation for Young Australians based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Family Planning [[New South Wales|NSW]], the [[Western Australian]] AIDS Council, the Sexual Health and Family Planning [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], Shine SA - Sexual Health Information Networking &amp; Education in [[South Australia]], True Relationships &amp; Reproductive Health, [[Queensland]] and Working it out in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

Schools are encouraged to join the coalition as members. The coalition began with 11 founding schools, including [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]], [[Bellarine Secondary College]], [[MacRobertson Girls’ High School|MacRobertson Girls' High School]], Hallam Secondary and [[Princes Hill Secondary College]].&lt;ref name="imad"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/3755992/safe-schools-program-is-making-a-difference/ |title=Safe Schools program is making a difference |author=Farrah Tomazin |accessdate=11 September 2016 |date=27 February 2016 |newspaper=The Border Mail |publisher=Fairfax Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St Joseph's College, Melbourne|St Joseph's College]] in Melbourne is a Catholic school taking part in the program.&lt;ref name="pwa"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.educatoronline.com.au/news/principal-warns-against-academic-impact-of-bullying-212561.aspx |title=Principal warns against academic impact of bullying |author=Brett Henebery |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=4 March 2016 |work=The Educator |publisher=Key Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpp"/&gt;

In November 2016 the [[Salvation Army]] said it supports the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/News-and-Media/news-and-media1/Salvation-Army-Supports-Safe-Schools-Initiative/ |title=Salvation Army Supports Safe Schools Initiative |author=Webb, Geoff|date=|work=[[Salvation Army]]|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November that endorsement was withdrawn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/education/salvation-army-in-retreat-on-safe-schools-program/news-story/12b1825e3d842abe5e960a58d304aa9e |title=Salvation Army in retreat on Safe Schools program |author=Urban, Rebecca|date=5 December 2016|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/salvation-army-responds-backflip-safe-schools-support/154320 |title=Salvation Army backflips on Safe Schools support|author=Power, Shannon|date=5 December 2016|work=[[Star Observer]]|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Salvation Army saying that it, "cannot unconditionally support the Safe Schools programs in Australia in their current form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/News-and-Media/news-and-media1/2016/The-Safe-Schools-Initiative/ |title=Salvation Army Announces National Position On Safe Schools |date=30 November 2016|work=[[Salvation Army]]|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 [[Bega Valley Shire Council]] voted to support the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.begadistrictnews.com.au/story/4358187/safe-schools-program-gets-bega-valley-council-support/ |title=Safe Schools Program gets Bega Valley council support |author=Dion, Denise|date=15 December 2016|work=Bega District News|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in January 2017 the council rescinded that support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.begadistrictnews.com.au/story/4411824/safe-schools-back-flip-by-bega-council/ |title=Safe School support rescinded in heated Bega council meeting|author=McKnight, Albert|date=18 January 2017|work=Bega District News|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In describing the aims of the program, the Safe Schools Coalition Australia reports that "75% of same sex attracted young people experience some form of homophobic abuse or bullying... A staggering 80% of young people experienced abuse and bullying while at school",&lt;ref name="allofus" /&gt; more than anywhere else.&lt;ref name="wti2010"/&gt; The ''All Of Us'' resource&lt;ref name="allofus" /&gt; cites research on same sex attracted and gender diverse youth documented in the report, ''Writing Themselves in 3'', prepared by the [[La Trobe University]]'s, ''Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society''.&lt;ref name="wti2010"&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 978-1-921377-92-1| last1 = Hillier| first1 = Lynne| last2 = Jones| first2 = Tiffany| last3 = Monagle| first3 = Marisa| last4 = Overton| first4 = Naomi| last5 = Gahan| first5 = Luke| last6 = Blackman| first6 = Jennifer| last7 = Mitchell| first7 = Anne| title = Writing Themselves in 3: The third national study on the sexual health and wellbeing of same sex attracted and gender questioning young people| location = Melbourne| date = 2010| publisher = Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society, [[La Trobe University]] |url = http://glhv.org.au/files/wti3_web_sml.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[Intersex rights in Australia|intersex]] Australians published in 2016 shows that, while 2% of Australians fail to complete secondary school, 18% of Australians born with intersex variations fail to do so due to issues around bullying, discrimination and pubertal medical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808| issn = 1468-1811| pages = 1–17| last = Jones| first = Tiffany| title = The needs of students with intersex variations| journal = Sex Education| accessdate = 2016-03-18| date = March 11, 2016| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14681811.2016.1149808}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carpenter"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Carpenter| first = Morgan| author-link1 = Morgan Carpenter | title = We support the Safe Schools Coalition Australia| accessdate = 15 February 2016| date = 11 February 2016 | url = https://oii.org.au/30360/support-ssca/ | publisher = [[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on student performance comparing those within to those without the program indicated gender diverse and same-sex-attracted young people did better with Safe Schools.&lt;ref name="prre"/&gt;

The first community-based LGBTIQ youth groups in the fields of [[social services]] were established in the United States in the late 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s a [[Abstinence-only sex education|sexual risk]] discourse dominated LGBTIQ issues in education policy in Victoria.&lt;ref name="poan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Policy and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Students Volume 6 of Policy Implications of Research in Education |last=Jones |first=Tiffany |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3319119915 |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=00EBBQAAQBAJ |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing school bullying with practical steps is a worldwide trend.

==Reception==
The program has been supported by the majority of state governments, as well as psychologists, gay-support groups and other non-governmental and religious organisations.&lt;ref name="cogf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="qgs"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/national-news/queensland-government-stands-by-safe-schools-coalition-australia/139201 |title=Queensland Government stands by Safe Schools Coalition Australia |author=David Alexander |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=30 July 2016 |newspaper=Star Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is supported by [[beyondblue]], [[headspace (organisation)|headspace]] and the Australian Secondary Principals Association.&lt;ref name="chbi"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-26/safe-schools-chest-binding-photo-removed-from-christian-website/7202772 |title=Safe Schools: Chest binding photo removed from Christian website after complaints by young transgender man shown |author=Simon Leo Brown |accessdate=19 September 2016 |date=26 February 2016 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates for the program point to high levels of homophobic abuse, including in school settings, and high levels of school leaving.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shaw| first = Rebecca| title = There is no such thing as a 'gay manual', but I wish I'd had this when I was a child| work = [[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 11 February 2016| date = 11 February 2016| url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/11/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-gay-manual-but-i-wish-id-had-this-when-i-was-a-child}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian LGBTIQ rights activist and academic [[Rodney Croome]] welcomed a review as a way of ensuring its funding delivered the outcomes it sought.&lt;ref name="whha"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2016/03/26/what-happened-the-safe-schools-program/14589108003049 |title=What happened to the Safe Schools program |author=Karen Middleton |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=26 March 2016 |work=The Saturday Paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSW Labor politician [[Penny Sharpe]] has said that opposition is primarily due to "[[homophobia]]" and "[[transphobia]]".&lt;ref name="partridge"/&gt; A petition presented by [[Australian Greens]] Senator [[Robert Simms (politician)|Robert Simms]] to Parliament in March 2016 contained 70,000 signatures in support of the organisation.&lt;ref name="70,000"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/03/03/70-000-signatures-collected-in-support-of-safe-schools-coalition/ |title=70,000 Signatures Collected In Support Of Safe Schools Coalition |author=Josh Butler |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=4 March 2016 |work=The Huffington Post Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the program is opposed by some religious groups, particularly the [[Christian right]], with the program said to be "gagged" on [[same-sex marriage]] while the Safe Schools Coalition said there had been "no change to media protocols".&lt;ref name="cook" /&gt; The [[Australian Christian Lobby]] and the Former National Party senator [[Bill O'Chee]] have criticised the program.&lt;ref name="crs"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/school-life/christian-lobby-groups-claim-radical-sexual-experimentation-is-being-promoted-in-schools/news-story/39c64a960b2d112875848c4f337de433 |title=Christian lobby groups claim ‘radical sexual experimentation’ is being promoted in schools |author= |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=25 July 2015 |work=news.com.au |publisher=News Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Labor senator [[Joe Bullock]] has also criticised Safe Schools.&lt;ref name="ssil"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/25/safe-schools-is-like-child-grooming-says-nationals-mp-george-christensen |title=Safe Schools is like child grooming, says Nationals MP George Christensen |author=Australian Associated Press |accessdate=12 September 2016 |date=25 February 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Democrats Senator [[Brian Greig]] stated that the criticism from religious conservatives echoed the 1997 conservative response to "Here for Life", the anti-suicide program introduced by the [[Keating Government]]'s [[Carmen Lawrence]] for gay and lesbian teenagers.&lt;ref name="grieg"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grieg|first1=Brian|title=History repeats: 20 years of political homophobia from the religious right|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/30/history-repeats-20-years-of-political-homophobia-from-the-religious-right|accessdate=21 December 2016|work=The Guardian|date=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conservatives described it as “promoting homosexuality” and “recruiting children”, the newly elected [[Howard Government]] cancelled the Here for Life program.&lt;ref name="grieg" /&gt;

On 14 February 2016 the education minister, [[Simon Birmingham]], described the lessons prepared by the coalition as having "reasonable objectives".

==Louden Review==
A review was announced by the [[Turnbull Government|Turnbull Liberal/National Coalition Government]] on 26 February 2016, after Coalition backbenchers [[George Christensen (politician)|George Christensen]] and [[Cory Bernardi]] raised concerns over what they claimed was the "[[sexualised]]" nature of the program, and forty-three Coalition backbenchers including former leader [[Tony Abbott]] had signed a petition calling for the program's closure.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/safe-schools-malcolm-turnbull-forced-to-act-on-funding-for-controversial-sexed-program/news-story/51dfbc4b15e86483632f6f6909bdac15 Safe Schools - Malcolm Turnbull forced to act on funding for controversial sex-ed program: Daily Telegraph 18 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indaily.com.au/news/2016/03/18/limits-imposed-on-safe-schools-program/ Limits imposed on Safe Schools program: InDaily 18 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The review did not consider the contents of the Minus 18&lt;ref name = "Minus18"/&gt; website, or the contents of the network partners’ websites. The review was conducted by [[University of Western Australia]]’s Professor Bill Louden.&lt;ref name="wbf17"/&gt; The process included interviews with a range of individuals and groups associated with the program.&lt;ref name="wbf17"/&gt;

On 11 March 2016 the ''Review of Appropriateness and Efficacy of the Safe Schools Coalition Australia Program Resources'' was published.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.education.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/review_of_appropriateness_and_efficacy_of_the_ssca_program_resources_0.pdf|title=Review of Appropriateness and Efficacy of the Safe Schools Coalition Australia Program Resources|last=Louden|first=William|date=11 March 2016|website=Australian Government Department of Education and Training|publisher=Department of Education and Training Australia|access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Findings===
The review revealed that opponents to the program had made statements that grossly misrepresented and exaggerated the nature of the program. Coalition MPs who support Safe School such as [[Warren Entsch]] said the concerns were being pushed by external lobby groups. Labor leader [[Bill Shorten]] labelled the Christensen group "[[ideologues]] ... trying to impose a 1950s view of the world".&lt;ref name=sbs&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/03/18/limits-imposed-safe-schools-program Safe Schools program downsized after campaign by right-wing MPs and Christian lobby groups: SBS 18 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="concerns"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9news.com.au/national/2016/03/17/03/33/most-mps-back-safe-schools-cut-christensen Abbott told of Safe Schools concerns: Nine News 17 March 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The review did not find that any of the official resources were inappropriate. It found that the content in guideline documents was consistent with the aims of the program and that the language and content was suitable.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; All lesson plans were found to be consistent with the aims of the program as were all the posters. No harm was expected to come from primary schools students viewing the material, just that they may not comprehend some terms such as transphobia or homophobia.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; The level of interaction between schools and parents was found to be appropriate.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
In May 2016, [[Queenslander of the Year]] and transgender woman [[Cate McGregor]], who "had been asked to be an Ambassador for the program and had initially agreed",&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph20160910&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/rendezview/i-am-transgender-and-i-oppose-safe-schools/news-story/7e194d1cc3037b6966b9fdab59871bf9|title=I am transgender.

McGregor said she objects to the program as she believes it is underpinned by a [[political ideology]] with which she does not agree, saying that the program "teaches a derivative of [[queer theory]], which I believe leads trans people into a blind alley".&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph20160910/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.outinperth.com/catherine-mcgregor-speaks-safe-schools/ |title=Catherine McGregor speaks out against Safe Schools |date=19 May 2016|work=Out In Perth|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGregor was subsequently stood down as the patron of [[Kaleidoscope Australia Human Rights Foundation|Kaleidoscope Australia]] for her opposition to the Safe Schools program.

===Queensland===
The program began in Queensland from the start of the second semester in 2015. [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]] pledged support for Safe Schools during the [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015 Queensland state election]] but as of March 2016 had not made any announcements.&lt;ref name="sgao"/&gt;

In September 2016, Queensland students were told not to participate in any class lessons involving Safe Schools Coalition materials without the consent of their parents.&lt;ref name = "parent view"/&gt;

In June 2017, the Queensland Government announced that it will not fund the program when the federal Government ceases funding the Safe Schools Program in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-23/queensland-safe-schools-funding-will-not-continue-post-october/8642966 |title=Safe Schools: Queensland Government will not fund teacher training after October |author=Wiggins, Nick|date=23 June 2017|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland has withdrawn from the Safe Schools Coalition Program.&lt;ref name ="July 2017"/&gt;  The [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National Party]] has said, in September 2017, if they are elected to form government they will, "dump the Safe Schools program".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/an-elected-lnp-government-would-dump-safe-schools-in-queensland-20170913-p4yvw8 |title=An elected LNP government would dump Safe Schools in Queensland |date=13 September 2017|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 there was what was described as "aggressive altercations" to prevent people entering a Brisbane church where a Safe Schools seminar was being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.outinperth.com/confrontational-protests-safe-schools-brisbane-church/  |title=Confrontational protests over Safe Schools at Brisbane Church |date=8 September 2017|work=[[OutInPerth]]|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A police statement and camera footage do not support the protesters version of what took place, saying, "there was no record of any cars hurtling towards protesters, nor any other assault or injury".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/the-ugly-samesex-clash-at-brisbane-church-that-proved-quite-tame/news-story/0a5db9f89a7f0abddea0dd8d8cffabc6  |title= The ‘ugly’ same-sex clash that wasn’t|author=Schliebs, Mark|date=9 September 2017|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 Liberal politician [[Elizabeth Kikkert]] speaking in the [[ACT Legislative Assembly]] said that "13-year-old girls [were asked] to fantasise about sexual intercourse". Opposition education spokesman [[Andrew Wall]] tabled a petition and asked the ACT government to withdraw support for the program.

[[File:Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschu.jpg|thumb|right|{{lang|gd|Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschu}}, or [[Glasgow Gaelic School]], is the largest provider of Gaelic medium education in Scotland in terms of pupils]]

'''Gaelic medium education''' ('''G.M.E.''' or '''GME'''; {{lang-gd|Foghlam tro Mheadhan na Gàidhlig}}) is a form of [[education in Scotland]] that allows pupils to be taught primarily through the medium of Scottish Gaelic, with [[English language|English]] being taught as the secondary language.

Gaelic medium education is increasingly popular throughout Scotland, and the number of pupils who are in Gaelic medium education has risen from 24 in 1985 (its first year)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scotland's Languages: Gaelic|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/studyingscotland/resourcesforlearning/literaturelanguage/scotlandslanguages/gaelic.asp|website=Education Scotland|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 3,892 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/dspupcensus/dspupcensus16|title=Pupil census 2016 supplementary data|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|date=2016-12-12|website=www.gov.scot|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current figure is the highest number of Gaelic medium Education pupils in Scotland since the 2005 passage of the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005|Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act]] by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. Not included in this figure are university students at {{lang|gd|[[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig]]}}, [[Lews Castle College]], or {{lang|gd|[[Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle]]}} who are taking their degrees through the medium of Gaelic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/hrh-visits-sabhal-mor-ostaig-scotlands-only-gaelic-language-college|publisher=Prince of Wales|title=HRH visits Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Scotland's only Gaelic language college|date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gàidhlig agus Conaltradh Certhe |url=https://www.lews.uhi.ac.uk/courses/certhe-gaidhlig-agus-conaltradh|website=Lews Castle College|publisher=University of Highlands and Islands |accessdate=15 January 2017|language=gd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://en.islay-gaelic.net/pagex.asp?bioid=33051 |website=Ionad Chaluim Chille Ìle |accessdate=7 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, some research has suggested that Gaelic medium education by itself is not enough for full bilingual competency in Gaelic, and it may be the pupils in primary Gaelic education who go on to use the language frequently as adults is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson McLeod, University of Edinburgh Bernadette O’Rourke, Heriot-Watt University Stuart Dunmore, University of Edinburgh|title=‘New Speakers’ of Gaelic in Edinburgh and Glasgow|url=http://www.soillse.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Speakers’-of-Gaelic-in-Edinburgh-and-Glasgow.pdf|website=Soillse|accessdate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunmore 80"/&gt;. Further qualitative and quantitative research is underway to articulate take up and the impact of changing strategies over time.

==Current provision==
In 2016, 10,215 pupils in Scotland were receiving some kind of education in Gaelic representing 1.5% of the country's student population.  This figure is higher than Scotland's overall proportion of Gaelic speakers which stood at 1.1% in 2011.

Nearly 3,900 students in Scotland were enrolled in Gaelic medium education in 2016, a 32% increase in only three years and a 47% increase over 2010 figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pupil Census Supplementary Data|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/dspupcensus/|publisher=The Scottish Government|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six council areas had a higher than average enrollment of students in Gaelic Medium Education: [[Eilean Siar]] (27.16%); [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] (3.69%); [[Argyll &amp; Bute]] (1.80%); [[Glasgow|Glasgow City]] (1.18%); [[Edinburgh|Edinburgh City]] (0.76%); and [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]] (0.61%).

Over 6,300 other pupils in Scotland were receiving instruction in Gaelic language courses in 2016.&lt;ref name="scotland.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/dspupcensus/dspupcensus16 Pupil census 2016 supplementary data]; updated 17 May 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Eilean Siar]], 86.19% of all pupils were receiving some form of Gaelic-language education in 2016.  In second place was [[Argyll &amp; Bute]] at 10.75%, with the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] council area in third at 7.59%.  On the reverse side, sixteen council areas had no students at all receiving any education in Gaelic.

[[File:Bunsgoilbh copy.jpg|thumb|right|Bun-Sgoil Bharabhais is an example of a [[Primary School]] containing a Gaelic Medium Unit]]

There are a handful of dedicated Gaelic medium schools in the country. The largest is [[Sgoil Ghàidhlig Ghlaschu]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/GoingtoSchool/GaelicEducation/ Gaelic Education]&lt;/ref&gt; (Glasgow Gaelic School), established in 2006 and catering to pupils aged three to eighteen, the country's first 3-18 Gaelic medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=Ronnie|title=Follow Through Inspection Report: Glasgow Gaelic Primary School|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=11969&amp;p=0|website=Glasgow City Council|publisher=Glasgow City Council|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 2015-16 year the school enrolled 811 pupils and is one of the most over-enrolled schools in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Estates 2016 supplementary dataset|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/schoolestatestats/schestate2016|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's only other Gaelic medium secondary school is Sgoil Lionacleit on the island of [[Benbecula]] in Na h-Eileanan Siar. Several Gaelic language primary schools exist in the Western Isles. Outside that region, [[Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis]] opened in 2007 in Inverness and serves pupils in class 1-7,&lt;ref&gt;https://bunsgoilghaidhliginbhirnis.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Bun-sgoil Taobh na Pàirce]] which opened in 2013 in the capital city of Edinburgh. A new Gaelic medium primary school, [[Bun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Loch Abar]], opened in [[Caol]] near Fort William in 2015, and a similar school is currently under construction in [[Portree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction begins on Portree Gaelic primary school|url=http://www.urbanrealm.com/news/6375/Construction_begins_on_Portree_Gaelic_primary_school_.html|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=Urban Realm|date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there are still relatively few [[List of schools providing Gaelic medium education in Scotland|such schools]], however, Gaelic medium education is mainly provided through Gaelic medium units within English-speaking schools. [[Bun-sgoil Shlèite]] on the [[Skye|Isle of Skye]] is the exception in that it is a Gaelic school with an English Medium Unit.  The largest Gaelic unit is at [[Mount Cameron Primary School]] in [[East Kilbride]] which enrolled 70 pupils at the start of the 2015-16 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School Estates 2016 supplementary dataset|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/School-Education/schoolestatestats/schestate2016|website=The Scottish Government|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectiveness===
Several studies have examined the Gaelic-language capabilities of Gaelic-medium educated adults and found that few of them demonstrate native-like, or fully bilingual, abilities in Gaelic: &lt;blockquote&gt;"researchers in these studies [(cf. Landgraf 2013; Nance 2013; MacLeod et al. 2014). Landgraf (2013) and Macleod et al. (2014)] observed '''frequent and unmarked use of non-native-like features''' in GME students’ syntax, morphology and phonology, both through ethnographic observations in the classroom and individual interviews."&lt;ref name="Dunmore 80"&gt;Dunmore, Stuart. "Bilingual life after school? Language use, ideologies and attitudes among Gaelic-medium educated adults." (2015). Pg. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; ''(emphasis added)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her 2013 thesis, Julia Landgraf found that the few GME students exhibiting fully bilingual abilities came from Gaelic-speaking households.&lt;ref&gt;Landgraf, Julia (Sìleas). Cànain agus Cultar ann am Foghlam tro Mheadhan na Gàidhlig: Neartan, Duilgheadasan agus am Buaidh air Comasan is Seasamhan Cànain na h-Òlgridh. Diss. University of Aberdeen, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, GME students and other young adults from Gaelic-speaking areas are increasingly exhibiting English-influenced phonology.&lt;ref&gt;Nance, C. (2014). Phonetic variation in Scottish Gaelic laterals. Journal of Phonetics, 47, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, not all graduates end up using the language. In Dunmore's study of 46 adults from a GME background, a majority were classified as "low use." Usage was strongly correlated with language abilities.&lt;ref name="Dunmore 136"&gt;Dunmore, Stuart. "Bilingual life after school? Language use, ideologies and attitudes among Gaelic-medium educated adults." (2015). Pg. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===17th century===
The attitudes towards education and the promotion of Anglicisation have been described as resulting from "confrontation of two disparate societies...Lowland Scotland made plain its anxiety concerning the unreformed society in the north in terms of unease concerning its language, which was identified as the chief cause of barbarity, ignorance and popery"&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Kenneth Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect (pp56)&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen as a continuation of such policies going back to 1609 and the [[Statutes of Iona]] which saw the Gaelic speaking nobility of Scotland forced to send their children to be educated in English speaking [[Lowland Scotland]]; an act which has been described as "the first of a succession of measures taken by the Scottish government specifically aimed at the extirpation of the Gaelic language, the destruction of its traditional culture and the suppression of its bearers."&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Kenneth ''Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect'' (pp46)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1616 by an act of the [[privy council]] which included a requirement that the children of the [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] nobility must be capable of speaking, reading and writing English if they were to be recognised as heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Roger ''Gealach an Fhàis: Ùr Beothachadh na Gàidhlig'' (pp50)&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
The history of Gaelic language schools (in the modern sense) in [[Scotland]] can be traced back to the early 18th century and the schools of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] or SSPCK. Ironically, one of the primary aims of the society was the de-[[Gaelicisation]] of the Highlands and initially its schools taught exclusively through the medium of the English language with the equivalent use of Gaelic prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Kenneth ''Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect'' (pp54)&lt;/ref&gt; However the insistence on teaching children in a language which was (in almost all cases) entirely foreign to them resulted in very little progress with regards to establishing literacy in the English language. This situation persisted until the collapse of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause in 1746 with the [[Battle of Culloden]] and the consequent collapse of the Gaelic speaking political structures and the pacification of the Highlands by the [[British Army]] in the ensuing decades. The change in political atmosphere following the [[Disarming Act]], as well as campaigning by the likes of [[Samuel Johnson]] - who was aghast at the fact the SSPCK was actively preventing the publication of the [[Bible]] into Scottish Gaelic&amp;nbsp;— led to the change in attitudes within the Society. Johnson had to say of the matter:

:"...there remains only their language and their poverty. Their language is attacked on every side. Schools are erected in which English only is taught and there were lately some who thought it reasonable to refuse them a version of the Holy Scriptures, that they might have no monument to their mother tongue."&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, Kenneth ''Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect'' (pp55)&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson, despite being commonly viewed as both anti-Scottish and anti-Gaelic, was actively involved in campaigning for the production of Gaelic literature and proposed the creation of a Gaelic press in the [[Isle of Skye]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated56"&gt;MacKinnon, Kenneth ''Gaelic: A Past and Future Prospect'' (pp56)&lt;/ref&gt; The change in attitudes resulted in the production, by the SSPCK, of a Gaelic version of the [[New Testament]] in 1767 with the [[Old Testament]] being translated and published in 1801. 1767 also saw the SSPCK switch from English to [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] as the language of instruction in their Highland schools.&lt;ref name="autogenerated56"/&gt; A school in Inverness, [[Raining School]], was also established to provide training for Gaelic speaking teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, Roger ''Gealach an Fhàis: Ùr Beothachadh na Gàidhlig'' (pp51)&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

The 19th century saw the establishment of the first Gaelic school society&amp;nbsp;— the ''Edinburgh Society for the Support of Gaelic Schools'' - in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Derick S. ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland'' (pp258)&lt;/ref&gt; The society stated its purpose thus:

:"(the) sole object being to teach the inhabitants of the [[Highlands and Islands]] to read the Sacred Scriptures in their native tongue...to maintain Circulating Schools in which the Gaelic language only shall be taught."

The new society attracted much support with similar organisations being founded in [[Glasgow]] and [[Inverness]]. The early success of the Edinburgh society was such that by 1828 it funded 85 schools in the Highlands and Islands with its sister societies enjoying similar levels of success. However following the early period of success the groups encountered financial difficulties due to poor administration and started to decline around 1830 and by 1850 only the original [[Edinburgh]] society remained although this branch, with strong support from the [[Edinburgh Ladies Association]], continued until 1892. This was despite the introduction of the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1872]] which effectively put an end to non-English medium education and led to the discouragement of Gaelic with pupils being punished by teachers for speaking the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/18678/Language%20shift%20on%20Skye%20-%20printed%20version.pdf?sequence=2 |title=Gaelic Language Erosion and Revitalization on the Isle of Skye, Scotland |first1=Dick |last1=Smakman |first2=Cassandra |last2=Smith-Christmas |publisher=openaccess.leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the education act upon the Gaelic language has been described as "disastrous"&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ldowI6VgeMC&amp;pg=PA568&amp;lpg=PA568&amp;dq=gaelic+education+act+1872&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Bs9xcVrday&amp;sig=eZEmZf9KIEbEEfoKq4celdsqBYw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result The Edinburgh history of the Scots language], ''Charles Jones''. Retrieved from Google Books on 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and the continuation of a general policy (by both [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish]], and post [[Acts of Union 1707|1707]], [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British]]) which aimed at [[Anglicisation]].&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

Pressure upon the Scottish Education Department in the years immediately following the act of 1872 saw the gradual reintroduction of certain measures providing for the use of Gaelic in schools.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Derick S. ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland'' (pp259)&lt;/ref&gt; This pressure led to the undertaking by the department of a survey in 1876 which revealed a "distinct majority" of school boards within the Highlands in favour of the inclusion of Gaelic within the curriculum although it also revealed that some of those in Gaelic-speaking areas were against this. However the continuing reluctance of school boards to take full advantages of the limited provisions made for Gaelic within the school curriculum as well as the problems of financing the Education Act generally saw little use of the limited provisions for Gaelic within the schools.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Derick S. ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland'' (pp260)&lt;/ref&gt; The severe financial difficulties suffered by Highland schools at this time saw the introduction of the "[[Highland Minute]]" in 1887 which aimed at aiding designated boards financially while also recognising Gaelic as a specific subject in the higher classes of both elementary and secondary schools. Grants to aid the supply of Gaelic speaking teachers were also introduced.

Despite these small measures towards the reintroduction of Gaelic into the classroom the manner in which the language was taught is thought to have contributed to its decline with the language being taught not as the native tongue of the pupils, via the medium of the language itself, but as an academic subject to be studied only through the English language with ever decreasing numbers of students studying the language.

The [[frigate]] '''''Shtandart''''' (''{{Lang-ru|Штандартъ}}'') is modern replica of the [[Shtandart (frigate)|first ship]] of Russia's [[Baltic fleet]], was launched in 1703 at the Olonetsky shipyard near [[Olonets]] by the decree of [[Tsar]] [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] and orders issued by commander [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov|Aleksandr Menshikov]]. The name ''Shtandart'' was also given to the royal yachts of the tsars until the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution in 1917]]. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II's]] royal yacht was last of this series.

== Design ==
In 1994 a small group of sailing enthusiasts led by Vladimir Martus started construction of a replica of the [[Shtandart (frigate)|historical ship]]. 
Martus developed a new layout of the ''Shtandart'' wherein she was built with four bulkheads, dividing her into five compartments. 

The replica frigate has three masts and her displacement is 220 tons. She is 25.88 metres (82.0&amp;nbsp;ft) registered length, 27.5 metres (90&amp;nbsp;ft) long on deck and 34.5 metres (113&amp;nbsp;ft) long overall. The ''Shtandart'' is 7.0 metres (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide with a draft of 3.0 to 3.3 metres (11&amp;nbsp;ft). The ship is designed for speeds between 8-9 knots under sail, and under auxiliary engines she can make up to 13 knots (25&amp;nbsp;km/h). The original crew complement in 1703 was between 120 and 150, and the modern crew consists of 30 trainees and 10 officers.

The "Shtandart Project" (a non-commercial organisation dedicated to youth development) launched a replica of the frigate on September 4, 1999. The modern ''Shtandart'' has two zones:
* The historically accurate area above the [[gun deck]]: the [[Steering wheel (ship)|steering wheel]] and helm, all decorative carvings, the furniture, and all of the [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], [[Touch hole|spikes]], [[guns]], gangways and hatches are carefully reconstructed.
* The "modern" area built to modern standards and in compliance with safety regulations: This includes two [[Volvo Penta]] TAMD 122P engines and a generator.

== Milestones of the ''Shtandart'' ==
* On September 4, 1999 the ''Shtandart'' was launched at the Petrovsky Shipyard in St Petersburg.
* In June 2000 the ''Shtandart'' set sail on her maiden voyage. The frigate retraced the route taken by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]], during his [[Grand Embassy]].
* Since 2005, the ''Shtandart'' has played the part of the "dream ship" at the [[Scarlet Sails (tradition)|Scarlet Sails]] festival, an annual celebration of the end of the school year in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] from a novel by [[Alexander Grin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bearsandvodka.com/2010/01/more-days-to-celebrate/ Brief description of "Scarlet Sails" celebration and other holidays.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gov.spb.ru/culture/holiday/al_parusa another "Scarlet Sails" link (Russian).]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Over the last seventeen years (till end 2017) the ''Shtandart'' has sailed approximately {{convert|150000|nmi|km}} in the Baltic, North, Norwegian Barents and Mediterranean Seas, as well as sailing to [[Canary islands]].  She has visited one hundred and fifty ports in seventeen countries. Around 7000 trainees has been on board ''Shtandart'' for sailing adventure and training.

== Bureaucratic challenges ==
Beginning in 2007, all sailing vessels in Russia faced challenges with a certification.  The new National Sea and River Authority (then Росморречнадзор/Rosmorrechnadzor, now Госморречнадзор/[[Gosmorrechnadzor]]) refused to issue certificates for sailing ships. The ''Shtandart'' was one of the most prominent of these vessels, so her dispute with this government agency was widely publicized.&lt;ref name="Lenizdat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lenizdat.ru/a0/ru/pm1/c-1064238-0.html|trans-title=Vladimir Martus: the Reason for the conflict "Shtandart" vs Rosmorrechnadzor "- too great a contract sum |title=Владимир Мартусь: Причина конфликта ""Штандарт" vs Росморречнадзор" - слишком большая сумма контракта|last=Pirogovsky|first=Artem|date=2008-07-10|work=Mediaconflict|publisher=Lenizdat|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Northwest directorate of the Rosmorrechnadzor cancelled the ''Shtandart's'' certifications but the St. Petersburg Arbitration Court reversed the decision in favor of the frigate, and the certificate's cancellation was ruled illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityspb.ru/goto/140693 ''Gazeta'' article about the case.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship has now been sailing around in Europe for the last ten years. It is not known when she could return to her home port.

'''''SkyWeek''''' was a weekly [[astronomy]] television program created by ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Horne1" /&gt;  The show was hosted by Tony Flanders, associate editor of ''Sky &amp; Telescope'' magazine.&lt;ref name="ST2" /&gt; Each episode of the program was released in one, three, and five-minute formats; and, the show's content and format were similar to that of another weekly astronomy program called ''[[Star Gazers]]''.&lt;ref name="Sutherland" /&gt; ''SkyWeek'' was carried by many [[PBS]] affiliates.

== Content ==
''SkyWeek'' was an [[Educational television|educational]] program that described [[Astronomical object|celestial]] events for the upcoming week. The show was aimed primarily at the general public and required no prior knowledge of astronomy. However, it also contained information that was likely to be interesting to experienced [[amateur astronomers]]. It depicted [[celestial objects]] in the night sky that could be seen without special equipment such as [[telescope]]s.&lt;ref name="aptonline" /&gt; Sky and Telescope's associate editor, Tony Flanders hosted the show,&lt;ref name="Homan" /&gt; which was available in one-, three- and five-minute versions.&lt;ref name="aptonline" /&gt;

== Production ==
''SkyWeek'' was produced by New Track Media, which publishes ''Sky &amp; Telescope'' magazine. The show was distributed to [[PBS]] stations through [[American Public Television]].&lt;ref name="aptonline" /&gt;

Images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and many other professional and amateur sources were used in the production of the show.&lt;ref name="aptonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KET" /&gt;

On April 16, 2014, Tony Flanders announced that the episode covering the week of April 28 to May 4, 2014 would be the last for the series.  Flanders reported that the series was being discontinued because of insufficient money from sponsors required to cover the show's costs.&lt;ref name="ST3" /&gt;

== Episodes ==
Episodes were titled by the week of the events they describe.  The production code used was of the form YYMMDD (2 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day) for the date the episode was best suited to be broadcast.&lt;ref name="KET2" /&gt;

=== Season 1: 2011 ===
The show premiered on November 19, 2011 with the inaugural episode covering the week of November 21 to 27 of 2011.&lt;ref name="Horne1" /&gt;

'''Subway Academy I''' is a [[Public school (government funded)|public]] [[alternative school|alternative]] [[high school]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Originally, Subway Academy I was simply called "Subway Academy", but after Subway Academy II opened, the name was changed to "Subway Academy I". It was founded in September 1973, making it one of the oldest secondary alternative schools in Toronto. The original staff were Achim Krull, Judith Robertson and Murray Shukyn. The school was a reflection of the Ivan Illich&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Deschooling/intro.html&lt;/ref&gt; "deschooling" movement, which proposed that people would learn best from community resources. As a result, a directory of resources along the Toronton subway system was created, and the school derives its name from that initiative. The community resource aspect of the program however faded very quickly. Students were more interested in formal credit courses and academic courses leading to admission to university or college admission. 
Subway Academy started as an independent studies program. It was intended to make education available to students with family or other obligations which limited their ability to attend school during regular hours and who could not attend night school. The school enrolled students at any time during the year, not just in September. Originally, there was no upper age limit on enrolment. The school attracted many adults. 
The independent studies program at Subway Academy operated very differently from regular high school programs. Students met their teachers by appointment several times a week, but there were no formal classes. During the appointments, students reviewed their progress with their teachers, wrote tests, handed in assignments, and received new work. Students could work at the school, or at home, or at the local library, wherever they were comfortable. Students started courses when they joined, and finished courses whenever they had completed all the required work. Additional courses could be started at any time. Today Subway Academy combined formal classes with independent studies, and students are required to complete courses during a regular semestered timeframe.
Subway Academy One continues to share a building with [[Eastern Commerce Collegiate Institute]]. Today it offers courses from grades 9 to 12 at both the academic and applied level. As the enrolment at Subway Academy increased, it was divided into two branches. Subway Academy II was opened in the west end of Toronto. Judith Robertson became the first coordinator of that program. It continues today as an independent studies program.

'''Sun Rise English School&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/sresbharatpur/&lt;/ref&gt;''' is a private school in [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Bharatpur]], [[Chitwan District|Chitwan]]. It is one of the premier private schools of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sres.edu.np/?page_id=130 | title = Sun Rise English School | publisher = SRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sun Rise English School was established in 1987 by Mr. Dinanath Duwadi, in his own home in Bharatpur-06, Krishnapur, Chitwan. Classes ran from Nursery to 5th grade. There were 33 students enrolled and 5 staff and teachers working in the school. After running the school for 3 years in his home, the board of directors moved it to Dipendra Nagar. The school was moved behind Birendra Multiple Campus, Dipendra Nagar in the fall of 1992. After running the school for two more years, the school's Board of Directors declared liquidity. In the summer of 1994, the school was closed with 142 students enrolled and studying.

Within a week, the school was purchased by a group of young educators. The new group registered the school as '''Sun Rise English School''', removing the word 'boarding' from its previous name. Mr. Bal Bahadur Acharya was selected as the acting principal of the school. The new management brought all the teachers and staff, and all the physical assets including the school building from the previous management and started the classes at the same place behind Birendra Multiple Campus in Dipendra Nagar.

The school has attended generally good reputation as one of the best Secondary Schools outside Kathmandu Valley. With overall excellent results in the [[School Leaving Certificate (Nepal)|SLC]] examinations, the school has established itself as a strong competitor in the Nepalese education system.

==Administration==
The new management took over in 1994. The school used to be administered completely by the Board of Directors elected by the Trustees of school till 2006. With a demand for a parent representative on the school's Board of Directors, the previous system was finally removed. Directors will be composed like this:
* From Share Holders-1 representative
* From Parents-2 representatives(1 Male/ 1 Female)
* From Teachers-1 representative
* From Local Educationalists-1 representative
* From Government of Nepal, School Invigilators-1 representative
* Principal
[[File:Sun_Rise_English_School.jpg|thumb|Left|Inside View]]

==Course of study==
The school operates two courses of study: 
* School Leaving Certificate level (a nationwide curriculum up to class 10 prescribed by the [[Department of Education (Nepal)|Department of Education]], Ministry of Education and Sports, Government of Nepal

Most students go on to attend high schools in [[Chitwan]], [[Kathmandu]], [[Pokhara]] and to some [[Education in India|Indian]] cities. Sun Rise has been producing excellent results in [[School Leaving Certificate|SLC]] examinations for the past 14 years. Every year till now, the school has been amongst the top three schools in the district with the best results.

As a singer she who has enjoyed substantial popularity in Hong Kong and other countries, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. She is also the mother of singer [[T.V. Carpio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Teresa and TV Carpio discuss Broadway's Spider-man Turn Off The Dark |author=David Gordon |url=http://www.theatermania.com/broadway/news/06-2011/news-flash-teresa-and-tv-carpio-discuss-broadways_38222.html |publisher=Theater Mania}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is most well known for her Cantonese hits, 假如 (If), 仍然記得嗰一次 (I Still Remember That Time), 眉頭不再皺 (Sukiyaki), 何必放棄 (Why Give Up) and 真愛 (True Love).

==Family background==
Carpio's father is [[Filipino people|Filipino]] and her mother [[Chinese people|Shanghainese]]. Born into a musical family (her grandfather was a concert [[violin]]ist and [[jazz guitarist]], her father Fernando, a [[jazz drummer]], and several uncles were also professional musicians), She began singing at age 6 when she entered and won Hong Kong's first Amateur Talent Quest. She is the eldest of five, all of whom have at some time been active in the music business. Her eldest daughter, [[T.V. Carpio|TV Carpio]], is a musician, actress and Broadway singer.

==Career==
Carpio began her career as a [[child singer|child star]], winning Hong Kong's first Amateur Talent Quest in 1963 at the age of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/648962/teresa-carpio|title=Teresa Carpio|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 11, she turned down a scholarship at [[St. Paul's Convent School|St Paul's Convent]] to work in her first job in Tahiti where her father was also working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/235872/stepping-back-lions-den|title=Stepping back into the lion's den|newspaper=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-02-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that, she worked in clubs until she went to Japan for a year where she met [[Shintaro Katsu]] who sponsored her during her time there. She released her first single in Japan in 1971, entitled Ainoko Mary (混血児マリー).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dreamwaterchildren.net/2012/02/05/vintage-japanese-movie%e3%80%80%e6%b7%b7%e8%a1%80%e5%85%90%e3%83%9e%e3%83%aa%e3%83%bc/|title=Music Video: Vintage Japanese Movie Song: Mongrel Marie 混血児マリー|date=2012-02-05|website=Dream of the Water Children: The Black Pacific|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=reftandlight3|title=Teresa Carpio - My First Love 1971|date=2014-12-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1scuqmn4JVg|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Hong Kong, she worked in many nightclubs, such as Danshaku, Gessekai and the Hyatt Hotel's Chin Chin Bar, until EMI came and offered her a recording deal.

For several years from 1975 onwards Carpio had her own TV variety show in [[Hong Kong]], on which she performed both solo and with several of her siblings.  She released many albums in Hong Kong from 1976 onwards; six of her albums under EMI went gold, in which she featured cover versions in English of western hits, including an album with [[George Lam]]. She made numerous television appearances in Hong Kong, in the late 1970s.

Carpio was the first and the youngest Hong Kong singer ever to appear on national TV in Japan. She has performed in many other countries as far apart as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tahiti]], Australia, Japan, Thailand, [[Brunei]], the United States and Canada.

With the growing popularity of [[Cantopop]], Carpio started to record in [[Cantonese]] along with English, remaining popular despite increasing competition from newer stars, notably [[Anita Mui]]. Carpio broadened her career into acting with appearances in a number of films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139568/|title=''Carpio's Starring Record IMDB Database''|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and auditioned for the lead role in [[Miss Saigon]], though this eventually went to [[Lea Salonga]]. She was no stranger to live musical theatre, having taken the lead role in the 1979 [[San Jose, California]] production of the stage musical ''[[City of Broken Promises]]'', based on the book by [[Austin Coates]], a story set in [[Macau]] which won Best Original Musical.

Following her second marriage, Carpio moved to Canada and focused her attention on bringing up her family (she has three daughters; the eldest, [[T. V. Carpio]], by her first marriage, also an actor, singer and [[songwriter]]).

== Discography ==
Carpio has released 25 albums to date, including 6 live recordings. Her first album, Teresa Carpio, was released in 1975 and then quickly followed up with five more solo albums from EMI as well as a duets album with George Lam. In 1981 she moved to WEA and released one Cantonese album. In 1983 she formed her own record company, TV Records, which released three more Cantonese albums, on which - together with her WEA album - are some of her most popular songs. Since then she has released several live CDs and DVDs as well as a few studio recordings.

== Filmography ==
She has appeared in 13 movies in total, starting in 1984 with a lead role in [[開心鬼]] (Happy Ghost), where she also sang the theme song. She is more well known for her later movies where she often was famous for small roles that became extremely popular, such as 2003's [[六樓后座]] (Sixth Floor Rear Flat) where she sang part of 海闊天空 ([[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]), accompanying herself on keyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=herman lee|title=海闊天空- 六樓后座 by 杜麗莎|date=2009-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN4307cjJss|accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''[[Singer 2017]]'' ==
Prior to her appearance on ''Singer 2017'', on 20 August 2016, she appeared as a guest singer on the finals of [[:zh:跨界歌王|Crossover Singer]] 2016 for the performance of runner-up [[Wong Cho-lam|Wong Cho Lam]] (who sung a version of [[The Prayer (Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]].) &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=第四季最强大脑|title=跨界歌王 第13期 20160820 王祖蓝, 杜丽莎 The Prayer|date=2016-08-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl9Kb5doYiE|accessdate=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of her appearance, Carpio was selected as one of eight initial singers to compete in Hunan TV's [[Singer 2017]]. During her tenure, she told to the media that her participation was fueled by the fact that she was competing against another Hong Kong singer, [[Sandy Lam|Sandy Lam Yik-Lin]] (who she went on to win). Despite topping the singer's voting predictions (two 1st, one 2nd and one 3rd), she was eliminated on week five (2nd Knockout round) after receiving the lowest combined votes, largely due to finishing last on her prior week. Her elimination was not without controversy, with many fans questioning about the elimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.twoeggz.com/news/3515194.html|title=相较歌手，更是艺术家的她在《歌手》惨遭淘汰，被疑有黑幕？|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E9%9F%B3%E6%A8%82/71170/-%E6%AD%8C%E6%89%8B-%E6%9D%9C%E9%BA%97%E8%8E%8E%E7%9C%9F%E6%83%85%E6%B5%81%E9%9C%B2%E6%85%98%E9%81%AD%E6%B7%98%E6%B1%B0-%E7%B6%B2%E6%B0%91%E9%AC%A7%E7%88%86%E7%AF%80%E7%9B%AE%E7%B5%84|title=【歌手】杜麗莎真情流露慘遭淘汰　網民鬧爆節目組|last=彭嘉彬|website=香港01|language=en|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her Return performance on the week after elimination, Carpio later returned to the stage to participate the "Breakout Round", and at second place by a difference of three votes (0.15%) behind the top singer [[Li Jian (singer)|Li Jian]], she was one of the few singers to be reinstated from the competition. However, she was shortly eliminated again on the semi-finals a week later as one of the bottom two singers (the other was [[Julia Peng]]) receiving a lower count of votes.

'''''The New Media Reader''''' is a [[new media]] [[textbook]] edited by [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]] and [[Nick Montfort]] and published through [[The MIT Press]]. The reader features essays from a variety of contributors such as [[Lev Manovich]], [[Richard Stallman]], and [[Alan Turing]]. It is currently in use at multiple college campuses including [[Brown University]] 
",&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/wdm/Cave+Writing+syllabus+-+Spring+10 Brown University Syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isis.duke.edu/curriculum/ISIS240/Syllabus_01_19_2007.pdf Duke University Syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=Syllabus&gt;[http://people.ucsc.edu/~lkelley/classes/fdm20c_spring/20c_spring.pdf/ UC Santa Cruz Film 20C Syllabus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of this book, as described by the authors, is to articulate the that has often gone unheard and under the radar. They made an extra effort to include illustrations that we originally intended but often neglected in subsequent printings. This book hopes to " assemble a representative collection of critical thoughts, events, and developments...as a new medium, or enabling a new media." By new media they are not referring to new media at this given moment in time, but rather media that was new and original at the time of its introduction. They mention that many times these ideas seemed radical and unorthodox at the time but have paved the way from many modern ideas and the authors hope to "provide understanding and offer fuel for inspiration".
