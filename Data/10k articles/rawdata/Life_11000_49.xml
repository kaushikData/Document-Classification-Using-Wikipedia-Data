'''''The 27 Club graffiti''''' is a [[mural]] that was painted by the Israeli [[graffiti]] crew, [[Jonathan Kis-Lev|Kis-Lev]], on the side wall of a large building in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]] in September 2014. The artwork is {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and depicts seven artists from the "[[27 Club]]", a list of [[popular music]]ians, artists, or actors who died at the age of 27.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2015|title=יהונתן כיס-לב מספר על אמנות הרחוב מעוררת המחלוקת|url=|journal=Kan, Israeli Art Magazine - מגזין כאן: מציאות ישראלית באמנות|volume=36|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkar Ellias|first=Bina|date=|title=Jonathan Kis-Lev's Street Art|url=|journal=International Gallerie|volume=40|pages=35-41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural has received much criticism.&lt;ref name="Kampinski2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kampinski|first=Zipa|title=Brilliance at Frenkel Street – Together All the Way|url=http://www.xnet.co.il/design/articles/0,14563,L-3107132,00.html|publisher=Xnet Yediot Aharonot|language=Hebrew|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Graffiti Tel Aviv, Khayim Ben Atar St - front.jpg|thumb|The work as seen from the street]]
[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv by Street Artist Kis-Lev16.jpg|thumb|Kis-Lev and Kozhokin used a crane to create the work]]
The work depicts, from left to right, [[Brian Jones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and an unknown figure, "believed to be the artist, Jonathan Kis-Lev."&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;{{Citation|last=Peterson|first=Sydney|title=12 Must-See Works Of Israeli Street Art|url=https://forward.com/slideshow/365364/12-must-see-works-of-israeli-street-art/#slide-9|publisher=Forward Magazine|language=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; That part of the painting was covered by pink paint, and "there is some argument as to whether or not the pink paint over Kis-Lev's face was done by Kis-Lev himself or another artist. One rumor is that Kis-Lev was so disappointed in all that he hadn't accomplished by the age of 27, that he included paint to cover his face."&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forward2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Zeveloff|first=Naomi|title=Take a Tour with the Graffiti Geek of Tel Aviv — and Learn Hebrew, Too|date=7 August 2016|url=https://forward.com/slideshow/365364/12-must-see-works-of-israeli-street-art/#slide-9|publisher=Forward Magazine|language=|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reportedly made with the help of a crane and took two days to complete.&lt;ref name="Kampinski2" /&gt;

Kis-Lev first came up with the idea to depict the seven figures when he was 26 years old. "I was about to turn 27 and, having read much about the 27 club, I was afraid I was to somehow join them. Some of my friends teased me that I would, being an artist and all... I promised myself that I would do a mural to commemorate these giants including my face in faded colors, and once I turn 28 to cover my face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Kis-Lev and the artists Itai Froumin and Roman Kozhokin jointly created the mural.&lt;ref name="Kampinski2" /&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
Since its creation in 2014 the mural has become one of the best-known [[street art]] works in Israel,&lt;ref name="Forward" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Tel Aviv Street Art|date=4 February 2017|url=http://streetartnyc.org/blog/2017/02/04/tel-aviv-street-art-klone-foma-dede-adi-sened-michal-rubin-mr-di-maggio-jonathan-kis-lev-ros-plazma-signor-g-and-murielle/|publisher=Street Art NYC|language=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to ''From the Grapevine Magazine'' "the most popular in Florentin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fromthegrapevine.com/photos/lifestyle/Florentin-Tel-Aviv-Israel-walk-hip-interesting-neighborhood|title=Take a walk through one of the world's most interesting neighborhoods|website=From the Grapevine|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become the focal point of many art tours in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photostock-israel.photoshelter.com/image/I00003PxsdtNJhXY|title=Graffiti wall art Tel Aviv {{!}} PhotoStock-Israel Licensed stock photography|website=photostock-israel.photoshelter.com|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=April 2018}} regard the work as vandalism.&lt;ref name="Kampinski2" /&gt; Others{{who|date=April 2018}} see the work as self-promotion for Kis-Lev and his crew, calling the work "commercial."{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2782">'''Abu Ishaq Shami''' (died 940) was a Muslim scholar who is often regarded as the founder of the Sufi [[Chishti Order]] ({{lang-fa|چشتی}} - ''Čištī'') ({{lang-ar|ششتى}} - ''Shishti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMotCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10| last = Jackson | first = Roy | title = Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic State | location = Abingdon, Oxfordshire | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-415-47411-5 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first in the Chishti lineage (''[[silsila]]'') to live in [[Chisht]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Karamustafa | first = Ahmet T. | title = Sufism: The Formative Period | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-520-25268-4 | page = 60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so to adopt the name "Chishti", so that, if the Chishti order itself dates back to him, it is one of the oldest recorded Sufi orders. His original name, Shami, implies he came from [[Syria]] ([[ash-Sham]]). He died in Damascus and lies buried on [[Mount Qasiyun]],&lt;ref name="sufi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chishti.ru/order_of_sufis.htm|last=Chishti|title=Early Sufis in the Chishti Order|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where later on also [[Ibn Arabi]] was buried.

==Masters and students==
Abu Ishaq Shami's teacher was Shaikh Ilw  Dinwari, whose own teacher was Abu Hubairah Basri, a disciple of [[Huzaifah Al-Mar'ashi]] who was in turn a disciple of [[Ibrahim ibn Adham]]. The Chishtiyyah ''silsila'' continued through Abu Ishaq Shami's disciple Abu Ahmad Abdal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ernst | first = Carl W. | title = Sufi martyrs of love: the Chishti Order in South Asia and beyond | publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-1-4039-6027-6 | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In south Asia [[Moinuddin Chishti]] was the founding father and most revered saint of the Chishti order.

==Quotes==
Some of Abu Ishaq Shami's sayings are:
* Starvation excels all in bliss.
* The worldly people are impure while the [[dervishes]] are pure in their souls. These two different natures cannot therefore mingle.&lt;ref name="sufi"/&gt;

==The chain of masters of Chishti order==

*'Ameerul Mo'mineen Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib

'''Agallis''' ([[ancient Greek|Gr.]] '''{{lang|grc|Ἀγαλλίς}}''', [[floruit|fl.]] 2nd century BC) of [[Corcyra]] was a female [[Philologist|grammarian]] who wrote about [[Homer]], according to [[Athenaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' i. p. 14, d.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe her to have belonged to the [[hetaera]]e class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Hecker  | first =Eugene Arthur  | title =A Short History of Women's Rights from the Days of Augustus to the Present Time  | publisher =[[G.

Her writings are no longer extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Pomeroy  | first =Sarah B.  | title =Women in Hellenistic Egypt: From Alexander to Cleopatra  | publisher =[[Wayne State University Press]]  | year =1990  | location =Detroit  | pages =61  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lcH6oWafBq8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=agallis  | isbn = 0-8143-2230-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have supposed from two passages in the ''[[Suda]]'' that we ought to read "Anagallis" in this passage of Athenaeus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], ''s.v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἀνάγαλλις}} and {{lang|grc|Ὄρχησις}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[scholiast]] on Homer and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]&lt;ref&gt;''ad Il.'' xviii. 491&lt;/ref&gt; mention a grammarian of the name of Agallias, a pupil of [[Aristophanes of Byzantium|Aristophanes the grammarian]], also a [[Corcyra]]ean and a commentator upon Homer, who may be the same as Agallis, or perhaps her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Agallis  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 5  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0066.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time in the 19th century, the name "Agallis" was thought to be the subject of one of the poems of [[Sappho]].  Later scholarship showed this to have been an erroneous interpretation of a corrupted text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Parsons  | first =Peter  |author2=T.P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="949">Agnesium is a [[neologism]] coined to describe a powerful, efficient and effective organization as an entity.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Organizational Behaviour and Management
 By David Knights, Hugh Willmott&lt;/ref&gt; Agnesium is a combination of [https://translate.google.ch/?oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#la/en/Agnes Agnes] (Latin for powerful, efficient and effective) and the suffix -ium &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/-ium -ium]&lt;/ref&gt; (indicating a biological structure).

The basic principle of Agnesium is that for complex structures/organizations there are many interdependencies between the members that are not known, understood or leveraged. By recognizing, understanding and leveraging these hidden interdependencies an organization can be proactive, adaptive and exploitive.

'''''Alcestis''''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|s|ɛ|s|t|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄλκηστις}}, ''Alkēstis'') is an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] by the [[Classical Greece|ancient Greek]] playwright [[Euripides]].&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 353).&lt;/ref&gt; It was first produced at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia festival]] in 438 BC. Euripides presented it as the final part of a [[tetralogy]] of unconnected plays in the competition of tragedies, for which he won second prize; this arrangement was exceptional, as the fourth part was normally a [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitts (1960b, 143), Banham (1998, 353), and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 16–17, 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]], [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] [[Tone (fiction)|tone]]—which may be "cheerfully romantic" or "bitterly ironic"—has earned it the label of a "[[problem play]]."&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 353) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 37).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alcestis'' is, possibly excepting the ''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]'', the oldest surviving work by Euripides, although at the time of its first performance he had been producing plays for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Banham (1998, 352) and Brockett and Hildy (2003, 16).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events prior to the start of the play==
Long before the start of the play, King [[Admetus]] was granted by the [[Moirai|Fates]] the privilege of living past the allotted time of his death. The Fates were persuaded to allow this by the god [[Apollo]] (who got them drunk). This unusual bargain was struck after Apollo was [[exile]]d from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] for nine years and spent the time in the service of the Thessalian king, a man renowned for his [[hospitality]] who treated Apollo well. Apollo wishes to repay Admetus' hospitality and offers him freedom from death. The gift, however, comes with a price: Admetus must find someone to take his place when Death comes to claim him.

The time of Admetus' death comes and he still has not found a willing substitute. His father, Pheres, is unwilling to step in and thinks that it is ludicrous that he should be asked to give up the life he enjoys so much as part of this strange deal. Finally, Admetus' devoted wife [[Alcestis]] agrees to be taken in his place because she wishes not to leave her children fatherless or be bereft of her lover. At the start of the play, she is close to death.

==Synopsis==
In the play's [[prologue]], the god [[Apollo]] comes out from Admetus' palace in [[Pherae]] (modern [[Velestino]] in [[Magnesia Prefecture|Magnesia]]), dressed in white and carrying his golden bow, with the intention of leaving to avoid becoming stained by the imminent death of [[Alcestis]], who is being comforted within. He offers an [[Exposition (fiction)|exposition]] of the [[Alcestis (play)#Events prior to the start of the play|events leading up to this moment]]. He hails the arrival of [[Thanatos]] ([[Death (personification)|Death]]), who, dressed in black and carrying a sword, has come to the palace in his role as [[psychopomp]] to lead Alcestis to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]]. Thanatos challenges Apollo's apparent defense of Alcestis and accuses him of "twisting slippery tricks" when he helped Admetus cheat death in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Line 32, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 150)&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo reassures him and, in a passage of swift [[Stichomythia|stichomythic]] banter, proposes a postponement of Alcestis' death, which is sarcastically rebuffed. Thanatos concludes, "you may not have what is not yours."&lt;ref&gt;Line 63, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 152).&lt;/ref&gt; Defeated, Apollo leaves angrily, prophesying the arrival of a man ([[Heracles]]) who will wrestle Alcestis away from Death. Alone with the audience, Thanatos warns that "this was a god of many words; but words / are not enough," before he summons the doors open with the tip of his sword and slowly enters the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Line 72, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 153).&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], or the "[[parodos]]" sequence, follows: a chorus of [[Chorus of the Elderly in Classical Greek Drama|fifteen men of Pherae]], led by a "[[coryphaeus]]" (chorus-leader), enter the [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|orchestra]] of the theatre. The chorus-leader complains that they are in a state of [[suspense]], ignorant of whether they ought to be performing [[Mourning ritual (Ancient Greek)|mourning rituals]] for their queen. The chorus' [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]] [[ode]], to which they dance as they sing, consists of two paired [[stanza]]s of [[strophe]] and [[antistrophe]]. They sing of the silence that greets their search for signs of mourning, the evidence of Alcestis' death. "When goodness dies," they lament, "all good men suffer, too."&lt;ref&gt;Line 110, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 154).&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus-leader concludes by dismissing the chorus' search for hope in the situation: "The King has exhausted every [[ritual]]."&lt;ref&gt;Line 131, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 155).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[episode]] begins with a [[maid]]servant, who enters from the palace in tears. When the chorus-leader presses her for news, she gives a confusing response: "She is alive. And dead."&lt;ref&gt;Line 141, trans. Fitts and Fitzgerald (1960, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Alcestis stands, she explains, at this moment on the brink of life and death. The chorus-leader anxiously confirms that all of the customary preparations have been made for her proper burial. The maidservant joins the chorus-leader in praising Alcestis' virtue. She narrates a long description of Alcestis' prayers and preparations to die earlier that morning, when Alcestis cried over the bridal bed that will destroy her, embraced her sobbing children, and bade all farewell. She describes how Admetus held Alcestis weeping in his arms while her eyes clung to the sight of the last rays of sun she would see. The maidservant welcomes the chorus-leader to the palace and goes inside to inform Admetus of their arrival.

[[Alcestis]], on her death-bed, requests that in return for her sacrifice, [[Admetus]] never again marry, nor forget her or place a resentful stepmother in charge of their children. Admetus agrees to this and also promises to lead a life of solemnity in her honour, abstaining from the merrymaking that was an integral part of his household. Alcestis then dies.

Just afterwards, Admetus' old friend [[Heracles]] arrives at the palace, having no idea of the sorrow that has befallen the place. Unwilling to turn a guest away, the king decides not to burden Heracles with the sad news and instructs the servants to make him welcome and to keep their mouths shut. By doing this, Admetus breaks his promise to Alcestis to abstain from merrymaking during the period that follows her death. Heracles gets drunk and begins to irritate the servants, who loved their queen and are bitter at not being allowed to mourn her properly. Finally, one of the servants snaps at the guest and tells him what has happened.

Heracles is deeply embarrassed at his blunder and his bad behaviour and he decides to ambush and confront [[Death]] when the funerary sacrifices are made at Alcestis' tomb. When he returns, he brings with him a veiled woman whom he tells Admetus he has won in a competition. He asks his host to take her and look after her while Heracles is away on [[Labours of Hercules|his labours]]. After much discussion, he finally forces a reluctant Admetus to take her by the hand, but when he lifts the veil, he finds that it appears to be Alcestis, back from the dead. Heracles has battled Death and forced him to give her up. She cannot speak for three days, after which she will be purified and fully restored to life.

==Critics' commentary==
The categorization of ''Alcestis'' has been a subject of debate among literary critics. It employs both tragic and comic elements, and (when first performed) occupied a slot that was generally reserved for [[satyr play]]s. Conacher explores how Euripides expanded the myth of Admetus and Alcestis, and added elements of comedy and folk tales. Beye also discusses legendary and fairy tale aspects of the play.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

''Alcestis'' is also a popular text for [[women's studies]]. Critics have indicated that the play's central focus is Admetus rather than Alcestis. Segal, for example, has written of the play's [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] aspects. The nature of [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]], especially in ancient times, has been variously analysed by Rabinowitz, Vellacott, and Burnett, who explain that ancient Greek morality differed considerably from that of the present day. Modern interpretations of the play have been extremely varied, so much so that critics (such as Michelini and Gounaridou) have noted their failure to agree on much of anything. Gounaridou argues that Euripides meant for the play to be understood in many different ways. The psychologies and motivations of Admetus and Alcestis are especially disputed, with the question of Admetus's selfishness strongly contested.

==Modern production history==

The American theatre director [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] staged a production of the play in 1986 at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and in 1987 at the [[Staatstheater Stuttgart|Staatstheater]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1989, 94).&lt;/ref&gt; The production supplemented Euripides' play with material drawn from a range of sources, united by their exploration of the themes of death and rebirth.&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 550"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 550).&lt;/ref&gt; It began with [[Heiner Müller|Heiner Müller's]] ''Explosion of a Memory (Description of a Picture)'' (1985) as a [[prologue]]; the piece is a dream narrative partly composed using [[automatic writing]]. Müller described it as a description of "a landscape beyond death" that is "an overpainting of Euripides' ''Alcestis'' which quotes the [[Noh|Noh play]] ''Kumasaka'', the Eleventh Canto of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]].''"&lt;ref&gt;Weber (1989, 93–102).&lt;/ref&gt; The production also utilised a [[Kyōgen|Japanese kyogen play]] whose themes parodied those of ''Alcestis'', laser projections, a musical score by [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]], and [[sound sculpture]]s by composer [[Robert Rutman]].&lt;ref name="Brockett and Hildy 2003, 550" /&gt;

[[T. S. Eliot]]'s play ''[[The Cocktail Party]]'' is a modern adaption of ''Alcestis''; it was premiered at the Edinburgh Festival on 22 August 1949, directed by E. Martin Browne.

'''Andrew Belton''' (17 April 1882 &amp;ndash; 1970) was a [[British Army]] officer and veteran of campaigns in [[South Africa]] and [[Morocco]]. He was an early exponent of the use of aircraft for military purposes, enrolling at the [[Chicago School of Aviation]] in April, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KAID OF MOROCCO STUDENT OF AIR |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/386697281.html?dids=386697281:386697281&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Apr+04%2C+1911&amp;author=KEENE+GARDINER&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=KAID+OF+MOROCCO+STUDENT+OF+AIR&amp;pqatl=google|work=[[Chicago Tribune|Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date=4 April 1911|accessdate=2008-10-29|first=Keene|last=Gardiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an [[entrepreneur]] who registered a number of companies in the newly established [[Irish Free State]].

==Military career==
Following the deaths of two of his brothers during the [[Second Boer War]], and though under age, Belton enlisted and saw service in Africa. On his return to England, he became aware of the developing military dispute in Morocco, subsequently known as the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. Having apparently resigned his military commission, he assisted the pretender to the throne [[Abdelhafid of Morocco|Abdelhafid]], to overthrow his brother [[Abdelaziz of Morocco|Abdelaziz]]. This is how he acquired the title ''''Kaid'''', or Commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoor.ukf.net/html/history/andrew_belton.html |title=Kaid Andrew Belton |work=Cleator Moor |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724115009/http://www.themoor.ukf.net/html/history/andrew_belton.html |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War]], he was arrested in [[Seville]] having crossed the border from [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LCdpAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Foreign+Intervention+in+Spain++By+Hispanicus&amp;q=belton&amp;pgis=1#search ''Foreign Intervention in Spain'', pg. 84 by Hispanicus]; retrieved on 2008-10-29&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in establishing the Independent Overseas Command of the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cushny|first=Tom|date=December 1977|title=The Demise of the Legion of Frontiersmen in Africa - North, South, East, West and Central|journal=Military History Journal|volume=4|issue=2|publisher=The South AfricanMilitary History Society|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol042tc.html|accessdate=2008-10-29 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202044739/http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol042tc.html| archivedate= 2 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting enquiry==
In 1924, Belton was at the centre of an investigation concerning allegations of Government corruption in the [[Irish Free State]]. He came to public attention when a letter from him to the Irish [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs|Postmaster General]], [[James Walsh (Irish politician)|J.J Walsh]] was revealed by Walsh. Accusations of impropriety centered around the business relationship between Belton and [[Deputy (legislator)|Deputy]] [[Darrell Figgis]], and Wireless Broadcasting concessions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Irish Television |last=Savage |first=Robert J. |year=1996 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-275-95457-4 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJZdyfyIx_gC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Belton%22|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Belton almost gaining control of the [[Irish Broadcasting Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2Rn and the Origins of Irish Radio|last=Pine|first=Richard|year=2002|publisher=Four Courts Press|isbn=978-1-85182-603-2|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4lZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Andrew+Belton%22&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Belton%22|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Gorham : [https://books.google.com/books?id=cysLAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Forty+Years+Irish+Broadcasting&amp;q=Andrew+Belton&amp;pgis=1#search  ''Forty Years of Irish Broadcasting''] Published for Radio Telefís Éireann [by] Talbot Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing scandal finished Figgis' political career.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23779">An '''artificial intelligence arms race''' is a competition between two or more states to have its military forces equipped with the best "[[artificial intelligence]]" (AI). Since the mid-2010s, many analysts have argued that a such a global arms race for better artificial intelligence has already begun.

Russian General [[Viktor Bondarev]], commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, has stated that as early as February 2017, Russia has been working on AI-guided missiles that can decide to switch targets mid-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia is building a missile that can makes its own decisions|url=http://www.newsweek.com/russia-military-challenge-us-china-missile-own-decisions-639926|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=Newsweek|date=20 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Elon Musk is right about the threat posed by Russian artificial intelligence|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/elon-musk-ai-artificial-intelligence-world-war-three-russia-china-robots-cyber-warfare-replicants-a7931981.html|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=The Independent|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the CEO of Russia's Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that "there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact", and that it is inevitable that "swarms of drones" will one day fly over combat zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia is developing autonomous "swarms of drones" it calls an inevitable part of future warfare|url=http://www.newsweek.com/drones-swarm-autonomous-russia-robots-609399|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=Newsweek|date=15 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such as [[Kalashnikov Concern|Kalashnikov]]'s "neural net" combat module, with a machine gun, a camera, and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Mark|title=Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41035201|accessdate=24 December 2017|work=BBC News|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in 16,000 Russian schools, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] stated "Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind...

According to Elsa Kania of the [[Center for a New American Security]], "China is no longer in a position of technological inferiority but rather sees itself as close to catching up with and overtaking the United States in AI.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18503">An '''autonomous robot''' is a [[robot]] that performs [[Behavior-based robotics|behaviors]] or tasks with a high degree of [[autonomy]]. Autonomous robotics is usually considered to be a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], and [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomous robots are particularly desirable in fields such as [[spaceflight]], household maintenance (such as cleaning), [[waste water treatment]], and delivering goods and services.

Some modern [[factory robot]]s are "autonomous" within the strict confines of their direct environment. It may not be that every [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory [[robot]]'s workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. This can vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view).

One important area of robotics research is to enable the robot to cope with its environment whether this be on land, underwater, in the air, underground, or in [[outer space|space]].

A fully autonomous robot can{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}:
* Gain information about the environment
* Work for an extended period without human intervention
* Move either all or part of itself throughout its operating environment without human assistance
* [[Three Laws of Robotics|Avoid situations that are harmful to people]], property, or itself unless those are part of its design specifications

An autonomous robot may also learn or gain new knowledge like adjusting for new methods of accomplishing its tasks or adapting to changing surroundings.

Like other machines, autonomous robots still require regular maintenance.

== Examples ==

=== Self-maintenance ===
&lt;!-- [[Image:PeopleGuide.jpg|left|thumb|Exteroceptive sensors: 1. blue laser rangefinder senses up to 360 distance readings in a 180-degree slice; 2. 24 round golden ultrasonic sensors sample range readings in a 15-degree cone; 3. ten touch panels along the bottom detect shoes and other low-lying objects. 4. break beams between the lower and upper segments sense tables and other mid-level obstacles.]] --&gt;

The first requirement for complete physical autonomy is the ability for a robot to take care of itself. Many of the battery-powered robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony's ''[[Aibo]]'' are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.

Self-maintenance is based on "proprioception", or sensing one's own internal status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low and it then seeks the charger. Another common proprioceptive sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common proprioceptive sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, as well as the [[Hall effect]] (electric).

[[Image:MobileEyesIntel.jpg|right|thumb|Robot GUI display showing battery voltage and other proprioceptive data in lower right-hand corner. The display is for user information only. Autonomous robots monitor and respond to [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] sensors without human intervention to keep themselves safe and operating properly.]]

=== Sensing the environment ===
Exteroception is sensing things about the environment. Autonomous robots must have a range of environmental sensors to perform their task and stay out of trouble.

*Common exteroceptive sensors include the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], [[sound]], touch, chemical (smell, [[odor]]), temperature, range to various objects, and [[altitude]].

Some robotic lawn mowers will adapt their programming by detecting the speed in which grass grows as needed to maintain a perfectly cut lawn, and some vacuum cleaning robots have dirt detectors that sense how much dirt is being picked up and use this information to tell them to stay in one area longer.

=== Task performance ===
The next step in autonomous behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small vacuuming robots beginning with [[iRobot]] and [[Electrolux]] in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.

The next level of autonomous task performance requires a robot to perform conditional tasks. For instance, security robots can be programmed to detect intruders and respond in a particular way depending upon where the intruder is.

=== Autonomous navigation ===

==== Indoor navigation ====

For a robot to associate behaviors with a place ([[robot localization|localization]]) requires it to know where it is and to be able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based [[triangulation]]. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' [[PatrolBot]] and autonomous wheelchair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activrobots.com/ "Principal Investigator: W. Kennedy"], [[National Institutes of Health]], NIH SBIR 2 R44 HD041781-02&lt;/ref&gt; both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.

At first, autonomous navigation was based on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only sense at one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.

Rather than climb stairs, which requires highly specialized hardware, most indoor robots navigate handicapped-accessible areas, controlling elevators, and electronic doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm "Speci-Minder; see elevator and door access"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053209/http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm |date=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such electronic access-control interfaces, robots can now freely navigate indoors. Autonomously climbing stairs and opening doors manually are topics of research at the current time.

As these indoor techniques continue to develop, vacuuming robots will gain the ability to clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots will be able to cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots' internal maps typically permit "forbidden areas" to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.

==== Outdoor navigation ====

Outdoor autonomy is most easily achieved in the air, since obstacles are rare. [[Cruise missile]]s are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using radio remote control. Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however.  An autonomous ship was announced in 2014—the [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship]]—and is scheduled to make its first operational test in December 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20141117&gt;

Outdoor autonomy is the most difficult for ground vehicles, due to:
* Three-dimensional terrain
* Great disparities in surface density
* Weather exigencies
* Instability of the sensed environment

[[Image:smSeekurMDARS.jpg|thumb|The Seekur and MDARS robots demonstrate their autonomous navigation and security capabilities at an airbase.]]
The Seekur robot was the first commercially available robot to demonstrate MDARS-like capabilities for general use by airports, utility plants, corrections facilities and [[Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293390,00.html "Weapons Makers Unveil New Era of Counter-Terror Equipment"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars rovers MER-A and MER-B (now known as [[Spirit rover]] and [[Opportunity rover]]) can find the position of the sun and navigate their own routes to destinations on the fly by:

* Mapping the surface with 3D vision
* Computing safe and unsafe areas on the surface within that field of vision
* Computing optimal paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving along the calculated route;
* Repeating this cycle until either the destination is reached, or there is no known path to the destination

The planned ESA Rover, ExoMars Rover, is capable of vision based relative localisation and absolute localisation to autonomously navigate safe and efficient trajectories to targets by:

* Reconstructing 3D models of the terrain surrounding the Rover using a pair of stereo cameras
* Determining safe and unsafe areas of the terrain and the general "difficulty" for the Rover to navigate the terrain
* Computing efficient paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving the Rover along the planned path
* Building up a navigation map of all previous navigation data

During the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge in 2016, a rover, named Cataglyphis, successfully demonstrated fully autonomous navigation, decision-making, and sample detection, retrieval, and return capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/feature/2016_sample_return_robot_challenge_award.html|title=NASA Awards $750K in Sample Return Robot Challenge|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2016-09-08|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover relied on a fusion of measurements from inertial sensors, wheel encoders, Lidar, and camera for navigation and mapping, instead of using GPS or magnetometers. During the 2 hour challenge, Cataglyphis traversed over 2.6&amp;nbsp;km and returned five different samples to its starting position.

The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] and [[DARPA Urban Challenge]] have encouraged development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while this has been the demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 as part of the AUVSI [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]].

Between 2013 and 2017, [[Total S.A.]] has held the [[ARGOS Challenge]] to develop the first autonomous robot for oil and gas production sites. The robots had to face adverse outdoor conditions such as rain, wind and extreme temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhanced Safety Thanks to the ARGOS Challenge|url=http://www.total.com/en/media/news/news/enhanced-safety-thanks-argos-challenge?folder=7692|website=Total Website|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open problems in autonomous robotics ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
There are several open problems in autonomous robotics which are special to the field rather than being a part of the general pursuit of AI. According to George A. Bekey's ''Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control'', problems include things such as making sure the robot is able to function correctly and not run into obstacles autonomously.

=== Energy autonomy and foraging ===
Researchers concerned with creating true [[artificial life]] are concerned not only with intelligent control, but further with the capacity of the robot to find its own resources through [[foraging]] (looking for [[food]], which includes both [[energy]] and spare parts).

This is related to '''autonomous foraging''', a concern within the [[science]]s of [[behavioral ecology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[human behavioral ecology]]; as well as [[robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], and [[artificial life]].

== Delivery robot==
A delivery robot is an autonomous robot used for delivering goods. As of February 2017 there were several notable companies developing delivery robots (some with pilot deliveries in progress):

* Starship Technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starship.xyz/|title=Starship|website=www.starship.xyz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/23/ground-based-robots-washington-dc/|title=You Can Have a Robot Deliver Your Groceries If You Live in Washington D.C.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/starship-delivery-robots-trial-washington-dc|title=Starship's autonomous delivery robots are heading to Washington, DC|first=James|last=Temperton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislature===

In March 2016 a bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B21-0673 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2016|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B21-0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was to take place from September 15 through the end of December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/its-official-drone-delivery-is-coming-to-d-c-in-september/|title=It’s official: Drone delivery is coming to D.C. in September|first=Brian|last=Fung|date=24 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B22-0019 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2017|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B22-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 a bill was passed in the US state of [[Virginia]] (the House bill, HB2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate bill, SB1207&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1207&lt;/ref&gt;) that will allow autonomous delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017. The robots will be limited to a maximum speed of 10&amp;nbsp;mph and maximum weight of 50 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14782518/virginia-robot-law-first-state-delivery-starship|title=Virginia is the first state to pass a law allowing robots to deliver straight to your door|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the states of Idaho and Florida there are also talks about passing similar legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/capitol-watch/bill-allowing-robots-to-make-deliveries-heads-to-idaho-house/416300359|title=Could delivery robots be on their way to Idaho?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/01/25/florida-senator-proposes-rules-for-tiny-personal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been discussed that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.

In November 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that companies would need to get a city permit in order to test these robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/san-francisco-just-put-the-brakes-on-delivery-robots/|title=San Francisco Just Put the Brakes on Delivery Robots|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sidewalk delivery robots have been banned from making non-research deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/12/6/16743326/san-francisco-delivery-robot-ban|title=San Francisco bans robots from most sidewalks|last=Brinklow|first=Adam|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Curbed]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barry der Menschenretter''' (1800–1814), also known as '''Barry''', was a dog of a breed which was later called the [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] that worked as a [[Mountain dog|mountain]] [[search and rescue dog|rescue dog]] in Switzerland and Italy for the [[Great St Bernard Hospice]]. He predates the modern St. Bernard, and was lighter built than the modern breed. He has been described as the most famous St. Bernard, as he was credited with saving more than 40 lives during his lifetime, hence his byname {{lang|de|Menschen[[wikt:Retter#German|retter]]}} meaning "people rescuer" in German.

The legend surrounding him was that he was killed while attempting a rescue; however, this is untrue. Barry retired to [[Bern]], Switzerland and after his death his body was passed into the care of the [[Natural History Museum of Bern]]. His skin has been preserved through [[taxidermy]] although his skull was modified in 1923 to match the Saint Bernard of that time period. His story and name have been used in literary works, and a monument to him stands in the [[Cimetière des Chiens]] near Paris. At the hospice, one dog has always been named Barry in his honor; and since 2004, the Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard has been set up to take over the responsibility for breeding dogs from the hospice.

==History==
[[File:Grand St-Bernard.jpg|thumb|left|The Great St Bernard Hospice]]
The first mention in the Great St Bernard Hospice archives of a dog was in 1707 which simply said "A dog was buried by us."&lt;ref name="fleischli16"&gt;[[#fleischli|Fleischli (2006)]]: p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The dogs are thought to have been introduced to the monastery as watchdogs at some point between 1660 and 1670.&lt;ref name="fleischli16"/&gt; Old skulls from the collection of the Natural History Museum of Bern show that at least two types of dog lived at the hospice.&lt;ref name="dogshospice"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dogs from the Hospice|url=http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_5.html|work=Naturhisorishches Museum Der Burgergemeinde Bern|accessdate=20 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909020744/http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_5.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1800, the year that Barry was born, it was known that a special kind of dog was being used for rescue work in the pass.&lt;ref name="fleischli16"/&gt; This general variety of dog was known as a Küherhund, or cowherd's dog.&lt;ref name=museum /&gt;

Measurements of his preserved body show that Barry was smaller than the modern Saint Bernard, weighing between {{convert|40|and|45|kg|lb}} whereas modern Bernards weigh between {{convert|80|and|130|kg|lb}}. His current mounted height is approximately {{convert|64|cm|in}}, but the living Barry would have been slightly smaller.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legendary Barry at the Natural History Museum|url=http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_9.html|work=Naturhisorisches Museum Der Burgergemeinde Bern|accessdate=20 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907194857/http://www.nmbe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_9.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Barry's career, he was credited with saving the lives of more than forty people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blumberg|first=Jess|title=A Brief History of the St. Bernard Rescue Dog|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/st-bernard-200801.html|publisher=Smithstonian.org|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this number has sometimes varied over the years.&lt;ref name=dogbook /&gt; Barry's most famous rescue was that of a young boy.

===Death===
There is a plaque on a monument in the [[Cimetière des Chiens]] [[pet cemetery]] which states, "{{lang|fr|Il sauva la vie à 40 personnes.

Barry was searching for the soldier and had picked up the scent, some forty-eight hours old, and finally stopped before a large bank of ice. He dug until he reached the soldier, and then licked him as he was trained. The Swiss soldier awoke startled and mistook Barry for a [[wolf]] and fatally stabbed him with his [[bayonet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=H.T.|title=Dog Heroes of the Valley of Death|journal=Popular Mechanics|date=December 1931|volume=56|issue=6|page=901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-IDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA898&amp;dq=barry+st+bernard&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9baXTPzSO4f44AbFr9iaBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=barry%20st%20bernard&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Watson in his 1906 work ''The Dog Book'' attributed the rumour to fellow author Idstone, also known as Reverend [[Thomas Pearce (priest)|Thomas Pearce]].&lt;ref name="dogbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=James|title=The Dog Book|year=1906|publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company|page=575|url=https://archive.org/stream/dogbookpopularhi02wats#page/n347/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until 1865 when the term "St. Bernard" was first used primarily for the breed.&lt;ref name="fleischli19"&gt;[[#fleischli|Fleischli (2006)]]: p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fleischli20"&gt;[[#fleischli|Fleischli (2006)]]: p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Under this name, the St. Bernard has been recognised since 1880 by the Swiss Kennel Club.&lt;ref name="gentle" /&gt;
[[File:Barry.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Barry with a small child.]]
Barry is described as the most famous St. Bernard by the [[Natural History Museum of Bern]]. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]] for the museum,&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; while the rest of his body was buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Dog of the Convent of St. Bernard|journal=The Monthly Magazine|date=February 1821|volume=51|issue=1|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=barry+st+bernard&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GumXTO2WLJD84Ab_t73xAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&amp;q=barry%20st%20bernard&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A [[barrel]] was added hanging from his [[Dog collar|collar]],&lt;ref name=museum /&gt; following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Edwin Landseer]]'s work ''Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=John|title=The Book of General Ignorance|year=2007|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=978-0-307-39491-0|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced.&lt;ref name="bibmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography|url=http://www-nmbe.unibe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_10.html|work=Naturhisorisches Museum Der Burgergemeinde Bern|accessdate=26 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017152918/http://www-nmbe.unibe.ch/deutsch/531_5_1_10.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the [[Cimetière des Chiens]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Les locataires du cimetière|url=http://www.asnieres-sur-seine.fr/Tourisme-international/Patrimoine/Le-cimetiere-des-animaux|work=Asnieres-sur-Seine.fr|language=French|accessdate=21 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214243/http://www.asnieres-sur-seine.fr/Tourisme-international/Patrimoine/Le-cimetiere-des-animaux|archivedate=25 September 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until September 2004, 18 dogs still belonged to the hospice at any one time. The Foundation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard was established to create kennels in [[Martigny]], a village further down the pass, to take over the breeding of St. Bernard puppies from the friars at the hospice. Around 20 puppies per year are born at the foundation. In 2009, the St. Bernard Dog Museum was opened at the Foundation in Martigny and – to commemorate the occasion – Barry's remains were lent from the museum in Bern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maurer|first=Urs|title=Legendary St Bernard rescue dogs find a home|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Legendary_St_Bernard_dogs_find_a_home.html?cid=5373762|accessdate=26 September 2010|newspaper=swissinfo.ch|date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each summer, the foundation leads dogs up the pass when it is open to the hospice, mainly for tourists, with rescue efforts on the pass now conducted by [[helicopter]]s.&lt;ref name="gentle"&gt;{{cite web|title=St Bernard – Gentle Giants|url=http://www.dogsmonthly.co.uk/breed-features/st-bernard-gentle-giants/|work=Dogs Monthly Magazine|accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2013, at least 23 students died and dozens more fell ill at a primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman in the [[Saran district]] of the [[India|Indian]] state of [[Bihar]] after eating a [[Midday Meal Scheme|Midday Meal]] contaminated with pesticide.&lt;ref name=BBC2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimesOfIndia /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt; Angered by the deaths and illnesses, villagers took to the streets in many parts of the district in violent protest.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Subsequently, the Bihar government took a series of steps to prevent any recurrence of such incidents.&lt;ref name=bp1/&gt;

== Background ==
Across India, the [[Midday Meal Scheme]] provides roughly 120 million children with free lunch, making it the world's largest school lunch program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=17 July 2013|first=Soutik|last=Biswas|title=Why India's school meal deaths are a terrible tragedy|work=[[BBC News]]|location=London|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-23339206|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of corruption involved in implementing the scheme, it aims to fight widespread poverty and improve children's school attendance and health as a large number of India's children suffer from malnutrition.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Corruption, poor quality taint India school meal scheme |date=19 July 2013|first1=Sunrita|last1=Sen|first2=Doreen|last2=Fiedler |work=[[Business Recorder]] |location=Karachi|url=http://www.brecorder.com/articles-a-letters/187/1212787/|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihar in northern India is among the nation's poorest states.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; According to [[Mashrakh]] residents, students have suffered from food poisoning after eating school lunches on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; P. K. Shahi, [[Bihar]]'s education minister, said complaints about food quality were not uncommon but there had been no reported incidents of widespread food poisoning during his tenure.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; The nonprofit [[Hare Krishna Food for Life|Iskcon Food Relief Foundation]] describes the meal programmes in Bihar and neighbouring [[Uttar Pradesh]] as "the worst in India." Public health is poor in general, with most water sources contaminated, and hospitals underfunded.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

The primary school in the village of Dharmashati Gandaman was established in 2010. At the time of the incident, 89 children were registered with the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nine children die after mid-day meal in Bihar school|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nine-children-die-after-midday-meal-in-bihar-school/article4921193.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai|date=16 July 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The food material for midday meals was stored at the house of the headmistress as the school did not have sufficient infrastructure.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

== Incident ==
On 16 July 2013, children aged between four and twelve years at the Dharmashati Gandaman primary school complained that their lunch, served as a part of the Midday Meal Scheme, tasted odd.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Contaminated Lunches Kill 22 Children in India|first1=Gardiner|last1=Harris|first2=Hari|last2=Kumar|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/world/asia/children-die-from-tainted-lunches-at-indian-school.html|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who questioned the food were rebuked by the headmistress.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Earlier, headmistress Meena Kumari had been informed by the school's cook that the new cooking oil was discoloured and smelled odd.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Kumari replied that the oil was purchased at a local grocery store and safe to use.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Contaminated school meal kills 25 Indian children|work=[[Reuters]]|location=New York City|date=17 July 2013|first1=Annie|last=Banerji|first2=Mayank|last2=Bhardwaj|first3=Anurag|last3=Kotoky|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/17/us-india-chidren-poison-idUSBRE96G0AY20130717|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; The cook, who was also hospitalized by the poisoning, later told reporters that it looked like there was "an accumulation of residual waste at the bottom [of the oil jar]".&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; The meal cooked at the school that day consisted of soya beans, rice and potato curry.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt;

Thirty minutes after eating the meal the children complained of stomach pain and soon after were taken ill with [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhoea]]. The number of sick children overwhelmed the school and local medical system. Some of the sick children were sent home, forcing their parents to seek help on their own.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; According to the official count, 23 children died as a result of the contaminated food.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; Parents and local villagers said at least 27 had died.&lt;ref name=TimesOfIndia /&gt; Sixteen children died on site, and four others were declared dead upon arrival at the local hospital. Others died in hospital. Among the dead were two children of a female cook, Panna Devi; her third child survived.&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite news|title=Death toll rises to 22|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/death-toll-rises-to-22/article4924937.ece|work=[[The Hindu]]|location=Chennai|accessdate=17 July 2013|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sick&gt;{{cite news|title=At least 23 more Indian children treated after getting sick at school lunch|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/19/world/asia/india-school-meal-poisoning|accessdate=20 July 2013|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta|date=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 48 students fell ill from the contaminated food. Three remained in a critical condition as of 17 July.&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; Thirty-one children were moved from the local hospital to [[Patna Medical College Hospital]] (PMCH) for further treatment.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

== Cause ==
Initial indications were that the food was contaminated by an [[organophosphate]], a class of chemicals commonly found in [[insecticide]]s.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/17/world/asia/india-school-meal-poisoning/index.html|title=School meals tainted with poison kill 22 children in Indian village|first1=Aloke|last1=Devichand|first2=Tim|last2=Hume|work=[[CNN]]|location=Atlanta|date=17 July 2013|accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local government administrator commented "It appears to be a case of poisoning but we will have to wait for forensic reports&amp;nbsp;... Had it been a case of natural food poisoning, so many children would not have died."&lt;ref name=Reuters /&gt; Dr. Amar Kant Jha, superintendent of [[Patna Medical College and Hospital]] in [[Patna]], said that the survivors were emitting toxic vapours, which led his team to suspect almost immediately that they had been poisoned by an organophosphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=204422677|title=Police hunt for principal after Indian school lunch deaths|last=McCarthy|first=Julie|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late on 17 July, officials stated that they believed the cooking oil had been placed in a container formerly used to store insecticides.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; According to state officials, the school’s headmistress had bought the cooking oil used in the food from a grocery store owned by her husband.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; On 20 July police said that a forensic report confirmed the cooking oil contained "very toxic" levels of [[monocrotophos]], an agricultural pesticide.&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news|title=India school lunch deaths: high pesticide levels found|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-23390972|work=[[BBC News]]|location=London|date=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=India school lunch deaths: pesticide found|date=20 July 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/20/india-school-meal-deaths-bihar-pesticide|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen of the children's bodies were buried on or near school grounds in protest.

== Education and early career ==
Maris graduated with a highest honors with a degree in neuroscience from Middlebury College.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Maris' background includes research at the [[Duke University Medical Center]] Department of Neurobiology. He has a degree in neuroscience from [[Middlebury College]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://charlierose.com/videos/17854 The Disruptive Ideas of Google Ventures] - Charlie Rose with Bill Maris and Kevin Rose, October 2012 (broadcast)&lt;/ref&gt; Maris began his career as a biotechnology and healthcare portfolio manager for Swedish investment firm [[Investor AB]]. In 1997, Maris founded one of the first Web hosting companies, Burlee.com, and built the company's original computing, network and technological infrastructure after teaching himself to code from books purchased at the local Barnes &amp; Noble. Burlee was subsequently acquired by Interland, Inc. and renamed [[Web.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2011/09/01/the-education-of-bill-maris-how-one-entrepreneurs-history-shaped-google-ventures/|title=The Education of Bill Maris: How One Entrepreneur's History Shaped Google Ventures {{!}} Xconomy|date=2011-09-01|newspaper=Xconomy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burlee.com was merged with Interland in 2002.  Maris remained with the company until 2003.  Interland subsequently changed its name to Web.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.web.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=268690|title=Interland Completes Acquisition of Web.com Assets: Assets Include Web.com Domain, Web Hosting Accounts, Registrar Business; Interland Announces Plans to Change Name to Web.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:WEB)|website=ir.web.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maris was a portfolio manager at Investor AB in 1997. It was on a business trip to Investor's headquarters in Stockholm where Maris was inspired to found Burlee.com after seeing a rack of servers in a closet which housed the company's email and web site.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Career ==
In the mid 2000s, Maris partnered with entrepreneur [[David Green (social entrepreneur)|David Green]] to transfer a novel hydrophobic acrylic lens to Aurolab to cure cataract blindness in the developing world, where it has been used in more than 30 million patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schwabfound.org/content/david-green|title=David Green {{!}} Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship|website=www.schwabfound.org|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maris founded GV, formerly Google Ventures, in 2008 as the venture capital investment arm of [[Google Inc]]. He was responsible for the fund's strategy and management, and oversaw $3.0 billion in investments in technology and the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/technology/venture-capital-blends-more-data-crunching-into-choice-of-targets.html?pagewanted=all Google Ventures Stresses Science of Deal, Not Art of the Deal] - New York Times, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Maris was one of the first to cite the troubles with [[Theranos]], the troubled Silicon Valley blood testing company.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Maris founded [[Calico (company)|Calico]], a multibillion-dollar company whose mission is to understand and influence the genetic basis of aging. Google funded the company after Maris pitched the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2013/10/09/new-details-on-googles-anti-aging-startup/|title=New details on Google's anti-aging startup|date=2013-10-09|website=Fortune|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/19/4748594/understanding-calico-larry-page-google-ventures-and-the-quest-for|title=Understanding Calico: Larry Page, Google Ventures, and the quest for immortality|last=Popper|first=Ben|date=2013-09-19|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage/posts/Lh8SKC6sED1|title=I'm excited to announce Calico, a new company that will focus on health and…|website=plus.google.com|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview, Maris stated that health care breakthroughs can significantly improve the quality and duration of human lifespan across the globe, and that he is looking to invest in promising biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooker|first1=Katrina|title=Google Ventures and the Search for Immortality|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/google-ventures-bill-maris-investing-in-idea-of-living-to-500|accessdate=9 April 2015|date=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maris was also the Vice President of Special Projects at Google, where he was heavily involved in [[X (company)|Google X]], [[Verily Life Sciences|Verily]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Bio-inspired robotic locomotion''' is a fairly new subcategory of bio-inspired design. It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them to the design of real-world engineered systems. More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by [[Biology|biological]] systems. [[Biomimicry]] and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused. Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature. Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called [[soft robotics]]. The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat. However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality. Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field. The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest. Bio-inspired [[roboticists]] are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. [[eye]]), bioactuators (e.g. [[muscle]]), or biomaterials (e.g. [[spider silk]]). Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system. Thus, in this article different modes of [[animal locomotion]] and few examples of the corresponding bio-inspired robots are introduced.

==Biolocomotion==
Biolocomotion or animal locomotion is usually categorized as below:

===Locomotion on a surface===
Locomotion on a surface may include [[terrestrial locomotion]] and [[arboreal locomotion]]. We will specifically discuss about [[terrestrial locomotion]] in detail in the next section.

[[Image:Big-eared-townsend-fledermaus.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Big eared townsend bat (''Corynorhinus townsendii'')]]

===Locomotion in a fluid===
Locomotion in a blood stream [[heart failure|swimming]] and [[flying and gliding animals|flying]]. There are many [[Aquatic locomotion|swimming]] and [[flying and gliding animals|flying]] robots designed and built by roboticists.&lt;ref name="flyingbot"&gt;R. Fearing, S. Avadhanula, D. Campolo, M. Sitti, J. Jan, and R. Wood, "A micromechanical flying insect thorax," Neurotechnology for Biomimetic Robots, pp. 469–480, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimmingbot"&gt;G. Dudek, M. Jenkin, C. Prahacs, A. Hogue, J. Sattar, P. Giguere, A. German, H. Liu, S. Saun- derson, A. Ripsman, et al., "A visually guided swimming robot," in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS, pp. 3604–3609, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swimmingbot2"&gt;A. Alessi, A. Sudano, D. Accoto, E. Guglielmelli, "Development of an autonomous robotic fish," In Biomedical Robotics and Biomechatronics (BioRob), 2012 4th IEEE RAS &amp; EMBS International Conference on (pp. 1032-1037). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral classification (terrestrial locomotion)==
There are many animal and insects moving on land with or without legs. We will discuss legged and limbless locomotion in this section as well as climbing and jumping. Anchoring the feet is fundamental to locomotion on land. The ability to increase traction is important for slip-free motion on surfaces such as smooth rock faces and ice, and is especially critical for moving uphill. Numerous biological mechanisms exist for providing purchase: claws rely upon friction-based mechanisms; gecko feet upon van der walls forces; and some insect feet upon fluid-mediated adhesive forces.&lt;ref name="animal locomotion"&gt;R. M. Alexander, Principles of animal locomotion. Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rhex.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhex: a Reliable Hexapedal Robot]]

===Legged locomotion===
Legged robots may have one,&lt;ref name="hoppingrobot"&gt;M. H. Raibert, H. B. Brown, "Experiments in balance with a 2D one-legged hopping machine," ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement, and Control, pp75-81, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1leg"&gt;M. Ahmadi and M. Buehler, "Stable control of a simulated one-legged running robot with hip and leg compliance," IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 96– 104, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1leg_2"&gt;P. Gregorio, M. Ahmadi, and M. Buehler, "Design, control, and energetics of an electrically actuated legged robot," IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, vol. 27, no. 4, pp. 626–634, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; two,&lt;ref name="2leg"&gt;R. Niiyama, A. Nagakubo, and Y. Kuniyoshi, "Mowgli: A bipedal jumping and landing robot with an artificial musculoskeletal system," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2546–2551, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; four,&lt;ref name="4leg"&gt;M. Raibert, K. Blankespoor, G. Nelson, R. Playter, et al., "Bigdog, the rough-terrain quadruped robot," in Proceedings of the 17th World Congress, pp. 10823–10825, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; six,&lt;ref name="Rhex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isprawl1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isprawl2"/&gt; or many legs&lt;ref name="manyleg"&gt;S. Wakimoto, K. Suzumori, T. Kanda, et al., "A bio-mimetic amphibious soft cord robot," Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers Part C, vol. 18, no. 2, pp. 471–477, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the application. One of the main advantages of using legs instead of wheels is moving on uneven environment more effectively. [[Bipedalism|Bipedal]], [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], and hexapedal locomotion are among the most favorite types of legged locomotion in the field of bio-inspired robotics. [[Rhex]], a Reliable Hexapedal robot&lt;ref name="Rhex"&gt;U. Saranli, M. Buehler, and D. Koditschek, "Rhex: A simple and highly mobile hexapod robot," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 20, no. 7, pp. 616–631, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cheetah&lt;ref name="Cheetah"&gt;Y. Li, B. Li, J. Ruan, and X. Rong, "Research of mammal bionic quadruped robots: A review," in Robotics, IEEE Conference on Automation and Mechatronics, pp. 166–171, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  are the two fastest running robots so far. iSprawl is another hexapedal robot inspired by [[cockroach]] locomotion that has been developed at Stanford University.&lt;ref name="isprawl1"&gt;J. Clark, J. Cham, S. Bailey, E. Froehlich, P. Nahata, M. Cutkosky, et al., "Biomimetic design and fabrication of a hexapedal running robot," in Robotics and Automation, 2001. Proceedings 2001 ICRA. IEEE International Conference on, vol. 4, pp. 3643–3649, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This robot can run up to 15 body length per second and can achieve speeds of up to 2.3&amp;nbsp;m/s. The original version of this robot was pneumatically driven while the new generation uses a single electric motor for locomotion.&lt;ref name="isprawl2"&gt;S. Kim, J. Clark, and M. Cutkosky, "isprawl: Design and tuning for high-speed autonomous open-loop running," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 25, no. 9, pp. 903– 912, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limbless locomotion===
Terrain involving topography over a range of length scales can be challenging for most organisms and biomimetic robots. Such terrain are easily passed over by limbless organisms such as snakes. Several animals and insects including [[worm]]s, [[snail]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, and [[snake]]s are capable of limbless locomotion. A review of snake-like robots is presented by Hirose et al.&lt;ref name="snakebook"&gt;S. Hirose, P. Cave, and C. Goulden, Biologically inspired robots: snake- like locomotors and manipulators, vol. 64. Oxford University Press Oxford, UK, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; These robots can be categorized as robots with passive or active wheels, robots with active treads, and undulating robots using vertical waves or linear expansions. Most snake-like robots use wheels, which are high in friction when moving side to side but low in friction when rolling forward (and can be prevented from rolling backward). The majority of snake-like robots use either [[Undulatory locomotion|lateral undulation]] or [[rectilinear locomotion]] and have difficulty climbing vertically. Choset has recently developed a modular robot that can mimic several snake gaits, but it cannot perform [[Concertina movement|concertina motion]].&lt;ref name="snakebot1"&gt;R. Hatton and H. Choset, "Generating gaits for snake robots: annealed chain fitting and keyframe wave extraction," Autonomous Robots, vol. 28, no. 3, pp. 271–281, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at Georgia Tech have recently developed two snake-like robots called Scalybot.

===Climbing===
Climbing is an especially difficult task because mistakes made by the climber may cause the climber to lose its grip and fall. Most robots have been built around a single functionality observed in their biological counterparts. Geckobots&lt;ref name="geckobot"&gt;O. Unver, A. Uneri, A. Aydemir, and M. Sitti, "Geckobot: a gecko inspired climbing robot using elastomer adhesives," in International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 2329–2335, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; typically use van der waals forces that work only on smooth surfaces.

Legged climbing robots have several limitations. They cannot handle large obstacles since they are not flexible and they require a wide space for moving. They usually cannot climb both smooth and rough surfaces or handle vertical to horizontal transitions as well.

===Jumping===
One of the tasks commonly performed by a variety of living organisms is [[jumping]]. [[Bharal]], [[hares]], [[kangaroo]], [[grasshopper]], [[flea]], and [[locust]] are among the best jumping animals. A miniature 7g jumping robot inspired by [[locust]] has been developed at EPFL that can jump up to 138&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="jumpingbot"&gt;M. Kovac, M. Fuchs, A. Guignard, J. Zufferey, and D. Floreano, "A miniature 7g jumping robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, pp. 373–378, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The jump event is induced by releasing the tension of a spring. The highest jumping miniature robot is inspired by the locust, weighs 23 grams with its highest jump to 365 cm is "TAUB" (Tel-Aviv University and Braude College of engineering).&lt;ref name="TAUB"&gt;V. Zaitsev, O. Gvirsman, U. Ben Hanan, A. Weiss, A. Ayali and G. Kosa, "A locust-inspired miniature jumping robot," in Bioinspiration &amp; biomimetics, 10(6), p.066012.&lt;/ref&gt; It uses torsion springs as energy storage and includes a wire and latch mechanism to compress and release the springs. ETH Zurich has reported a soft jumping robot based on the combustion of [[methane]] and [[laughing gas]].&lt;ref name="combustion-driven soft robot"&gt;M. Loepfe, C.M. Schumacher, U.B. Lustenberger, and W.J. Stark, "An Untethered, Jumping Roly-Poly Soft Robot Driven by Combustion," Soft Robotics, Vol. 2, No. 1, pp. 33-41, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermal gas expansion inside the soft combustion chamber drastically increases the chamber volume. This causes the 2&amp;nbsp;kg robot to jump up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm. The soft robot inspired by a [[roly-poly toy]] then reorientates itself into an upright position after landing.

=== Swimming (piscine) ===
It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a [[Marine propulsion|propulsive]] efficiency greater than 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk/Research/oceans/people/Michael_Sfakiotakis/IEEEJOE_99.pdf|author=Sfakiotakis|date=1999|title=Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion|publisher=IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering|accessdate=2007-10-24|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926175113/http://www.ece.eps.hw.ac.uk/Research/oceans/people/Michael_Sfakiotakis/IEEEJOE_99.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-26|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance.

[[File:ISplash Robotic Fish.jpg|thumb|Robotic Fish: ''iSplash''-II]]
In 2014 ''iSplash''-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof. Huosheng Hu at Essex University. It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isplash-robotics.com/|title=High-Speed Robotic Fish {{!}} iSplash|website=isplash-robot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/hhu/Papers/IEEE-IROS-2014-1080-1086.pdf|publisher=Robotics Group at Essex University|title=iSplash-II: Realizing Fast Carangiform Swimming to Outperform a Real Fish|accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first build, ''iSplash''-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length [[Fish locomotion|carangiform]] swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/hhu/Papers/IEEE-ICRA-2014-322-327.pdf|publisher=Robotics Group at Essex University|title=iSplash-I: High Performance Swimming Motion of a Carangiform Robotic Fish with Full-Body Coordination|accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphological classification==

===Modular===
[[Image:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Honda Asimo: A Humanoid robot]]
The modular robots are typically capable of performing several tasks and are specifically useful for search and rescue or exploratory missions. Some of the featured robots in this category include a [[salamander]] inspired robot developed at EPFL that can walk and swim,&lt;ref name="salamander robot"&gt;A. J. Ijspeert, A. Crespi, D. Ryczko and J.-M. Cabelguen, "From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model," Science, vol. 315, num. 5817, p. 1416-1420, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[snake]] inspired robot developed at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] that has four different modes of terrestrial locomotion,&lt;ref name="snakebot1"/&gt; and a [[cockroach]] inspired robot can run and climb on a variety of complex terrain.&lt;ref name="Rhex"/&gt;

===Humanoid===
Humanoid robots are robots that look human-like or are inspired by the human form. There are many different types of humanoid robots for applications such as personal assistance, reception, work at industries, or companionship. These type of robots are used for research purposes as well and were originally developed to build better orthosis and prosthesis for human beings. Petman is one of the first and most advanced humanoid robots developed at Boston Dynamics. Some of the humanoid robots such as Honda Asimo are over actuated.&lt;ref name="hondahumanoid"&gt;K. Hirer, M. Hirose, Y. Haikawa, and T. Takenaka, "The development of honda humanoid robot," in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, vol. 2, pp. 1321–1326, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there are some humanoid robots like the robot developed at Cornell University that do not have any actuators and walk passively descending a shallow slope.&lt;ref name="passivewalking"&gt;S. Collins, M. Wisse, and A. Ruina, "A three-dimensional passive-dynamic walking robot with two legs and knees," The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 20, no. 7, pp. 607–615, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swarming===
[[Collective animal behavior|The collective behavior of animals]] has been of interest to researchers for several years. [[Ant]]s can make structures like rafts to survive on the rivers. [[Fish]] can sense their environment more effectively in large groups. [[Swarm robotics]] is a fairly new field and the goal is to make robots that can work together and transfer the data, make structures as a group, etc.&lt;ref name="swarmrobotic"&gt;E. S ̧ahin, "Swarm robotics: From sources of inspiration to domains of application," Swarm Robotics, pp. 10–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''birthing chair''', also known as a '''birth chair''', is a device that is shaped to assist a woman in the physiological upright posture during [[childbirth]]. It is intended to provide balance and support. If backless, it is known as a birth stool.

The early birthing chairs varied between having three or four legs, though three legged birthing chairs are most commonly seen.&lt;ref name=Carson&gt;Carson, Amanda. Birth Chairs, Midwives, and Medicine. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 1999.5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both styles support the bottom of the women in labor and often have a slender, sloped back for comfort and to allow [[Midwifery|birthing assistants]], who are positioned behind the mother in labor, to massage or support her. Often the arms of the chair have hand holds or arm rests for the mother to grip, providing extra leverage. Birthing chairs are usually 8 to 10 inches (20.32 centimeters- 25.4 centimeters) off the ground specifically to allow laboring women to brace their feet against the ground to help in pushing.&lt;ref name=Carson/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Obstetrics#History}}

[[File:Birthing Chair.jpg|thumb|upright|Birthing chair]]
The birthing chair has been used for millennia. Birthing chairs took the place of laboring mothers sitting on birth attendant’s laps, as it was the previous practice. These chairs were used before male physicians dominated the delivery room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1449803 | pmid=12604487 | volume=93 | issue=3 | title=Early modern childbirth | year=2003 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=432 |vauthors=Fee E, Brown TM, Beatty RL | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.432}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the birthing chair or similar devices has been seen around the globe, not isolated to a particular region. The birthing chair can be traced to [[Egypt]] in the year 1450 B.C.E. Pictured on the walls of The Birth House at Luxor, Egypt, is an Egyptian queen giving birth on a stool. It can also be traced to [[Greece]] in 200 B.C as it is featured on an ancient Grecian sculpted votive.&lt;ref name=Carson/&gt;

[[File:Naissance en Alsace-Musée alsacien de Strasbourg (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wooden birthing chair]]
[[Celts|Celtic]] items from 100 B.C.E in Britain also depict women sitting in the same upright position as if in a birthing chair. Birthing chairs fell out of use after physicians began using the flat bed for women to lie on during delivery. A woman giving birth in the upright position has been seen in Asian, African, Pacific Islander, and Native American art.  The concept of the birthing chair has also been written in observations by anthropologist as well as missionaries.&lt;ref name=Carson/&gt;

==In modern times==
[[File:Romarad.jpg|thumb|Modern birthing chair]]
As of the 1980s the birthing chair has been making a comeback in the modern medicine of childbirth. Some expecting mothers have reverted to the birthing chair for its upright position because it allows gravity to assist in the expulsion of the baby. Studies have shown that the birthing chair speeds up the time of delivery and increases comfort" for expecting mothers. The position of the birthing chair allows muscles(including vaginal and abdominal as well as those in the back, stomach, legs, and arms) used in [[childbirth]] to work to efficiency. Since the 1980s many hospitals have begun installing birthing chairs due to the large number of inquiries about them.&lt;ref&gt;Otten M.D, Carl . "Rebirth of the Birthing Chair." Saturday Evening Post. 254.1 (1982): 69. Web. 28 Feb. 2013. &lt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=17928982&amp;site=ehost-live&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern birthing chair/stool can be made of many different materials including PVC inflatables such as the '''CUB support''', plastic such as the '''Kaya stool''' and '''padded wooden stools'''. More recently birthing chairs/stools have been made to accommodate several upright positions such as [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[All fours (human position)|all fours]], [[kneeling]] and [[sitting]], and are used as supports not necessarily as chairs or stools. Research suggests that '''being upright during labour''' can have many '''[[Childbirth positions|positive benefits for mother and baby]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Child birth in squatting position Ayesha Nasir, K.J. Noorani, Razia Korejo Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Using a modern-day birthing chair/stool/support can aid a woman in having an upright birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lawrence A, Lewis L, Hofmeyr GJ, Dowswell T, Styles C | year = 2013 | title = Maternal positions and mobility during first stage labour | url = | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | issue = | page = CD003934 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003934.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bobbie the Wonder Dog''' (1921–1927) was a dog who covered  {{convert|2551|mi}} on his own to return home to [[Silverton, Oregon]] after he was lost while his owners were visiting family in [[Wolcott, Indiana]].&lt;ref name="Brazier"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.silvertonor.com/murals/bobbie/bobbie_wonder_dog2.htm |title= Bobbie - The Wonder Dog of Oregon |first= G. F. |last=Brazier |work= Animal Pals |editor= Wager-Smith, Curtis |year= 1924 |location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |publisher= Macrae Smith Company |at= City of Silverton, Oregon |accessdate= March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's]] estimated the journey may have been as long as {{convert|3000|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silvertonbobbie.com/Photos.html#7 |title=Bobbie, the Prodigal Dog |format=photo array/cartoon |publisher=[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]] |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In August 1923, while on a family road trip in Indiana, Frank and Elizabeth Brazier, with their daughters Leona and Nova, were visiting relatives in [[Wolcott,  Indiana]]. Their two-year-old [[Scotch Collie]]/[[English Shepherd]] mix dog Bobbie was attacked by three other dogs and ran away. After an exhaustive search, the heartbroken Brazier family were unable to find Bobbie and continued their trip before returning home to Oregon, expecting never to see their dog again.

==Journey home ==
In February 1924, six months later, Bobbie returned to Silverton mangy, dirty,  and scrawny, with his toenails worn down to nothing. He showed all the signs of having walked the entire distance, including swimming rivers and crossing the Continental Divide during the coldest part of winter.&lt;ref name=oe&gt;{{Oregon Encyclopedia|bobbie_the_wonder_dog|Bobbie the Wonder Dog|author=Stelljes, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his ordeal, he crossed at least {{convert|2551|mi|km}} of plains, desert, and mountains in the winter to return home, an average of approximately {{convert|14|mi|km}} per day. After his return to Silverton, he experienced a meteoric rise to fame. His story drew national attention and was featured in numerous newspapers.&lt;ref name = john/&gt;

He was the subject of newspaper articles including ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'', books, and film.&lt;ref name=oe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silvertonbobbie.com/Photos.html#7 |title=Bobbie, the Prodigal Dog |format=photo array/cartoon |publisher=[[Ripley's Believe it or Not]] |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbie played himself in the 1924 [[silent film]] ''The Call of the West''.&lt;ref name=oe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19240711&amp;id=bl0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1458,2064310 |title= Bobbie the Wonder Dog in ''The Call of the West'' |date= July 11, 1924 |work= [[The Register-Guard]] |accessdate= March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received hundreds of letters from people around the world and was honored with a jewel-studded harness and collar, ribbons, and [[key to the city|keys to cities]].&lt;ref name=oe/&gt;

People who had fed and sheltered Bobbie on his journey wrote the family to tell about their time with Bobbie. The Humane Society of Portland was able to use these stories to assemble a relatively precise description of the route Bobbie took.&lt;ref name = john&gt;John, Finn J.D.  [http://offbeatoregon.com/o1101a-bobbie-the-wonder-dog-put-silverton-on-map.html “Wonder Dog’s” 2,500-mile odyssey put Silverton on the map] January 2, 2011 offbeatoregon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The humane society concluded that after returning to Wolcott and unable to find his owners, Bobbie initially followed their further travels into northeast Indiana. He then struck out in several directions, apparently seeking their scent. He eventually headed west.&lt;ref name = john/&gt;

During their original trip, the Braziers had parked their car in a service station each night. Their dog visited each of these stops on his journey, along with a number of homes, and a hobo camp.&lt;ref name = john/&gt;
 
In Portland, an Irish woman took care of him for a period of time when she found he had been injured, leaving his legs and paws gashed.&lt;ref name = john/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Upon his death in 1927, he was buried with honors at the [[Oregon Humane Society|Oregon Humane Society's]] [[pet cemetery]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. A week later, German Shepherd film star [[Rin Tin Tin]] laid a wreath at his grave.&lt;ref name="Brazier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=oe/&gt; His grave is sheltered by a "fancy white and red dog house" received during a promotional appearance at the Portland Home Show.&lt;ref name="Brazier"/&gt; The gravestone has been moved outside the house for better viewing.&lt;ref name="roadside"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/14881 |title=Grave of Bobbie the Wonder Dog Portland |publisher= Roadside America  |accessdate= March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobbie's demonstration of loyalty is celebrated during Silverton's annual children's pet parade that serves as a reminder of the special place animals and pets have in people's lives. The event was started several years after Bobbie's death and the first parade was led by his son, Pal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sunset.com/travel/northwest/silverton-travel-00418000067498/ |title=Oregon Day Trip: Silverton |last=Hauser |first=Susan |journal=Sunset |date=May 2010 |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} outdoor painting featuring Bobbie's story is part of a series of murals that decorate the walls of businesses in Silverton.&lt;ref name=Walls&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.oregonlive.com/terryrichard/2008/03/silverton.html |title= Silverton wears its history on its walls |last= Richard |first= Terry |date= March 21, 2008 |work= [[The Oregonian]] |accessdate= March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2012, responding to public sentiment that his burial location in Portland did not properly honor his story and his connection to his hometown, a grassroots movement was started by a group of Silvertonians with the goal of repatriating Bobbie's remains to Silverton, for reburial and memorialization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bringbobbiehome.com/ Bring Bobbie Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''chapelle ardente''''' ([[French language|Fr.]] "burning chapel") is a chapel or room in which the corpse of a sovereign or other exalted personage lies in state pending the [[funeral]] service. The name is in allusion to the many candles which are lighted round the [[catafalque]]. This custom is first chronicled as occurring at the obsequies of [[Dagobert I]] (602–638).

'''Dean Johnson''' (1961–2007) was a cross-dressing musician, party promoter, and was a highly recognisable figure in the downtown [[New York City]] [[nightlife]] in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Known for his towering height, shaved head, giant sunglasses, and penchant for wearing short cocktail dresses that exaggerated the length of his pale, lithe figure, Johnson played a seminal role in the emergence of the [[Queercore]] gay [[rock and roll]] subculture in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Disquieting Death Stills the Nite Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/fashion/14dean.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2011-01-30 |first=Cara |last=Buckley |date=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career ==
Both an underground rock star and a porn star, Dean Johnson fronted two bands: [[Dean and the Weenies]] and the [[Velvet Mafia]]. He partied with art-world luminaries like [[Keith Haring]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and [[Andy Warhol]], and performed at nightclubs such as; [[Area (nightclub)|Area]], [[Danceteria]], The Cat Club, and the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Johnson was the driving force behind the ground-breaking “Rock and Roll Fag Bar” party, held Tuesday nights in the late 1980s at [[The World (nightclub)|The World]]. He subsequently produced the monthly “HomoCorps” live music showcase at [[CBGB]], which featured gay and transgender rock-and-roll bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Promoter and Queer Icon Dean Johnson Dies |url= http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/09/promoter_and_queer_icon_dean_j.html |work= New York Magazine |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death ==
Johnson grappled with [[drug addiction]] and also was a [[sex worker]]. He died at age 46 from an apparent drug overdose while turning a trick in a Washington, D.C. apartment. There is some suspicion around his death, stemming from the fact that the man he was with had been found not guilty of murder in a trial held only a few weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dean Johnson’s E-Mails Shed New Light on His Strange Death|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-02-05/news/dean-johnson-s-e-mails-shed-new-light-on-his-strange-death/|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=2011-01-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170420130008/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/dean-johnsons-e-mails-shed-new-light-on-his-strange-death-6420463|archivedate=2017-04-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Domenico Leccisi''' (20 May 1920{{spaced ndash}}2 November 2008) was an [[Italy|Italian]] politician, who is best known for [[Grave robbery|stealing the corpse]] of the fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] from an unmarked grave in 1946.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/world/europe/06leccisi.html "Domenico Leccisi, Italian Political Figure, Dies at 88"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 5, 2008. Accessed November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grave robbing incident==
On the eve of the first anniversary of Italy's liberation from Nazi occupying forces, Leccisi, then a right-wing journalist, and two helpers dug up the corpse from the city's Musocco cemetery and spirited it away.

Leccisi left behind a note that said: "Finally, O Duce, you are with us. We will cover you with roses but the smell of your virtue will overpower those roses."

Authorities discovered Mussolini's remains four months later, hidden at a 15th-century monastery at Pavia south of Milan. Two monks were charged with hiding the body.

In 1957 Mussolini found a final resting place at his birthplace in Predappio, northern Italy, after a campaign led by Leccisi and his party.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

==Political career==
Leccisi served as a parliamentary deputy for the neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] from 1953 to 1963. He was also a Milan city councillor and wrote an autobiography, ''With Mussolini Before and After Piazzale Loreto''.

==Death==
Leccisi died at age 88 on 2 November 2008 at a retirement home in [[Milan]] due to heart and respiratory disease.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7308">{{Euthanasia}}

In [[Switzerland]], a total of  742 [[assisted suicide]]s (320 men, 422 women) was recorded for 2014, compared to 1,029  [[Suicide in Switzerland|non-assisted suicides]] (754 men, 275 women);  most of the assisted suicides concerned elderly people suffering from a [[terminal disease]].&lt;ref name=bfs14&gt;[https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/gesundheit.assetdetail.1023143.html Sterbehilfe und Suizid in der Schweiz 2014], [[Federal Statistical Office (Switzerland)|Federal Statistical Office]], published 11 October 2016.
[[Demographics of Switzerland#Population|Total resident population]] in 2014: 8,236,666	(male 4,121,471, female 4,205,655) [https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung.assetdetail.349846.html Die Bevölkerung der Schweiz 2014] BFS 348-1400, 8 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euthanasia organisations have been widely used by foreigners, in what critics have termed [[suicide tourism]]. As of 2008, 60% of the total number of  suicides assisted by the organisation [[Dignitas (euthanasia group)|Dignitas]]  had been Germans.&lt;ref name="tagesspiegel_interview"&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/Sterbehilfe-Dignitas-Minelli;art1117,2502357 Wenn Sie das trinken, gibt es kein Zurück] ''Tagesspiegel.de''  Retrieved April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation==
The [[Swiss Criminal Code]] of 1937 outlaws "incitement or assistance to suicide from selfish motives" (Art. 115). Any active role in [[voluntary euthanasia]] ("manslaughter on request") is also outlawed, even if committed from "respectable motives" such as [[mercy killing]]s (Art. 114).
However, [[Nulla poena sine lege|by omission]], [[assisted suicide]] from non-selfish motives remains legal. 
For example, lethal drugs may be prescribed as long as the recipient takes an active role in the drug administration, but active euthanasia (such as the act of administering a lethal injection) is not legal.&lt;ref name="Hurst Mauron"/&gt; 
All forms of active euthanasia like administering lethal injection remain prohibited in Switzerland. Swiss law only allows providing means to commit suicide, and reasons for doing so must not be based on self-interest (such as monetary gain).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assistedsuicide.org/suicide_laws.html Assisted Suicide Laws Around the World, compiled by [[Derek Humphry]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on this legal situation, non-profit organisations administering life-ending medicine were first established in Switzerland in the 1980s.

Article 115 of the [[Swiss Criminal Code]] reads:&lt;ref name="Hurst Mauron"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurst SA, Mauron A |title=Assisted suicide and euthanasia in Switzerland: allowing a role for non-physicians |journal=BMJ |volume=326 |issue=7383 |pages=271–3 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12560284 |pmc=1125125 |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7383.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|'''Inciting and assisting suicide:''' Any person who for selfish motives incites or assists another to commit or attempt to commit suicide shall, if that other person thereafter commits or attempts to commit suicide, be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty.}}

It should be noted, however, that the [[Swiss Criminal Code]] states that "English is not an official language of the Swiss Confederation. This translation is

This [[Liberalism|liberal]] regulation of assisted suicide also permits the assistance of voluntary euthanasia for non-resident foreigners, which has led to  the phenomenon of "[[suicide tourism]]".&lt;ref name="Hurst Mauron"/&gt;

When an assisted suicide is declared, a police inquiry may be started. Since no crime has been committed in the absence of a selfish motive, these are mostly open and shut cases. Prosecution can occur if doubts are raised about the patient's competence to make an autonomous choice, or about the motivation of anyone involved in assisting the suicide.
While there is no regulation on permissible reasons for the suicide, the major Swiss non-profit organisations dedicated to assisted suicide may require that a [[terminal illness]] has been diagnosed.

==Debate==
A complaint against the [[health department]] of the [[canton of Zurich]] on the part of a man suffering from   [[bipolar affective disorder]] and desiring to be issued with [[pentobarbital]] by the state in order to end his life was rejected in a [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]] decision of 3  November 2006.
The court conceded that "It cannot be denied that an incurable, long-lasting, severe mental impairment similar to a somatic one can create a suffering out of which a patient would find his/her life in the long run not worth living anymore" but found that no case can be made that the state has any obligation to facilitate the availability of substances used for euthanasia, as had been argued by the plaintiff based on both the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] and on [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|article 8 of the ECHR]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bger/061103_2A_48-2006.html BGE 133 I 58, 2A.48/2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In a [[referendum]] on 15 May 2011, voters in the [[canton of Zurich]] overwhelmingly rejected calls to ban assisted suicide or to outlaw the practice for non-residents. Out of more than 278,000 ballots cast, the initiative to ban assisted suicide was rejected by 85 per cent of voters and the initiative to outlaw it for foreigners was turned down by 78 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/switzerland/8515258/Zurich-votes-to-keep-suicide-tourism-alive.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zurich-voters-keep-suicide-tourism-alive/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/05/15/zurich-voters-suicide-tourism-alive/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Swiss voters back assisted suicide" ''BBC News'': 15.05.2011: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13405376&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 essay in the ''[[Hastings Center Report]]'', bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel]] advocated adopting similar rules in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appel JM |title=A suicide right for the mentally ill?

&lt;!--not part of any "debate", perhaps "notable cases"?
In July 2009, British conductor [[Sir Edward Downes]] and his wife Joan died together at a suicide clinic outside Zürich "under circumstances of their own choosing." Sir Edward was not  terminally ill, but his wife was diagnosed with rapidly developing  cancer.&lt;ref name="CB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=7887|  title=YOUthanasia| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |date=2009-08-02|  publisher=Criminal Brief| accessdate=2009-08-27}}{{verify credibility}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The '''Fermi paradox''', or '''Fermi's paradox''', named after physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], is the apparent contradiction between the lack of [[evidence]] and high [[probability]] estimates&lt;ref&gt;e.g., those given by optimistic choices of parameters in the [[Drake equation]]&lt;/ref&gt; for the existence of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] civilizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last=Krauthammer |first=C. |date=December 29, 2011 |title=Are we alone in the universe? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/are-we-alone-in-the-universe/2011/12/29/gIQA2wSOPP_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic points of the argument, made by [[physicists]] [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–1954) and [[Michael H.

The Fermi [[paradox]] is a conflict between the argument that [[scale (spatial)|scale]] and [[probability]] seem to favor intelligent life being common in the universe, and a total lack of [[evidence]] of intelligent life having ever arisen anywhere other than on the Earth.

The first aspect of the Fermi paradox is a function of the scale or the large numbers involved: there are an estimated 200–400 billion stars in the Milky Way&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cain |first=Fraser |url=http://www.universetoday.com/102630/how-many-stars-are-there-in-the-universe/ |title=How Many Stars are There in the Universe? |work=Universe Today |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=2016-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2–4 × [[orders of magnitude|10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;]]) and 70 sextillion (7×10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) in the [[observable universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3085885.stm|title = Astronomers count the stars |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = April 8, 2010|author=Craig, Andrew |date=July 22, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if intelligent life occurs on only a minuscule percentage of planets around these stars, there might still be a great number of [[Wiktionary:extant#English|extant]] civilizations, and if the percentage were high enough it would produce a significant number of extant civilizations in the Milky Way. This assumes the [[mediocrity principle]], by which the Earth is a typical [[planet]].

The second aspect of the Fermi paradox is the argument of probability: given intelligent life's ability to overcome scarcity, and its tendency to colonize new [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], it seems possible that at least some civilizations would be technologically advanced, seek out new resources in space, and colonize their own [[star system]] and, subsequently, surrounding star systems. Since there is no significant evidence on Earth, or elsewhere in the known universe, of other intelligent life after 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years of the universe's history, there is a conflict requiring a resolution. Some examples of possible resolutions are that intelligent life is rarer than we think, that our assumptions about the general development or behavior of intelligent species are flawed, or, more radically, that our current scientific understanding of the nature of the universe itself is quite incomplete.

The Fermi paradox can be asked in two ways.&lt;ref&gt;See Hart for an example of "no aliens are here", and Webb for an example of the more general "We see no signs of intelligence anywhere".&lt;/ref&gt; The first is, "Why are no aliens or their artifacts found here on Earth, or in the Solar System?" If [[interstellar travel]] is possible, even the "slow" kind nearly within the reach of Earth technology, then it would only take from 5 million to 50&amp;nbsp;million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref name=cr&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=where-are-they "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"], '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38–43, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; This is relatively brief on a [[geological time|geological scale]], let alone a [[Timeline of the Big Bang|cosmological one]]. Since there are many stars older than the Sun, and since intelligent life might have evolved earlier elsewhere, the question then becomes why the galaxy has not been colonized already. Even if colonization is impractical or undesirable to all alien civilizations, large-scale ''exploration'' of the galaxy could be possible by [[#Alien constructs|probes]].  These might leave detectable artifacts in the Solar System, such as old probes or evidence of mining activity, but none of these have been observed.

The second form of the question is "Why do we see no signs of intelligence elsewhere in the universe?"  This version does not assume interstellar travel, but includes other galaxies as well.  For distant galaxies, travel times may well explain the lack of alien visits to Earth, but a sufficiently advanced civilization could potentially be observable over a significant fraction of the [[Observable universe#Size|size of the observable universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shklovskii|Sagan|1966|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if such civilizations are rare, the scale argument indicates they should exist somewhere at some point during the history of the universe, and since they could be detected from far away over a considerable period of time, many more potential sites for their origin are within range of our observation.  It is unknown whether the paradox is stronger for our galaxy or for the universe as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Extraterrestrials; Where Are They? |editor1-first = Ben |editor1-last = Zuckerman |editor2-first=Michael |editor2-last=Hart |author=J.

== History and name ==
[[File:Los Alamos aerial view.jpeg|thumb|Los Alamos National Laboratory]]
In 1950, while working at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], Fermi had a casual conversation while walking to lunch with colleagues [[Emil Konopinski]], [[Edward Teller]] and [[Herbert York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shostak|first=Seth|date=October 25, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415185347/http://space.com/searchforlife/shostak_paradox_011024.html |url=http://www.space.com/searchforlife/shostak_paradox_011024.html|archivedate=April 15, 2006|title=Our Galaxy Should Be Teeming With Civilizations, But Where Are They?|work=Space.com|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men discussed a recent spate of [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] reports and an [[Alan Dunn (cartoonist)|Alan Dunn]] cartoon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/pillars/New_Yorker_aliens.png |title=Uncaptioned cartoon |author=Alan Dunn |publisher=The New Yorker |date=May 20, 1950 |accessdate = August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens.  The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, "Where are they?" (alternatively, "Where is everybody?").  Teller remembers, "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact that in spite of Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life."&lt;ref name="Eric-Jones"&gt;Jones, Eric [http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/la-10311-ms.pdf "Where is everybody?", An account of Fermi's question"], Los Alamos Technical report LA-10311-MS, March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that we ought to have been visited long ago and many times over.

Although Fermi's name is most commonly associated with the paradox, he was not the first to ask the question. An earlier implicit mention was by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] in an unpublished manuscript from 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Tsiolkovsky, K, 1933, ''The Planets are Occupied by Living Beings'', Archives of the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics, Kaluga, Russia. See [[:s:ru:Планеты заселены живыми существами (Циолковский)|original text]] in Russian [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; He noted "people deny the presence of intelligent beings on the planets of the universe" because "(i) if such beings exist they would have visited Earth, and (ii) if such civilizations existed then they would have given us some sign of their existence." This was not a paradox for others, who took this to imply the absence of ETs, but it was for him, since he himself was a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and the possibility of space travel.  Therefore, he proposed what is now known as the [[zoo hypothesis]] and speculated that mankind is not yet ready for higher beings to contact us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Tsiolkovsky – Russian Cosmism and Extraterrestrial Intelligence |author=Lytkin, V. |author2=Finney, B. |author3=Alepko, L. |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=36 |issue=4 |date=December 1995 |pages=369 |bibcode=1995QJRAS..36..369L }}&lt;/ref&gt; That Tsiolkovsky himself may not have been the first to discover the paradox is suggested by his above-mentioned reference to other people's reasons for denying the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations.

[[Michael H. Hart]] published in 1975 a detailed examination of the paradox,&lt;ref name="Hart" /&gt; which has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the '''Fermi–Hart paradox'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Gray]] argues that the term ''Fermi paradox'' is a misnomer, since in his view it is neither a paradox nor due to Fermi; he instead prefers the name '''Hart–Tipler argument''', acknowledging Michael Hart as its originator, but also the substantial contribution of [[Frank J.

== Drake equation ==
{{Main|Drake equation}}

The theories and principles in the [[Drake equation]] are closely related to the Fermi paradox.&lt;ref&gt;Gowdy, Robert H., VCU Department of Physics [http://www.courses.vcu.edu/PHY-rhg/astron/html/mod/019/s5.html SETI: Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. The Interstellar Distance Problem], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The equation was formulated by [[Frank Drake]] in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of [[star formation]] in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are [[Planetary habitability|habitable]]; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop ''intelligent'' life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. The fundamental problem is that the last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.

The Drake equation has been used by both optimists and pessimists, with wildly differing results. The first scientific meeting on the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), which had 10 attendees including Frank Drake and [[Carl Sagan]], speculated that the number of civilizations was roughly equal to the lifetime{{Non sequitur | date = October 2018 | reason = What lifetime?}} in years, and there were probably between 1,000 and 100,000,000 civilizations in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Drake | first1 = F. | last2 = Sobel |first2 = D. | year = 1992 | title = Is Anyone Out There?

Barrow]] used pessimistic numbers and speculated that the average number of civilizations in a galaxy is much less than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986|page=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all arguments involving the Drake equation suffer from the [[overconfidence effect]], a common error of probabilistic reasoning about low-probability events, by guessing specific numbers for likelihoods of events whose mechanism is not yet understood, such as the likelihood of [[abiogenesis]] on an Earth-like planet, with current likelihood estimates varying over many hundreds of orders of magnitude. An analysis that takes into account some of the uncertainty associated with this lack of understanding has been carried out by [[Anders Sandberg]], [[Eric Drexler]] and [[Toby Ord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1806.02404 |title=Dissolving the Fermi Paradox |author=Anders Sandberg |author2=Eric Drexler |author3=Toby Ord |date=6 June 2018 |class=physics.pop-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that with very high probability, either intelligent civilizations are plentiful in our galaxy or humanity is alone in the observable universe, with the lack of observation of intelligent civilizations pointing towards the latter option.

== Empirical projects ==
There are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence—that there are many potential [[Planetary habitability|habitable planets]], and that we see no evidence of life.  The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi's time that is gaining ground with the discovery of many [[exoplanet]]s, and models predicting billions of habitable worlds in our galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On The History and Future of Cosmic Planet Formation |journal=MNRAS |date=December 1, 2015 |volume=454 |issue=2 |pages=1811–1817 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1817|arxiv = 1508.01202 |bibcode = 2015MNRAS.454.1811B |last1=Behroozi |first1=Peter |last2=Peeples |first2=Molly S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of the paradox, that we see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research.  This includes both efforts to find any indication of life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Astrophys Space Sci |date=2013 |volume=348 |pages=1–10 |doi=10.1007/s10509-013-1536-9 |title=Final frontiers: the hunt for life elsewhere in the Universe |author=Sohan Jheeta|bibcode = 2013Ap&amp;SS.348....1J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life.  These searches have been made since 1960, and several are ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [[SETI Institute]], [http://seti.harvard.edu/seti/ The Harvard SETI Home Page], or [http://seti.berkeley.edu/ The Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence at Berkeley]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although astronomers do not usually search for extraterrestrials, they have observed phenomena that they could not immediately explain without positing an intelligent civilization as the source.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; theoretically creating effects that might be detected over interstellar distances. The careful searching for non-natural radio emissions from space may lead to the detection of alien civilizations. Sensitive alien observers of the [[Solar System]], for example, would note unusually intense [[radio wave]]s for a [[Star#Classification|G2 star]] due to Earth's television and telecommunication broadcasts. In the absence of an apparent natural cause, alien observers might infer the existence of a terrestrial civilization. It should be noted however that the most sensitive radio telescopes currently available on Earth would not be able to detect non-directional radio signals even at a fraction of a [[light-year]], so it is questionable whether any such signals could be detected by an extraterrestrial civilization.  Such signals could be either "accidental" by-products of a civilization, or deliberate attempts to communicate, such as the [[Arecibo message]]. A number of astronomers and observatories have attempted and are attempting to detect such evidence, mostly through the [[SETI]] organization. Several decades of SETI analysis have not revealed any unusually bright or meaningfully repetitive radio emissions.

==== Conjectures about interstellar probes ====
{{Further|Von Neumann probe|Bracewell probe}}

Self-replicating probes could exhaustively explore a galaxy the size of the [[Milky Way]] in as little as a million years.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; If even a single civilization in the Milky Way attempted this, such probes could spread throughout the entire galaxy. Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien [[Bracewell probe]]. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to Von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow [[speed-of-light]] dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an [[artificial intelligence]] would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization. The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bracewell| first1=R.

[[File:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|A variant of the speculative [[Dyson sphere]]. Such large scale artifacts would drastically alter the spectrum of a star.]]

In 1959, [[Freeman Dyson]] observed that every developing human civilization constantly increases its energy consumption, and, he conjectured, a civilization might try to harness a large part of the energy produced by a star. He proposed that a Dyson sphere could be a possible means: a shell or cloud of objects enclosing a star to absorb and utilize as much radiant energy as possible. Such a feat of [[astroengineering]] would drastically alter the observed [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] of the star involved, changing it at least partly from the normal [[emission line]]s of a natural [[stellar atmosphere]] to those of [[black body radiation]], probably with a peak in the [[infrared]]. Dyson speculated that advanced alien civilizations might be detected by examining the spectra of stars and searching for such an altered spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]| date= 1960| url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM| title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation| author= [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson, Freeman J.]]| pages= 1667–1668| volume =131| doi= 10.1126/science.131.3414.1667| pmid=17780673| issue=3414| bibcode = 1960Sci...131.1667D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G^I"&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=1408.1133| last1= Wright| first1= J.

== Hypothetical explanations for the paradox ==

=== Extraterrestrial life is rare or non-existent ===
{{main|Rare Earth hypothesis}}
Those who think that intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life—or at least the [[evolution of biological complexity]]—are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the [[rare Earth hypothesis]], a rejection of the [[mediocrity principle]], complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.&lt;ref name="rare-earth"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |first1=Peter D. |last1=Ward |authorlink1=Peter Ward (paleontologist) |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |authorlink2=Donald Brownlee |date=January 14, 2000 |page=368 |publisher=Springer |edition=1st |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]].

=== No other intelligent species have arisen ===

=== Periodic extinction by natural events ===
New life might commonly die out due to runaway heating or cooling on their fledgling planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2016/01/the-aliens-are-silent-because-they-are-extinct.html |title=The Aliens Are Silent Because They Are Extinct |work=Australian National University |date=January 21, 2016 |accessdate=2016-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Earth, there have been numerous major [[extinction event]]s that destroyed the majority of complex species alive at the time; the [[K-T extinction|extinction of the dinosaurs]] is the best known example. These are thought to have been caused by events such as impact from a large meteorite, massive volcanic eruptions, or astronomical events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1473550404001910 |title=Did a gamma-ray burst initiate the late Ordovician mass extinction? |vauthors=Melott AL, Lieberman BS, Laird CM, Martin LD, Medvedev MV, Thomas BC, Cannizzo JK, Gehrels N, Jackman CH |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=55–61 |date=2004 |url = http://acdb-ext.gsfc.nasa.gov/People/Jackman/Melott_2004.pdf|arxiv = astro-ph/0309415 |bibcode = 2004IJAsB...3...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be the case that such extinction events are common throughout the universe and periodically destroy intelligent life, or at least its civilizations, before the species is able to develop the technology to communicate with other intelligent species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global catastrophic risks |author1=Nick Bostrom |author2=Milan M.

Using extinct civilizations such as [[Easter Island]] as models, a study conducted in 2018 posited that [[climate change]] induced by "energy intensive" civilizations may prevent sustainability within such civilizations, thus explaining the paradoxical lack of evidence for intelligent extra-terrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-could-answer-fermi-paradox-2018-6|title=There's a compelling explanation for why we've never found aliens — and it could mean humanity is doomed|publisher=Business Insider|first1=Kevin|last1=Loria|date=June 25, 2018|access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inflation hypothesis and the youngness argument ===
Cosmologist [[Alan Guth]] proposed a [[multiverse]] solution to the Fermi paradox. This hypothesis uses the [[synchronous gauge]] probability distribution, with the result that young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop. However, Guth notes "Perhaps this argument explains why SETI has not found any signals from alien civilizations, but I find it more plausible that it is merely a symptom that the synchronous gauge probability distribution is not the right one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/hep-th/pdf/0702/0702178v1.pdf|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical|title = Eternal Inflation and its Implications|volume = 40|issue = 25|pages = 6811–6826 | first = Alan|date = 2007 | last = Guth|doi=10.1088/1751-8113/40/25/S25|arxiv = hep-th/0702178 |bibcode = 2007JPhA...40.6811G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligent civilizations are too far apart in space or time ===
[[File:Terrestrial Planet Finder PIA04499.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s conception of the [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]]]]

It may be that non-colonizing technologically capable alien civilizations exist, but that they are simply too far apart for meaningful two-way communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002|pp=62–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two civilizations are separated by several thousand light-years, it is possible that one or both cultures may become extinct before meaningful dialogue can be established. Human searches may be able to detect their existence, but communication will remain impossible because of distance. It has been suggested that this problem might be ameliorated somewhat if contact/communication is made through a [[Bracewell probe]]. In this case at least one partner in the exchange may obtain meaningful information. Alternatively, a civilization may simply broadcast its knowledge, and leave it to the receiver to make what they may of it. This is similar to the transmission of information from ancient civilizations to the present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vakoch, Douglas |title=Decoding E.T.: Ancient Tongues Point Way To Learning Alien Languages |publisher=SETI Institute |date=November 15, 2001 |accessdate=August 19, 2010 |url=http://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_decode_011115.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523030456/https://www.space.com/searchforlife/seti_decode_011115.html |archivedate=May 23, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and humanity has undertaken similar activities like the [[Arecibo message]], which could transfer information about Earth's intelligent species, even if it never yields a response or does not yield a response in time for humanity to receive it. It is also possible that [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of past civilizations may be detected through deep space observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Adam Stevens |author2=Duncan Forgan |author3=Jack O'Malley James |date=2015 |title=Observational Signatures of Self–Destructive Civilisations |eprint=1507.08530 |class=astro-ph.EP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related speculation by Sagan and Newman suggests that if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Newman, W.T.  |author2=Sagan, C. |date=1981 |title=Galactic civilizations: Population. dynamics and interstellar diffusion |journal=Icarus |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=293–327 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(81)90135-4 |bibcode=1981Icar...46..293N|hdl=2060/19790011801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is a tiny fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that we are in the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Brin, Glen David |date=1983 |title= The 'Great Silence': The Controversy Concerning Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life |bibcode= 1983QJRAS..24..283B| journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]| volume=24 |pages=287, 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of resources to spread physically throughout the galaxy ===
{{See also|Project Daedalus|Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Longshot}}

Many speculations about the ability of an alien culture to colonize other star systems are based on the idea that interstellar travel is technologically feasible. While the current understanding of physics rules out the possibility of [[faster-than-light]] travel, it appears that there are no major theoretical barriers to the construction of "slow" interstellar ships, even though the engineering required is considerably beyond our present capabilities. This idea underlies the concept of the Von Neumann probe and the Bracewell probe as a potential evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence.

It is possible, however, that present scientific knowledge cannot properly gauge the feasibility and costs of such interstellar colonization. Theoretical barriers may not yet be understood, and the resources needed may be so great as to make it unlikely that any civilization could afford to attempt it. Even if interstellar travel and colonization are possible, they may be difficult, leading to a colonization model based on [[percolation theory]].&lt;ref name=landis&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Geoffrey A. Landis|author=Landis, Geoffrey|url=http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/percolation.htp |title=The Fermi Paradox: An Approach Based on Percolation Theory|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume= 51|pages= 163–166|date= 1998|bibcode = 1998JBIS...51..163L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization efforts may not occur as an unstoppable rush, but rather as an uneven tendency to "percolate" outwards, within an eventual slowing and termination of the effort given the enormous costs involved and the expectation that colonies will inevitably develop a culture and civilization of their own. Colonization may thus occur in "clusters," with large areas remaining uncolonized at any one time.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;

====It's cheaper to transfer information for exploration====
If human-capability constructs in a machine such as [[mind uploading]] are possible, and it is possible to transfer such constructs over vast distances and  rebuild on a remote machine, then it might not make a strong economic sense to travel the galaxy by spaceflight.  After the first civilization have physically  explored or colonized the galaxy, as well as sent such machines for easy explorations, then the subsequent civiliizations, after having contacted the first, may find it cheaper, faster, and easier to explore the galaxy through intelligent construct transfers to the machines built by the first civilization, which is cheaper than spaceflight by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;.  However, since only a star system needs only one such remote machine, and the communication is most likely highly directed, transmitted at high-frequencies and at a minimal power to be economical, such signals would be hard to detect from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scheffer, L.K. |date= 1994 |title=Machine Intelligence, the Cost of Interstellar Travel and Fermi's Paradox |bibcode=1994QJRAS..35..157S|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human beings have not existed long enough ===
Humanity's ability to detect intelligent extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period—from 1937 onwards, if the invention of the [[radio telescope]] is taken as the dividing line—and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that human beings have neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seth D.

Once ETI become alerted to our presence, it will take at least as many years for us to realize that they know."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== We are not listening properly ===
There are some assumptions that underlie the [[SETI]] programs that may cause searchers to miss signals that are present. Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) [[Frequency|frequencies]], which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non-[[main sequence]] star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting [[Solar twins|Sun-like stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turnbull|first1=Margaret C.|last2=Tarter|first2=Jill C.|doi=10.1086/345779|title=Target Selection for SETI.

The greatest challenge is the sheer size of the radio search needed to look for signals (effectively spanning the entire observable universe), the limited amount of resources committed to SETI, and the sensitivity of modern instruments. SETI estimates, for instance, that with a radio telescope as sensitive as the [[Arecibo Observatory]], Earth's television and radio broadcasts would only be detectable at distances up to 0.3 light-years, less than 1/10 the distance to the nearest star.  A signal is much easier to detect if the signal energy is limited to either a [[narrowband|narrow]] range of frequencies, or directed at a specific part of the sky. Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=December 1975 |pages=462–466 |title=The Arecibo message of November, 1974 |author=The Staff at the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103575901165 |bibcode = 1975Icar...26..462. |doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(75)90116-5 }}  "A radio telescope in M13 operating at the transmission frequency, and pointed toward the Sun at the time the message arrives at the receiving site will observe a flux density from the message which will exceed the flux density of the Sun itself by a factor of roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, at that unique time, the Sun will appear to the receptors to be by far the brightest star of the Milky Way."&lt;/ref&gt; However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent. Many SETI searches assume that extraterrestrial civilizations will be broadcasting a deliberate signal, like the Arecibo message, in order to be found.

Thus to detect alien civilizations through their radio emissions, Earth observers either need more sensitive instruments or must hope for fortunate circumstances: that the broadband radio emissions of alien radio technology are much stronger than our own; that one of SETI's programs is listening to the correct frequencies from the right regions of space; or that aliens are deliberately sending focused transmissions in our general direction.

=== Civilizations broadcast detectable radio signals only for a brief period of time ===
It may be that alien civilizations are detectable through their radio emissions for only a short time, reducing the likelihood of spotting them. The usual assumption is that civilizations outgrow radio through technological advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Calculating the probability of detecting radio signals from alien civilizations |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=143–149 |author=Marko Horvat |date=2007 |arxiv=0707.0011|doi=10.1017/S1473550406003004 |bibcode = 2006IJAsB...5..143H }} "There is a specific time interval during which an alien civilization uses radio communications. Before this interval, radio is beyond the civilization's technical reach, and after this interval radio will be considered obsolete."&lt;/ref&gt; However, even if radio is not used for communication, it may be used for other purposes such as power transmission from solar power satellites.  Such uses may remain visible even after broadcast emission are replaced by less observable technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solar Power Satellites as Interstellar Beacons |author=Stephenson, D. G. |bibcode=1984QJRAS..25...80S |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=25 |issue=1 |page=80 |date=1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More hypothetically, advanced alien civilizations may evolve beyond broadcasting at all in the electromagnetic spectrum and communicate by technologies not developed or used by mankind. Some scientists have hypothesized that advanced civilizations may send [[neutrino]] signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigear.org/vol1no3/neutrino.htm |title=Cosmic Search Vol. 1 No. 3 |publisher=Bigear.org |date=September 21, 2004 |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such signals exist, they could be detectable by [[neutrino detector]]s that are now under construction for other goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Learned| first1=J| last2=Pakvasa| first2=S| last3=Zee| first3=A| title=Galactic neutrino communication| arxiv=0805.2429| journal=Physics Letters B| volume=671| issue=1| pages=15–19| date=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.11.057| bibcode = 2009PhLB..671...15L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== They tend to isolate themselves ===
It has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial [[simulated reality|virtual environments]], transfer themselves into these environments through [[mind uploading]], and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Bostrom| first1=Nick| title=Where Are They?|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/409936/where-are-they/page/1/| publisher=MIT Technology Review| accessdate=June 21, 2015| date=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be that intelligent alien life develops an "increasing disinterest" in their outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly any sufficiently advanced society will develop highly engaging media and entertainment well before the capacity for advanced space travel, and that the rate of appeal of these social contrivances is destined, because of their inherent reduced complexity, to overtake any desire for complex, expensive endeavors such as space exploration and communication. Once any sufficiently advanced civilization becomes able to master its environment, and most of its physical needs are met through technology, various "social and entertainment technologies", including virtual reality, are postulated to become the primary drivers and motivations of that civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Chapter 15: "They Stay at Home and Surf the Web"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== They are too alien ===
[[File:TerrestrialMicrowaveWindow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Microwave window as seen by a ground-based system. From NASA report SP-419: SETI – the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]]
Another possibility is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings. Perhaps human [[mathematics]] is parochial to Earth and not shared by other life,&lt;ref&gt;Schombert, James. [http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec28.html "Fermi's paradox (i.e. Where are they?)"] ''Cosmology Lectures'', University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt; though others argue this can only apply to abstract math since the math associated with physics must be similar (in results, if not in methods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mathematics on a distant planet  |author=Hamming, RW  |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly  |volume=105  |issue=7  |pages=640–650  |date=1998  |jstor=2589247|doi=10.2307/2589247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physiology might also cause a communication barrier. Carl Sagan speculated that an alien species might have a thought process orders of magnitude slower (or faster) than ours.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A message broadcast by that species might well seem like random background noise to us, and therefore go undetected.

This is the so-called ''[[SETI]] Paradox''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=physics/0611283 |title=The SETI paradox |author=Alexander Zaitsev |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only civilization we know, our own, does not [[Active SETI|explicitly transmit]], except for a few small efforts.&lt;ref name=webbwhere /&gt; Even these efforts, and certainly any attempt to expand them, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Should We Call the Cosmos Seeking ET?

However, given the possible impact of any reply&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michaud | first1 = M. | title = Ten decisions that could shake the world | doi = 10.1016/S0265-9646(03)00019-5 | journal = Space Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 131–950 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be very difficult to obtain any consensus on "Who speaks for Earth?" and "What should we say?"

=== Earth is deliberately not contacted===
{{main|Zoo hypothesis}}
[[File:Matrix sphere.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation of a planetarium simulating the universe to humans. The "[[reality|real]]" universe is outside the black sphere, the simulated one projected on/filtered through it.]]

The [[zoo hypothesis]] states that intelligent extraterrestrial life exists and does not contact life on Earth to allow for its natural evolution and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ball| first1=J| title=The zoo hypothesis| journal=Icarus| volume=19|issue=3|pages=347–349|date=1973| doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90111-5| bibcode=1973Icar...19..347B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis may break down under the [[uniformity of motive]] flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation increases with the number of civilizations.&lt;ref name=cr /&gt;

Analysis of the inter-arrival times between civilizations in the galaxy based on common astrobiological assumptions suggests that the initial civilization would have a commanding lead over the later arrivals. As such, it may have established what we call the ''zoo hypothesis'' through force or as a galactic/universal norm and the resultant "paradox" by a cultural [[founder effect]] with or without the continued activity of the founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hair |first1=Thomas W. |title=Temporal dispersion of the emergence of intelligence: an inter-arrival time analysis |journal=International Journal of Astrobiology |date=25 February 2011 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=131–135 |doi=10.1017/S1473550411000024|bibcode=2011IJAsB..10..131H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a civilization advanced enough to travel between solar systems could be actively visiting or observing Earth while remaining undetected or unrecognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=What Role Will Extraterrestrials Play in Humanity's Future?

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth is purposely isolated (planetarium hypothesis) ===
{{Main|Planetarium hypothesis}}

A related idea to the zoo hypothesis is that, beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a [[simulated reality]]. The planetarium hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baxter, Stephen|date=2001 |title=The Planetarium Hypothesis: A Resolution of the Fermi Paradox| journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society| volume= 54|issue=5/6|pages=210–216|bibcode = 2001JBIS...54..210B }}&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that beings may have created this simulation so that the universe appears to be empty of other life.

=== It is dangerous to communicate ===
An alien civilization might feel it is too dangerous to communicate, either for us or for them. After all, when very different civilizations have met on Earth, the results have often been disastrous for one side or the other, and the same may well apply to interstellar contact. Even contact at a safe distance could lead to infection by computer code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Do potential SETI signals need to be decontaminated? |author=Carrigan, Richard A. |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages=112–117|date=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2005.05.004 |bibcode=2006AcAau..58..112C }}&lt;/ref&gt; or even ideas themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Marsden|first=P.| title=Memetics and social contagion: Two sides of the same coin| journal=Journal of Memetics-Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission| date=1998|volume=2| issue=2|pages=171–185| url=http://cfpm.org/jom-emit/1998/vol2/marsden_p.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps prudent civilizations actively hide not only from Earth but from everyone, out of [[#It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy others|fear of other civilizations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title=A Solution to the Fermi Paradox: The Solar System, Part of a Galactic Hypercivilization? |author=Beatriz Gato-Rivera |date=1970 |eprint=physics/0512062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or the alien equivalent of it—is the reason for any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, even if no other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely for them to be the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.&lt;ref name="Brin" /&gt;

[[Liu Cixin]]'s novel [[The Dark Forest]] is based upon such a situation.

=== They are here unacknowledged ===
{{Main|UFO conspiracy theory}}
A significant fraction of the population believes that at least some [[UFOs]] (Unidentified Flying Objects) are spacecraft piloted by aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/why-do-people-believe-in-ufos-120810.htm |title=Why Do People Believe in UFOs? |date=August 10, 2012 |author=Ray Villard |publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/15/alien-believers-outnumber-god_n_1968259.html |title=More Believe in Space Aliens Than in God According To U.K. Survey |author=Paul Speigel |publisher=Huffington Post |date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of these are unrecognized or mistaken interpretations of mundane phenomena, there are those that remain puzzling even after investigation.

Similarly, it is theoretically possible that SETI groups are not reporting positive detections, or governments have been blocking signals or suppressing publication.  This response might be attributed to security or economic interests from the potential use of advanced extraterrestrial technology. It has been suggested that the detection of an extraterrestrial radio signal or technology could well be the most highly secret information that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A.

The '''Cryptobranchidae''' are a [[family (taxonomy)|family]] of fully aquatic [[salamander]]s commonly known as the '''giant salamanders'''.  A single [[species]], the [[hellbender]] (''Cryptobranchus alleganiensis'') occurs in the [[eastern United States]], while Asian species occur in China and Japan.  They are the largest living [[amphibians]] known today. The [[Japanese giant salamander]] (''Andrias japonicus'') reaches up to {{convert|1.44|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, feeds at night on [[fish]] and [[crustacean]]s, and has been known to live for more than 50 years in captivity.&lt;ref name=amphibia1&gt;[http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?query_src=aw_lists_genera_&amp;table=amphib&amp;where-genus=Andrias&amp;where-species=japonicus Andrias japonicus].

==Taxonomy==
The family name is from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''krypto'' ("hidden"), and ''branch'' ("gill"), which refer to how the members absorb oxygen through capillaries of their side-frills, which function as gills.

==Fossil record==
Extant species in the family Cryptobranchidae are the modern-day members of a lineage that extends back millions of years; the earliest fossil records of a basal species date back to the [[Middle Jurassic]] and were found in volcanic deposits in northern [[China]].&lt;ref name=salamanders424&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gao |first=Ke-Qin |author2=Shubin, Neil H. |title=Earliest known crown-group salamanders |journal=Nature |date=27 March 2003 |volume=422 |issue=6930 |pages=424–428 |doi=10.1038/nature01491|pmid=12660782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specimens are the earliest known relatives of modern salamanders, and together with the numerous other basal groups of salamanders found in the Asian fossil record, they form a firm base of evidence for the fact that "the early diversification of salamanders was well underway" in Asia during the Jurassic period.&lt;ref name=salamanders424/&gt; Little has changed in the morphology of the Cryptobranchidae since the time of these fossils, leaving researchers to note "extant cryptobranchid salamanders can be regarded as living fossils whose structures have remained little changed for over 160 million years."&lt;ref name=salamanders424/&gt;

As the fossil record for the Cryptobranchidae shows an Asian origin for the family, how these salamanders made it to the eastern US has been a point of scientific interest. Research has indicated a dispersal via [[land bridge]], with waves of [[adaptive radiation]] seeming to have swept the Americas from north to south.&lt;ref name=salamanders424/&gt;&lt;ref name=pennsylvania362&gt;{{cite journal |last=Swanson |first=P.L. |title=Notes on the Amphibians of Venango County, Pennsylvania |journal=American Midland Naturalist |date=September 1948 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=362–371 |doi=10.2307/2421606|jstor=2421606 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrias Scheuchzeri Oeningen.jpg|thumb|left|294x294px|''[[Andrias scheuchzeri]]'']]
In 1726, the Swiss physician [[Johann Jakob Scheuchzer]] described a fossil as ''Homo diluvii testis'' ([[Latin]]: Evidence of a [[diluvian]] human), believing it to be the remains of a human being who drowned in the biblical [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]]. The [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]], bought the fossil in 1802, where it is still exhibited. In 1812, the fossil was examined by [[Georges Cuvier]], who recognized that it was not human. After being identified as a salamander, it was renamed ''[[Salamandra]] scheuchzeri'' by Holl in 1831. The [[genus]] ''Andrias'' was coined six years later by [[Johann Jakob von Tschudi|Tschudi]]. In doing so, both the genus, ''Andrias'' (which means "image of man"), and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''scheuchzeri'', ended up honouring Scheuchzer and his beliefs. It and the [[Extant taxon|extant]] ''A. davidianus'' cannot be mutually diagnosed, and the latter, only described in 1871, is therefore sometimes considered a [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Darrel R. (2011). [http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/?action=references&amp;id=28745 "Andrias Tschudi"]. Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference. Version 5.5 (31 January 2011). Electronic database accessible at http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/. American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA. Retrieved 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Cryptobranchids are large [[salamander]]s, with large folds of skin along their flanks. These help increase the animals' surface area, allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water. They have four toes on the fore limbs, and five on the hind limbs. Their [[metamorphosis]] from the larval stage is incomplete, so the adults retain gill slits (although they also have lungs), and lack eyelids.They have bad eyesight. They can reach a length of {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though most are considerably smaller today.&lt;ref name=amphibia2/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
In Japan, their natural habitats are threatened by dam-building.  Ramps and staircases have been added to some dams to allow them to move upstream to areas where they spawn.
&lt;ref name=NG&gt;[http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/news/animals-news/giant-salamander-wcvin/ "Giant Salamanders Helped to Spawn"] 31 December 2009. National Geographic Society. Retrieved 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
The Japanese giant salamander has lived for as long as 52 years in captivity.&lt;ref name=amphibia1/&gt;

===Feeding===
The Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs, crabs, and shrimp.&lt;ref name=EoR&gt;{{cite book |editor=Cogger, H.G. |editor2=Zweifel, R.G.|author= Lanza, B.|author2= Vanni, S.|author3= Nistri, A.|last-author-amp= yes|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 69|isbn= 0-12-178560-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hunt mainly at night.  As they have poor eyesight, they use sensory nodes on their heads and bodies to detect minute changes in water pressure, enabling them to find their prey.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, C.&amp;nbsp;R. (2006). [http://www.earthsendangered.com/profile.asp?view=c&amp;ID=3&amp;sp=413 "Earth's Endangered Creatures - Chinese Giant Salamander Facts"] Retrieved 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
During mating season, the salamanders travel upstream, where the female lays two strings of over 200 eggs each. The male fertilizes the eggs externally by releasing his sperm onto them, and then guards them for at least three months, until they hatch.&lt;ref name=EoR/&gt; At this point, the larvae live off their noticeable stored fat until ready to hunt. Once ready, they hunt as a group rather than individually.

Scientists at [[Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park]] in Japan have recently discovered the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. On occasion, the male "den master" will also allow a second male into the den; the reason for this is unclear.

The '''Great Plague''', lasting from 1665–1666, was the last major epidemic of the [[bubonic plague]] to occur in [[England]]. It happened within the centuries-long time period of the [[Second plague pandemic|Second Pandemic]], an extended period of intermittent bubonic plague epidemics which began in China in 1331, the first year of the [[Black Death]], an outbreak which included other forms such as [[pneumonic plague]], and lasted until 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The 1665–66 [[epidemic]] was on a far smaller scale than the earlier Black Death [[pandemic]]; it was remembered afterwards as the "great" plague mainly because it was the last widespread outbreak of bubonic plague in England during the 400-year timespan of the Second Pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_salisbury.shtml |title=Spread of the Plague |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ibeji, Mike|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/black_09.shtml |title=Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==London in 1665==

[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Plan of London before the fire (State 2), variant.jpg|thumb|left|Map of London by [[Wenceslas Hollar]], c.1665]]
As in other European cities of the period, the plague was endemic in 17th century London.&lt;ref name=Moote61&gt;Moote (2004) pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;
The disease periodically erupted into massive epidemics. There were 30,000 deaths due to the plague in 1603, 35,000 in 1625, and 10,000 in 1636, as well as smaller numbers in other years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen |last=Porter|title=17th Century: Plague|year=2001|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/17th-century-plague|publisher=Gresham College|accessdate=2014-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moote11&gt;Moote (2004) pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1664, a bright comet was to be seen in the sky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pepys |first=Samuel |chapter=March 1st |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys/1665/March#March_1st |title=Diary of Samuel Pepys |year=1665 |isbn=0-520-22167-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the people of London were fearful, wondering what evil event it portended. London at that time consisted of a city of about 448 acres surrounded by a [[London Wall|city wall]], which had originally been built to keep out raiding bands. There were gates at [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], [[Aldersgate]], [[Cripplegate]], [[Moorgate]] and [[Bishopsgate]] and to the south lay the [[River Thames]] and [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name=Leasor13&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; In the poorer parts of the city, hygiene was impossible to maintain in the overcrowded tenements and garrets. There was no sanitation, and open drains flowed along the centre of winding streets. The cobbles were slippery with animal dung, rubbish and the slops thrown out of the houses, muddy and buzzing with flies in summer and awash with sewage in winter. The [[City of London Corporation|City Corporation]] employed "rakers" to remove the worst of the filth and it was transported to mounds outside the walls where it accumulated and continued to decompose. The stench was overwhelming and people walked around with handkerchiefs or [[nosegay]]s pressed against their nostrils.&lt;ref name=Leasor15&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the city's necessities such as coal arrived by [[barge]], but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and pedestrians were crowded together and the gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which it was difficult to progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used [[hackney carriage]]s and [[sedan chair]]s to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made [[soap]], from [[Brewery|breweries]] and iron [[Smelting|smelters]] and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.&lt;ref name=Leasor19&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the city walls, suburbs had sprung up providing homes for the craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city. These were [[shanty town]]s with wooden shacks and no sanitation. The government had tried to control this development but had failed and over a quarter of a million people lived here.&lt;ref name=Leasor27&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt; Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] who had fled the country during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.&lt;ref name=Leasor27&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Administration of the City of London was organised by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and common councillors, but not all  of the inhabited area generally comprising London was legally part of the City. Both inside the City and outside its boundaries there were also [[Liberty (division)|Liberties]], which were areas of varying sizes which historically had been granted rights to self-government. Many had been associated with religious institutions, and when these were abolished in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], their historic rights were transferred along with their property to new owners. The walled City was surrounded by a ring of Liberties which had come under its authority, contemporarily  called 'the City and Liberties', but these were surrounded by further suburbs with varying administrations. [[Westminster]] was an independent town with its own liberties, although it was joined to London by urban development.  The [[Tower of London]] was an independent liberty, as  were others. Areas north of the river not part of one of these administrations came under the authority of the county of [[Middlesex]], and south of the river under [[Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|"Woodcut" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]
At that time, bubonic plague was a much feared disease but its cause was not understood. The credulous blamed emanations from the earth, "pestilential effluviums", unusual weather, sickness in livestock, abnormal behaviour of animals or an increase in the numbers of moles, frogs, mice or flies.&lt;ref name=Leasor42&gt;Leasor (1962) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1894 that the identification by [[Alexandre Yersin]] of its causal agent ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' was made and the transmission of the [[bacterium]] by [[Oriental rat flea|rat fleas]] became known.&lt;ref name="Bockemühl_1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bockemühl J |title=100 years after the discovery of the plague-causing agent—importance and veneration of Alexandre Yersin in Vietnam today |journal=Immun Infekt |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=72–5 |year=1994 |pmid = 7959865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Great Plague in London had long been believed to be bubonic plague caused by ''Yersinia pestis'', this was only definitively confirmed by DNA analysis in 2016.&lt;ref name=stanbridge2016&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37287715|title=DNA confirms cause of 1665 London's Great Plague|last=Stanbridge|first=Nicola|date=2016-09-08|website=BBC News|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third pandemic of the plague started in 1855 in China and eventually killed about 15 million people, mainly in India. In 1894, the plague hit [[Hong Kong]], a major trade port between China and US.

==The recording of deaths==
{{more|Searcher of the dead}}
In order to judge the severity of an epidemic, it is first necessary to know how big the population was in which it occurred.  There was no official census of the population to  provide this figure, and the best contemporary  count comes from the work of [[John Graunt]] (1620–1674), who was  one of the earliest [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellows of the Royal Society]] and one of the first  [[Demography|demographer]]s, bringing a scientific approach to the collection of statistics. In 1662, he estimated  that 384,000 people lived in the City of London, the Liberties, Westminster and the out-parishes, based on figures in the  [[bills of mortality]] published each week in the capital. These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognised extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to 'not above 460,000'. Other contemporaries put the figure higher, (the French Ambassador, for example, suggested 600,000) but with no mathematical basis to support their estimates. The next largest city in the kingdom was Norwich, with a population of 30,000.&lt;ref name=Leasor27&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 24–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed. p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Infected [[Oriental rat flea]]. ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' bacteria appear as a dark mass in the gut. The bacteria block the flea's digestive system, leaving it hungry but unable to eat. Instead, when it tries to feed, it regurgitates ''Yersinia''  into the wound.]]
There was no duty to report a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish appointed two or more '[[searchers of the dead]]', whose duty was to inspect a corpse and determine the cause of death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty.&lt;ref name=Bellf10&gt;Bell Folio ed., p.&amp;nbsp;10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave, or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as [[Quakers]], [[Anabaptists]], other non-Anglican Christians or [[Jewish people|Jews]], frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart  from the community and stay indoors except when performing their duties, for fear of spreading the diseases. Outside they should avoid other people and always carry a white stick to warn of their occupation. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern.&lt;ref name=Bell10&gt;Bell folio ed., p.&amp;nbsp;10–11&lt;/ref&gt; The reported figures were used to compile the [[Bills of Mortality]], which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.&lt;ref name=Bellf12 /&gt;

Graunt recorded the incompetence of the Searchers at identifying true causes of death, remarking on the frequent recording of 'consumption' rather than other diseases which were recognised then by physicians. He suggested a cup of ale and a doubling of their fee to two groats rather than one was sufficient for Searchers to change the cause of death to one  more convenient for the householders. No one wished to be known as having had a death by plague in their household, and Parish Clerks, too, connived in covering up cases of plague in their official returns. Analysis of the Bills of Mortality during the months plague took hold shows a rise in deaths other than by plague well above the average death rate, which has been attributed to misrepresentation of the true cause of death.&lt;ref name=Bellf12&gt;Bell, Folio ed., p.12&lt;/ref&gt; As plague spread, a system of [[quarantine]] was introduced, whereby any house where someone had died from plague would be locked up and no one allowed to enter or leave for 40 days. This frequently led to the deaths of the other inhabitants, by neglect if not from plague, and provided ample incentive not to report the disease. The official returns record 68,596 cases of plague, but a reasonable estimate suggests this figure is 30,000 short of the true total.&lt;ref name="Bell Folio ed p 13"&gt;Bell, Folio ed. p.13&lt;/ref&gt; A plague house was marked with a red cross on the door with the words "Lord have mercy upon us", and a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|watchman]] stood guard outside.&lt;ref name=Leasor27/&gt;

==Preventive measures==

Reports of plague around Europe began to reach England in the 1660s, causing the Privy Council to  consider what steps might be taken to prevent it crossing to England. Quarantining of ships had been used during previous outbreaks and was again introduced for ships coming to London in November 1663, following outbreaks in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Hamburg]].  Two naval ships were assigned to intercept any vessels entering the Thames estuary. Ships from infected ports were  required to moor at Hole Haven on [[Canvey Island]] for a period of 30 days before being allowed to travel upriver. Ships from ports free of plague or completing their quarantine were given a certificate of health and allowed to travel on.  A second inspection line was established  between the forts on opposite banks of the Thames at [[Tilbury]] and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] with instructions only to pass ships with a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

The duration of quarantine was increased to forty days in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to quarantine changed with the news of the spread of plague to include all of [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]] and [[Lordship of Frisia|Friesland]] (all regions of the [[Dutch Republic]]), although restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, commencing with [[Great Yarmouth]]. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it had been one of the last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;117–119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak==
{{Main|Plague of Justinian|Black Death|Third plague pandemic}}
Plague was one of the hazards of life in Britain from its dramatic appearance in 1348 with the Black Death. The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating  in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the 'Great Plague', Until 1665, surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed., p.&amp;nbsp;3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early days===
[[File:Rattus norvegicus 1.jpg|thumb|right|''Rattus rattus'', the Black Rat. Smaller than the Norwegian rat, which later supplanted it, it is also keener to live near to humankind. Timber houses and overcrowded slums provided great homes. The link between the rat as reservoir of infection and host to fleas which could transfer to man was not understood. Efforts were made to eliminate cats and dogs but not rats. If anything, this encouraged the rats.]]
Although plague was known, it was still sufficiently uncommon that medical practitioners might have had no personal experience of seeing the disease; medical training varied from those who had attended the college of physicians, to apothecaries who also acted as modern doctors, to simple charlatans. Other diseases abounded, such as an outbreak of smallpox the year before, and these uncertainties all added to difficulties identifying the true start of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary accounts suggest cases of plague occurred through the winter of 1664/5, some of which were fatal but a number of which did not display the virulence of the later epidemic. The winter was cold, the ground frozen from December to March, river traffic on the Thames twice blocked by ice, and it may be that the cold weather held back its spread.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed., pp. 7,8&lt;/ref&gt;

This outbreak of bubonic plague in England is thought to have spread from the [[Netherlands]], where the disease had been occurring intermittently since 1599. It is unclear exactly where the disease first struck but the initial contagion may have arrived with Dutch trading ships carrying bales of [[cotton]] from [[Amsterdam]], which was ravaged by the disease in 1663–1664, with a mortality given of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Appleby, Andrew B. |year=1980 |title=The Disappearance of Plague: A Continuing Puzzle |journal=The Economic History Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=161–173 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.1980.tb01821.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first areas to be struck  are believed to be the [[Dock (maritime)|dock]] areas just outside London, and the parish of [[St Giles in the Fields]]. In both of these localities, poor workers were crowded into ill-kept structures. Two suspicious deaths were recorded in St. Giles [[parish]] in 1664 and another in February 1665. These did not appear as plague deaths on the [[Bills of Mortality]], so no control measures were taken by the authorities, but the total number of people dying in London during the first four months of 1665 showed a marked increase. By the end of April, only four plague deaths had been recorded, two in the parish of St. Giles, but total deaths per week had risen from around 290 to 398.&lt;ref name=Leasor50&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 46–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there had been only three official cases in April, which level of plague in earlier years had not induced any official response, the Privy Council now acted to introduce household quarantine. Justices of the Peace in Middlesex were instructed to investigate any suspected cases  and to shut up the house if it was confirmed. Shortly after, a similar order was issued by the King's Bench to the City and Liberties. A riot broke out in St. Giles when the first house was sealed up; the crowd broke down the door and released the inhabitants. Rioters caught were punished severely. Instructions were given to build pest-houses, which were essentially isolation hospitals built away from other people where the sick could be cared for (or stay until they died). This official activity suggests that despite the few recorded cases, the government was already aware that this was a serious outbreak of plague.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed., p.14,15&lt;/ref&gt;

With the arrival of warmer weather, the disease began to take a firmer hold. In the week 2–9 May, there were three recorded deaths in the parish of St Giles, four in neighbouring [[St Clement Danes]] and one each in [[St Andrew, Holborn]] and [[St Mary Woolchurch Haw]].&lt;ref name="Bell Folio ed p 13"/&gt; Only the last was actually inside the city walls. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate methods to best prevent the spread of plague, and measures were introduced to close some of the ale houses in affected areas and limit the number of lodgers allowed in a household. In the city, the Lord Mayor issued a proclamation that all householders must diligently clean the streets outside their property, which was a householder's responsibility, not a state one (the city employed scavengers and rakers to remove the worst of the mess). Matters just became worse, and Aldermen were instructed to find and punish those failing their duty.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed., p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; As cases in St. Giles began to rise, an attempt  was made to quarantine the area and constables were instructed to inspect everyone wishing to travel and  contain inside vagrants or suspect persons.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Folio ed., p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

People began to be alarmed. [[Samuel Pepys]], who had an important position at the [[Admiralty]], stayed in London and provided a contemporary account of the plague through his diary.&lt;ref name=Leasor62&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April he wrote: "Great fears of the sickness here in the City it being said that two or three houses are already shut up. God preserve us all!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pepys |first=Samuel |chapter=April 30th |chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys/1665/April#April_30th |title=Diary of Samuel Pepys |year=1665 |isbn=0-520-22167-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of information on the time is a fictional account, ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'', which was  written by [[Daniel Defoe]] and published in 1722. He had been only six when the plague struck but made use of his family's recollections (his uncle was a saddler in East London and his father a butcher in [[Cripplegate]]), interviews with survivors and sight of such official records as were available.&lt;ref name=Leasor47&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 47, 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exodus from the city===
By July 1665, plague was rampant in the City of London. The rich ran away including King [[Charles II of England]], his family and his court left the city for [[Salisbury]], moving on to [[Oxford]]  in September when some cases of plague occurred in Salisbury.&lt;ref name=Leasor103&gt;Leasor (1962) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The [[aldermen]] and most of the other city authorities opted to stay at their posts. The [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|Lord Mayor of London]], [[John Lawrence (Lord Mayor)|Sir John Lawrence]], also decided to stay in the city. Businesses were closed when merchants and professionals fled. Defoe wrote "Nothing was to be seen but wagons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, coaches filled with people of the better sort, and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away".&lt;ref name=Leasor62/&gt; As the plague raged throughout the summer, only a small number of [[clergymen]], [[physician]]s and [[apothecaries]] remained to cope with an increasingly large number of victims. Edward Cotes, author of ''London's Dreadful Visitation'', expressed the hope that "Neither the Physicians of our Souls or Bodies may hereafter in such great numbers forsake us".&lt;ref name=Leasor62/&gt;

The poorer people were also alarmed by the contagion and some left the city, but it was not easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.&lt;ref name=Leasor69&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 66–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height of the epidemic===
[[File:Bill of Mortality.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A ''bill of mortality'' for the plague in 1665]]
In the last week of July, the London Bill of Mortality showed 3,014 deaths, of which 2,020 had died from the plague. The number of deaths as a result of plague may have been underestimated, as deaths in other years in the same period were much lower, at around 300. As the number of victims affected mounted up, burial grounds became overfull, and pits were dug to accommodate the dead. Drivers of dead-carts travelled the streets calling "Bring out your dead" and carted away piles of bodies. The authorities became concerned that the number of deaths might cause public alarm and ordered that body removal and interment should take place only at night.&lt;ref name=Leasor145&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 141–145&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, there were too many victims, and too few drivers, to remove the bodies which began to be stacked up against the walls of houses. Daytime collection was resumed and the plague pits became mounds of decomposing corpses. In the parish of Aldgate, a great hole was dug near the churchyard, fifty feet long and twenty feet wide. Digging was continued by labourers at one end while the dead-carts tipped in corpses at the other. When there was no room for further extension it was dug deeper until ground water was reached at twenty feet. When finally covered with earth it housed 1,114 corpses.&lt;ref name=Leasor175&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plague doctor]]s traversed the streets diagnosing victims, although many of them had no formal medical training. Several [[public health]] efforts were attempted. Physicians were hired by city officials and burial details were carefully organized, but panic spread through the city and, out of the fear of contagion, people were hastily buried in overcrowded pits. The means of transmission of the disease were not known but thinking they might be linked to the animals, the City Corporation ordered a cull of dogs and cats.&lt;ref&gt;Moote, Lloyd and Dorothy: ''The Great Plague: the Story of London's most Deadly Year'', Baltimore, 2004. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; This decision may have affected the length of the epidemic since those animals could have helped keep in check the rat population carrying the fleas which transmitted the disease. Thinking bad air was involved in transmission, the authorities ordered giant bonfires to be burned in the streets and house fires to be kept burning night and day, in hopes that the air would be cleansed.&lt;ref name=Leasor169&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 166–169&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco was thought to be a [[Prophylaxis#Prophylaxis|prophylactic]] and it was later said that no London [[tobacconist]] had died from the plague during the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Plague |last=Porter |first=Stephen |year=2009 |publisher=Amberley Publishing |isbn=978-1-84868-087-6 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2EBkPNnUXEC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Great%20Plague%22%20tobacco }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade and business had completely dried up, and the streets were empty of people except for the dead-carts and the desperate dying victims, as witnessed and recorded by Samuel Pepys in his diary: " Lord! How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick people in the streets full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Concise Pepys|last=Pepys|first=Samuel|publisher=Wordsworth Editions Ltd|year=1996|isbn=978-1853264788|location=|pages=363, 16 September 1665|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That people did not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] who arranged for a commission of one [[Farthing (English coin)|farthing]] to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London.&lt;ref name=Leasor101&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in a bucket of water to "disinfect" the coins.&lt;ref name=Leasor101&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt;

Records state that plague deaths in London and the suburbs crept up over the summer from 2,000 people per week to over 7,000 per week in September. These figures are likely to be a considerable underestimate. Many of the sextons and parish clerks who kept the records themselves died. [[Quakers]] refused to co-operate and many of the poor were just dumped into mass graves unrecorded. It is not clear how many people caught the disease and made a recovery because only deaths were recorded and many records were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] the following year. In the few districts where intact records remain, plague deaths varied between 30% and over 50% of the total population.&lt;ref name=Leasor156&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

Although concentrated in London, the outbreak affected other areas of the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of [[Eyam]] in [[Derbyshire]]. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coleman, Michel P. |year=1986 |title=A Plague Epidemic in Voluntary Quarantine |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=379–385 |doi=10.1093/ije/15.3.379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{See also|Great Fire of London}}
By late autumn, the death toll in London and the suburbs began to slow until, in February 1666, it was considered safe enough for the King and his entourage to come back to the city. With the return of the monarch, others began to return: The gentry returned in their carriages accompanied by carts piled high with their belongings. The judges moved back from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] to sit in [[Westminster Hall]], although [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], which had been [[Legislative session|prorogued]] in April 1665, did not reconvene until September 1666. Trade recommenced and businesses and workshops opened up. London was the goal of a new wave of people who flocked to the city in expectation of making their fortunes. Writing at the end of March 1666, [[Lord Clarendon]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], stated "...&amp;nbsp;the streets were as full, the Exchange as much crowded, the people in all places as numerous as they had ever been seen&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name=Leasor196&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 193–196&lt;/ref&gt;

Plague cases continued to occur sporadically at a modest rate until the summer of 1666. On the second and third of September that year, the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the City of London, and some people believed that the fire put an end to the epidemic. However, it is now thought that the plague had largely subsided before the fire took place. In fact, most of the later cases of plague were found in the suburbs,&lt;ref name=Leasor196/&gt; and it was the City of London itself that was destroyed by the Fire.&lt;ref name=Leasor251&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bills of Mortality, there were in total 68,596 deaths in London from the plague in 1665. Lord Clarendon estimated that the true number of mortalities was probably twice that figure. The next year, 1666, saw further deaths in other cities but on a lesser scale. [[Thomas Gumble|Dr Thomas Gumble]], chaplain to the [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|Duke of Albemarle]], both of whom had stayed in London for the whole of the epidemic, estimated that the total death count for the country from plague during 1665 and 1666 was about 200,000.&lt;ref name="Leasor196"/&gt;

The Great Plague of 1665/1666 was the last major outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Great Britain. The last recorded death from plague came in 1679, and it was removed as a specific category in the Bills of Mortality after 1703. It spread to other towns in East Anglia and the southeast of England but fewer than ten percent of parishes outside London had a higher than average death rate during those years. Urban areas were more affected than rural ones; Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Southampton and Winchester were badly affected, while the West of England and areas of the Midlands escaped altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of England in 1650 was approximately 5.25 million, which declined  to about 4.9 million by 1680, recovering to just over 5 million by 1700. Other diseases, such as smallpox, took a high toll on the population even without the contribution by plague. The higher death rate in cities, both generally and specifically from the plague, was made up by continuous immigration, from small towns to larger ones and from the countryside to the town.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no contemporary censuses of London's population, but available records suggest that the population returned to its previous level within a couple of years.  Burials in 1667 had returned to 1663 levels, Hearth Tax returns had recovered, John Graunt contemporarily analysed baptism records and concluded they represented a recovered population. Part of this could be accounted for by the return of wealthy households, merchants and manufacturing industries, all of which needed to replace losses among their staff and took steps to bring in necessary people. Colchester had suffered  more severe depopulation, but manufacturing records for cloth suggested that production had recovered or even increased by 1669, and the total population had nearly returned to pre-plague levels by 1674. Other towns did less well: Ipswich was affected less than Colchester, but in 1674, its population had dropped by 18%, more than could be accounted for by the plague deaths alone.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;148–150&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2018}}

As a proportion of the population who died, the London death toll was less severe than in a number of other towns. The total of deaths in London was greater than in any previous outbreak for 100 years, though as a proportion of the population, the epidemics in 1563, 1603 and 1625 were comparable or greater. Perhaps around 2.5% of the English population died.&lt;ref&gt;Porter 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The plague in London largely affected the poor, as the rich were able to leave the city by either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin in other parts of the country. The subsequent [[Great Fire of London]], however, ruined many city merchants and property owners.&lt;ref name="Leasor196"/&gt; As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/source.aspx?pubid=351 |title=An Act for rebuilding the City of London |work=Statutes of the Realm: volume 5 - 1628–80, pp.603–612 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a greater sense of community after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.&lt;ref name=Leasor271&gt;Leasor (1962) pp. 269–271&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by [[Robert Hooke]] as Surveyor of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jX8ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=rebuilding+of+london|title=The Rebuilding of London After the Great Fire |publisher=Thomas Fiddian |year=1940 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]] was involved in the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and more than [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|fifty London churches]].&lt;ref name=Hart&gt;{{cite book |author=Hart, Vaughan |year=2002 |title=Nicholas Hawksmoor: Rebuilding Ancient Wonders |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-09699-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles II of England|King Charles ll]] did much to foster the rebuilding work. He was a patron of the arts and sciences and founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] and supported the [[Royal Society]], a scientific group whose early members included [[Robert Hooke]], [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Sir Isaac Newton]]. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a [[English Renaissance|renaissance]] in the arts and sciences in England.&lt;ref name=Leasor271/&gt;

[[Plague pit]]s have been archaeologically excavated during underground construction work. Between 2011 and 2015, some 3,500 burials from the '[[New Churchyard]]' or 'Bethlam burial ground' were discovered during the construction of the [[Crossrail]] railway at Liverpool Street.&lt;ref name=stanbridge2016/&gt;  ''Yersinia pestis'' DNA was found in the teeth of individuals found buried in pits at the site, confirming they had died of bubonic plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Habiba Msika''', also spelled Messika (حبيبة مسيكة), (born 1903 Testour – February 21, 1930 Tunis), was a Tunisian singer, dancer and actress. 
Born Marguerite Msika, she was the niece of singer [[Leila Sfez]].

She quickly climbed the ladder of fame under the pseudonym Habiba ("beloved"). Prototype of the free, and master of her destiny, charismatic singer and daring actress, adored by Aboriginal Tunisian population, Msika was a social phenomenon in her time. The film ''[[The Fire Dance]]'' by [[Salma Baccar]] talks about her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yv1BH5Wz-ekC&amp;pg=PA378&amp;dq=Habiba+Msika&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj69aza3rbKAhXMWz4KHZJIBgYQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Habiba%2520Msika&amp;f=false|publisher = American Univ in Cairo Press|date = 2005-01-01|isbn = 9789774249433|first = Rebecca|last = Hillauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

=== Youth ===
She was born in the Jewish quarter of Tunis in a poor family. His parents, Daida and Maïha, worked in the wire trade.

She learned to read and write in the school of the Israelite covenant, which she left after seven years to follow, through the help of her aunt, singing lessons, music theory and classical Arabic with the famous composer [[Khemaïs Tarnane]] and Egyptian tenor [[Hassan Bannan]].

She married her cousin Victor Chetboun but their union lasted a short time.

Her first recital was held at the palace of [[El Marsa (Tunisia)|La Marsa]], where she met her Pygmalion and lover: the Minister de la Plume.

=== Career ===
It was from 1920 that her career took off; she became a sex symbol and initiated the phenomenon of "soldiers of the night", the nickname for her fans, mostly young dandies of Tunisia.

It was at this time that she went with her lover to Paris, where through him she met [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Coco Chanel]].

In March 1925, she played Romeo and Juliet at the Ben Kamla theatre.

=== End ===
On the morning of February 20, 1930, her former lover Eliyahu Mimouni entered her apartment in Alfred Durand-Claye street in Tunis, and attacked her. Badly burned, she died the next day, followed soon after by Mimouni. Msika is buried in the cemetery of Borgel in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Rough Guide to Tunisia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k2By-NdV93AC&amp;pg=PR127&amp;dq=Habiba+Msika&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY6cWt3rbKAhVDWj4KHUxVAwoQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Habiba%2520Msika&amp;f=false|publisher = Rough Guides|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9781858287485|first = Daniel|last = Jacobs|first2 = Peter|last2 = Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hervé de Portzmoguer''' (c1470–1512), known as "'''Primauguet'''", was a [[Breton people|Breton]] naval commander, renowned for his raids on the English and his death in the [[Battle of St. Mathieu]].

==Raids==
Portzmoguer participated in armed convoys, protecting merchant ships from pirates and enemy warships at a time when France was often in conflict with England. He also looted foreign ships. In 1506 he was convicted of looting a Scottish ship.

From [[Morlaix]] he harassed English ships, which earned complaints from the Ambassador of England who wrote to the King of France that "more than thirty vessels" had been captured and looted by Portzmoguer. In retaliation, the troops of [[Edward Howard (admiral)|Admiral Edward Howard]] looted and burned Portzmoguer's mansion in the spring of 1512.

His motto is said to have been «War vor ha war zouar» ([[Breton language|Breton]] for "On sea and on land").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netmarine.net/bat/fregates/primaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701012241/http://netmarine.net/bat/fregates/primaug/index.htm |archivedate=2014-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Combat de la Cordelière.jpg|thumb|The sinking of the ''Cordelière'' and the ''Regent'', painting by [[Pierre-Julien Gilbert]], 1838.]]
On 10 August 1512 he went down with his ship ''Marie de la Cordelière'' in the [[Battle of St. Mathieu]], when it blew up in a struggle with the English ship ''Regent''. Both ships were sunk. Almost all the crew were killed. The incident immediately became famous. The French poet-scholar [[Germain de Brie]] wrote a Latin poem which portrayed de Portzmoguer in such an ultra-heroic light that the English writer with [[Thomas More]] attacked it mercilessly.&lt;ref name="Tournoy1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tournoy|first=Gilbert|title=Humanistica Lovaniensia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCXp0xAxKbQC&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=1980-06-30|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=9789061861072|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marius1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marius|first=Richard|title=Thomas More: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdAYSzj20t0C&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=9 August 2012|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674885257|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his epigrams addressed to de Brie, More ridiculed the poem's description of "Hervé fighting indiscriminately with four weapons and a shield; perhaps the fact slipped your mind, but your reader ought to have been informed in advance that Hervé had five hands.&lt;ref name="Marius1999"/&gt;

The explosion that killed de Portzmoguer was subsequently portrayed as a deliberate act of self-sacrificing heroism. He is supposed to have said "Nous allons fêter saint Laurent qui périt par le feu!". ("we will celebrate the feast of [[Saint Lawrence]], who died by fire") before blowing up the ship to avoid its otherwise inevitable capture by the English.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Leguay.

The Breton poet [[Théodore Botrel]] wrote a heroic poem about this version of the incident. An equally heroic version is portrayed [[Alan Simon (musician)|Alan Simon]] in the song ''Belle Marie de la Cordelière'' in his rock opera ''[[Anne de Bretagne (rock opera)|Anne de Bretagne]]'' (2008).

A '''home birth''' is a birth that takes place in a residence rather than in a [[hospital]] or a [[birthing center|birth centre]].  They may be attended by a midwife, or lay attendant with experience in managing home births. Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the de facto method of delivery. Since the beginning of the 20th century, home birth rates have fallen in most developed countries, often to less than 1% of all births. Infant and mother mortality rates have also dropped drastically over the same time period and initially, assumptions were made that these findings were linked, as reflected in the UK Government's Peel Report (DoH 1970).{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} Epidemiological work later identified there were no causal links, with improvements in mortality linked primarily to improvements in income and general health. Analysis which controlled for socioeconomic factors and for whether birth was planned and attended or unplanned and unattended identified that outcomes of planned home birth were positive.&lt;ref&gt;Macfarlane and Mugford 1984&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Tew 1985&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Campbell and Macfarlane 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, by this time, the view that birth should take place in hospital had become more normalised.

Women with access to high-quality medical care may choose home birth because they prefer the intimacy of a home and family-centered experience, or they desire to avoid a medically-centered experience typical of a hospital, among other reasons. Professionals attending home births can be [[obstetricians]], certified or uncertified [[midwives]], and [[doulas]]. In [[developing countries]], where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind. In some cases, therefore, an unattended home birth may be unplanned (owing to lack of access to care or lack of easy access to a facility for birth) or chosen (often called [freebirth]). The latter tends to occur in women seeking to avoid repeat of previous traumatic birth experiences in facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Feeley and Thomson 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Multiple studies have been performed concerning the safety of home births for both the child and the mother. Standard practices, licensing requirements and access to emergency hospital care differ between countries, and in countries like the US, between regions, making it difficult to compare studies across national borders. A 2014 US systematic review and meta-analysis of studies concluded that neonatal mortality rates were triple that of hospital births (Wax et al 2010), but the methodology has been subject to critical review on the basis of inclusion of studies with poor controls.&lt;ref&gt;Gyte et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} A US-wide cohort study of planned home or hospital births from 2004-2009&lt;ref&gt;Cheyney et al 2014 JMWH&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} concluded that there were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes but a lower intervention rate for mothers planning a home birth. A US registry-based study of all planned births in Oregon 2012-2013 (Snowden et al NEJM 2015) concluded that adverse outcome rates in low-risk women were low but births planned at home were associated with a higher rate of perinatal death and neonatal seizures when compared to planned birth in hospitals. However, this study relied on retrospective routine data and failed to control for differences in service provision, such as unlicensed midwives attending a proportion of home births and lack of integration of midwifery services in Oregon state). Conversely, a more recent study of integration of midwifery services in the US&lt;ref&gt;Vedam et al. 2018 PLOSone&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} found that mortality rates and rates of preterm or low-birthweight births were lower in states with integrated midwifery services, in addition to lower rates of obstetric intervention and higher rates of physiological birth. A large-scale prospective cohort study of outcomes of births planned in home, obstetric hospital or midwifery unit settings in England found lower rates of intervention in all midwife-led settings and no differences in adverse neonatal outcome. However, although rates were very low overall, there was an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes for first births planned at home.&lt;ref&gt;Birthplace Collaborative Group 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=May 2018}} Optimal outcomes in this study were found with freestanding midwifery units, which are units separate from a hospital with an obstetric unit, which are managed by midwives and intended primarily for the care of women with healthy pregnancies. 
Variations in study findings are likely to be associated with the inability to offer timely assistance to mothers with emergency procedures in case of complications during labour in settings with low levels of service integration or lack of universal access to care, as well as with widely varying licensing and training standards for birth attendants between different states and countries.

==Types==

Home births are either attended or unattended, planned or unplanned. Women are attended when they are assisted through labor and birth by a professional, usually a [[midwife]], and rarely a [[general practitioner]]. Women who are unassisted or only attended by a lay person, perhaps their spouse, family, friend, or a non-professional [[doula|birth attendant]], are sometimes called [[freebirth]]s. A "planned" home birth is a birth that occurs at home by intention. An "unplanned" home birth is one that occurs at home by necessity but not with intention. Reasons for unplanned home births include  inability to travel to the hospital or birthing center due to conditions outside the control of the mother such as weather or road blockages or speed of birth progression.&lt;ref name="plannedDef"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Vedam|first = S.|date = 2003|title = Home Birth versus Hospital Birth: Questioning the Quality of the Evidence on Safety|url =|journal = Birth|issue = 30 (1)|pages =57–63|doi = 10.1046/j.1523-536X.2003.00218.x|pmid =|access-date =|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors===

Many women choose home birth because delivering a baby in familiar surroundings is important to them.&lt;ref name=bourcher/&gt; Others choose home birth because they dislike a hospital or birthing center environment, do not like a medically centered birthing experience, are concerned about exposing the infant to hospital-borne [[pathogens]], or dislike the presence of strangers at the birth. Others prefer home birth because they feel it is more natural and less stressful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Vernon, David |title=Men at Birth|publisher=Australian College of Midwives |location=Canberra |year=2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  In a study published in the ''Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health'', women were asked, ''Why did you choose a home birth?'' The top five reasons given were safety, avoidance of unnecessary medical interventions common in hospital births, previous negative hospital experiences, more control, and a comfortable and familiar environment.&lt;ref name=bourcher&gt;{{cite journal|title= Staying Home to Give Birth: Why Women in the United States Choose Home Birth |journal= [[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]]| volume=54|issue=2|date= March–April 2009|pages=119–126|author= Debora Boucher |author2=Catherine Bennett |author3=Barbara McFarlin |author4=Rixa Freeze |doi=10.1016/j.jmwh.2008.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that women experience pain inherent in birth differently, and less negatively, in a home setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Home birth and hospital deliveries: A comparison of the perceived painfulness of parturition| author=Morse J |author2=Park C. |date=June 1988 |volume= 11|number=3|pages=175–81 |doi=10.1002/nur.4770110306 |journal=Research in Nursing &amp; Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developing countries]], where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Montagu|first=Dominic |author2=Yamey G |author3=Visconti A |author4=Harding, April |author5=Yoong, Joanne |author6=Mock, Nancy|title=Where Do Poor Women in Developing Countries Give Birth?

There are some medical conditions that can prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth. These often include heart disease, renal disease, diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, placenta abruption, antepartum hemorrhage after 20 weeks gestation, and active genital herpes. Prior cesarean deliveries can sometimes prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth, though not always. It is important that a woman and her health care provider discuss the individual health risks prior to planning a home birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boucher |first1=D. |last2=Bennett |first2=C. |last3=McFarlin |first3=B |last4=Freeze |first4=R. |date=2009 |title=Staying Home to Give Birth: Why women in the United States choose home birth |journal=[[Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health]] |issue=54 |pages=119–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the ''de facto'' method of delivery.&lt;ref name="compleat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compleatmother.com/homebirth/hb_safety.htm|title=Homebirth: as Safe as Birth Gets|last= Cryns |first=Yvonne Lapp |year=1995|publisher=The Compleat Mother Magazine|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developed countries, home birth declined rapidly over the 20th century. In the United States there was a large shift towards hospital births beginning around 1900, when close to 100% of births were at home. Rates fell to 50% in 1938 and to fewer than 1% in 1955. Since 2000 a shift back towards home births has brought the rate up from 0.54% in 2004 to 0.72% in 2009.&lt;ref name="birthrates"&gt;{{cite book|last = Cassidy|first = Tina|title =  Birth|publisher= Atlantic Monthly Press|location= New York|year= 2006|pages = 54–55 |isbn = 0-87113-938-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDCstats"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db84.htm |title=Home Births in the United States, 1990–2009 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |date=January 2012 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom a similar but slower trend happened with approximately 80% of births occurring at home in the 1920s and only 1% in 1991. In Japan the change in birth location happened much later, but much faster: home birth was at 95% in 1950, but only 1.2% in 1975.&lt;ref name="birthrates"/&gt; Over a similar time period, maternal mortality during childbirth fell during 1900 to 1997 from 6–9 deaths per thousand to 0.077 deaths per thousand, while the infant mortality rate dropped between 1915 and 1997 from around 100 deaths per thousand births to 7.2 deaths per thousand.&lt;ref name="JMEstudy"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |author1=Lachlan de Crespigny |author2=Julian Savulescu |title=Homebirth and the Future Child |url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2013/10/08/medethics-2012-101258.full.pdf+html |date=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One doctor described birth in a working class home in the 1920s:

{{quote|You find a bed that has been slept on by the husband, wife and one or two children; it has frequently been soaked with urine, the sheets are dirty, and the patient's garments are soiled, she has not had a bath. Instead of sterile dressings you have a few old rags or the discharges are allowed to soak into a nightdress which is not changed for days.&lt;ref name=shorter&gt;{{cite book| title=A History of Women's Bodies |author=Edward Shorter |publisher=Basic Books |year= 1982| isbn=0-465-03029-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p156}}}}

This experience is contrasted with a 1920s hospital birth by Adolf Weber:

{{quote|The mother lies in a well-aired disinfected room, light and sunlight stream unhindered through a high window and you can make it light as day electrically too. She is well bathed and freshly clothed on linen sheets of blinding whiteness... You have a staff of assistants who respond to every signal... Only those who have to repair a perineum in a cottar's house in a cottar's bed with the poor light and help at hand can realize the joy.&lt;ref name=shorter/&gt;{{rp|157}} }}

[[Midwifery]], the practice supporting a natural approach to birth, enjoyed a revival in the United States during the 1970s. [[Ina May Gaskin]], for example, sometimes called "the mother of authentic midwifery"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/01/gaskin/|title=The midwife of modern midwifery|last=Granju|first=Katie Allison|website=Salon|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped open The Farm Midwifery Center in Summertown, Tennessee in 1971, which is still in operation. However, although there was a steep increase in midwife-attended births between 1975 and 2002 (from less than 1.0% to 8.1%), most of these births occurred in the hospital. The US rate of out-of-hospital birth has remained steady at 1% of all births since 1989, with data from 2007 showing that 27.3% of the home births since 1989 took place in a free-standing [[birthing center|birth center]] and 65.4% in a residence. Hence, the actual rate of home birth in the United States remained low (0.65%) over the twenty years prior to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Martin, JA |title=Births: Final Data for 2005|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr56/nvsr56_06.pdf |work=CDC National Vital Statistics Report |volume=56|number= 6|date=December 5, 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home birth in the United Kingdom has also received some press since 2000. There was a movement, most notably in Wales, to increase home birth rates to 10% by 2007. Between 2005 and 2006, there was an increase of 16% of home birth rates in Wales, but by 2007 the total home birth rate was still 3% even in Wales (double the national rate). A 2001 report noted that there was a wide range of home birth rates in the UK, with some regions around 1% and others over 20%.&lt;ref name=NHS_Northampton&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Bobby|last2=Richley|first2=Anne|title=Homebirth Guidelines|url=http://www.northamptongeneral.nhs.uk/Downloads/FOI/Disclosures/November2011/298/HomebirthGuideline.pdf|website=www.northamptongeneral.nhs.uk/|publisher=NHS Trust - Northampton General Hospital|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, birth at home has fallen steadily over the years and was 0.3% as of 2008, ranging from nearly 1% in the [[Northern Territory]] to 0.1% in [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Perinatal Statistics Unit |year=2008 |title=Australia's mothers and babies 2006, Perinatal statistics series no. 22, Cat. no.

In the Netherlands, the trend has been somewhat different from other industrialized countries: while in 1965, two-thirds of Dutch births took place at home, that figure has dropped to about 20% in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22888411 | work=BBC News | title=Home birth complications 'less common' than hospital | date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is still more than in other industrialized countries. Less than 1% of South Korean infants are born at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hancinema.net/actress-kim-se-ah-i-makes-case-for-natural-home-birth-23293.html|title=Actress Kim Se-ah-I Makes Case for Natural Home Birth|date=May 8, 2010|publisher=The Korean Movie and Drama Database|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research on safety ==

In 2014, a comprehensive review in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'' of 12 previously published studies encompassing 500,000 planned home births in low-risk women concluded that neonatal mortality rates for home births were triple those of hospital births.&lt;ref name="JMEstudy"/&gt; This finding echoes that of the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]].&lt;ref name=ACOG&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Obstetric_Practice/Planned_Home_Birth|title=Committee opinion, number 476:Planned home birth|accessdate=24 April 2012|author=Committee on obstetric practice|journal=Obstet Gynecol|volume=117|pages=425–8|issn=1074-861X|date=Feb 2011|pmid=21252776|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e31820eee20|issue=2 Pt 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a greater risk of perinatal death, the College advises women who are postterm (greater than 42 weeks gestation), carrying twins, or have a breech presentation not to attempt home birth.&lt;ref name=OBGYN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcp.obgyn.net/pregnancy-and-birth/content/article/1760982/1977662|title=The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issues opinion on planned home births|date=24 January 2011|work=OBGYN.net|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Medical Ethics'' review additionally found that several studies concluded that home births had a higher risk of failing [[Apgar score]]s in newborns, as well as a delay in diagnosing [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[acidosis]] and [[asphyxia]].&lt;ref name="JMEstudy"/&gt; This contradicts a 2007 UK review study by the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE), a British governmental organization devoted to creating guidelines for coverage throughout the UK, which expressed concern for the lack of quality evidence in studies comparing the potential risks and benefits of home and hospital birthing environments in the UK. Their report noted that intrapartum-related perinatal mortality was low in all settings in the UK, but that in cases of unanticipated obstetric complications, the mortality rate was higher for home births due to the time needed to transfer the mother to an obstetric unit.

{{quote|The uncertain evidence suggests intrapartum-related perinatal mortality (IPPM) for booked home births, regardless of their eventual place of birth, is the same as, or higher than for birth booked in obstetric units. If IPPM is higher, this is likely to be in the group of women in whom intrapartum complications develop and who require transfer into the obstetric unit.

A 2002 study of planned home births in [[Washington (state)|the state of Washington]] found that home births had shorter labors than hospital births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pang |first1=J. |last2=Heffelfinger |first2=J. |last3=Huang |first3=G. |date=2002 |title=Outcomes of planned home births in Washington State: 1989–1996 |journal=[[Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (journal)|Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology]] |issue=100 |pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, a 2005 study found that about 12 percent of women intending to give birth at home needed to be transferred to the hospital for reasons such as a difficult labor or pain relief.&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/briefs/pregnancy_infertility/hb050617a.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830022038/http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/briefs/pregnancy_infertility/hb050617a.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 30, 2008 |title=Home births |last=Goldstein |first=Samantha A. |date=June 17, 2005 |accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 survey of American home births between 2004 and 2010 found the percent of women transferred to a hospital from a planned home birth after beginning labor to be 10.9%.&lt;ref name="2014USsurvey"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cheyney |first=Melissa |title=Outcomes of Care for 16,924 Planned Home Births in the United States: The Midwives Alliance of North America Statistics Project, 2004 to 2009 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.12172/full |accessdate=April 12, 2014 |author2=Marit Bovbjerg |author3=Courtney Everson |author4=Wendy Gordon |author5=Darcy Hannibal |author6=Saraswathi Vedam |doi=10.1111/jmwh.12172 |date=January 30, 2014 |volume=59 |journal=Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health |pages=17–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the ''Journal of Medical Ethics'' and NICE report noted that usage of [[caesarean section]]s were lower for women who give birth at home, and both noted a prior study that determined that women who had a planned home birth had greater satisfaction from the experience when compared with women who had a planned birth in a hospital.&lt;ref name="NICE"&gt;{{cite web|work=National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health as Commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/IPC-cons-fullguideline.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312152705/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/IPC-cons-fullguideline.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 March 2012 |title=Final Draft of Guideline on Intrapartum Care |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |location=London |date=22 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a study of 500,000 low-risk planned home and hospital births in the UK, where midwives have a strong licensing requirement, was reported in the ''British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology''. The study concluded that for low-risk women there was no increase in perinatal mortality, provided that the midwives were well-trained and there was easy and quick access to hospitals. Further, the study noted there was evidence that "low risk women with a planned home birth are less likely to experience referral to secondary care and subsequent obstetric interventions than those with a planned hospital birth."&lt;ref name=dejonge&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Jonge A, van der Goes BY, Ravelli AC, Amelink-Verburg MP, Mol BW, Nijhuis JG, Bennebroek Gravenhorst J, Buitendijk SE |title=Perinatal mortality and morbidity in a nationwide cohort of 529688 low-risk planned home and hospital births |work=BJOG |year=2009|pmid=19624439 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2009.02175.x |volume=116 |issue=9 |pages=1177–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} The study has been criticised on several grounds, including that some data might be missing and that the findings may not be representative of other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/04April/Pages/HomeBirthSafe.aspx |title=Home birth Safe as in hospital |publisher=NHS Knowledge Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Oregon performed a study of all births in the state during the year as a part of discussing a bill regarding licensing requirements for midwives in the state. They found that the rate of intrapartum infant mortality was 0.6 deaths per thousand births for planned hospital births, and 4.8 deaths per thousand for planned home births. They further found that the death rate for planned home births attended by direct-entry midwives was 5.6 per thousand. The study noted that the statistics for Oregon were different for other areas, such as British Columbia, which had different licensing requirements.&lt;ref name="Oregonstudy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2013R1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/8585 |title=Committee Meeting Document 8585 |date=2013-03-15 |publisher=[[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon was noted by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as having the second-highest rate of home births in the nation in 2009, at 1.96% compared to the national average of 0.72%.&lt;ref name="CDCstats"/&gt; A 2014 survey of nearly 17,000 voluntarily-reported home births in the United States between 2004 and 2010 found an intrapartum infant mortality rate of 1.30 per thousand; early neonatal and late neonatal mortality rates were a further 0.41 and 0.35 per thousand. The survey excluded congenital anomaly-related deaths, as well as births where the mother was transferred to a hospital prior to beginning labor.&lt;ref name="2014USsurvey"/&gt;

In October 2013 the largest study of this kind was published in the [[American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology]] and included data on more than 13 million births in the United States, assessing deliveries by physicians and midwives in and out of the hospital from 2007 to 2010. The study indicated that babies born at home are roughly 10 times as likely to have an Apgar score of 0 after 5 minutes and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals. The study findings showed that the risk of Apgar scores of 0 is even greater in first-born babies—14 times the risk of hospital births. The study results were confirmed by analyzing birth certificate files from the [[U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) and the [[National Center for Health Statistics]]. Given the study's findings, Dr. Amos Grunebaum, professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] and lead author of the study, stated that the magnitude of risk associated with home delivery is so alarming that necessitates the need for the parents-to-be to know the risk factors. Another author, Dr. Frank Chervenak, added that the study underplayed the risks of home births, as the data used counted home births where the mother was transferred to a hospital during labor as a hospital birth.&lt;ref name="AJOG"&gt;{{cite web |work=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |url=http://weill.cornell.edu/news/pr/2013/09/birth-setting-study-signals-significant-risks-in-planned-home-birth.html |title=Birth Setting Study Signals Significant Risks in Planned Home Birth |publisher=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology |date= September 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AJOGstudy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0002-9378/PIIS0002937813006418.pdf |title=Apgar score of 0 at 5 minutes and neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction in relation to birth setting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When it comes to home births vs hospital births, home births are strongly associated with worse outcomes. The increased rate of adverse outcomes of home births exists despite the reported lower risk profile of home birth. [...] We emphasize that the increased risks of poor outcomes from the setting of home birth, regardless of attendant, are virtually impossible to solve by transport. This is because total time for transport from home to hospital cannot realistically be reduced to clinically satisfactory times to optimize outcome when time is of the essence when unexpected deterioration of the condition of either the fetal patient or pregnant patient occurs.&lt;ref name="AJOGstudy"/&gt;}}

===Study design===

Randomized [[blind experiment|controlled trials]] are the "gold standard" of research methodology with respect to applying findings to populations; however, such a study design is not feasible or ethical for location of birth. The studies that do exist, therefore, are [[cohort studies]] conducted retrospectively by selecting hospital records and midwife records.&lt;ref name="Woodcock"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Woodcock HC. |year=1994 |title=  A matched cohort study of planned home and hospital births in Western Australia 1981–1987|volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=125–135|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/0266-6138(94)90042-6 |journal=Midwifery}}&lt;/ref&gt; by matched pairs (by pairing study participants based on their background characteristics),&lt;ref name="Ackerman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackerman-Liebrich | first=U|year=1996| title=British Medical Journal|volume=313| pages=1313–1318|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] identified several factors that make quality research on home birth difficult. These include "lack of randomization; reliance on birth certificate data with inherent ascertainment problems; ascertainment of relying on voluntary submission of data or self-reporting; a limited ability to distinguish between planned and unplanned birth; variation in the skill, training, and certification of the birth attendant; and an inability to account for and accurately attribute adverse outcomes associated with transfers". Quality studies, therefore, need to take steps in their design to mitigate these problems in order to produce meaningful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=American Congress of Obstetricians |author2=Gynecologists [ACOG] |date=2011|title=Planned home birth.

The data available on the safety of home birth in developed countries is often difficult to interpret due to issues such as differing home-birth standards between different countries, and difficult to compare with other studies because of varying definitions of perinatal mortality.&lt;ref name="NICE"/&gt; Additionally, it is difficult to compare home and hospital births because only the risk profiles are different between the two groups, according to the CDC: people who choose to give birth at home are more likely to be healthy and at low risk for complications.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/la-he-themd9-2009nov09,0,3205320.story|title=The right place to deliver: home or hospital?|publisher=Chicago Tribune | first=Valerie|last=Ulene}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDCstats"/&gt; There are also unquantifiable differences in home birth patients, such as maternal attitudes towards medical involvement in birth.&lt;ref name=Woodcock /&gt;

==Insurance and Licensing Issues==

While a woman in developed countries may choose to deliver her child at home, in a birthing center, or at hospital, health coverage and legal issues influence available options.

===Australia===

In April 2007, the Western Australian Government expanded coverage for birth at home across the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2006/s1929033.htm |title=The Health Minister's controversial plan to encourage more home births}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other state governments in Australia, including the Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia, also provide government funding for independent, private home birth.

The 2009 Federal Budget provided additional funds to Medicare to allow more midwives to work as private practitioners, allow midwives to prescribe medication under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, and assist them with [[medical indemnity]] insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Improving Maternity Services Package |url=http://www.budget.gov.au/2009-10/content/bp2/html/bp2_expense-16.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this plan only covers hospital births. There are no current plans to extend Medicare and PBS funding to home birth services in Australia.

As of July 2012, all health professionals must show proof of liability insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Australian College for Midwives |url=http://www.midwives.org.au/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=MIDW/ccms.r?PageId=10055 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706125404/http://www.midwives.org.au/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=MIDW/ccms.r?PageId=10055 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=National Registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Public health coverage of home birth services varies from province to province as does the availability of doctors and midwives providing home birth services.

The noble Lord, Lord Mancroft, made some helpful remarks. As I understand it, although the NHS has a legal duty to provide a maternity service, there is not a similar legal duty to provide a home birth service to every woman who requests one. However, I certainly hope that when a woman wants a home birth, and it is clinically appropriate, the NHS will do all it can to support that woman in her choice of a home birth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/vo000112/text/00112-08.htm#00112-08_head0|title=Hansard 12 Jan 2000 : Column 743|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-185''''' (originally '''''I-85''''') was a [[Kaidai type submarine|''Kaidai'' type]] [[cruiser submarine]] of the KD7 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s. She was sunk with all hands by an American [[destroyer]] during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.

==Design and description==
The submarines of the KD7 sub-class were medium-range attack submarines developed from the preceding KD6 sub-class. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|1833|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} surfaced and {{Convert|2602|LT|t|0|disp=flip|sp=us}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|105.5|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|8.25|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.6|m|ftin|sp=us}}. The boats had a diving depth of {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a complement of 86 officers and crewmen.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Polmar, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|4000|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|900|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the KD7s had a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|50|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, all in the bow. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of a dozen [[torpedo]]es. They were originally intended to be armed with two twin-gun mounts for the [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|abbr=on|1}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]], but a [[Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval gun|{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface was substituted for one 25&amp;nbsp;mm mount during construction.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, pp. 183, 186&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and career==
Built by the [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], the boat was [[laid down]] on 9 February 1942&lt;ref name=hk/&gt; as ''I-85'' and renamed ''I-185'' in 1942. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 16 September 1943 and completed on 23 September.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt; The boat was sunk with the loss of all 95 officers and crewmen aboard by the destroyer {{USS|Newcomb|DD-586|6}} on 22 June 1944 near [[Saipan]]. ''I-185'' was stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 10 September 1944.&lt;ref name=hk&gt;Hackett &amp; Kingsepp&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Law, Legislation and Liberty''''' is the 1973 work in three volumes by Nobel laureate economist and political philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]]. In it, Hayek further develops the philosophical principles he discussed earlier in ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]'', and other writings. ''Law, Legislation and Liberty'' is more abstract than Hayek's earlier work, and it focuses on the conflicting views of society as either a design, a made order ("taxis"), on the one hand, or an emergent system, a grown order ("cosmos"), on the other. These ideas are then connected to two different forms of law: law proper, or "nomos" coinciding more or less with the traditional concept of [[natural law]], which is an [[emergent property]] of social interaction, and legislation, or "thesis", which is properly confined to the administration of non-coercive government services, but is easily confused with the occasional acts of legislature that do actually straighten out flaws in the nomos.

'''MV ''Joyita''''' was a [[merchant ship|merchant vessel]] from which 25 passengers and crew mysteriously disappeared in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]] in 1955. It was found adrift with no one aboard. The ship was in very poor condition, with corroded pipes and a radio which, while functional, had a range of only about {{convert|2|mi}}, because of faulty wiring. However, the extreme buoyancy of the ship made sinking nearly impossible. Investigators were puzzled as to why the crew had not remained on board and waited for help.

==Vessel description and history==

===Construction===
The {{convert|69|ft|m|adj=on|1}} wooden ship was built in 1931 as a [[luxury yacht]] by the Wilmington Boat Works in Los Angeles for [[movie director]] [[Roland West]], who named the ship for his wife, actress Jewel Carmenille — ''joyita'' in Spanish meaning "little jewel".&lt;ref name=DW1&gt;David Wright: "Joyita: Solving the mystery" pages 1&amp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 the ship was sold and registered to Milton E. Beacon.&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;David Wright: "Joyita: Solving the mystery" p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, she made numerous trips south to [[Mexico]] and to the 1939–1940 [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]]. During part of this time, Chester Mills was the skipper of the vessel.

The ship's hull was constructed of {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=on|0}}-thick cedar on oak frames. She was {{convert|69|ft|0|in|m|1}} long, with [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17|ft|0|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|7|ft|6|in|m|1}}; her [[net tonnage]] was 47 tons and her [[Gross register tonnage|gross tonnage]] approximately 70 tons. She had tanks for {{convert|2500|U.S.gal|litre|-2}} of water and {{convert|3000|U.S.gal|litre|-2}} of diesel fuel.&lt;ref name=DW2&gt;David Wright: "Joyita: Solving the mystery" p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Navy service in World War II===
[[File:Chief Body at the wheel of the Joyita.jpg|thumb|150px|Ship's wheelhouse in 1942]]

In October 1941, just before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Joyita'' was acquired by the [[United States Navy]] and taken to [[Pearl Harbor]], Hawaii, where she was outfitted as [[Yard patrol boat]] YP-108. The Navy used her to patrol the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of Hawaii until the end of [[World War II]]. In 1943 she [[Ship grounding|ran aground]] and was heavily damaged, but the Navy was in need of ships so she was repaired. At this point, new pipework was made from galvanized iron instead of copper or brass. In 1946, the ship was surplus to Navy requirements and most of its equipment was removed.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt;

===Private purchase===
In 1948 ''Joyita'' was sold to the firm of Louis Brothers. At this point, cork lining was added to the ship's hull along with refrigeration equipment.&lt;ref name="ref4"/&gt; The ship had two [[Gray Marine Motor Company|Gray Marine]] [[diesel engine]]s providing {{convert|225|hp|lk=in}}, and two extra diesel engines for generators.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;David Wright: "Joyita: Solving the mystery" p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 William Tavares became the owner; however, he had little use for the vessel, and sold it in 1952 to Dr [[Katharine Luomala]], a professor at the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; She chartered the boat to her friend, Captain Thomas H. "Dusty" Miller, a British-born sailor living in [[Samoa]]. Miller used the ship as a trading and [[fishing]] charter boat.

==Disappearance==

[[File:Joyita planned route map.png|thumbnail|Planned route and where ''Joyita'' was found]]
About 5:00 AM on October 3, 1955, ''Joyita'' left Samoa's [[Apia]] harbor bound for the [[Tokelau]] Islands, about {{convert|270|mi|km}} away.  The boat had been scheduled to leave on the noon tide the previous day but her departure was delayed because her port engine [[clutch]] failed. ''Joyita'' eventually left Samoa on one engine. She was carrying sixteen crew members and nine passengers, including a government official, a doctor (Alfred "Andy" Denis Parsons, a World War II surgeon on his way to perform an amputation), a [[copra]] buyer, and two children. Her cargo consisted of medical supplies, timber, 80 empty 45 gallon (200 l) oil drums and various foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="Remember"/&gt;

The voyage was expected to take between 41 and 48 hours. She was scheduled to return with a cargo of copra. ''Joyita'' was scheduled to arrive in the Tokelau Islands on October 5. On October 6 a message from [[Fakaofo]] port reported that the ship was overdue. No ship or land-based operator reported receiving a [[distress signal]] from the crew. A [[search and rescue]] mission was launched and, from 6 to 12 October, [[Short Sunderland|Sunderlands]] of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] covered a probability area of nearly {{convert|100,000|mi2|km2}} of ocean, but no sign of ''Joyita'' or any of her passengers or crew was found.

Five weeks later, on November 10, Gerald Douglas, captain of the merchant ship ''Tuvalu'', en route from [[Suva]] to [[Funafuti]], sighted ''Joyita'' more than {{convert|600|mi|km}} west from her scheduled route, drifting north of [[Vanua Levu]].&lt;ref name="Solvedd" /&gt;  The ship was partially submerged and listing heavily (her port deck rail was awash) and there was no trace of any of the passengers or crew; four tons of [[cargo]] were also missing. The recovery party noted that the radio was discovered tuned to [[2182 kHz]], the international marine [[radiotelephone]] distress channel.

[[File:MV Joyita 1955 port.jpg|thumb|250px|Wreck seen from port side]]
* [[Barnacle]] growth high above the usual waterline on the port side showed that ''Joyita'' had been listing heavily for some time.
* There was some damage to the [[superstructure]]. Her [[flying bridge]] had been smashed away and the deckhouse had light damage and broken windows. A canvas [[awning]] had been rigged on top of the deckhouse behind the [[bridge (ship)|bridge]].
* ''Joyita'' carried a [[dinghy]] and three [[Carley float|Carley liferafts]],&lt;ref name="ref5"/&gt; but all were missing. She did not carry enough lifejackets for everyone on board.&lt;ref name="Solvedd"/&gt;
* The starboard engine was found to be covered by [[mattress]]es, while the port engine's clutch was still partially disassembled, showing that the vessel was still running on only one engine.
* An auxiliary pump had been rigged in the engine room, mounted on a plank of wood slung between the main engines. However, it had not been connected.
* The radio on board was tuned to the international distress channel, but when the equipment was inspected, a break was found in the cable between the set and the [[Antenna (radio)|aerial]]. The cable had been painted over, obscuring the break. This would have limited the range of the radio to about {{convert|2|mi|km}}.
* The electric clocks on board (wired into the vessel's generator) had stopped at 10:25 and the switches for the cabin lighting and [[navigation light]]s were on, implying that whatever had occurred happened at night. The ships' [[logbook]], [[sextant]], mechanical [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]] and other navigational equipment, as well as the firearms Miller kept in the boat,&lt;ref name="Solvedd"/&gt; were missing.
* A [[doctor's bag]] was found on deck, containing a [[stethoscope]], a [[scalpel]], and four lengths of blood-stained [[bandage]]s.

There was still fuel in ''Joyita''{{'}}s tanks; from the amount used, it was calculated she made some {{convert|243|mi|km}} before the vessel was abandoned, probably within {{convert|50|mi|km}} of Tokelau. The leak had probably started after 9 p.m. on the second night of the voyage, with nine hours of darkness ahead.&lt;ref name="Solvedd"/&gt;

Although ''Joyita'' was found with her [[bilge]]s and lower decks flooded, her hull was sound. When she was moored back in harbour at Suva, investigators heard the sound of water entering the vessel. It was found that a pipe in the raw-water circuit of the engine's [[water cooling|cooling system]] had failed due to [[galvanic corrosion]], allowing water into the bilges. The first the crew would have known about the leak was when the water rose above the engine room floorboards, by which time it would have been nearly impossible to locate the leak. Also, the bilge pumps were not fitted with [[Water filter|strainers]], and had become clogged with debris, meaning that it would have been very difficult to pump the water out.

==Maritime inquiry==
A subsequent inquiry found that the vessel was in a poor state of repair, but determined that the fate of the passengers and crew was "inexplicable on the evidence submitted at the inquiry." An especially perplexing point was that the three [[liferaft]]s ''Joyita'' carried were missing, but it would not make sense for the crew and passengers to voluntarily abandon the vessel. Fitted out for carrying refrigerated cargo, ''Joyita'' had {{convert|640|cuft|m3}} of [[cork (material)|cork]] lining her holds, making her virtually unsinkable. In addition, further [[buoyancy]] was provided by a cargo of empty fuel drums.

The inquiry was only able to establish the reasons for the vessel becoming flooded. It found that the vessel would have begun to flood due to the fractured cooling pipe. The bilge pumps were unserviceable due to becoming blocked. ''Joyita'' lacked watertight bulkheads or subdivisions in the bilges. The water would have gradually flooded the lower decks. As the boat began to sink lower into the water, the one remaining engine would not have been able to maintain enough speed to steer. ''Joyita'' then fell beam-on to a heavy swell and took on the heavy list it was found with. While flooded to an extent which would sink a conventional vessel, ''Joyita'' stayed afloat due to her cork-lined hull and cargo of fuel drums.

The inquiry also placed much of the responsibility for the events on Miller. They found him reckless for setting out on an ocean-going voyage with only one engine and numerous minor faults, and negligent for failing to provide a working radio or properly equipped [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. He was also in breach of maritime law, since he had allowed ''Joyita''{{'}}s license to carry fare-paying passengers to lapse.

The inquiry made no mention of the used medical equipment found on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=New Zealand. Commission to Inquire into the Casualty to the Motor Vessel Joyita | author2=Marsack, C. C | title=Report | publication-date=1956 | publisher=Govt. Printer | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34411816 | accessdate=3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses==

''Joyita'' is sometimes referred to as the "''[[Mary Celeste]]'' of the South Pacific" and has been the subject of several books and [[documentary film|documentaries]] offering explanations that range from rational and conventional to supernatural and paranormal. Numerous hypotheses for the disappearance of ''Joyita''{{'}}s crew and passengers have been advanced. Many were circulated at the time of the event, and several others have been put forward since. Given the fact that the hull of ''Joyita'' was sound and her design made her almost unsinkable, a main concern of investigators was determining why the passengers and crew did not stay on board if the events were simply triggered by the flooding in the engine room.

===Captain injured hypothesis===

Captain Miller should have been well aware of the vessel's ability to stay afloat, leading some to speculate that Miller had died or become incapacitated for some reason (someone on board was injured—hence the bloodstained bandages). Without him to reassure the other people on board, they may have panicked when ''Joyita'' began to flood and taken to the liferafts. However, this in itself would not account for the missing cargo and equipment, unless the vessel had been found abandoned and had her cargo removed.

A friend of Miller, Captain S. B. Brown, was convinced that Miller would never have left ''Joyita'' alive, given his knowledge of her construction. He was aware of tension between Miller and his American first mate, Chuck Simpson. Brown felt that Miller and Simpson's dislike of each other came to blows and both men fell overboard or were severely injured in a struggle. This left the vessel without an experienced seaman and would explain why those remaining on board would panic when the ship began to flood.

===Japanese involvement and other hypotheses===
[[File:Joyita crew killed by japs.jpg|thumb|Newspaper headline accusing Japan]]
The [[Fiji]] ''Times and Herald'' quoted at the time from an "[[Journalism sourcing|impeccable source]]" to the effect that ''Joyita'' had passed through a fleet of Japanese [[fishing]] boats during its trip and "had observed something the Japanese did not want them to see."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' hypothesized that some [[Japanese holdout|still-active]] Japanese forces from World War II were to blame for the disappearances, operating from an isolated island base.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
There was still strong anti-Japanese feeling in parts of the Pacific, and in Fiji there was specific resentment of Japan being allowed to operate fishing fleets in local waters. Such theories suddenly gained credence when men clearing ''Joyita'' found knives stamped 'Made in Japan'. However, tests on the knives proved negative and it turned out the knives were old and broken- quite possibly left on board from when ''Joyita'' was used for fishing in the late 1940s.

Also there was a proposition that "the vessel's occupants were kidnapped by a Soviet submarine, with the world at the time in the midst of the growing Cold War."&lt;ref name=Solvedd&gt;{{cite web|title=Author says he's solved MV Joyita mystery, 47 years later|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=1292221|website=nzherald|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=March 29, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others{{who|date=June 2016}} hypothesize that [[piracy|modern sea pirates]] attacked the vessel, killed the 25 passengers and crew (and cast their bodies into the ocean), and stole the missing four tons of cargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Insurance fraud hypothesis===

It was also revealed that Miller had amassed large debts after a series of unsuccessful fishing trips on ''Joyita''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, it would have been difficult to see the events surrounding ''Joyita'' as [[insurance]] [[fraud]], given that no [[seacock]]s were found open and the ship would be almost impossible to [[Scuttling|scuttle]]. Also, Miller was relying on ''Joyita'' being chartered for regular runs between Samoa and Tokelau—these government charters would have quickly cleared his debts.

===Mutiny hypothesis===

A subsequent owner of ''Joyita'', author [[Robin Maugham]], spent many years investigating the vessel's past, and published his findings as ''The Joyita Mystery'' in 1962. Maugham agreed that events were started by the flooding from the broken cooling pipe and the failure of the pumps. The mattresses found covering the starboard engine were used either in an attempt to stem the leak or to protect the electrical [[Electric switchboard|switchboard]] from spray kicked up by the engine's [[flywheel]] as the water level rose. At the same time, ''Joyita'' encountered increasingly heavy swells and [[squall]]y weather.

Miller, knowing ''Joyita'' to be unsinkable and desperate to reach his destination to clear his debt, pressed on. However, Chuck Simpson, and possibly other crew members, demanded that he turn back. This effectively led to [[mutiny]] and Miller and the crew struggled, during which Miller sustained a serious injury. By now the ship was entering heavier weather, with winds around {{convert|40|mph|km/h}}, and with one engine and a flooded bilge, was beginning to labor. The flooding in the engine room would have eventually caused the starboard engine to fail, also cutting all the vessel's electrical power. Chuck Simpson was now in control and made the decision to abandon ship, taking the navigational equipment, logbook and supplies, as well as the injured Miller, with them.

It still seems unlikely that Chuck Simpson would choose to abandon a flooded but floating ship to take to small open rafts in the Pacific Ocean. Maugham proposed that they sighted a nearby island or [[reef]] and tried to reach it, but in the strong winds and seas the rafts were carried out to sea, leaving ''Joyita'' drifting and empty. The damage to the lightly built superstructure was caused by wave damage while the vessel was drifting in heavy seas.

==''Joyita'' after 1955==

In July 1956, ''Joyita'' was auctioned off by her owners for £2,425 to a Fiji Islander, David Simpson. He refitted and overhauled her and she went to sea again that year. However, she was surrounded by legal disputes over the transfer of her registry from the United States to Britain without permission. In January 1957 she ran aground while carrying 13 passengers in the [[Koro Sea]]. She was repaired and in October 1958 began a regular trade between [[Levuka]] and [[Suva]].

She again ran aground on a reef in November, 1959 at Vatuvalu near Levuka.&lt;ref name="DavidWeight"/&gt; She floated off the reef assisted by high tide, but while heading for port began to take in water through a split seam. The pumps were started, but it became clear that the valves for the pump had been installed the wrong way, meaning that water was pumped into the hull, not out. Now with a reputation as an 'unlucky ship' and with a damaged hull, she was abandoned by her owners and beached. She was stripped of useful equipment and was practically a [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]] when she was bought by [[Robin Maugham]], who wrote the book ''The Joyita Mystery'' (1962). He sold the hulk in 1966 to Major J. Casling-Cottle who ran a tourist and publicity bureau at Levuka. He planned to turn it into a museum and tearoom, but the plan never saw daylight. The hulk disappeared piece by piece and the process of disintegration appears to have been complete by the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="DavidWeight"/&gt;

On March 14, 1975 The Western Samoa Post Office released a set of five stamps dealing with the mystery of ''Joyita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8141#!lightbox/0/|title=shipstamps.co.uk • View topic – Joyita|work=shipstamps.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 a walkway was named after Dr. Alfred Denis Parsons near his former [[Torbay, New Zealand|Torbay]] home in Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10552657|title=Doctor lost at sea given permanent memorial|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.fi/maps?channel=fflb&amp;q=Parsons+Walkway+Torbay,+Auckland+0630+NZ&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x6d0d3a8d1887b625:0x75f08e1d35f0a233,Parsons+Walkway,+Torbay,+Auckland+0630,+New+Zealand&amp;gl=fi|title=Parsons Walkway Torbay, Auckland 0630 NZ – Google Maps|work=google.fi|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 two memory stones in honor of the event were erected in Apia, Samoa and in [[Fakaofo]] Village, Tokelau.&lt;ref name="Remember"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.282124885197741.65027.281686231908273&amp;type=1 Apia service.

'''Marye''' was a [[warhorse]] owned by the [[United States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]] who was later captured and pressed into [[Confederate States]] service. 

==Early life and career==
[[File:Gordonstatue_crop.JPG|thumb|A statue of Marye, with John Brown Gordon atop, sits on the grounds of the Georgia capitol.]]

===United States military service===
Marye's early life and original name and master are unknown. She fought with United States forces during the American Civil War at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in 1862. During the assault against fortified Confederate positions at Marye's Heights, the beast's rider was shot off her and the animal galloped into the Confederate lines. The brigade of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] troops of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] captured the steed and brought her to their commander, General [[John Brown Gordon]], whose own mount had just succumbed to exhaustion. At the conclusion of active combat, the horse was surrendered to the Quartermaster but purchased back by the Georgia soldiers and presented to Gordon as a trophy.&lt;ref name="gene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;

===Confederate States military service===
Gordon named the horse Marye in tribute to the location of its capture and is said to have treasured the horse since it was a gift from his men. Gordon used the horse as a mount until 1864 when she was killed in action by gunfire at the [[Battle of Monocacy]].&lt;ref name="gene"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
According to Gordon's description of the horse, she was generally sluggish, however, during battle was "transformed" into an excellent warhorse with a fearless character who would "with its head up and its nostrils distended, bound across ditches and over fences".&lt;ref name="gene"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Armistead |first1=Gene C. |title=Horses and Mules in the Civil War: A Complete History with a Roster of More Than 700 War Horses |date=2013 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=0786473630 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSJ5AAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon would tribute Marye as "the most superb battlehorse that it was my fortune to mount during the war".&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=John Gordon |title=Reminiscences of the Civil War |date=1903 |publisher=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6072">'''Matilda Newport''' ({{circa}} 1795–1837) was an [[Americo-Liberian]] colonist and [[folk hero]]. She is known for her actions in 1822 when she is alleged to have defended the settlement [[Cape Mesurado]] with a cannon she lit from her pipe. She is a controversial figure in light of the tensions between Americo-Liberians and native Liberians. The historical accuracy of the account has been challenged. A national holiday in her honour, Matilda Newport Day, was celebrated annually on 1 December from 1916 until it was abolished in 1980.

==Biography==
Matilda was born in the United States circa 1795 (possibly [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give Georgia as her place of birth, while ''Roll of Emigrants to Liberia, 1820-1843'' lists her "US origin" and that of her husband as [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;/ref&gt; She married Thomas Spencer, becoming '''Matilda Spencer'''. At the age of 25 she sailed to [[Liberia]] with her husband on the ship ''Elizabeth''. They arrived on 30 September 1820&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nyanseor|first1=Siahyonkron|title=Putting to Rest the Matilda Newport Myth - Part 2|url=http://www.theperspective.org/2004/jan/matildanewportmyth.htm|work=The Perspective|date=7 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and settled in Cape Mesurado.

Newport is principally known for her actions on 1 December 1822 defending the colonial settlement [[Cape Mesurado]] during the Battle of Fort Hill. An [[American Colonization Society]] representative had acquired the land through [[gunboat diplomacy]], displacing the indigenous [[Dei people|Dei]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fanning|first1=Sara Connors|title=Haiti and the U.S.: African American Emigration and the Recognition Debate|date=2008|isbn=978-0-549-63633-5|page=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45KUZihR_3IC&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=1YsGb0AtVq&amp;dq=cape%20mesurado%20dei%20people&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one of two attacks on the settlement by the Dei, [[Bassa people (Liberia)|Bassa]], and [[Gola people|Gola]], Newport noticed that the cannoneers were either dead or wounded. She used a hot coal from her pipe to light the fuse of a cannon. The resulting explosion deterred the advance of the African warriors and changed the course of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huffman|first1=Alan|title=Mississippi in Africa|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=978-1-60473-754-7|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vz4OySLtmE0C&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=Matilda%20Newport&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newport's husband died, probably in one of the conflicts.&lt;ref name="Myth"/&gt; Sometime after 1822, she married again to Ralph Newport. He died in a canoeing accident in 1836.&lt;ref name="HDWSA"/&gt; Matilda Newport died of [[pleurisy]] in [[Monrovia]] in 1837.&lt;ref name="HDWSA"/&gt;

==Legacy and historicity==
Newport's role in the 1822 battle was not initially considered particularly significant, but grew over time in [[oral history|oral histories]]. In 1916 the Liberian legislature designated 1 December as ''Matilda Newport Day''. Until its abolishment, the annual celebration included a grand ball, speeches, parades, and reenactments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Story of Matilda Newport - Liberian Hero|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2238&amp;dat=19530203&amp;id=ezsmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rP4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5596,4243940|work=Washington Afro-American|agency=Liberia Today|date=3 February 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was commemorated with a [[List of people on stamps of Liberia|Liberian postage stamp]] in 1947. A bronze plaque at the Centennial Pavilion in Monrovia depicts Newport with the cannon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=David|title=Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia|date=2012|publisher=I .B.

As criticism of Americo-Liberian rule grew in the 1960s, Newport's role in Liberian history was no longer seen as admirable. Following the military coup in 1980, [[Samuel Doe]] abolished Matilda Newport Day.&lt;ref name="HDWSA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Kathleen|title=Historical Dictionary of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6547-1|pages=171–172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HMAeAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Matilda%20Newport&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Newport, Matilda (c. 1795–1837)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steady|first1=Filomena Chioma|title=Women and Leadership in West Africa: Mothering the Nation and Humanizing the State|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-01038-4|page=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VhdAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT124&amp;dq=Matilda%20Newport&amp;pg=PT124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Women and Leadership in Liberia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have questioned the veracity of the account of Newport's actions.

The molecule is a [[secondary metabolite]], and can be obtained in large amounts from its producing organism.&lt;ref name=Lundeberg /&gt;

Due to its unique properties it is an important model for drug development against [[melanoma]] and other [[cancer]]s.

== Medical properties ==

In [[NCI-60]] anti-cancer compound screening mensacarcin has a high [[cytostatic]] effect against almost all cell lines (mean of 50% growth inhibition) and a relatively selective [[cytotoxic]] effect against melanoma cells.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

Low [[COMPARE]] correlation with standard antitumor agents indicate a unique mechanism of action.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;
Further examinations reveal mensacarcin effecting the [[mitochondria]].

=== Potential use in cancer therapy ===

With its unique mechanism,
effective also in [[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]] [[V600E]] mutation [[cell line]]s,
mensacarcin is a promising model for the development of new anticancer drugs.

[[Melanoma#Treatment|Existing therapies]] for melanoma are limited.
Mensacarcin's powerful effect against melanoma cells make it especially valuable for this disease.

== Mechanism of action ==

=== Specific disruption of mitochondrial function ===

Mitochondria provide most of the energy used by [[eukaryotic]] cells.

In a study at the Oregon State University a synthesized [[fluorescent]] probe of mensacarcin was localized to the mitochondria within 20 minutes of treatment.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

Live-cell [[Bioenergetics|bioenergetic]] [[Metabolic flux analysis|flux analysis]] showed rapid disturbance of energy production and of mitochondrial function.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

The localization together with the metabolic effects provide evidence that mensacarcin targets mitochondria.

=== Induction of cell death ===

Mitochondria are also important in [[cell death]] signaling.

Mensacarcin in melanoma cells activates [[apoptotic]] pathways related to [[caspase 3]] and [[caspase 7]], and thus induces cell death.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

After mensacarcin treatment of two melanoma cell lines, the cells showed characteristic [[chromatin]] [[DNA condensation|condensation]] as well as distinct [[Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase]]-1 cleavage;
[[flow cytometry]] identified a large population of apoptotic cells;
single-cell [[electrophoresis]] indicated that mensacarcin causes [[genetic instability]], a sign of early apoptosis.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

=== Effect in melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutation ===

The BRAF V600E mutation is associated with drug resistance.&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;
Due to its independent mechanism, mensacarcin has an undiminished effect in melanoma cell lines with this mutation (NCI 60 cell lines [[SK-Mel-28]] and [[SK-Mel-5]]).&lt;ref name=Plitzko /&gt;

'''Microneurography''' is a [[neurophysiological]] method employed by scientists to visualize and record the normal traffic of nerve impulses that are conducted in [[peripheral nerve]]s of waking human subjects.  The method has been successfully employed to reveal functional properties of a number of neural systems, e.g. sensory systems related to touch, pain, and muscle sense as well as [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activity]] controlling the [[Vasoconstriction|constriction state of blood vessels]]. To study nerve impulses of an identified neural system, a fine tungsten needle electrode is inserted into the nerve and connected to a high gain recording amplifier. The exact position of the electrode tip within the nerve is then adjusted in minute steps until the electrode discriminates impulses of the neural system of interest. A unique feature and a significant strength of the microneurography method is that subjects are fully awake and able to cooperate in tests requiring mental attention, while impulses in a representative nerve fibre or set of nerve fibres are recorded, e.g. when cutaneous sense organs are stimulated or subjects perform voluntary precision movements.

==History==
Before the microneurography technique was developed in the late 1960s, impulses in peripheral nerves had been recorded in animal experiments alone using a technique that involved dissection and splitting the nerve.

The two Swedish scientists who developed the microneuropgraphy technique (Hagbarth and Vallbo) handled the medical-ethical concern by performing a large series of experiments on their own nerves during a period of about 2 years while carefully checking for nerve damage. Working at the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Academic Hospital, Uppsala, they collected data resulting in the first complete papers representing three areas to become major fields of microneurography, i.e. afference from intra-muscular sense organs during voluntary contractions, response of cutaneous sense organs related to touch stimuli, and efferent sympathetic activity controlling the constriction state of human blood vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagbarth|first=K-E|author2=Vallbo ÅB|title=Discharge characteristics of human muscle afferents during muscle stretch and contraction|journal=Experimental Neurology|year=1968|volume=22|pages=674–694|pmid=4237061|doi=10.1016/0014-4886(68)90156-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vallbo|first=ÅB|author2=Hagbarth K-E|title=Activity from skin mechanoreceptors recorded percutaneously in awake human subjects|journal=Experimental Neurology|year=1968|volume=21|pages=270–289|pmid=5673644|doi=10.1016/0014-4886(68)90041-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagbarth|first=K-E|author2=Vallbo ÅB|title=Pulse and respiratory grouping of sympathetic impulses in human muscle nerves|journal=Acta Physiologica Scandinavica|year=1968|volume=74|pages=96–108|pmid=4235387|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.1968.tb04218.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The microneurography approach of Hagbarth and Vallbo based on epoxy resin coated tungsten electrodes is now generally accepted whereas an alternative attempt using glass coated platina-iridium electrodes had obviously limited success as it yielded a single short note alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=E|author2=Widén L|title=Impulses from single nerve fibres recorded in man using microelectrodes|journal=Nature|year=1967|volume=213|pages=606–607|pmid=6032256|doi=10.1038/213606a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of nerves ==
	Nerve fibers of various kinds are more or less randomly mixed in most nerves. This is true for fibers of different functions as well as fibers of different size. Basically fiber diameter is closely related to function, e.g. cutaneous pain system is dependent on small fibers whereas discriminative touch is dependent on large fibers. With regard to fiber diameter there are two main categories: A-fibers are large and conduct impulses at high or moderate speed (5–75&amp;nbsp;m/s). C-fibers are small and conduct impulses at low speed (around 1&amp;nbsp;m/s). In microneurography recordings, A- and C-fiber impulses differ in shape. Because fibers are mixed in most nerves, it is usually essential to record from an individual nerve fiber at a time to explore the properties of a functional system, although multi-unit recording has been very rewarding in studies of sympathetic efferent activity. An individual nerve consists of a number of parallel fascicles, i.e. bundles of nerve fibers enclosed within a connective tissue sheath that may be quite tough and hard for a needle microelectrode to penetrate.

==Methods==
Microneurography is based on tungsten needle electrodes which are inserted through the skin and into a nerve. Anaesthetics are not required because surprisingly  the procedure is not very painful. The tungsten microelectrodes have a shaft diameter of 100-200 μm, a tip diameter of 1-5 μm, and they are insulated to the tip with an epoxy resin. Electrode impedance varies between 0.3 and 5 MΩ at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz as measured initially. However, the impedance tends to decrease during experiment and is usually below 1 MΩ while impulses are recorded. Nerve discharges are determined by voltage differences between the intra-neural electrode and a reference needle electrode in the vicinity. The 2 electrodes are connected to an amplifier with a high input impedance and an appropriate band-pass filtering, often 500 to 5000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Signals are monitored on a computer screen and stored on a hard disc for off-line analysis. Any peripheral nerve that can be reached may be a target for microneurographical recordings, although so far only arm, leg, and facial nerves have been exploited. 
In order to locate the nerve, electrical stimulation through a needle electrode or ultrasonic monitoring is often used. Weak electrical shocks are delivered either through the recording electrode or through a separate stimulation needle while neural response is observed, either a muscle twitch or a cutaneous sensation reported by the subject.
In ultrasonic monitoring a linear, high frequency ultrasound probe is used.&lt;ref name= "curry"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2011.03.007 |title=The use of real-time ultrasound in microneurography |year=2011 |last1=Curry |first1=Timothy B. |last2=Charkoudian |first2=Nisha |journal=Autonomic Neuroscience |volume=162 |pages=89–93 |pmid=21514900 |issue=1–2 |pmc=3111900}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The microelectrode is then inserted 1–2&amp;nbsp;cm from the probe, ideally in a 90° angle to the ultrasonic beam. This generates the best wave reflection and image. Ultrasonic approach accurately locates the depth of the nerve and identifies surrounding anatomical structures of interest, such as blood vessels and bony structures, which may affect the placement of a microelectrode. A particular advantage is that the ultrasonic approach visualizes the electrode and the nerve at the same time, thereby facilitating electrode manipulation to reach the nerve. Once the electrode tip is in the nerve, small adjustments are required, first, to penetrate the sheath of an individual fascicle and, second, to take the tip to contact nerve fibers of the kind you are interested to explore, be it multi-unit sympathetic activity or single unit activity of either a myelinated afferent or a small unmyelinated fibres. The search procedure requires considerable skill and patience as it may be very tedious particularly with small nerves or nerves located deep below the skin surface.

===The marking technique===
Recording of single afferent impulses from C-fibers is particularly demanding as they have a diameter of only one micrometer. A method to increase the yield is the marking technique which is based on a unique property of many kinds of C-fibres, i.e. a decrease of conduction velocity in the wake of preceding impulses. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Weidner |first1= C.|last2=Schmidt |first2=R.|last3=Schmeltz|first3=M.|last4=Hilliges|first4=M.|last5= Handwerker|first5=H.O.|last6=Torebjörk|first6= H.E.|title= Time course of post-excitatory effects separates afferent human C fibre classes |journal= Journal of Physiology|year=2000|volume=527|issue=1|pages=185–191|pmid=10944181 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.2000.00185.x |pmc=2270064}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By combining repetitive electrical stimulation and physical stimulation, e.g. skin pinch or light touch, the afferent can be identified and characterized. The marking technique is very efficient as it allows simultaneous recordings of several fibers. However, it generates only semi-quantitative information about unitary activity, whereas recordings of impulse trains allow more comprehensive description of functional properties of sense organs.

===Micro-stimulation===
The microneurography electrode may be used not only for recording of nerve impulses but for stimulation of individual fibers as well. An interesting application is to combine successive recording and stimulation of the same afferent. Once the functional properties of an afferent have been defined, e.g. with regard to sensitivity, receptive field structure, and adaptation, the electrode may be reconnected to a stimulator to give trains of electrical pulses of controlled strength, rate, and duration. It has been found that the percept elicited from a single tactile afferent in the glabrous skin of the hand, may be remarkably detailed and closely matching the properties of the afferent, indicating a high degree of specificity. Although this approach to bridge the gap between biophysical events in a single afferent and mental phenomena within the mind is simple and straight forward in principle it is demanding in practice for a number of reasons. Micro-stimulation has also been used to characterize individual motor units with regard to contraction properties.

==Functional systems explored==
Microneurography recordings have elucidated the organization as well as normal and pathological function of a fair number of neural systems in man, whereas the technique is not useful in clinical routine for diagnostic purposes to clarify the condition of the individual patient. Three main groups of neural systems have been explored, i.e. proprioception, cutaneous sensibility, and sympathetic efferent activity.

==Proprioception and motor control==
Information from a variety of sense organs provides information about joint positions and movements. The most elaborate proprioceptive sense organ is the muscle spindle. It is unique because its functional state is continually controlled from the brain through the fusimotor system. Recordings from muscle spindle afferents indicate that the fusimotor system remains largely passive when the parent muscle is relaxed whereas is it regularly activated in voluntary contractions and more so the stronger the contraction. Thus microneurography suggests a parallelism between the two motor systems, i.e. the skeletomotor system controlling the ordinary muscle fibers and the fusimotor system. This seems to hold at least for weak contractions and small movements which have been explored so far. In contrast, more independent fusimotor activity has been reported in animal experiments, mainly cat hind limb, where larger movements are allowed. Thanks to fusimotor activation, the afferent signal from muscle spindles remains efficient in monitoring large changes of muscle length without turning silent during muscle shortening. On the other hand, very small intramuscular events are monitored as well, thanks to the extreme sensitivity of the sense organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wessberg|first1=Johan|last2=Vallbo|first2=Åke B.|title=Coding of pulsatile motor output by human muscle afferents during slow finger movements|journal=Journal of Physiology|year=1995|volume=485|pages=271–282|pmid=7658380|pmc=1157989}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example is the small pulsatile component of the muscle contraction which is due to a periodic fluctuation at 8–10&amp;nbsp;Hz of the motor command. These small variations are insentient but readily monitored by the population of spindle afferents. They are akin to the tremor we may experience when emotionally excited. The functional significance of the insentient spindle response to faint intramuscular events remains to be assessed. However, it seems likely that detailed information on large as well as small mechanical events in the muscles is essential for neural systems in the brain to produce appropriate commands for dexterous movements.

Microneurography has demonstrated that our brains make use of detailed proprioceptive information not only by deep sense organs but by cutaneous mechanoreceptors as well. Any joint movement causing the slightest skin stretch is accurately monitored by cutaneous Ruffini endings in the skin area surrounding the joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Edin |first1= Benoni B. |last2= Johansson |first2=Niclas|title= Skin strain patterns provide kinaesthetic information to the human central nervous system|journal= Journal of Physiology|year=1995|volume=487|pages=243–251|pmid=7473253 |pmc=1156613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cutaneous sensibility==
Cutaneous sensibility includes a number of functions. Microneurography has been particularly used to investigate discriminative and affective touch mechanisms, as well as pain mechanisms, although afferents related to pruritus and temperature have been studied to some extent as well. A separate set of studies concern motor effects from cutaneous tactile afferents in the glabrous skin.

===Discriminative touch===

Two different tactile systems have been identified. A system for discriminative touch has been intensely studied since long whereas a system for affective touch was understood and explored more recently. Discriminative touch is based on large myelinated afferents from skin as well as afferents from deeper structures. This system allows us to extract detailed information on spatial and temporal features of any skin deformation as well as properties of physical objects such as size, shape, and surface structure. The glabrous skin of the human hand has a paramount role in discriminative touch. Thus the tactile organization of this skin area has therefore been extensively explored. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vallbo|first1=A.B.|last2=Johansson|first2=Roland S.|title= Properties of cutaneous mechanoreceptors in the human hand related to touch sensation |journal= Human Neurobiology |year=1984|volume=3|pages=3–14|pmid=6330008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Altogether there are about 17,000 tactile afferents in the glabrous skin area of one hand. They are of four distinct types. Two kinds of afferents have small receptive fields suited for high spatial resolution (Merkel and Meissner). They are particularly numerous in the pulp of the finger, a region often engaged in exploration of object properties. Pacini units are extremely sensitive to fast movements whereas spatial resolution is poor. Ruffini units are characterized by high sensitivity to skin stretch and forces acting on the nails. Micro-stimulation has shown that input from one single Meissner, Merkel, or Pacini unit may produce a distinct and differential percept in the mind of the subject indicating an absolute specificity within the tactile system. It has even been demonstrated that a single impulse in a Meissner afferent may produce a percept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Roland S.|last2=Vallbo|first2=Åke B.|title=Detection of tactile stimuli. Thresholds of afferent units related to psychophysical thresholds in the human hand. |journal=Journal of Physiology|year=1979|volume=297|pages=405–422|pmid=536918|pmc=1458728}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, no percept is reported when a single Ruffini afferent is stimulated which might indicate that spatial summation is required. Consistent with the perceptive findings, neural responses in the somatosensory cortex have been recorded on micro-stimulation of single afferents connected to Meissner, Merkel, Pacini endings but not with single Ruffini afferents. On the basis of collateral studies in man and monkey a very tight match has been claimed between magnitude estimation of sensation of skin deformation, on the one hand, and response of Merkel afferents in the mnonkey, on the other. In man, deviations from such a linear relation was found in combined psychophysical and microneurography recordings. 
In the hairy skin Meissner units are lacking altogether. Instead there are hair follicle and field afferents which have large receptive fields while Merkel, Pacini, and Ruffini are present. Cutaneous Ruffini units in the hairy skin are important for position sense and kinesthesia as pointed out in another section. A caveat is justified with regard to end organ norphology. The four kinds of units considered above were physiologically identified in man (FA/RA and SA units, i.e. fast and slowly adapting type I and type II, ) whereas end organ morphology has been inferred on the basis of animal studies. Particularly, it seems likely that SAII afferents may be connected to other morphological structures than the classical Ruffini ending.

===Affective touch===
Light touch is coded not only in large myelinated afferents but in small unmyelinated afferents as well. Tactile C-afferents (CT) were described long ago in non-human species but did not attract much interest until it was shown that they are numerous in human hairy skin. In contrast, they are lacking altogether in glabrous skin. A number of findings from both normal subjects and from unique patients lacking large tactile afferents indicate that CT afferents are essential for the pleasurable aspect of friendly touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Olausson |first1=H.|last2=Wessberg|first2=J|last3=Morrison|first3=I|last4=McGlone|first4=F|last5=Vallbo|first5=A|title=The neurophysiology of unmyelinated tactile afferents|journal= Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|year=2010|volume=34|issue=2|pages=185–191|doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2008.09.011|pmid=18952123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly, CT afferents respond vigorously to slow caressing movements, and, importantly, the size of the afferent response matches the sense of pleasure reported by the subject. fMRI studies of brain activity indicate that CT activate the insular cortex but not the primary or secondary somatosensory cortex consistent with the hypothesis that CT may play a role in emotional, behavioral, and hormonal responses to pleasant skin-to-skin contact between individuals.

===Tactile afferents in motor control===

It has been shown that tactile afferents from the glabrous skin of the hand exert profound effects on hand and finger muscles in the subconscious control of grip force whenever we lift and manipulate objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=J. Randall|last2=Bowman |first2=Miles C.| first3=Johansson| last3=Roland S.|title= Control strategies in object manipulation tasks|journal= Current Opinion in Neurobiology |year=2006|volume=16|issue=6|pages=650–659|doi= 10.1016/j.conb.2006.10.005|pmid=17084619}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The friction between skin and object surface is extracted as soon as your fingers close around the object and contraction force of the muscles gripping the object is adjusted accordingly. Moreover, any tendency to slipping is monitored by tactile afferents and gives rise to swift reflexes resulting in subconscious adjustments of motor output. Many forms of dexterous handling of objects include successive phases of different motor activity. It has been shown that tactile sense organs in the glabrous skin are involved in timely linking the separated phases to a purposeful motor act.

===Pain related afferents===
Afferents responding to noxious stimuli are known as nociceptors. There are 2 main groups, unmyelinated C-afferents and small myelinated Aδ fibers. Most studies are focused on C nociceptiors.&lt;ref name= "Schmelz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2009.05.064 |title=Microneurographic single-unit recordings to assess receptive properties of afferent human C-fibers |year=2010 |last1=Schmelz |first1=M. |last2=Schmidt |first2=R. |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=470 |issue=3 |pages=158–61 |pmid=19481585}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nociceptive C-fibers constitute a very large proportion of somatic afferent nerve fibers. The majority are polymodal because they are activated by several kinds of stimuli, i.e. mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. The activation of the polymodal by heat corresponds to the heat pain threshold for humans whereas a weak response to mechanical stimuli is usually not associated with pain sensation.
Another group of unmyelinated nociceptor fibers differ by lacking response to mechanical stimuli. These mechano-insensitive fibers differ from polymodal afferents in other respects as well, e.g. threshold for heat is higher, receptive fields on the skin are larger, conduction velocity is slower, and activity-dependent hyperpolarization of the axon is more pronounced. The mechano-insensitive nociceptors may be sensitized particularly by inflammatory mediators to render them mechano-responsive, a process that may account for the tenderness we experience following a physical injury. Moreover, electrical activation of C-mechano-insensitive fibers demonstrates that they have a role in neurogenic vasodilation which has not been found with polymodal nociceptors.
It is suspected that the inflammatory mediators bind to protein receptors on mechano-insensitive nociceptors, but sensitization may also be caused by changes in gene expression that affect expression of transduction proteins. In either case, the sensitization of mechano-insensitive nociceptors has been observed to result in hyperalgesia, chronic pain. About ten percent of the afferents classified as mechano-insensitive nociceptors seem to constitute a group of “itch specific” units because they respond to pruritogen substances including histamine with an activity that corresponds to the sensation of itch.

===Temperature sensibility===
Thermoreceptors can be separated into two groups for warmth and cold detection. A subset of unmyelinated fibers are responsible for warmth detection. They are mechano-insensitive, low in number, and innervate small receptive fields. Aδ fibers are responsible for cold detection. However, there seems to be a subset of C-fibers that may function as cold-receptors along with A-fibers. Remarkably, these C-cold fibers seem to produce a sensation of unpleasant heat when there is no input from A-fibers. Altogether thermoreceptive afferents have not been studied as much as other systems.

==Autonomic efferent activity==
 [[File:Spinal nerve Sympathetic ganglion multilingual.svg|thumb|Spinal nerve Sympathetic ganglion multilingual]]
Microneurography exploration of sympathetic efferent system is unique from technical point of view as multiunit recordings have been very prosperous whereas single unit recording is essential with most other systems. Soon after microneurography was launched it was demonstrated that sympathetic activity is much different in muscle and skin nerves.  
&lt;ref name= "Mano"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2006.06.002 |title=Microneurography as a tool in clinical neurophysiology to investigate peripheral neural traffic in humans |year=2006 |last1=Mano |first1=Tadaaki |last2=Iwase |first2=Satoshi |last3=Toma |first3=Shinobu |journal=Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=117 |issue=11 |pages=2357–84 |pmid=16904937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2170/jjphysiol.48.99 |title=Microneurographic Research on Sympathetic Nerve Responses to Environmental Stimuli in Humans |year=1998 |last1=Mano |first1=Tadaaki |journal=The Japanese Journal of Physiology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=99–114 |pmid=9639545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mus.20831 |title=Sympathetic neural control of integrated cardiovascular function: Insights from measurement of human sympathetic nerve activity |year=2007 |last1=Wallin |first1=B. Gunnar |last2=Charkoudian |first2=Nisha |journal=Muscle &amp; Nerve |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=595–614 |pmid=17623856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instantaneous sympathetic activity in muscle nerves (MSA / MSNA) is heavily controlled by baroreflex mechanisms, resulting in a characteristic cardiac rhythmicity as well as a close and inverse relation to the small variations of blood pressure that  normally occur continuously in phase with respiration. In contrast, the sympathetic activity in skin nerves (SSA/SSNA) lacks a tight relation to cardiac and respiratory events. On the other hand, sympathetic activity in skin nerves is dependent on a number of other mechanisms because changes are easily evoked e.g. by arousal, emotions, and ambient temperature changes, which stimuli are not effective with efferents in muscle nerves. These and other findings demonstrate that sympathetic efferent activity is highly differentiated, as individual effectors are governed by their own control systems and specific reflexes. The amount of muscular sympathetic activity, measured as number of bursts per 100 heart beats, varies considerably between subjects but, on the other hand, it is highly reproducible over time within the individual subject. However, there is some increase with age. Counter-intuitively, there seems to be only a weak and barely significant correlation between sympathetic efferent activity and hypertension as found in group studies. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart |first1= E.C. |last2= Joyner |first2=M.J.|last3=Wallin|first3=B.G.|last4=Charkoudian|first4=N.|title= Sex, ageing and resting blood pressure: gaining insights from the integrated balance of neural and haemodynamic factors|journal= Journal of Physiology|year=2012|volume=590|pages=2069–2079|pmid=22351633 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2011.224642 |pmc=3447151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, microneurography recordings were performed for the first time on a spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia with the purpose to explore the effect of microgravity on the human sympathetic nerve system. Two astronauts measured MSNA from peroneal nerves of their fellow astronauts. The findings support earlier observations that weightlessness results in a decrease of MSNA activity through a baroreflex mechanism.&lt;ref name= "Manospace"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19301593 |year=2009 |last1=Mano |first1=T |title=Microneurography--from basic aspects to clinical applications and application in space medicine |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=227–42 |journal=Brain and nerve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and limitations==
The microneurography technique allows the recording of impulse activity of individual nerve fibers with absolute resolution in attending human subjects. Hence the subject is able to cooperate in various kinds of tests while the exact and complete information carried by the individual nerve fiber is monitored and offered for analysis of correlations between neural activity and physical or mental events. On the other hand, the particular physical conditions involving a microelectrode freely floating in the tissue preclude brisk and large movements because the exact electrode position is easily jeopardized. The experiment is often time-consuming because the search procedure can be particularly demanding. Hence it is not suited as a diagnostic test in clinical routine whereas its strength is in its unique power for exploration of normal neural mechanisms as well as pathophysiological conditions of various neurological disorders. Microneurography records intact axons in vivo and is minimally invasive. There have been no reports of persistent nerve damage. As a result, repeated recordings with the same subject are possible and longitudinal observations can be made. In the experiment, it is important to create an atmosphere of psychological confidence and to observe carefully the subject´s reactions so that the procedure can be adjusted accordingly. The technique requires considerable training and skill and it is highly recommended that scientists who are interested to take up the method are trained in a laboratory where the method is running and that the scientist her-/himself has participated as the subject in a couple of experiments.

'''Benjamin Hermansen''' (29 May 1985 &amp;ndash; 26 January 2001) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]]-[[Ghana|Ghanaian]] boy whose father was born in [[Ghana]], his mother was [[Norway|Norwegian]]. He was [[stabbing|stabbed]] to death at [[Holmlia]] in [[Oslo]], Norway, just before midnight on 26 January 2001 by people from the [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] group [[Boot Boys]]. [[Joe Erling Jahr]] (born 1981) and [[Ole Nicolai Kvisler]] (born 1979) were convicted of the murder and sentenced to 16 and 15 years in prison respectively.&lt;ref name="nytimes20020118"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/world/2-neo-nazis-in-norway-are-guilty-in-race-death.html|title=2 Neo-Nazis In Norway Are Guilty In Race Death|author=Gibbs, Walter

==Response to the murder==
Since the murder was motivated by [[racism]], it mobilised large parts of the Norwegian population. Throughout the entire country, marches were organised to protest against the murder, with nearly 40,000 people participating in Oslo.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

=="Song to Benjamin"==
Hermansen was buried on 6 February 2001. "Song to Benjamin", written by several of his friends for the service, was presented at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Norwegians Bury Slain Ghanaian Teen |url= http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/artikel.php?ID=13443 |work= |publisher= Ghana Web |location= Amsterdam, Netherlands |date= February 6, 2001 |accessdate= July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was later recorded in studio by artists including [[Noora Noor]] and [[Briskeby]].

==The Benjamin Prize==
In 2002, the [[Benjamin Prize]] was founded in Hermansen's memory.  It is awarded on 27 January every year.

==Michael Jackson's ''Invincible'' dedicated to Benjamin==
Pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] dedicated his 2001 album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' to Benjamin Hermansen (and also to his own parents and grandmother). The reason for this has partly to do with the fact that the Holmlia boy Omer Bhatti and Jackson were close friends, and Bhatti was at the same time a good friend of Benjamin Hermansen. On the album cover, next to the image of a rose, it reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title= Hedrer Benjamin - Michael Jackson tilegner sitt nye album til det norske knivofferet |url= http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=1773308 |format= |work= |publisher= [[Verdens Gang|vg.no]] |location= |date= October 23, 2001 |accessdate= July 26, 2008 |language= Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= McNamara, Liz |title= Jacko dedicates Invincible to Benjamin |url= http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article216474.ece |publisher= [[Aftenposten]] |location=  |date= October 23, 2001 |accessdate= July 26, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090309155446/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article216474.ece |archivedate= 2009-03-09 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weltzin-testament==
Clara Dorothea Weltzin (1925–2007), an Oslo woman with far-right anti-immigration views, left 250,000 [[Norwegian kroner]] (c. US$43,000) to [[Ole Nicolai Kvisler]] in her will, something that caused major headlines in Norwegian media, and there were also suspicions regarding the legality of doing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/06/10/537782.html Dagbladet - Ulovlig å gi arv til Kvisler og Vigrid]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nick Corwin''' was an American student and athlete. He was murdered in his second grade classroom in Hubbard Woods School in  [[Winnetka, Illinois|Winnetka, IL]]. &lt;ref&gt; Keppel, Bruce. “Woman Kills Boy, Wounds 5 at Illinois School; Is Found Dead.” ''Los Angeles Times.'' Los Angeles, CA. May 21, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

A dedicated athlete &lt;ref&gt;Silverman, David. “Nicky`s Story: Meet The Boy, Not The Victim, From Winnetka.” ''Chicago Tribune.'' Chicago IL. July 17, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;, he was remembered for his sportsmanship and skill. 

Although the history of school shootings in America goes back to pre-independence times, Nick’s murder was among the first to feature prominently in the [[24-hour_news_cycle|24-hour news cycle]], mostly revolving around the mental state of his killer, [[Laurie Dann]].

Because no other school shooting had received such wide coverage,  Nick’s murder is sometimes called “the first school shooting.” Since his murder, a school shooting was widely reported almost every year. 

Others noted that his shooting marked an “end of innocence” &lt;ref&gt;Constable, Burt. “1988 school shooting in Winnetka.“1988 school shooting in Winnetka was different.” ''The Daily Herald.'' Arlington Heights, IL. Feb 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; for the prosperous community along Chicago’s North Shore, which hadn’t had a murder in 30 years. 

Dr. Donald Monroe, superintendent of Winnetka School District 36 noted 'his “safe” school was “not as isolated and insulated as we thought.''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, Isabel. Shootings Leave a Suburb in Trauma.” ''New York Times.'' New York, NY. May 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the shooting, Hubbard Woods, like many schools, was an open campus, with many doors, such as those to individual classrooms, kept open. After the shooting, a pattern of single-point entry emerged in more schools. &lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, Isabel. Shootings Leave a Suburb in Trauma.” ''New York Times.'' New York, NY. May 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corwin is the namesake of a popular soccer field and playground in Winnetka. 
&lt;ref&gt; Lucadamo, John. “Park To Be Renamed For Dann Victim.” ''Chicago Tribune.'' Chicago, IL. Sept 23. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was resistance from those concerned that naming the park after Nick would be a source of ongoing trauma, but the children made it clear they wanted the park renamed.  A plaque was also placed in the park, in his honor.

According to a report in [[People_(magazine)|''People'']] magazine, 1500 attended his funeral &lt;ref&gt;Brower, Montgomery; Bell, Bonnie. Breo, Dennis; Brott, Jody; Hevrdejs, Judy; Klebman, Barbara Mills; Tamarkin, Civia; Greenberg, Justin. “Mad Enough to Kill.” ''People.'' June 06, 1988. Cover story. &lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his death, playing on the meaning of his name (“giver of gifts”) his friends and schoolmates created a book, The Gifts that Nicholas Gave. He was remembered for his sportsmanship, kindness, and leadership. &lt;ref&gt; Kaplan, Joel; Papajohn, George; Zorn, Eric. ''Murder of Innocence: The Tragic Life and Final Rampage of Laurie Dann.’''Grand Central Publishing, 1991. {{ISBN|0446360023}} {{ISBN|978-0446360029}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Classmates remember Corwin for his exemplary play. One told a reporter that the kids would not be able to play fairly, because Nick was the one who knew all the rules.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, Montgomery; Bell, Bonnie. Breo, Dennis; Brott, Jody; Hevrdejs, Judy; Klebman, Barbara Mills; Tamarkin, Civia; Greenberg, Justin. “Mad Enough to Kill.” ''People.'' June 06, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his death, Winnetka passed a handgun ban, which stood until [[District_of_Columbia_v._Heller|D.C. vs Heller]] and subsequent [[National_Rifle_Association|NRA]] lawsuits &lt;ref&gt;Black, Lisa. “Winnetka repeals 20-year-old ban on possessing handguns.” ''Chicago Tribune.''

'''Ohan Demirgian''', also called Habib Bey (14 January 1837 – 1877), was an Egyptian-Armenian diplomat. He was the favorite of king [[Charles XV of Sweden]].

==Biography==
Demirgian was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] and the son of the Egyptian foreign minister [[Stephan Bey]]. He was a student of the Mission égyptienne in Paris before he was employed as a secretary in the foreign ministry of the Egyptian vice-roy [[khedive]]n [[Isma'il Pasha]]. 
Demirgian lived in France from 1844 to 1853 and studied at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris]] and in [[Versailles]]. Thereafter, he moved to England where he lived for two years. After furthering his education in England, he returned to Egypt in 1855 where he married Arouse Araigian in 1859.&lt;ref name=artsvi /&gt;

He met [[Prince August, Duke of Dalarna]] in Egypt in 1860. In 1866, he was placed in Sweden as the envoy of the Egyptian [[khedive]]. Demirgian were described as an adventurer, and his presence at court was regarded a scandal. He became a favorite of Charles XV, who awarded him Swedish citizenship in 1867, named him his secondary royal stable master at [[Ulriksdal Palace]] at 1868, and bestowed him several royal orders including the [[Order of Vasa]].&lt;ref name=artsvi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakhchinyan|first1=Artsvi|title=Armenian-Scandinavian relations from the Early Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century|journal=Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies: JSAS|date=2000|volume=11|pages=65–81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNVtAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demirgian was disliked at the Swedish royal court, where he was referred to as ''The Demiurg''. He resided in a house next to the Ulriksdal Palace, where he reportedly lived in "Oriental luxury" and arranged parties with women dancing with veils, who were allegedly then trafficked for prostitution to the [[Russian Empire]]. He was a member of the club ''Enkan Bloms Bekanta'' (The Acquaintances of the Widow Blom), the club of the monarch's private circle, including among others [[Svante Hedin]] and [[Daniel Hwasser]]. According to a contemporary description, he was: "Insinuative, good-looking, small and dark, with burning eyes, extremely accommodating and polite to the ladies and keeps himself in the first line always".&lt;ref&gt;Ohan Demirgian, [http://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=17456 Svenskt biografiskt lexikon] (art av Carl-Gustaf Thomasson.), hämtad 2014-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, he unofficially represented Charles XV at the inauguration ceremony of the [[Suez Canal]] in Egypt. At this occasion he awarded several Swedish royal orders to important people in Egypt, such as the [[Order of the Sword]] to the mother of the khedive. He had the wish to achieve an alliance between Sweden and Egypt.

[[File:Kapell Överjärva 2015c.jpg|thumbnail|Ohan Demirgian had built an Armenian chapel in Sweden known as the ''Armeniska kapellet'' in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gårdens historia|url=http://www.overjarvagard.se/gaardens-historia/|publisher=Överjärva Gård}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After the death of the queen, [[Louise of the Netherlands]], in 1871, he offered to manage the negotiations for the king's next marriage. It was reportedly Ohan Demirgian who suggested the Polish countess [[Graciosa Krasińska]] as candidate for the second marriage of Charles XV, rather than [[Thyra of Denmark]] or a Russian Grand Duchess. Krasińska, who was distantly related to the House of Savoy, was described as a young beauty and a millionaire after her father, was by then living in Paris with her mother and stepfather. Demirgian was to be given one million in provision for handling the negotiations in collaboration with the Ottoman ambassador in Paris. The plan was to give Krasińska the befitting status for a non-morganatic marriage by making her stepfather a Spanish grande through her relative, the Spanish monarch, and then award him with the title Royal Hignhess by the Italian monarch: thereby, Krasińska, would become Hr Royal Highness Princess Maria and acceptable as Queen of Sweden after marriage to Charles XV, with their potential son heir to the Swedish throne before the brother of Charles XV. These plans were not popular among the royal house nor with the Swedish government, and foreign minister [[Baltzar von Platen (statesman)|Baltzar von Platen]] made preparations to prevent the marriage. The negotiations failed because of the sudden and unexpected death of the king in 1872.

Similarly, he offered to negotiate a new marriage for the widowed [[Princess Therese of Saxe-Altenburg|Princess Therese]] before she was placed under guardianship. During his last years, he made several attempts to blackmail the Swedish Royal House. He reportedly died at a mental hospital in [[Marseilles]], [[France]] in 1877.

Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .
&lt;/ref&gt;. It is in large part an adaptation and generalization of classic methods used by [[military intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradfield|first=Ron|last2=Wright|first2=George|last3=Burt|first3=George|last4=Cairns|first4=George|last5=Heijden|first5=Kees Van Der|title=The origins and evolution of scenario techniques in long range business planning|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016328705000042|journal=Futures|volume=37|issue=8|pages=795–812|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2005.01.003|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The original method was that a group of analysts would generate [[simulation game]]s for [[policy maker]]s. The methods combine known facts about the future, such as [[demographics]], [[geography]], [[military]], [[politics|political]], [[industry|industrial]] information, and [[mineral reserve]]s, with key driving forces identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) trends&lt;ref&gt;Amer, M., Daim, T.U. and Jetter, A., 2013. A review of scenario planning. Futures, 46, pp.23-40.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In business applications, the emphasis on gaming the behavior of opponents was reduced (shifting more toward a game against nature). At [[Royal Dutch/Shell]] for example, scenario planning was viewed as changing mindsets about the exogenous part of the world, prior to formulating specific strategies&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/living-in-the-futures|title=Living in the Futures|date=2013-05-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=Paul J.

Scenario planning may involve aspects of [[systems thinking]], specifically the recognition that many factors may combine in complex ways to create sometime surprising futures (due to non-linear [[feedback loop]]s)&lt;ref&gt;Grösser, S.N. and Schaffernicht, M., 2012. Mental models of dynamic systems: taking stock and looking ahead. System dynamics review, 28(1), pp.46-68.&lt;/ref&gt;. The method also allows the inclusion of factors that are difficult to formalize, such as novel insights about the future, deep shifts in values, unprecedented regulations or inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendonça|first=Sandro|last2=Cunha|first2=Miguel Pina e|last3=Ruff|first3=Frank|last4=Kaivo-oja|first4=Jari|title=Venturing into the Wilderness|journal=Long Range Planning|volume=42|issue=1|pages=23–41|doi=10.1016/j.lrp.2008.11.001|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Systems thinking used in conjunction with scenario planning leads to plausible scenario storylines because the causal relationship between factors can be demonstrated &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gausemeier|first=Juergen|last2=Fink|first2=Alexander|last3=Schlake|first3=Oliver|title=Scenario Management|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=59|issue=2|pages=111–130|doi=10.1016/s0040-1625(97)00166-2|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cases when scenario planning is integrated with a systems thinking approach to scenario development, it is sometimes referred to as [[dynamic scenarios]].

==Crafting scenarios==
These combinations and permutations of fact and related social changes are called "[[scenario]]s". The scenarios usually include plausible, but unexpectedly important situations and problems that exist in some small form in the present day. Any particular scenario is unlikely. However, [[future studies]] analysts select scenario features so they are both possible and uncomfortable. Scenario planning help policy-makers and firms to anticipate change, prepare a response and create more robust strategies&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehr|first=Thomas|last2=Lorenz|first2=Ullrich|last3=Willert|first3=Markus|last4=Rohrbeck|first4=René|title=Scenario-based strategizing: Advancing the applicability in strategists' teams|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=124|pages=214–224|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.026|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringland|first=Gill|title=The role of scenarios in strategic foresight|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=77|issue=9|pages=1493–1498|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2010.06.010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scenarios help a firm to anticipate the impact of different scenarios identify weaknesses. When disclosed years in advance, these weaknesses can be avoided or their impacts reduced more effectively than if similar real-life problems were considered under duress of an emergency. For example, a company may discover that it needs to change contractual terms to protect against a new class of risks, or collect cash reserves to purchase anticipated technologies or equipment. Flexible [[business continuity planning|business continuity plans]] with "[[Systems thinking|PREsponse protocols]]" help cope with similar  operational problems and deliver measurable future value-added.

===Zero-sum game scenarios===
Strategic military intelligence organizations also construct scenarios. The methods and organizations are almost identical, except that scenario planning is applied to a wider variety of problems than merely military and political problems.

As in military intelligence, the chief challenge of scenario planning is to find out the real needs of policy-makers, when policy-makers may not themselves know what they need to know, or may not know how to describe the information that they really want.

Good analysts design [[Military simulation|wargames]] so that policy makers have great flexibility and freedom to adapt their simulated organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Jan Oliver|title=Business wargaming for teaching strategy making|journal=Futures|volume=51|pages=59–66|doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.06.002|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Then these simulated organizations are "stressed" by the scenarios as a game plays out. Usually, particular groups of facts become more clearly important. These insights enable intelligence organizations to refine and repackage real information more precisely to better serve the policy-makers' real-life needs. Usually the games' simulated time runs hundreds of times faster than real life, so policy-makers experience several years of policy decisions, and their simulated effects, in less than a day.

This chief value of scenario planning is that it allows policy-makers to make and learn from mistakes without risking career-limiting failures in real life. Further, policymakers can make these mistakes in a safe, unthreatening, game-like environment, while responding to a wide variety of concretely presented situations based on facts. This is an opportunity to "rehearse the future", an opportunity that does not present itself in day-to-day operations where every action and decision counts.

==How military scenario planning or scenario thinking is done==
# ''Decide on the key question to be answered by the analysis.'' By doing this, it is possible to assess whether scenario planning is preferred over the other methods. If the question is based on small changes or a very small number of elements, other more formalized methods may be more useful.
# ''Set the time and scope of the analysis.'' Take into consideration how quickly changes have happened in the past, and try to assess to what degree it is possible to predict common trends in demographics, product life cycles. A usual timeframe can be five to 10 years.
# ''Identify major stakeholders.'' Decide who will be affected and have an interest in the possible outcomes. Identify their current interests, whether and why these interests have changed over time in the past.
# ''Map basic trends and driving forces.'' This includes industry, economic, political, technological, legal, and societal trends. Assess to what degree these trends will affect your research question. Describe each trend, how and why it will affect the organisation. In this step of the process, brainstorming is commonly used, where all trends that can be thought of are presented before they are assessed, to capture possible group thinking and tunnel vision.
# ''Find key uncertainties.'' Map the driving forces on two axes, assessing each force on an uncertain/(relatively) predictable and important/unimportant scale. All driving forces that are considered unimportant are discarded. Important driving forces that are relatively predictable (ex. demographics) can be included in any scenario, so the scenarios should not be based on these. This leaves you with a number of important and unpredictable driving forces. At this point, it is also useful to assess whether any linkages between driving forces exist, and rule out any "impossible" scenarios (ex. full employment and zero inflation).
# ''Check for the possibility to group the linked forces'' and if possible, reduce the forces to the ''two'' most important. (To allow the scenarios to be presented in a neat [[Cartesian coordinate system|xy-diagram]])
# ''Identify the extremes'' of the possible outcomes of the two driving forces and check the dimensions for consistency and plausibility. Three key points should be assessed:
## Time frame: are the trends compatible within the time frame in question?
## Internal consistency: do the forces describe uncertainties that can construct probable scenarios.
## Vs the stakeholders: are any stakeholders currently in disequilibrium compared to their preferred situation, and will this evolve the scenario? Is it possible to create probable scenarios when considering the stakeholders? This is most important when creating macro-scenarios where governments, large organisations et al. will try to influence the outcome.
# ''Define the scenarios,'' plotting them on a grid if possible. Usually, two to four scenarios are constructed. The current situation does not need to be in the middle of the diagram (inflation may already be low), and possible scenarios may keep one (or more) of the forces relatively constant, especially if using three or more driving forces. One approach can be to create all positive elements into one scenario and all negative elements (relative to the current situation) in another scenario, then refining these. In the end, try to avoid pure best-case and worst-case scenarios.
# ''Write out the scenarios.'' Narrate what has happened and what the reasons can be for the proposed situation. Try to include good reasons why the changes have occurred as this helps the further analysis. Finally, give each scenario a descriptive (and catchy) name to ease later reference.
# ''Assess the scenarios.'' Are they relevant for the goal? Are they internally consistent? Are they archetypical? Do they represent relatively stable outcome situations?
# ''Identify research needs.'' Based on the scenarios, assess where more information is needed. Where needed, obtain more information on the motivations of stakeholders, possible innovations that may occur in the industry and so on.
# ''Develop quantitative methods.'' If possible, develop models to help quantify consequences of the various scenarios, such as growth rate, cash flow etc. This step does of course require a significant amount of work compared to the others, and may be left out in back-of-the-envelope-analyses.
# ''Converge towards decision scenarios.'' Retrace the steps above in an iterative process until you reach scenarios which address the fundamental issues facing the organization. Try to assess upsides and downsides of the possible scenarios.

===In military applications===
Scenario planning is also extremely popular with military planners. Most states' department of war maintains a continuously updated series of strategic plans to cope with well-known military or strategic problems. These plans are almost always based on scenarios, and often the plans and scenarios are kept up-to-date by war games, sometimes played out with real troops. This process was first carried out (arguably the method was invented by) the Prussian general staff of the mid-19th century.

==Development of scenario analysis in business organizations==
In the past, strategic plans have often considered only the "official future", which was usually a straight-line graph of current trends carried into the future. Often the trend lines were generated by the accounting department, and lacked discussions of demographics, or qualitative differences in social conditions&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

These simplistic guesses are surprisingly good most of the time, but fail to consider qualitative social changes that can affect a business or government. Scenarios focus on the joint effect of many factors. Scenario planning helps us understand how the various strands of a complex tapestry move if one or more threads are pulled&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. When you just list possible causes, as for instance in fault tree analysis, you may tend to discount any one factor in isolation. But when you explore the factors together, you realize that certain combinations could magnify each other’s impact or likelihood. For instance, an increased trade deficit may trigger an economic recession, which in turn creates unemployment and reduces domestic production. [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]]  offers a strong managerial case for the use of scenario planning in business and had wide impact.&lt;ref name="schoemaker1995"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. “Scenario Planning:  A Tool for Strategic Thinking,” ''Sloan Management Review''. Winter: 1995, pp. 25-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scenarios planning starts by dividing our knowledge into two broad domains: (1) things we believe we know something about and (2) elements we consider uncertain or unknowable. The first component – trends – casts the past forward, recognizing that our world possesses considerable momentum and continuity. For example, we can safely make assumptions about demographic shifts and, perhaps, substitution effects for certain new technologies. The second component – true uncertainties – involve indeterminables such as future interest rates, outcomes of political elections, rates of innovation, fads and fashions in markets, and so on. The art of scenario planning lies in blending the known and the unknown into a limited number of internally consistent views of the future that span a very wide range of possibilities.  In [[project management]], this is called the [[cone of uncertainty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Numerous organizations have applied scenario planning to a broad range of issues, from relatively simple, tactical decisions to the complex process of strategic planning and vision building.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991"&gt;Schwartz, Peter.

Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The power of scenario planning for business was originally established by Royal Dutch/Shell, which has used scenarios since the early 1970s as part of a process for generating and evaluating its strategic options.&lt;ref name="wack1985"&gt;Wack, Pierre. "Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead", ''Harvard Business Review''. September–October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schoemakervanderheijden1992"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. and Cornelius A.J.M. van der Heijden, "Integrating Scenarios into Strategic Planning at Royal Dutch/Shell," ''Planning Review''. Vol. 20 (3): 1992, pp.41-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shell has been consistently better in its oil forecasts than other major oil companies, and saw the overcapacity in the tanker business and Europe’s petrochemicals earlier than its competitors.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991" /&gt;  The approach may have had more impact outside Shell than within, as many others firms and consultancies started to benefit as well from scenario planning.  Scenario planning is as much art as science, and prone to a variety of traps (both in process and content) as enumerated by [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]].&lt;ref name="schoemaker1995" /&gt; More recently scenario planning has been discussed as a tool to improve the strategic agility, by cognitively preparing not only multiple scenarios but also multiple consistent strategies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.  

==History of use by academic and commercial organizations==
Most authors attribute the introduction of scenario planning to [[Herman Kahn]] through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a [[Futures techniques|technique of describing the future]] in stories as if written by people in the future. He adopted the term "scenarios" to describe these stories. In 1961 he founded the Hudson Institute where he expanded his scenario work to social forecasting and public policy.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1991"&gt;Schwartz, Peter. . The Art of the Long View: Planning for the Future in an Uncertain World New York: Currency Doubleday, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kahncolency2009"&gt;"Herman Kahn."

Ruona. "A Review of Scenario Planning Literature." Futures Research Quarterly 7 2 (2001): 7-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindgren2003"&gt;Lindgren, Mats, and Hans Bandhold.

"The Origins and Evolution of Scenario Techniques in Long Range Business Planning." Futures 37 8 (2005): 795-812.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most controversial uses of scenarios was to suggest that a nuclear war could be won.&lt;ref name="KAHN1965"&gt;Kahn, Herman. Thinking About the Unthinkable. New York: Horizon Press, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Kahn is often cited as the father of scenario planning, at the same time Kahn was developing his methods at RAND, Gaston Berger was developing similar methods at the Centre d’Etudes Prospectives which he founded in France. His method, which he named 'La Prospective', was to develop normative scenarios of the future which were to be used as a guide in formulating public policy. During the mid-1960s various authors from the French and American institutions began to publish scenario planning concepts such as 'La Prospective' by Berger in 1964&lt;ref name="berger1964"&gt;Berger, G. "Phénoménologies du Temps et Prospectives." Presse Universitaires de France, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'The Next Thirty-Three Years' by Kahn and Wiener in 1967.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Herman, and Anthony J. Wiener. "The Next Thirty-Three Years: A Framework for Speculation." Daedalus 96 3 (1967): 705-32.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s scenario planning was in full swing with a number of institutions now established to provide support to business including the Hudson Foundation, the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]), and the SEMA Metra Consulting Group in France. Several large companies also began to embrace scenario planning including [[DHL Express]], [[Dutch Royal Shell]] and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref name="Chermack2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bradfield2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Godet1996"&gt;Godet, Michel, and Fabrice Roubelat. "Creating the Future :The Use and Misuse of Scenarios." Long Range Planning 29 2 (1996): 164-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godet2000"&gt;Godet, Michel, Fabrice Roubelat, and Guest Editors. "Scenario Planning: An Open Future." Technological Forecasting and Social Change 65 1 (2000): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly as a result of these very sophisticated approaches, and of the difficult techniques they employed (which usually demanded the resources of a central planning staff), scenarios earned a reputation for difficulty (and cost) in use. Even so, the theoretical importance of the use of alternative scenarios, to help address the uncertainty implicit in long-range forecasts, was dramatically underlined by the widespread confusion which followed the Oil Shock of 1973. As a result, many of the larger organizations started to use the technique in one form or another. By 1983 Diffenbach reported that 'alternate scenarios' were the third most popular technique for long-range forecasting – used by 68% of the large organizations he surveyed.&lt;ref name="diffenbach1983"&gt;Diffenbach, John. "Corporate Environmental Analysis in Large US Corporations," ''Long Range Planning''. 16 (3), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Practical development of scenario forecasting, to guide strategy rather than for the more limited academic uses which had previously been the case, was started by [[Pierre Wack]] in 1971 at the Royal Dutch Shell group of companies – and it, too, was given impetus by the Oil Shock two years later. Shell has, since that time, led the commercial world in the use of scenarios – and in the development of more practical techniques to support these. Indeed, as – in common with most forms of long-range forecasting – the use of scenarios has (during the depressed trading conditions of the last decade) reduced to only a handful of private-sector organisations, Shell remains almost alone amongst them in keeping the technique at the forefront of forecasting.&lt;ref name="Wack1985"&gt;Wack, Peter. "Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead," Harvard Business Review. September–October, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has only been anecdotal evidence offered in support of the value of scenarios, even as aids to forecasting; and most of this has come from one company – Shell. In addition, with so few organisations making consistent use of them – and with the timescales involved reaching into decades – it is unlikely that any definitive supporting evidenced will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. For the same reasons, though, a lack of such proof applies to almost all long-range planning techniques. In the absence of proof, but taking account of Shell's well documented experiences of using it over several decades (where, in the 1990s, its then CEO ascribed its success to its use of such scenarios), can be significant benefit to be obtained from extending the horizons of  managers' long-range forecasting in the way that the use of scenarios uniquely does.&lt;ref name="mercer1995"&gt;Mercer, David. "Simpler Scenarios," ''Management Decision''. Vol. 33 Issue 4:1995, pp 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of Shell's use of scenario planning===
In the 1970s, many energy companies were surprised by both [[environmentalism]] and the [[OPEC]] cartel, and thereby lost billions of dollars of revenue by mis-investment. The dramatic financial effects of these changes led at least one organization, Royal Dutch Shell, to implement scenario planning. The analysts of this company publicly estimated that this planning process made their company the largest in the world.&lt;ref name="schwartz1991" /&gt; However other observers{{Who|date=April 2017}} of Shell's use of scenario planning have suggested that few if any significant long term business advantages accrued to Shell from the use of scenario methodology{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Whilst the intellectual robustness of Shell's long term scenarios was seldom in doubt their actual practical use was seen as being minimal by many senior Shell executives{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. A Shell insider has commented "The scenario team were bright and their work was of a very high intellectual level. However neither the high level "Group scenarios" nor the country level scenarios produced with operating companies really made much difference when key decisions were being taken".{{source needed|reason=The quote needs a source.  Or are the quotation marks in the wrong place.|date=October 2016}}

The use of scenarios was audited by [[Arie de Geus]]'s team in the early 1980s and they found that the decision-making processes following the scenarios were the primary cause of the lack of strategic implementation {{clarify|date=November 2015}} ), rather than the scenarios themselves. Many practitioners today spend as much time on the decision-making process as on creating the scenarios themselves.

&lt;!-- how is this a critique? --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cornelius et al. 2005"&gt;Cornelius, Peter, Van de Putte, Alexander, and Romani, Mattia. "Three Decades of Scenario Planning in Shell," ''California Management Review''. Vol. 48 Issue 1:Fall 2005, pp 92-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==General limitations==
Although scenario planning has gained much adherence in industry, its subjective and heuristic nature leaves many academics uncomfortable. How do we know if we have the right scenarios?  And how do we go from scenarios to decisions?  These concerns are legitimate and scenario planning would gain in academic standing if more research were conducted on its comparative performance and underlying theoretical premises. A collection of chapters by noted scenario planners&lt;ref name="faheyrandall1998"&gt;Fahey, Liam and Randall, Robert M. ''Learning from the Future''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; failed to contain a single reference to an academic source, though this may be because academics have not caught up or do not have the resources to either do or teach scenario planning.  In general, there are few academically validated analyses of scenario planning (for a notable exception, see [[Paul J. H. Schoemaker]]&lt;ref name="schoemaker1993"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. “Multiple Scenario Development: Its Conceptual and Behavioral Foundation,” ''Strategic Management Journal''. Vol. 14: 1993, pp 193-213.&lt;/ref&gt;). The technique was born from practice and its appeal is based more on experience than scientific evidence. Furthermore, significant misconceptions remain about its intent and claims.  Above all, scenario planning is a tool for collective learning, reframing perceptions and preserving uncertainty when the latter is pervasive.  Too many decision makers want to bet on one future scenario, falling prey to the seductive temptation of trying to predict the future rather than to entertain multiple futures. Another trap is to take the scenarios too literally as though they were static beacons that map out a fixed future. In actuality, their aim is to bound the future but in a flexible way that permits learning and adjustment as the future unfolds.

One criticism of the two-by-two technique commonly used is that the resulting [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] results in four somewhat arbitrary scenario themes. If other key uncertainties had been selected, it might be argued, very different scenarios could emerge.  How true this is depends on whether the matrix is viewed as just a starting point to be superseded by the ensuing blueprint or is considered as the grand architecture that nests everything else. In either case, however, the issue should not be which are the “right” scenarios but rather whether they delineate the range of possible future appropriately. Any tool that tries to simplify a complex picture will introduce distortions, whether it is a geographic map or a set of scenarios. Seldom will complexity decompose naturally into simple states. But it might.  Consider, for example, the behavior of water (the molecule H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which, depending on temperature and pressure, naturally exists in just one of three states: gas, liquid or ice. The art of scenarios is to look for such natural states or points of bifurcation in the behavior of a complex system.

Apart from some inherent subjectivity in scenario design, the technique can suffer from various process and content traps.&lt;ref name="schoemaker1998"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. "Twenty Common Pitfalls in Scenario Planning", in ''Learning from the Future''. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998, pp 422-431.&lt;/ref&gt; These traps mostly relate to how the process is conducted in organizations (such as team composition, role of facilitators, etc.) as well as the substantive focus of the scenarios (long vs. short term, global vs. regional, incremental vs. paradigm shifting, etc.). One might think of these as merely challenges of implementation, but since the process component is integral to the scenario experience, they can also be viewed as weaknesses of the methodology itself. Limited safeguards exist against political derailing, agenda control, myopia and limited imagination when conducting scenario planning exercises within real organizations. But, to varying extents, all forecasting techniques will suffer from such organizational limitations. The benchmark to use is not perfection, especially when faced with high uncertainty and complexity, or even strict adherence to such normative precepts as procedural invariance and logical consistency, but whether the technique performs better than its rivals. And to answer this question fairly, performance must be carefully specified. It should clearly include some measures of accuracy as well as a cost-benefit analysis that considers the tradeoff between effort and accuracy. In addition, legitimation criteria may be important to consider as well as the ability to refine and improve the approach as more experience is gained.

A third limitation of scenario planning in organizational settings is its weak integration into other planning and forecasting techniques.  Most companies have plenty of trouble dealing with just one future, let alone multiple ones. Typically, budgeting and planning systems are predicated on single views of the future, with adjustments made as necessary through variance analysis, contingency planning, rolling budgets, and periodic renegotiations. The weaknesses of these traditional approaches were very evident after the tragic attack of [[September 11, 2001]] when many companies became paralyzed and quite a few just threw away the plan and budget. Their strategies were not future-proof and they lacked organized mechanisms to adjust to external turmoil. In cases of crisis, leadership becomes important but so does some degree of preparedness.  Once the scenarios are finished, the real works starts of how to craft flexible strategies and appropriate monitoring systems.&lt;ref name="schoemaker2002" /&gt; Managers need a simple but comprehensive compass to navigate uncertainty from beginning to end. Scenario planning is just one component of a more complete management system. The point is that scenario thinking needs to be integrated with the existing planning and budgeting system, as awkward as this fit may be. The reality is that most organizations do not handle uncertainty well and that researchers have not provided adequate answers about how to plan under conditions of high uncertainty and complexity.

==Use by managers==
The basic concepts of the process are relatively simple. In terms of the overall approach to forecasting, they can be divided into three main groups of activities (which are, generally speaking, common to all long range forecasting processes):&lt;ref name="mercer1995" /&gt;
 
#Environmental analysis
#Scenario planning
#Corporate strategy
  
The first of these groups quite simply comprises the normal [[environmental analysis]]. This is almost exactly the same as that which should be undertaken as the first stage of any serious long-range planning. However, the quality of this analysis is especially important in the context of scenario planning. 
 
The central part represents the specific techniques – covered here – which differentiate the scenario forecasting process from the others in long-range planning.
 
The final group represents all the subsequent processes which go towards producing the [[corporate strategy]] and plans. Again, the requirements are slightly different but in general they follow all the rules of sound long-range planning.

==Process==
The part of the overall process which is radically different from most other forms of long-range planning is the central section, the actual production of the scenarios. Even this, though, is relatively simple, at its most basic level. As derived from the approach most commonly used by Shell,&lt;ref name="Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shell|title=Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide|url=http://s05.static-shell.com/content/dam/shell/static/public/downloads/brochures/corporate-pkg/scenarios/explorers-guide.pdf|website=www.shell.com/scenarios|publisher=Shell Global|accessdate=15 July 2014|ref=http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/explorers-guide.html|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it follows six steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meinert|first1=Sacha|title=Field manual - Scenario building|date=2014|publisher=Etui|location=Brussels|isbn=978-2-87452-314-4|url=http://www.etui.org/content/download/13953/114820/file/2014_Scenario_Building_DEF.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
#Decide drivers for change/assumptions
#Bring drivers together into a viable framework
#Produce 7–9 initial mini-scenarios
#Reduce to 2–3 scenarios
#Draft the scenarios
#Identify the issues arising

===Step 1 – decide assumptions/drivers for change===
The first stage is to examine the results of environmental analysis to determine which are the most important factors that will decide the nature of the future environment within which the organisation operates. These factors are sometimes called 'variables' (because they will vary over the time being investigated, though the terminology may confuse scientists who use it in a more rigorous manner). Users tend to prefer the term 'drivers' (for change), since this terminology is not laden with quasi-scientific connotations and reinforces the participant's commitment to search for those forces which will act to change the future. Whatever the nomenclature, the main requirement is that these will be informed assumptions.
 
This is partly a process of analysis, needed to recognise what these 'forces' might be. However, it is likely that some work on this element will already have taken place during the preceding environmental analysis. By the time the formal scenario planning stage has been reached, the participants may have already decided – probably in their sub-conscious rather than formally – what the main forces are.
 
In the ideal approach, the first stage should be to carefully decide the overall assumptions on which the scenarios will be based. Only then, as a second stage, should the various drivers be specifically defined. Participants, though, seem to have problems in separating these stages.
 
Perhaps the most difficult aspect though, is freeing the participants from the preconceptions they take into the process with them. In particular, most participants will want to look at the medium term, five to ten years ahead rather than the required longer-term, ten or more years ahead. However, a time horizon of anything less than ten years often leads participants to extrapolate from present trends, rather than consider the alternatives which might face them. When, however, they are asked to consider timescales in excess of ten years they almost all seem to accept the logic of the scenario planning process, and no longer fall back on that of extrapolation.  There is a similar problem with expanding participants horizons to include the whole external environment.

'''Brainstorming'''
 
In any case, the brainstorming which should then take place, to ensure that the list is complete, may unearth more variables – and, in particular, the combination of factors may suggest yet others. 
 
A very simple technique which is especially useful at this – [[brainstorming]] – stage, and in general for handling scenario planning debates is derived from use in Shell where this type of approach is often used. An especially easy approach, it only requires a conference room with a bare wall and copious supplies of 3M [[Post-It Notes]].
 
The six to ten people ideally taking part in such face-to-face debates should be in a conference room environment which is isolated from outside interruptions. The only special requirement is that the conference room has at least one clear wall on which Post-It notes will stick. At the start of the meeting itself, any topics which have already been identified during the environmental analysis stage are written (preferably with a  thick magic marker, so they can be read from a distance) on separate Post-It Notes. These Post-It Notes are then, at least in theory, randomly placed on the wall. In practice, even at this early stage the participants will want to cluster them in groups which seem to make sense. The only requirement (which is why Post-It Notes are ideal for this approach) is that there is no bar to taking them off again and moving them to a new cluster.

A similar technique – using 5" by 3" index cards – has also been described (as the 'Snowball Technique'), by Backoff and Nutt, for grouping and evaluating ideas in general.&lt;ref&gt;Backoff, R.W. and P.C. Nutt. "A Process for Strategic Management with Specific Application for the Non-Profit Organization," ''Strategic Planning: Threats and Opportunities for Planners''. Planners Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As in any form of brainstorming, the initial ideas almost invariably stimulate others. Indeed, everyone should be encouraged to add their own Post-It Notes to those on the wall. However it differs from the 'rigorous' form described in 'creative thinking' texts, in that it is much slower paced and the ideas are discussed immediately. In practice, as many ideas may be removed, as not being relevant, as are added. Even so, it follows many of the same rules as normal brainstorming and typically lasts the same length of time – say, an hour or so only.
 
It is important that all the participants feel they 'own' the wall – and are encouraged to move the notes around themselves. The result is a very powerful form of creative decision-making for groups, which is applicable to a wide range of situations (but is especially powerful in the context of scenario planning). It also offers a very good introduction for those who are coming to the scenario process for the first time. Since the workings are largely self-evident, participants very quickly come to understand exactly what is involved. 
 
'''Important and uncertain'''
 
This step is, though, also one of selection – since only the most important factors will justify a place in the scenarios. The [[Pareto principle|80:20 Rule]] here means that, at the end of the process, management's attention must be focused on a limited number of most important issues. Experience has proved that offering a wider range of topics merely allows them to select those few which interest them, and not necessarily those which are most important to the organisation.
 
In addition, as scenarios are a technique for presenting alternative futures, the factors to be included must be genuinely 'variable'. They should be subject to significant alternative outcomes. Factors whose outcome is predictable, but important, should be spelled out in the introduction to the scenarios (since they cannot be ignored). The Important Uncertainties Matrix, as reported by Kees van der Heijden of Shell, is a useful check at this stage.&lt;ref name="vanderheijden1996" /&gt;
 
At this point it is also worth pointing out that a great virtue of scenarios is that they can accommodate the input from any other form of forecasting. They may use figures, diagrams or words in any combination. No other form of forecasting offers this flexibility.

===Step 2 – bring drivers together into a viable framework===
The next step is to link these drivers together to provide a meaningful framework. This may be obvious, where some of the factors are clearly related to each other in one way or another. For instance, a technological factor may lead to market changes, but may be constrained by legislative factors. On the other hand, some of the 'links' (or at least the 'groupings') may need to be artificial at this stage. At a later stage more meaningful links may be found, or the factors may then be rejected from the scenarios. In the most theoretical approaches to the subject, probabilities are attached to the event strings. This is difficult to achieve, however, and generally adds little – except complexity – to the outcomes.
 
This is probably the most (conceptually) difficult step. It is where managers' 'intuition' – their ability to make sense of complex patterns of  'soft' data which more rigorous analysis would be unable to handle – plays an important role. There are, however, a range of techniques which can help; and again the Post-It-Notes approach is especially useful:
 
Thus, the participants try to arrange the  drivers, which have emerged from the first stage, into groups which seem to make sense to them. Initially there may be many small groups. The intention should, therefore, be to gradually merge these (often having to reform them from new combinations of drivers to make these bigger groups work). The aim of this stage is eventually to make 6–8 larger groupings;  'mini-scenarios'. Here the Post-It Notes may be moved dozens of times over the length – perhaps several hours or more – of each meeting. While this process is taking place the participants will probably want to add new topics – so more Post-It Notes are added to the wall. In the opposite direction, the unimportant ones are removed (possibly to be grouped, again as an 'audit trail' on another wall). More important, the 'certain' topics are also removed from the main area of debate – in this case they must be grouped in clearly labelled area of the main wall.
 
As the clusters – the 'mini-scenarios' – emerge, the associated notes may be stuck to each other rather than individually to the wall; which makes it easier to move the clusters around (and is a considerable help during the final, demanding stage to reducing the scenarios to two or three).
 
The great benefit of using Post-It Notes is that there is no bar to participants changing their minds. If they want to rearrange the groups – or simply to go back (iterate) to an earlier stage – then they strip them off and put them in their new position.

===Step 3 – produce initial mini-scenarios===
The outcome of the previous step is usually between seven and nine logical groupings of drivers. This is usually easy to achieve. The 'natural' reason for this may be that it represents some form of limit as to what participants can visualise. 
 
Having placed the factors in these groups, the next action is to work out, very approximately at this stage, what is the connection between them. What does each group of factors represent?

===Step 4 – reduce to two or three scenarios===
The main action, at this next stage, is to reduce the seven to nine mini-scenarios/groupings detected at the previous stage to two or three larger scenarios. The challenge in practice seems to come down to finding just two or three 'containers' into which all the topics can be sensibly fitted. This usually requires a considerable amount of debate – but in the process it typically generates as much light as it does heat. Indeed, the demanding process of developing these basic scenario frameworks often, by itself, produces fundamental insights into what are the really important (perhaps life and death) issues affecting the organisation. During this extended debate – and even before it is summarised in the final reports – the participants come to understand, by their own involvement in the debate, what the most important drivers for change may be, and (perhaps even more important) what their peers think they are. Based on this intimate understanding, they are well prepared to cope with such changes – reacting almost instinctively – when they actually do happen; even without recourse to the formal reports which are eventually produced!
 
There is no theoretical reason for reducing to just two or three scenarios, only a practical one. It has been found that the managers who will be asked to use the final scenarios can only cope effectively with a maximum of three versions! Shell started, more than three decades ago, by building half a dozen or more scenarios – but found that the outcome was that their managers selected just one of these to concentrate on. As a result, the planners reduced the number to three, which managers could handle easily but could no longer so easily justify the selection of only one! This is the number now recommended most frequently in most of the literature.   
 
'''Complementary scenarios'''
 
As used by Shell, and as favoured by a number of the academics, two scenarios should be complementary; the reason being that this helps avoid managers 'choosing' just one, 'preferred', scenario – and lapsing once more into single-track forecasting (negating the benefits of using 'alternative' scenarios to allow for alternative, uncertain futures). This is, however, a potentially difficult concept to grasp, where managers are used to looking for opposites; a good and a bad scenario, say, or an optimistic one versus a pessimistic one – and indeed this is the approach (for small businesses) advocated by Foster. In the Shell approach, the two scenarios are required to be equally likely, and between them to cover all the 'event strings'/drivers. Ideally they should not be obvious opposites, which might once again bias their acceptance by users, so the choice of  'neutral' titles is important. For example, Shell's two scenarios at the beginning of the 1990s were titled 'Sustainable World' and 'Global Mercantilism'[xv]. In practice, we found that this requirement, much to our surprise, posed few problems for the great majority, 85%, of those in the survey; who easily produced 'balanced' scenarios. The remaining 15% mainly fell into the expected trap of 'good versus bad'. We have found that our own relatively complex (OBS) scenarios can also be made complementary to each other; without any great effort needed from the teams involved; and the resulting two scenarios are both developed further by all involved, without unnecessary focusing on one or the other.
 
'''Testing'''
 
Having grouped the factors into these two scenarios, the next step is to test them, again, for viability. Do they make sense to the participants? This may be in terms of logical analysis, but it may also be in terms of intuitive 'gut-feel'. Once more, intuition often may offer a useful – if academically less respectable – vehicle for reacting to the complex and ill-defined issues typically involved. If the scenarios do not intuitively 'hang together', why not? The usual problem is that one or more of the assumptions turns out to be unrealistic in terms of how the participants see their world. If this is the case then you need to return to the first step – the whole scenario planning process is above all an iterative one (returning to its beginnings a number of times until the final outcome makes the best sense).

===Step 5 – write the scenarios===
The scenarios are then 'written up' in the most suitable form. The flexibility of this step often confuses participants, for they are used to forecasting processes which have a fixed format. The rule, though, is that you should produce the scenarios in the form most suitable for use by the managers who are going to base their strategy on them. Less obviously, the managers who are going to implement this strategy should also be taken into account. They will also be exposed to the scenarios, and will need to believe in these. This is essentially a 'marketing' decision, since it will be very necessary to 'sell' the final results to the users. On the other hand, a not inconsiderable consideration may be to use the form the author also finds most comfortable. If the form is alien to him or her the chances are that the resulting scenarios will carry little conviction when it comes to the 'sale'. 
 
Most scenarios will, perhaps, be written in word form (almost as a series of alternative essays about the future); especially where they will almost inevitably be qualitative  which is hardly surprising where managers, and their audience, will probably use this in their day to day communications. Some, though use an expanded series of lists and some enliven their reports by adding some fictional 'character' to the material – perhaps taking literally the idea that they are stories about the future – though they are still clearly intended to be factual. On the other hand, they may include numeric data and/or diagrams – as those of Shell do (and in the process gain by the acid test of more measurable 'predictions').

===Step 6 – identify issues arising===
The final stage of the process is to examine these scenarios to determine what are the most critical outcomes; the 'branching points' relating to the 'issues' which will have the greatest impact (potentially generating 'crises') on the future of the organisation. The subsequent strategy will have to address these – since the normal approach to strategy deriving from scenarios is one which aims to minimise risk by being 'robust' (that is it will safely cope with all the alternative outcomes of these 'life and death' issues) rather than aiming for performance (profit) maximisation by gambling on one outcome.

==Use of scenarios==
It is important to note that scenarios may be used in a number of ways:
 
'''a) Containers for the drivers/event strings'''
 
Most basically, they are a logical device, an artificial framework, for presenting the individual factors/topics (or coherent groups of these) so that these are made easily available for managers' use – as useful ideas about future developments in their  own right – without reference to the rest of the scenario. It should be stressed that no factors should be dropped, or even given lower priority, as a result of producing the scenarios. In this context, which scenario contains which topic (driver), or issue about the future, is irrelevant. 
 
'''b) Tests for consistency'''
 
At every stage it is necessary to iterate, to check that the contents are viable and make any necessary changes to ensure that they are; here the main test is to see if the scenarios seem to be internally consistent – if they are not then the writer must loop back to earlier stages to correct the problem. Though it has been mentioned previously, it is important to stress once again that scenario building is ideally an iterative process. It usually does not just happen in one meeting – though even one attempt is better than none – but takes place over a number of meetings as the participants gradually refine their ideas.
 
'''c) Positive perspectives'''
 
Perhaps the main benefit deriving from scenarios, however, comes from the alternative 'flavors' of the future their different perspectives offer. It is a common experience, when the scenarios finally emerge, for the participants to be startled by the insight they offer – as to what the general shape of the future might be – at this stage it no longer is a theoretical exercise but becomes a genuine framework (or rather set of alternative frameworks) for dealing with that.

==Scenario planning compared to other techniques==
Scenario planning differs from [[contingency planning]], [[sensitivity analysis]] and [[computer simulation]]s.&lt;ref name="schoemaker2002"&gt;Schoemaker, Paul J.H. ''Profiting from Uncertainty''. Free Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contingency planning is a "What if" tool, that only takes into account one uncertainty. However, scenario planning considers combinations of uncertainties in each scenario. Planners also try to select especially plausible but uncomfortable combinations of social developments.

Sensitivity analysis analyzes changes in one variable only, which is useful for simple changes, while scenario planning tries to expose policy makers to significant interactions of major variables.

While scenario planning can benefit from computer simulations, scenario planning is less formalized, and can be used to make plans for qualitative patterns that show up in a wide variety of simulated events.

During the past 5 years, computer supported [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological Analysis]] has been employed as aid in scenario development by the [[Swedish Defence Research Agency]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="erikssonritchey"&gt;T. Eriksson &amp; T. Ritchey, {{cite web |url=http://www.swemorph.com/pdf/cornwallis3.pdf |title=Scenario Development using Computer Aided Morphological Analysis}} Adapted from a Paper Presented at the Winchester International OR Conference, England, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; This method makes it possible to create a multi-variable morphological field which can be treated as an inference model – thus integrating scenario planning techniques with [[contingency analysis]] and [[sensitivity analysis]].

==Combination of Delphi and scenarios==
Scenario planning concerns planning based on the systematic examination of the future by picturing plausible and consistent images thereof. [[Delphi method|Delphi]], in turn, attempts to develop systematically expert opinion consensus concerning future developments and events. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round.

Numerous researchers have stressed that both approaches are best suited to be combined. Kinkel et al. (2006)&lt;ref name="Kinkel06"&gt;Kinkel, S., Armbruster, H., &amp; Schirrmeister, E. (2006). Szenario-Delphi oder Delphi-Szenario? Erfahrungen aus zwei Vorausschaustudien mit der Kombination dieser Methoden. In J. Gausemeier (Ed.), Vorausschau und Technologieplanung: 2. Symposium für Vorausschau und Technologieplanung (pp. 109-137). Paderborn: Heinz-Nixdorf-Institut.&lt;/ref&gt; recently reported on their experiences with both Delphi-scenarios and scenario-Delphis. The authors found that, due to their process similarity, the two methodologies can be easily combined. Generally speaking, the output of the different phases of the Delphi method can be used as input for the scenario method and vice versa. A combination makes a realization of the benefits of both tools possible. In practice, usually one of the two tools is considered the dominant methodology and the other one is integrated at some stage. In fact, the authors found that in either case the combination of the methodologies adds significant value to futures projects.

The variant that is most often found in practice is the integration of the Delphi method into the scenario process (see e.g. Rikkonen, 2005;&lt;ref name="Rik05"&gt;Rikkonen, P. (2005). Utilisation of alternative scenario approaches in defining the policy agenda for future agriculture in Finland. Turku School of Economics and Business Administration, Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; von der Gracht, 2007;&lt;ref name="vdGracht07"&gt;von der Gracht, H. (2007). Scenario Planning for Logistics Service Providers. Planning Practices and Scenarios for 2025. EBS Business School, Supply Chain Management Institute, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/transportation-logistics/tl2030/tl2030-pub.jhtml Transportation &amp; Logistics 2030 – How will supply chains evolve in an energy constrained and low-carbon world]; [http://www.pwc.com/en_GX/gx/transportation-logistics/tl2030/infrastructure/supply-chains.jhtml Transportation &amp; Logistics 2030 – Transport infrastructure – Engine or hand brakes for global supply chains?]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719193840/http://www.ebs.edu/smi/1661.html?&amp;L=1 Future of Logistics – Global Scenarios 2025]).  Authors refer to this type as Delphi-scenario (writing), expert-based scenarios, or Delphi panel derived scenarios. Von der Gracht (2010)&lt;ref name = "vdG2010"&gt;von der Gracht, H. A./ Darkow, I.-L.: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527310001349 Scenarios for the Logistics Service Industry: A Delphi-based analysis for 2025]. In: International Journal of Production Economics, Vol. 127, No. 1, 2010, 46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; is a scientifically valid example of this method. Since scenario planning is “information hungry”, Delphi research can deliver valuable input for the process. There are various types of information output of Delphi that can be used as input for scenario planning. Researchers can, for example, identify relevant events or developments and, based on expert opinion, assign probabilities to them. Moreover, expert comments and arguments provide deeper insights into relationships of factors that can, in turn, be integrated into scenarios afterwards. Also, Delphi helps to identify extreme opinions and dissent among the experts. Such controversial topics are particularly suited for extreme scenarios or wildcards.

In his doctoral thesis, Rikkonen (2005)&lt;ref name="Rik05"/&gt; examined the utilization of Delphi techniques in scenario planning and, concretely, in construction of scenarios. The author comes to the conclusion that the Delphi technique has instrumental value in providing different alternative futures and the argumentation of scenarios. It is therefore recommended to use Delphi in order to make the scenarios more profound and to create confidence in scenario planning. Further benefits lie in the simplification of the scenario writing process and the deep understanding of the interrelations between the forecast items and social factors.

{{Legend|green|In favour (106)}}{{Legend|red|Against (46)}}{{Legend|yellow|Abstained (34)}}]]
At Italy's instigation, the '''UN moratorium on the death penalty''' resolution was presented by the EU in partnership with eight co-author member States to the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]],  calling for general suspension (not abolition) of [[capital punishment]] throughout the world. It was twice affirmed: first, on 15 November 2007 by the Third Committee, and then subsequently reaffirmed on 18 December by the [[United Nations General Assembly resolution]] 62/149.  New Zealand played a central role facilitating agreement between the co-author group and other supporters.

It calls on States that maintain the death penalty to establish a [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the use of the death penalty with a view to abolition, and in the meantime, to restrict the number of offences which it punishes and to respect the rights of those on death row. It also calls on States that have abolished the death penalty not to reintroduce it. Like all General Assembly resolutions, it is not binding on any state.

On 18 December 2007, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted  104 to 54 in favour of resolution A/RES/62/149, which proclaims a global moratorium on the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], with 29 abstentions (as well as 5 absent at the time of the vote).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/ga10678.doc.htm UNGA press release], UNGA website&lt;/ref&gt; Italy had proposed and sponsored this resolution.  After the resolution's approval, Italian Foreign Minister [[Massimo D'Alema]] declared: "Now we must start working on the abolition of the death penalty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/09/sezioni/esteri/pena-di-morte2/voto-moratoria/voto-moratoria.html Article from Italian newspaper La Repubblica], in Italian&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2008, the General Assembly adopted another resolution (A/RES/63/168) reaffirming its previous call for a global moratorium on capital punishment 106 to 46 (with 34 abstentions and another 6 were absent at the time of the vote).  Working in partnership with the EU, New Zealand and Mexico were co-facilitators of the draft text which was developed over a period of six months, which Chile then presented to the UN General Assembly on behalf of cosponsors.

On 21 December 2010, the 65th General Assembly adopted a third resolution (A/RES/65/206) with 109 countries voting in favour, 41 against and 35 abstentions (another seven countries were absent at the time of the vote).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.handsoffcain.info/news/index.php?iddocumento=13317774 NEW RESOLUTION APPROVED BY THE UN. THE PRO MORATORIUM FRONT GROWS]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The international campaign==

===Hands off Cain===
[[File:Ntc logo2.png|thumb|100px|left|Logo of the organization "Hands Off Cain".]]
The UN moratorium campaign was launched in Italy by the association Hands Off Cain, affiliated to the [[Nonviolent Radical Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35043 "NGOs, Italy Seek Worldwide Ban"], ''IPS'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The association against death penalty and [[torture]] was founded in [[Rome]] in 1993 by former [[left-wing]] [[terrorist]] and now [[nonviolent]] [[politician]] and [[human rights]]' activist [[Sergio D'Elia]], with his first wife Mariateresa Di Lascia and [[Italian Radicals]]' [[Liberalism|liberal]] leaders [[Marco Pannella]] and [[Emma Bonino]] (former [[European commissioner]]).

===The previous history===
In 1994 a resolution for a moratorium was presented for the first time at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) by the Italian government. It lost by eight votes. Since 1997, through Italy's initiative, and since 1999 through the EU's endeavour, the United Nations Commission of Human Rights (UNCHR) has been approving a resolution calling for a moratorium on executions with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty, every year. The 2007 vote at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly saw intense diplomatic activity in favour of the moratorium by EU countries, and by the Nonviolent Radical Party itself; the [[Catholic]] [[Community of Sant'Egidio]] joined forces by submitting to the U.N. an appeal and 5,000,000 signatures asking for the moratorium to be passed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}.

'''Visual ethics''' is an emerging interdisciplinary field of scholarship that brings together religious studies, philosophy, photo and video journalism, visual arts, and [[cognitive science]] in order to explore the ways human beings relate to others ethically through visual perception. Historically, the field of [[ethics]] has relied heavily on rational-linguistic approaches, largely ignoring the importance of seeing and visual representation to human moral behavior. At the same time, studies in [[visual culture]] tend to analyze imagistic representations while ignoring many of the ethical dimensions involved. Visual ethics is a field of cross-fertilization of ethics and visual culture studies that seeks to understand how the production and reception of visual images is always ethical, whether or not we are consciously aware of this fact.

== Ethics of visual production ==

On the one hand, visual ethics is concerned with ethical issues involved in the production of visual images. For example, how do representations in newsmedia deploy cultural codes of race, class, ethnicity, gender, and so on in order to create distance from or empathy with specific people and groups? How can visual representations of the other facilitate or foreclose certain ethical responses from viewers? When is it ethically justifiable to capture and share images of another person in a moment of vulnerability? With whom should such images be shared?

== Ethics of visual reception ==

Visual ethics is equally concerned with the ethics of reception, that is, with seeing as an ethical act. How do different images influence our ethical responses and moral behavior in different ways? To what extent do our ethical responses to images take place pre-reflectively, by visual-perceptual processes in the body-mind, before images even come to consciousness? It can be looked upon more into the cultural perception. It always depends on the cultural background.

==Ethics and visual arts==

This topic focuses on ethical theories and methods of ethical reasoning.  Controversies and arguments abound as ethical decisions, or the lack thereof, continue to play a role in institutional practice. With the increasing gap between commerce and culture, the prioritization of good business over public service creates an increasingly blurry set of ethical guidelines. Collector-based exhibitions, conflicts of interest, and the de-accessioning practices of collections.  One might ask do museums have a responsibility to their public? And if so, is this a part of institutional culture and is it being taught in today’s museum studies programs?  [[Elaine A. King]] and co-editor Gail Levin addressed many of these issues in the anthology they compiled titled "Ethics and The Visual Arts" published in September 2006 by Allworth Press in New York. This volume of 19 essays explores a diverse range of topics about ethics in the visual arts.  The dark side of the arts is explored in this volume with nineteen diverse essays by such distinguished authors as Eric Fischl, Suzaan Boettger, Stephen Weil, Richard Serra, and more cover a broad range of topics facing today’s artists, policy makers, art lawyers, galleries, museum professionals, and more.

== Visual Ethics Symposium ==

In April 2007, under the direction of [[Timothy Beal]] of the Baker-Nord Center for the Humanities and William E. Deal of the Inamori Center for Ethics at [[Case Western Reserve University]] hosted an interdisciplinary group of scholars in the fields of philosophical ethics, religious studies, theology, visual culture studies, neuroscience, and cognitive science to develop the first research collaboration on visual ethics.

'''Vortigaunts''' are a fictional extra-dimensional [[species]] in the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]] of [[video game]]s by [[Valve Corporation]]. In ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and its three expansions, Vortigaunts are frequently encountered by the player as hostile [[non-player character]]s in ''Half-Life'' and later as allies in ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. The Vortigaunts are depicted in ''Half-Life'' as being an enslaved race in an [[multiverse|alternative dimension]] called [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], subservient to a large creature called the [[List of creatures in the Half-Life series#Nihilanth|Nihilanth]], which itself is a slave to undisclosed masters. In ''Half-Life 2'', the Vortigaunts have broken free of their slavery, and actively assist the player and other humans in resisting the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] occupation of [[Earth]].

Vortigaunts are shown as a very communal and cultural race, believing in a force that binds the fabric of the universe and each Vortigaunt together, as well as producing a tradition of poetry and music. Vortigaunts also display the ability to summon and command electrical energy without the need for technology. This ability is used for various activities, such as a means of attack, powering electrical equipment, and healing.

The fictional creatures have received a range of critical responses from their various appearances. In addition to their role within the ''Half-Life'' series, Vortigaunts have been adapted for [[machinima]] productions and have been made into a [[plush toy]] by Valve.

==Character design==
[[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] provides the voice for the Vortigaunts in ''Half-Life 2'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=43775&amp;tab=credits|title=''Half-Life 2'' – Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was partially chosen due to his role as the alien in the film ''[[Enemy Mine (film)|Enemy Mine]]''.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|first=David|last=Hodgson|date=2004|isbn=978-0-7615-4364-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Episode Two'', the Vortigaunts' voicing was done by [[Tony Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=50489&amp;tab=credits|title=''The Orange Box'' – Credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graphically, the Vortigaunts in both ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2'' were designed by [[concept art]]ists Dhabih Eng and Chuck Jones.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt;

Initially, Vortigaunts were planned to begin ''Half-Life'' as enemy non-player characters, which the player has to win over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved impractical and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt; The plan re-emerged for ''Half-Life 2'', in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in ''Half-Life 2'' were originally going to be fully integrated in [[City 17]] alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game taking place in the countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to hint at the story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game.&lt;ref name="CVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=147512|title=PC Interview: Looking Back... ''Half-Life 2: Episode One''|work=[[PC Zone]]|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|date=2006-10-12|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through ''Half-Life 2'', the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, but it was too late in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in ''Episode Two''.&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; The concept was later showcased in an ''Episode Two'' trailer shown at the [[Games Convention]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200608/N06.0824.1746.35287.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731115011/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200608/N06.0824.1746.35287.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-31 |title=GC 2006: New ''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' Details Emerge |work=[[Game Informer]] |publisher=[[GameStop Corporation]] |first=Billy |last=Berghammer |date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2009-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to series writer [[Marc Laidlaw]], one of the most important goals with ''Episode Two'' was to expand on the Vortigaunts as characters, as opposed to just "purveyors of bugbait or Xen [[Kōan|koans]]".&lt;ref name="play"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&amp;contentid=587 |title=Interview – Valve Software |work=[[Play (US magazine)|Play]] |publisher=Fusion Publishing |first=Mike |last=Griffin |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018065127/http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content |archivedate=2009-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Valve added new behaviours, new animations, and new audio to the Vortigaunts.&lt;ref name="play"/&gt; [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] devices called "Vorti-Cells" were to be encountered in ''Half-Life 2''. They were meant to siphon power from captive Vortigaunts in City 17. The player would then be able to free Vortigaunts from these devices to gain their assistance.&lt;ref name="raising the bar"/&gt;

==Attributes==
===Society===
Vortigaunts are very intelligent and social creatures. In ''Half-Life'', they serve as basic ground units for the [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]] forces, often supporting heavier troops fighting the player and the humans in the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. They are capable of developing intelligent strategies and tactics to take on their enemies.&lt;ref name="VortHL2"/&gt; Initially, Vortigaunts are enslaved to the [[Nihilanth]], a large creature on Xen, who, in turn, claims it is a slave to unknown superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 1998| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Interloper| quote='''Nihilanth''': Their slaves, we are their slaves, we are.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Xen, the Vortigaunts are used as factory workers and drones.&lt;ref name="interloper"/&gt; In ''Half-Life 2'', Vortigaunts indicate that this slavery has lasted for generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Vortigaunts are shown to have developed an intellectual culture, valuing poetry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': Our finest poet describes it thus: Gallum galla gilla ma.}}&lt;/ref&gt; music&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote='''Vortigaunt''': We are mindful of the words of our greatest philosopher: Kpnnum gninin vogenuk!}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Vortigaunts practise the husbandry of [[antlion (Half-Life)|antlions]], large insectoids that live in underground hives, as an ancestral tradition. The death of the Nihilanth at the hands of [[Gordon Freeman]] at the end of ''Half-Life'' frees the Vortigaunts from their slavery;&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote = '''Vortigaunt''': While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us.}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently the Vortigaunts see Freeman as a [[messianic figure]].

Vortigaunts possess their own method of vocal communication, "flux shifting", which they can be heard using in ''Half-Life 2''. This method of communication involves both speakers vocalising at the same time and cannot be understood by other species who lack the auditory anatomy to interpret the sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Sandtraps| quote='''Vortigaunt #1''': The Freeman must excuse us.

Vortigaunts use scattered English words in ''Half-Life'' to taunt the player, although by ''Half-Life 2'' they have learned to speak at least the English language fluently, albeit using archaic words and grammatical structures. In addition, the Vortigaunts believe in a binding life-force referred to as the "Vortessence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game | title = [[Half-Life 2]] | developer = [[Valve Corporation]] | date = 2004| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| level = Water Hazard| quote = '''Vortigaunt''': Communion of the Vortessence.

===Depiction===
In general, a Vortigaunt is a somewhat [[humanoid]] figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and [[digitigrade]] legs, allowing them to move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye.&lt;ref name="VortHL2E"/&gt; In ''Half-Life'', this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes,&lt;ref name="VortHL1"/&gt; although, in ''Half-Life 2'', this has been reduced to three smaller eyes.&lt;ref name="VortHL2"/&gt; A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts.&lt;ref name="VortHL1"/&gt; In addition, Vortigaunts have been shown to be able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's [[HEV suit]] or powering up electrical generators.&lt;ref name="VortHL2"/&gt; Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles,&lt;ref name="VortHL1"/&gt; although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of ''Half-Life 2'' and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as [[carnivore|meat eaters]]; the player can observe Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in ''Half-Life''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&amp;id=14&amp;game=4 |title=''Half-Life'' Walkthrough: Lambda Core |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810183251/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&amp;id=14&amp;game=4 |archivedate=2011-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooking [[headcrab]]s in ''Half-Life 2'',&lt;ref name="WaterHazard"/&gt; although ''Half-Life 2'' also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are [[omnivore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=16&amp;game=3 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough—Chapter 5: Black Mesa East |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113112249/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=16&amp;game=3 |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vortigaunts are first introduced as one of the primary enemies in ''Half-Life''. They are frequently encountered by players throughout ''Half-Life'' and its three expansions, ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Opposing Force]]'', ''[[Half-Life: Blue Shift|Blue Shift]]'' and ''[[Half-Life: Decay|Decay]]''. They are portrayed as one of the sentient races of [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]], often working in groups or with more heavily armored Xen troops.&lt;ref name="VortHL1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&amp;id=7&amp;game=4 |title=Life Forms |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410063004/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLGameInfo.Detail&amp;id=7&amp;game=4 |archivedate=2010-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later stages of ''Half-Life'', Vortigaunts are seen working in factory-like environments, constructing or maturing the more heavily armored Xen troops in [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]-like capsules under the direction of other aliens in the Xen hierarchy.&lt;ref name="interloper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&amp;id=17&amp;game=4 |title=''Half-Life'' Walkthrough: Interloper |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808203841/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=hlstrategies.detail&amp;id=17&amp;game=4 |archivedate=2011-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]] expansion ''Decay'', players have the opportunity to assume the role of two Vortigaunts if they score highly on all missions. In this bonus mission, entitled "Xen Attacks", two Vortigaunts, designated as Drone Subjects X-8973 and R-4913, are given a mission by the Nihilanth to retrieve a number of crystals stolen from Xen by human scientists from the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]].&lt;ref name="Decay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Previews.Detail&amp;id=67 |title=''Half-Life: Decay'' |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2006-11-12 |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418020910/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=Previews.Detail&amp;id=67 |archivedate=2008-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Half-Life 2''===
The role of the Vortigaunts is drastically changed in ''Half-Life 2''. Now acting as allies to the player, Vortigaunts have been freed as a result of protagonist [[Gordon Freeman]] killing the Nihilanth at the end of ''Half-Life''. Instead of acting with hostility towards humanity, the Vortigaunts are actively engaged in assisting the human resistance against the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]], a multi-dimensional empire that has invaded and occupied [[Earth]] in between ''Half-Life'' and ''Half-Life 2''.&lt;ref name="VortHL2"/&gt; Vortigaunts are frequently seen at resistance compounds and stations,&lt;ref name="WaterHazard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=15&amp;game=3 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough—Chapter 4: Water Hazard |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312224556/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&amp;id=15&amp;game=3 |archivedate=2008-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; often performing maintenance work or providing help with experiments, and sometimes assist the player by using their energy abilities to recharge the player's [[HEV suit]].&lt;ref name="VortHL2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=2&amp;game=3 |title=''Half-Life 2'' Allies |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413085731/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=2&amp;game=3 |archivedate=2008-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of Vortigaunts are still in captivity, as at various points in the game, Vortigaunts are shown used as slave labor by the Combine; for example, one Vortigaunt is seen cleaning the floor of a Combine train station with a broom, wearing a similar collar to those worn in ''Half-Life''.&lt;ref name="VortHL2"/&gt;

Vortigaunts play a greater part in the story of the series in ''Half-Life 2''{{'}}s continuations, ''Episode One'' and ''Episode Two''. In ''Episode One'', Vortigaunts use unexplained powers to rescue [[Alyx Vance]], the series' main female character, from the top of the Combine Citadel in [[City 17]], saving her from the explosion of the Citadel's reactor at the end of ''Half-Life 2''.&lt;ref name="VortHL2E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=23&amp;game=3 |title=''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' Allies |work=Planet Half-Life |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411053327/http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=23&amp;game=3 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vortigaunts also free Gordon Freeman from the [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] imposed on him at the end of ''Half-Life 2'' by his enigmatic employer, the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]], much to the G-Man's irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] |developer=[[Valve Corporation]]| scene = Prologue |date=2006-06-01 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]] |quote='''G-Man:''' We'll see...about ''that''. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Episode Two'' dedicates much of the early part of the game to the Vortigaunts, with a group of four Vortigaunts working to heal Alyx Vance after she is mortally wounded by a Combine [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two#Enemies|Hunter]], while tracking and killing the Combine [[Combine Advisor|Advisors]] that fled the Citadel.&lt;ref name="VortHL2E"/&gt; One Vortigaunt accompanies the player and acts as combat support on an expedition into an antlion hive.

===Reception===
The change of the Vortigaunts from enemy characters to allied characters in ''Half-Life 2'' was described as "intriguing" by reviewers, with ''[[PC Zone]]'' stating that the Vortigaunts were one of the most interesting characters in the game, playing a role "somewhere between [[Yoda]] and [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|ET]]".&lt;ref name="PCZoneHL2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=111902 |title=PC Review: ''Half-Life 2'' |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |work=[[PC Zone]] |date=2004-11-16 |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208035503/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=111902 |archivedate=2006-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the Vortigaunts in ''Episode Two'' was met with more approval by critics, who described the Vortigaunt who accompanies the player in the early parts of the game as "a great joy to fight alongside", praising the improved artificial intelligence and noting that "the fact that they're not trying to intricately imitate real-life people" significantly aided the presentation of the Vortigaunts.&lt;ref name="CVGEP2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=173331 |publisher=''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' |title=Review: ''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' |first=Andy |last=Robinson |date=2007-10-10 |accessdate=2008-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624090605/http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=173331 |archivedate=2007-06-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[IGN]] praised the visual and character overhaul given to the Vortigaunt in ''Episode Two''.&lt;ref name="IGNEP2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/826/826067p1.html|title=''Half-Life 2: Episode Two'' Review|first=Dan|last=Adams|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the sixteenth-century coroner|the eighteenth and nineteenth writer|William Danby}}

'''William Danby''' ([[floruit|''fl.'']] 1542–1593) was a sixteenth-century lawyer and [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]] towards the end of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. He is particularly noted for having presided over the inquest into the controversial death at Deptford in 1593 of the poet/dramatist [[Christopher Marlowe]].

==Lincoln's Inn==

Although the date of Danby's birth is unknown, he is most probably the William Danby who entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 1 August 1542.&lt;ref&gt;Discovered by William Urry ({{harvnb|Urry|1988|p=92}}) and supported by Charles Nicholl ({{harvnb|Nicholl|2002|p=20}}) and Park Honan ({{harvnb|Honan|2005|p=354}}).&lt;/ref&gt; If so, his exact contemporary there was the father of Marlowe's friend and patron [[Thomas Walsingham (literary patron)|Thomas Walsingham]], another Thomas, who was born in 1526.&lt;ref&gt;''The Records of the Honorable Society of Lincoln's Inn. The Black Books, Vol. I, 1422–1586'' (London, 1897). A William Danby is also mentioned in the ''Black Books'' as having, on 8 May 1553, agreed with Thomas Hardwick "to be responsible for the debts of Miles Sticke, late Steward."&lt;/ref&gt; Danby was therefore probably in his late sixties at the time of Marlowe's inquest.

==Coroner of The Queen's Household==

In 1589 Danby apparently took over the role of Coroner of The Queen's Household from Richard Vale. The first time Danby's name appears in this capacity (in the Middlesex records held at the London Metropolitan Archives) was for an inquest held in October 1589—in Shepperton, Middlesex—when he presided together with a county coroner, John Chalkhill, at the inquest on one Robert Wrote. Unfortunately for Danby, this case was later declared "insufficient"&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=4awvAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA45-IA1&amp;dq=M3yAR_eXKZnOtAOjjfy_Cw The Reports of Edward Coke, knt. (1572–1617)] Part.IV pp.45–47.&lt;/ref&gt; because Chalkhill had not said in his report that Shepperton was within the verge, which was legally required to explain Danby's presence there.

We know that Danby's predecessor as the Royal coroner, Richard Vale, was also one of the coroners for Middlesex&lt;ref&gt;From the item above, "...an inquisition taken before R. Vale, then coroner of the Queen's houshold and one of the coroners ''com. Midd.'' (of the county of Middlesex)". Similarly, [[Michael Burgess (coroner)|Michael Burgess]], the holder of that position today, is also the coroner for Surrey, and his predecessor, Sir John Burton, was coroner for West London. See an [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/how-much-does-he-earn-no-21-dr-john-burton-coroner-for-west-london-1428814.html item] in ''The Independent'' newspaper of 13 March 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately only a very few (and irrelevant) Kentish inquests survive from that time to provide direct evidence that Danby similarly combined his royal responsibilities with those of a county coroner, and if he had been, it should have been noted in his report of Marlowe's inquest, which it did not.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hotson|1925|pp=28–34}} and the extract from Sir Edward Coke cited above (p.47).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, two other pieces of evidence suggest that he may have nevertheless also been a coroner for Kent. The first is that it would have been illegal for him to have presided on his own over the Marlowe inquest, as he did, ''unless'' he was also a coroner for Kent, as Deptford was both in Kent and, at the time, within the verge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honan|2005|p=354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is that Leslie Hotson said that he had found a William Danby in Woolwich (in Kent, four or five miles east of Deptford) at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hotson|1925|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, although Hotson gave no reference for this claim, William Urry was prepared to acknowledge it as quite likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Urry|1988|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Marlowe inquest==

Had there been no doubts about Danby's report of the inquest jury's verdict on Marlowe's death, the name of William Danby would have probably disappeared by now. Some biographers still accept the story told at the inquest as a true account,&lt;ref&gt;For example {{Harvnb|Kuriyama|2002|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Downie|2000|pp=26–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority of the more recent ones find the verdict of a killing in self-defence difficult to accept, and think that it must have been a deliberate murder, even though there is no agreement as to who was behind it or just what their motive might have been for arranging it.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Breight|1996|p=114}}, {{Harvnb|Hammer|1996|pp=225–242}}, {{Harvnb|Trow|2001|p=250}}, {{Harvnb|Nicholl|2002|pp=415–7}}, {{Harvnb|Kendall|2003|pp=272–9}}, {{Harvnb|Haynes|2004|pp=119–120}}, {{Harvnb|Riggs|2004|p=334}} and {{Harvnb|Honan|2005|p=354}} – all of whom offer different explanations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marlovian theory]] even argues that the most logical reason for those people to have been there at that time was to fake Marlowe's death, allowing him to escape almost certain trial and execution for his seditious atheism.

The date of Danby's death is unknown, but there is no record of his having presided over any other inquest after this date, so the last we hear of him is when he obeys the command to send a copy of the Marlowe inquisition to the Court of Chancery on 15 June 1593.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''Şevki Balmumcu''' (1905 &amp;ndash; 20 April 1982 [[Istanbul]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] architect who designed the [[Ankara Opera House]].

He was born in 1905 in Istanbul.

In 1928, he graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts as an architect. Between 1930 and 1932, he worked as the control architect of many buildings including Bursa Cinema Theater in Bursa, which is among the first modern cinema, theater and concert halls of the republic history. [1]

The winning of a cinema and office building project competition in Elâzığ is one of the important achievements in his professional life. However, the most important turning point in his career was the fact that he won the competition for the Ankara exhibition building in 1933. The building, which was built in 1933-1934, was a successful practice in Soviet Structuralism or Neo-Plasticism styles. The building, which often hosts exhibitions reflecting the development moves of the republic, was used as a work symbolizing the ideals of Kemalist thought in photographs, postcards and republic posters, and most often in the pages of La Turquie Kemaliste. [2]

The exhibition building was converted into an opera house in 1948 by Paul Bonatz. It is said that the transformation of the structure from its original form into an appropriate form for the style of Second National Architecture with its porticoes and ornaments distressed Şevki Balmumcu and removed him from the architectural profession. [3] The architect did not go to Ankara after this incident. [4]

After his success in 1933, Şevki Balmumcu won many architectural design competitions. From 1941 to 1958 he worked in Tekel General Directorate as a construction bureau chief. After 1958, he continued his professional life independently, but there was no remarkable work during this period. He died on April 20, 1982. [1] His funeral was buried in Edirnekapı Cemetery.
