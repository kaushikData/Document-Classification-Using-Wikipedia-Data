The '''A72 road''' is a major route in [[Scotland]] connecting [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] in [[South Lanarkshire]], with [[Galashiels]] in the [[Scottish Borders]]. It travels for over {{Convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} in a south-easterly direction, along the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] and [[River Tweed|Tweed]] valleys, passing the towns of [[Larkhall]], [[Lanark]], [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] and [[Peebles]].

==Route==
===Hamilton to Lanark===
Starting at the junction with the [[A724 road (Great Britain)|A724]], the road parallels the [[M74 motorway|M74]], following the original A74 (now [[List of B roads in Great Britain|B7078]]) before descending into the forested [[Clyde Valley]] as it skirts around the town of Larkhall. The road follows the [[River Clyde]], with some tight bends, sheer drops and adverse cambers, and meets the [[A73 road|A73]] just north of Lanark. 

=== Lanark to Causewayend ===
This section of the road follows the course of the A73 through the town of Lanark and, just before [[Symington, South Lanarkshire|Symington]], again becomes the A72. It meets the main [[A702 road|A702]], [[Edinburgh]] to [[Abington, South Lanarkshire|Abington]], [[South Lanarkshire]] road; this short section of road is narrow as it passes through Symington.

=== Causewayend to Kaimrig End ===
[[File:The A72 At Wolfclyde - geograph.org.uk - 1077935.jpg|left|thumb|The A72 near Wolfclyde between [[Symington, South Lanarkshire|Symington]] and [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]]]]
This section of the road follows the course of the A702 for approximately 3 miles through the town of [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]]. The A72 enters the village of [[Skirling, Scottish Borders|Skirling]] before ascending onto higher moorland. This section of road is notorious for accidents due to its high elevation, poor weather and winding route.{{fact|date=April 2017}}

=== Kaimrig End to Galashiels ===
On this last {{Convert|6|mi|km|order=flip}} section of A72, it is the secondary route on the [[A701 road|A701]]. Just south of [[Blyth Bridge]], it meets the [[A721 road|A721]], and less than a mile further, it leaves the course of the A701. The A72 ascends a high plateau, then descends into the valley of the [[River Tweed]] at [[Stobo]], and parallels the Tweed for the remainder of its length.

The road passes through [[Peebles]] and then [[Innerleithen]] and [[Walkerburn]] towards Galashiels.  It comes to an end at a junction with the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]], which leads on to the [[Galashiels]] Ring Road.

The pass starts from just northeast of the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] over the North Atlantic Ocean to central Africa, over [[South Sudan]].]]

The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second largest of the world's [[ocean]]s, with an area of about {{convert|106,460,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name="NOAA-how-big"&gt;{{Harvnb|NOAA: How big is the Atlantic Ocean?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic Ocean - Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Atlantic-Ocean |title=Atlantic Ocean |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=December 20, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215072935/https://www.britannica.com/place/Atlantic-Ocean |archivedate=15 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers approximately 20 percent of the [[Earth's surface]] and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the "[[Old World]]" from the "[[New World]]".

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]]). The [[Equatorial Counter Current]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and the '''South Atlantic Ocean''' at about [[8th parallel north|8°N]].&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy Hydrographic Office]].&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:1710 De La Feuille Map of Africa - Geographicus - Africa-lafeuille-1710.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Aethiopian Ocean]] in a 1710 French map of Africa]]
The oldest known mentions of an "Atlantic" sea come from [[Stesichorus]] around mid-sixth century BC (Sch. A. R. 1. 211):&lt;ref name="MangasPlácido1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mangas|first1=Julio|last2=Plácido|first2=Domingo|last3=Elícegui|first3=Elvira Gangutia|first4=Helena|last4=Rodríguez Somolinos|title=La Península Ibérica en los autores griegos: de Homero a Platón - SLG / (Sch. A. R. 1. 211)|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pZBSML97Ya0C|page=283}}|year=1998|publisher=Editorial Complutense|pages=283–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Atlantikoi pelágei'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντικῷ πελάγει; English: 'the Atlantic sea'; etym. 'Sea of [[Atlantis]]') and in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: 'Sea of Atlantis' or 'the Atlantis sea'&lt;ref&gt;[http://dge.cchs.csic.es/xdge/Ἀτλαντίς 1 Ἀ. θάλασσα "la mar Atlántida" (the Atlantis sea)..., DGE Dictionary, CSIC, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101191304/http://dge.cchs.csic.es/xdge/%E1%BC%88%CF%84%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%AF%CF%82 |date=1 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) where the name refers to "the sea beyond the [[pillars of Heracles]]" which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hdt. 1.202.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, on one hand, the name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] in [[Greek mythology]], who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in Medieval maps and also lent his name to modern [[Atlas (geography)|atlases]].&lt;ref name="Oxford-Dict"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oxford Dictionaries|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, to early [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sailors and in Ancient Greek mythological literature such as the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', this all-encompassing ocean was instead known as [[Oceanus]], the gigantic river that encircled the world; in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the Greeks: the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janni|2015|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the term "Atlantic" originally referred specifically to the [[Atlas Mountains]] in Morocco and the sea off the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the North African coast.&lt;ref name="Oxford-Dict" /&gt; The Greek word ''thalassa'' has been reused by scientists for the huge [[Panthalassa]] ocean that surrounded the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] hundreds of millions of years ago.

The term "'''[[Aethiopian Ocean]]'''", derived from [[Aethiopia|Ancient Ethiopia]], was applied to the Southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name="AmCyclo-1873"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ripley|Anderson Dana|1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the [[Age of Discovery]], the Atlantic was also known to English cartographers as the '''Great Western Ocean'''.&lt;ref name=Steele1986&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Ian Kenneth|title=The English Atlantic, 1675-1740: An Exploration of Communication and Community|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195039689|page=14|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=N2fmCwAAQBAJ|page=14}}|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent and data==
{{For|complete lists of marginal seas and borders of the Atlantic|List of seas#Atlantic Ocean|Borders of the oceans#Atlantic Ocean}}
{{For|the extent of the Southern Ocean|Southern Ocean#Definitions and use}}
[[File:Atlantic Ocean - en.png|thumb|Extent of the Atlantic Ocean according to the 2002 IHO definition, excluding [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] regions]]
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953,&lt;ref name="IHO-1953"&gt;{{Harvnb|IHO|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities, institutions, and countries, see for example the [[CIA World Factbook]]. Correspondingly, the extent and number of oceans and seas varies.

The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are Europe: the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–one of its [[marginal sea]]s–and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]], both of which also touch upon Asia) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. In the 1953 definition it extends south to Antarctica, while in later maps it is bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name="IHO-1953" /&gt;

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs and seas. These include the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], part of the [[Drake Passage]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]], almost all of the [[Scotia Sea]], and other tributary water bodies.&lt;ref name="CIA-World"&gt;{{Harvnb|CIA World Factbook: Atlantic Ocean}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Including these marginal seas the coast line of the Atlantic measures {{Convert|111866|km|abbr=on}} compared to {{Convert|135663|km|abbr=on}} for the Pacific.&lt;ref name="CIA-World" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|CIA World Factbook: Pacific Ocean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers an area of {{Convert|106460000|km2|abbr=on}} or 23.5% of the global ocean and has a volume of {{Convert|310410900|km3|abbr=on}} or 23.3% of the total volume of the earth's oceans. Excluding its marginal seas, the Atlantic covers {{Convert|81760000|km2|abbr=on}} and has a volume of {{Convert|305811900|km3|abbr=on}}. The North Atlantic covers {{Convert|41490000|km2|abbr=on}} (11.5%) and the South Atlantic {{Convert|40270000|km2|abbr=on}} (11.1%).&lt;ref name="ETOPO1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eakins|Sharman|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average depth is {{Convert|3646|m|abbr=on}} and the maximum depth, the [[Milwaukee Deep]] in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]], is {{Convert|8486|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ETOPO1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|USGS: Mapping Puerto Rico Trench}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bathymetry==
[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|[[False color]] map of ocean depth in the Atlantic basin]]
The [[bathymetry]] of the Atlantic is dominated by a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR). It runs from 87°N or {{Convert|300|km|abbr=on}} south of the [[North Pole]] to the subantarctic [[Bouvet Island]] at [[42nd parallel south|42°S]].&lt;ref name="WHC-MAR"&gt;{{Harvnb|World Heritage Centre: Mid-Atlantic Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic Ridge===
{{Main|Mid-Atlantic Ridge}}
The MAR divides the Atlantic longitudinally into two halves, in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary, transverse ridges.  The MAR reaches above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} along most of its length, but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places: the [[Romanche Trench]] near the Equator and the [[Gibbs Fracture Zone]] at [[53rd parallel north|53°N]]. The MAR is a barrier for bottom water, but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other.&lt;ref name="LevGood-2003"&gt;{{Harvnb|Levin|Gooday|2003|loc=Seafloor topography and physiography, pp. 113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAR rises {{Convert|2|-|3|km|abbr=on}} above the surrounding ocean floor and its [[rift valley]] is the [[divergent boundary]] between the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] plates in the North Atlantic and the [[South American Plate|South American]] and [[African Plate|African]] plates in the South Atlantic. The MAR produces [[Basaltic lava|basaltic volcanoes]] in [[Eyjafjallajökull]], Iceland, and [[pillow lava]] on the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|The Geological Society: Mid-Atlantic Ridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|fathom ft|abbr=on|lk=out}} in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kenneth J.

The MAR is intersected by two perpendicular ridges: the [[Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault]], the boundary between the [[Nubian Plate|Nubian]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian plates]], intersects the MAR at the [[Azores Triple Junction]], on either side of the Azores microplate, near the [[40th parallel north|40°N]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeMets|Gordon|Argus|2010|loc=The Azores microplate, pp. 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much vaguer, nameless boundary, between the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[South American Plate|South American]] plates, intersects the MAR near or just north of the [[Fifteen-Twenty Fracture Zone]], approximately at [[16th parallel north|16°N]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|DeMets|Gordon|Argus|2010|loc=Boundary between the North and South America plates, pp. 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, the [[Challenger expedition]] discovered parts of what is now known as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, or:
{{Quote|text=An elevated ridge rising to an average height of about {{convert|1900|fathom|m ft|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} below the surface traverses the basins of the North and South Atlantic in a meridianal direction from Cape Farewell, probably its far south at least as Gough Island, following roughly the outlines of the coasts of the Old and the New Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomson|1877|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  The remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the [[German Meteor expedition]] using echo-sounding equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NOAA: Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exploration of the MAR in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of [[seafloor spreading]] and [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name="WHC-MAR" /&gt;

Most of the MAR runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands. While nine of these have collectively been nominated a [[World Heritage Site]] for their geological value, four of them are considered of "Outstanding Universal Value" based on their cultural and natural criteria: [[Þingvellir National Park|Þingvellir]], Iceland; [[Landscape of the Pico Island Vineyard Culture]], Portugal; [[Gough and Inaccessible Islands]], United Kingdom; and Brazilian Atlantic Islands: [[Fernando de Noronha]] and [[Atol das Rocas]] Reserves, Brazil.&lt;ref name="WHC-MAR" /&gt;

===Ocean floor===
{{For|a list of fracture zones in the Atlantic|List of fracture zones#Atlantic Ocean}}
Continental shelves in the Atlantic are wide off Newfoundland, southern-most South America, and north-eastern Europe.
In the western Atlantic [[carbonate platform]]s dominate large areas, for example the [[Blake Plateau]] and [[Bermuda Rise]].
The Atlantic is surrounded by [[passive margin]]s except at a few locations where [[active margin]]s form deep [[oceanic trench|trenches]]: the [[Puerto Rico Trench]] ({{Convert|8414|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} maximum depth) in the western Pacific and [[South Sandwich Trench]] ({{Convert|8264|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in the South Atlantic.  There are numerous submarine canyons off north-eastern North America, western Europe, and north-western Africa. Some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep-sea channels.&lt;ref name="LevGood-2003" /&gt;

In 1922 a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred. The USS Stewart used a Navy Sonic Depth Finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the Atlantic. This involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straight forward with pulses being sent from the vessel, which bounce off the ocean floor, then return to the vessel.&lt;ref name="the Atlantic"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hamilton-Paterson |first=James | author-link = James Hamilton-Paterson |date=1992 |title=The Great Deep}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

The mean depth between [[60th parallel north|60°N]] and [[60th parallel south|60°S]] is {{Convert|3730|m|abbr=on}}, or close to the average for the global ocean, with a modal depth between {{Convert|4000|and|5000|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="LevGood-2003" /&gt;

In the South Atlantic the [[Walvis Ridge]] and [[Rio Grande Rise]] form barriers to ocean currents.
The [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of Canada.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|-2|C|F}} to over {{convert|30|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by {{convert|7|–|8|C-change}}.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above [[40th parallel north|40° North]] some east-west oscillation, known as the [[North Atlantic oscillation]], occurs.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

===Salinity===
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about [[25th parallel north|25° north]] and [[25th parallel south|south]], in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.&lt;ref name="USN-2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|U.S. Navy|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high surface salinity in the Atlantic, on which the Atlantic [[thermohaline circulation]] is dependent, is maintained by two processes: the [[Agulhas Current#Agulhas leakage and rings|Agulhas Leakage/Rings]], which brings salty Indian Ocean waters into the South Atlantic, and the "Atmospheric Bridge", which evaporates subtropical Atlantic waters and exports it to the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marsh|Hazeleger|Yool|Rohling|2007|loc=Introduction, p. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major, upper [[water mass]]es with distinct temperature and salinity. The Atlantic Subarctic Upper Water in the northern-most North Atlantic is the source for Subarctic Intermediate Water and North Atlantic Intermediate Water. North Atlantic Central Water can be divided into the Eastern and Western North Atlantic central Water since the western part is strongly affected by the Gulf Stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water. The eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to Mediterranean Water. North Atlantic Central Water flows into South Atlantic Central Water at [[15th parallel north|15°N]].&lt;ref name="Emery-Atlantic"&gt;{{Harvnb|Emery|Meincke|1986|loc=Atlantic Ocean, pp. 384–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five intermediate waters: four low-salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high-salinity formed through evaporation. Arctic Intermediate Water, flows from north to become the source for North Atlantic Deep Water south of the Greenland-Scotland sill. These two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins. The wide range of salinities in the North Atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources: Labrador Sea, Norwegian-Greenland Sea, Mediterranean, and South Atlantic Intermediate Water.&lt;ref name="Emery-Atlantic" /&gt;

The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW) is a complex of four water masses, two that form by deep convection in the open ocean&amp;nbsp;— Classical and Upper Labrador Sea Water&amp;nbsp;— and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland sill&amp;nbsp;— Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water. Along its path across Earth the composition of the NADW is affected by other water masses, especially [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] and Mediterranean Overflow Water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smethie|Fine|Putzka|Jones|2000|loc=Formation of NADW, pp. 14299–14300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NADW is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern North Atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in Europe. Changes in the formation of NADW have been linked to global climate changes in the past. Since man-made substances were introduced into the environment, the path of the NADW can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from [[nuclear weapon test]]s in the 1960s and [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smethie|Fine|Putzka|Jones|2000|loc=Introduction, p. 14297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gyres===
[[File:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|Map of the five major ocean [[Ocean gyre|gyres]]|alt=Map showing 5 circles. The first is between western Australia and eastern Africa. The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
The clockwise warm-water [[North Atlantic Gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and the counter-clockwise warm-water [[South Atlantic Gyre]] appears in the southern Atlantic.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

In the North Atlantic, surface circulation is dominated by three inter-connected currents: the [[Gulf Stream]] which flows north-east from the North American coast at [[Cape Hatteras]]; the [[North Atlantic Current]], a branch of the Gulf Stream which flows northward from the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]]; and the [[Subpolar Front]], an extension of the North Atlantic Current, a wide, vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre.  This system of currents transport warm water into the North Atlantic, without which temperatures in the North Atlantic and Europe would plunge dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marchal|Waelbroeck|Colin de Verdière|2016|loc=Introduction, pp. 1545–1547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:North Atlantic Circulation.gif|thumb|In the subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic warm subtropical waters are transformed into colder subpolar and polar waters.  In the Labrador Sea this water flows back to the subtropical gyre.]]
North of the North Atlantic Gyre, the cyclonic [[North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre]] plays a key role in climate variability.  It is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography, rather than being steered by wind, both in the deep ocean and at sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tréguier|Theetten|Chassignet|Penduff|2005|loc=Introduction, p. 757}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global [[thermohaline circulation]].  Its eastern portion includes [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddying]] branches of the [[North Atlantic Current]] which transport warm, saline waters from the subtropics to the north-eastern Atlantic.  There this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of Greenland where they form an intense (40–50&amp;nbsp;[[Sverdrup|Sv]]) current which flows around the continental margins of the [[Labrador Sea]].  A third of this water become parts of the deep portion of the [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] (NADW).  The NADW, in its turn, feed the [[meridional overturning circulation]] (MOC), the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change.  Large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade-century scale, associated with the [[North Atlantic oscillation]], are especially pronounced in [[Labrador Sea Water]], the upper layers of the MOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Böning|Scheinert|Dengg|Biastoch|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 1; Fig. 2, p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Atlantic is dominated by the anti-cyclonic southern subtropical gyre.  The [[South Atlantic Central Water]] originates in this gyre, while [[Antarctic Intermediate Water]] originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region, near the [[Drake Passage]] and Falkland Islands.  Both these currents receive some contribution from the Indian Ocean.  On the African east coast the small cyclonic [[Angola Gyre]] lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stramma|England|1999|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind-induced [[Ekman layer]].  The residence time of the gyre is 4.4–8.5&amp;nbsp;years. [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] flows southerward below the [[thermocline]] of the subtropical gyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gordon|Bosley|1991|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sargasso Sea===
{{Main|Sargasso Sea}}
[[File:Sargasso.png|thumb|Approximate extent of the Sargasso Sea]]
The Sargasso Sea in the western North Atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of ''[[Sargassum]]'' (''S. fluitans'' and ''natans'') float, an area {{Convert|4000|km|abbr=on}} wide and encircled by the [[Gulf Stream]], [[North Atlantic Drift]], and [[North Equatorial Current]].  This population of seaweed probably originated from Tertiary ancestors on the European shores of the former [[Tethys Ocean]] and has, if so, maintained itself by [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetative growth]], floating in the ocean for millions of years.&lt;ref name="Lün-p223"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lüning|1990|pp=223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HanaOZ.jpg|thumb|left|Sargassum fish (''Histrio histrio'')]]
Other species endemic to the Sargasso Sea include the [[sargassum fish]], a predator with algae-like appendages who hovers motionless among the ''Sargassum''.  Fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former Tethys Ocean, in what is now the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region, that were similar to the Sargasso Sea.  It is possible that the population in the Sargasso Sea migrated to the Atlantic as the Tethys closed at the end of the Miocene around 17&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="Lün-p223" /&gt;
The origin of the Sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries.  The fossils found in the Carpathians in the mid-20th century, often called the "quasi-Sargasso assemblage", finally showed that this assemblage originated in the [[Carpathian Basin]] from where it migrated over [[Sicily]] to the Central Atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the Sargasso Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerzmańska|Kotlarczyk|1976|loc=Abstract; Biogeographic Significance of the "Quasi-Sargasso" Assemblage, pp. 303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the spawning ground for European eels [[Eel life history#Search for the spawning grounds|remained unknown for decades]].  In the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern Sargasso Sea is the spawning ground for both the [[European eel|European]] and [[American eel]] and that the former migrate more than {{Convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} and the latter {{Convert|2000|km|abbr=on}}.  Ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream transport eel larvae from the Sargasso Sea to foraging areas in North America, Europe, and Northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Als|Hansen|Maes|Castonguay|2011|p=1334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use [[Earth's magnetic field]] to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Do Baby Eels Use Magnetic Maps to Hitch a Ride on the Gulf Stream? |publisher=Scientific American |date=17 April 2017 |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-baby-eels-use-magnetic-maps-to-hitch-a-ride-on-the-gulf-stream/?WT.mc_id=SA_EVO_20170417 |access-date=18 April 2017 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419192009/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-baby-eels-use-magnetic-maps-to-hitch-a-ride-on-the-gulf-stream/?WT.mc_id=SA_EVO_20170417 |archivedate=19 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}

==Climate==
[[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|Waves in the [[trade winds]] in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] is thought to have at least some influence on climate. For example, the Gulf Stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern North America, keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas. The Gulf Stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the Florida Peninsula. In the higher latitudes, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the atmosphere over the oceans, keeping the British Isles and north-western Europe mild and cloudy, and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast.  In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

===Natural hazards===
[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common from early February to the end of July across the shipping lanes near the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]. The ice season is longer in the polar regions, but there is little shipping in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=IIPHome International Ice Patrol]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricanes]] are hazard in the western parts of the North Atlantic during the summer and autumn. Due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], they are practically unknown in the South Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The break-up of Pangaea began in the Central Atlantic, between North America and Northwest Africa, where rift basins opened during the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic.  This period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the Atlas Mountains.  The exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=Central Atlantic, pp. 218, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the Atlantic Ocean coincided with the initial break-up of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], both of which were initiated by the eruption of the [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province]] (CAMP), one of the most extensive and voluminous [[large igneous province]]s in Earth's history associated with the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], one of Earth's major [[extinction event]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackburn|Olsen|Bowring|McLean|2013|p=941}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Theoliitic [[Dike (geology)|dikes]], [[Aquatic sill|sills]], and lava flows from the CAMP eruption at 200&amp;nbsp;Ma have been found in West Africa, eastern North America, and northern South America.  The extent of the volcanism has been estimated to {{Convert|4.5e6|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{Convert|2.5e6|km2|abbr=on}} covered what is now northern and central Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marzoli|Renne|Piccirillo|Ernesto|1999|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the [[Central American Isthmus]] closed the [[Central American Seaway]] at the end of the Pliocene 2.8&amp;nbsp;Ma ago. The formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land-living animals, known as the [[Great American Interchange]], but the closure of the seaway resulted in a "Great American Schism" as it affected ocean currents, salinity, and temperatures in both the Atlantic and Pacific.  Marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lessios|2008|loc=Abstract, Introduction, p. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geologically the Northern Atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins, Newfoundland and Iberia, and to the north by the Arctic [[Eurasian Basin]].  The opening of the Northern Atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor, the [[Iapetus Ocean]], and spread from the Central Atlantic in six stages: [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]–[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], [[Porcupine Bank|Porcupine]]–North America, Eurasia–Greenland, Eurasia–North America.  Active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the [[Iceland hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=Northern Atlantic, p. 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Gondwana (South America and Africa) broke up in the Early Cretaceous to form the South Atlantic.

Geologically the South Atlantic can be divided into four segments: Equatorial segment, from 10°N to the Romanche Fracture Zone (RFZ);; Central segment, from RFZ to Florianopolis Fracture Zone (FFZ, north of Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise); Southern segment, from FFZ to the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (AFFZ); and Falkland segment, south of AFFZ.&lt;ref name="Torsvik2009-p1316"&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Rousse|Labails|Smethurst|2009|loc=General setting and magmatism, pp. 1316–1318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern segment the Early Cretaceous (133–130&amp;nbsp;Ma) intensive [[magmatism]] of the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps|Paraná–Etendeka Large Igneous Province]] produced by the [[Tristan hotspot]] resulted in an estimated volume of {{Convert|1.5e6|to|2.0e6|km3|abbr=on}}. It covered an area of {{Convert|1.2e6|to|1.6e6|km2|abbr=on}} in Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay and {{Convert|0.8e5|km2|abbr=on}} in Africa. [[Dyke swarm]]s in Brazil, Angola, eastern Paraguay, and Namibia, however, suggest the LIP originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas.  Associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the Falkland Islands and South Africa.  Traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 147–49&amp;nbsp;Ma with two peaks between 143–121&amp;nbsp;Ma and 90–60&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref name="Torsvik2009-p1316" /&gt;

In the Falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the Patagonia and Colorado sub-plates between the Early Jurassic (190&amp;nbsp;Ma) and the Early Cretaceous (126.7&amp;nbsp;Ma).  Around 150&amp;nbsp;Ma sea-floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment.  No later than 130&amp;nbsp;Ma rifting had reached the Walvis Ridge–Rio Grande Rise.&lt;ref name="Seton-2012-p217" /&gt;

In the central segment rifting started to break Africa in two by opening the [[Benue Trough]] around 118&amp;nbsp;Ma.  Rifting in the central segment, however, coincided with the [[Geomagnetic reversal#Superchrons|Cretaceous Normal Superchron]] (also known as the Cretaceous quiet period), a 40&amp;nbsp;Ma period without magnetic reversals, which makes it difficult to date sea-floor spreading in this segment.&lt;ref name="Seton-2012-p217" /&gt;

The equatorial segment is the last phase of the break-up, but, because it is located on the Equator, magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating.  Various estimates date the propagation of sea-floor spreading in this segment to the period 120–96&amp;nbsp;Ma.  This final stage, nevertheless, coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in Africa.&lt;ref name="Seton-2012-p217" /&gt;

About 50&amp;nbsp;Ma the opening of the [[Drake Passage]] resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the South American and Antarctic plates.  First small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the Middle Eocene.  34–30&amp;nbsp;Ma a deeper seaway developed, followed by an [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event|Eocene–Oligocene climatic deterioration]] and the growth of the [[Antarctic ice sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Livermore|Nankivell|Eagles|Morris|2005|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Closure of the Atlantic===
{{See also|Pangaea Ultima}}
An embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of Gibraltar.  The [[Gibraltar Arc]] in the western Mediterranean is migrating westward into the Central Atlantic where it joins the converging African and Eurasian plates.  Together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern Atlantic Basin.  Meanwhile, the [[Scotia Arc]] and [[Caribbean Plate]] in the western Atlantic Basin are eastward-propagating subduction systems that might, together with the Gibraltar system, represent the beginning of the closure of the Atlantic Ocean and the final stage of the Atlantic [[Wilson cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Duarte|Rosas|Terrinha|Schellart|2013|loc=Abstract; Conclusions, p. 842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main category|History of the Atlantic Ocean}}

===Human origin===
[[Human evolution|Humans evolved]] in Africa; first by diverging from other apes around 7&amp;nbsp;Ma; then developing stone tools around 2.6&amp;nbsp;Ma; to finally evolve as [[Anatomically modern human|modern humans]] around 100&amp;nbsp;kya.  The earliest evidences for the complex behavior associated with this [[behavioral modernity]] has been found in the Greater [[Cape Floristic Region]] (GCFR) along the coast of South Africa.  During the latest glacial stages the now-submerged plains of the [[Agulhas Bank]] were exposed above sea level, extending the South African coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers.  A small population of modern humans&amp;nbsp;— probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals&amp;nbsp;— survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these Palaeo-Agulhas plains.  The GCFR is delimited to the north by the [[Cape Fold Belt]] and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex Stone Age technologies emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marean|Cawthra|Cowling|Esler|2014|loc=pp. 164–166, fig. 8.2, p. 166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human history thus begins on the coasts of South Africa where the Atlantic [[Benguela Current|Benguela Upwelling]] and Indian Ocean [[Agulhas Current]] meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish, fur seal, fish and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marean|2011|loc=Environmental Context on the South Coast, pp. 423–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Coastal Oasis Model (COM) --&gt;
The African origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70,000 years-old engravings from [[Blombos Cave]], South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henshilwood|d'Errico|Yates|Jacobs|2002|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old World===
[[Mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) studies indicate that 80–60,000 years ago a major demographic expansion within Africa, derived from a single, small population, coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid [[Marine isotope stage|MIS]]&amp;nbsp;5–4 environmental changes.  This group of people not only expanded over the whole of Africa, but also started to disperse [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] into Asia, Europe, and Australasia around 65,000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mellars|2006|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) 20,000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the European North Atlantic coast and retreat to the Mediterranean.  Following rapid climate changes at the end of the LGM this region was repopulated by [[Magdalenian]] culture.  Other hunter-gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large-scale hazards such as the [[Laacher See]] volcanic eruption, the inundation of [[Doggerland]] (now the [[North Sea]]), and the formation of the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riede|2014|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The European coasts of the North Atlantic were permanently populated about 9–8.5 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bjerck|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.  50&amp;nbsp;ka-old, deeply stratified [[shell midden]]s found in [[Ysterfontein]] on the western coast of South Africa are associated with the Middle Stone Age (MSA).  The MSA population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations.  While their middens resemble 12–11&amp;nbsp;ka-old Late Stone Age (LSA) middens found on every inhabited continent, the 50–45&amp;nbsp;ka-old [[Enkapune Ya Muto]] in Kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Avery|Halkett|Orton|Steele|2008|loc=Introduction, p. 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meilgaard-boplads.jpg|thumb|Excavation of the [[Ertebølle culture|Ertebølle]] middens in 1880]]
The same development can be seen in Europe.  In [[La Riera Cave]] (23–13&amp;nbsp;ka) in Asturias, Spain, only some 26,600 molluscs were deposited over 10&amp;nbsp;ka.  In contrast, 8–7&amp;nbsp;ka-old shell middens in Portugal, Denmark, and Brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts.  The [[Ertebølle culture|Ertebølle]] middens in Denmark, for example, accumulated {{Convert|2000|m3|abbr=on}} of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years.  This intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies&amp;nbsp;— such as boats, harpoons, and fish-hooks&amp;nbsp;— because many caves found in the Mediterranean and on the European Atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower.  The earliest exploitation, however, took place on the now submerged shelves, and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves.  The reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|Flemming|2008|loc=The Long-Term History of Marine Resources, pp. 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World===
During the LGM the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] covered most of northern North America while [[Beringia]] connected Siberia to Alaska.  In 1973 late American geoscientist [[Paul S. Martin]] proposed a "blitzkrieg" colonization of the Americas by which [[Clovis culture|Clovis hunters]] migrated into North America around 13,000 years ago in a single wave through an ice-free corridor in the ice sheet and "spread southward explosively, briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1973|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others later proposed a "three-wave" migration over the [[Bering Land Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Greenberg|Turner|Zegura|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These hypotheses remained the long-held view regarding the [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|settlement of the Americas]], a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries: the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas have been found in South America; sites in north-east Siberia report virtually no human presence there during the LGM; and most Clovis artefacts have been found in eastern North America along the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Rourke|Raff|2010|loc=Introduction, p. 202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, colonisation models based on mtDNA, [[yDNA]], and [[atDNA]] data respectively support neither the "blitzkrieg" nor the "three-wave" hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results.  Contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will, eventually, confirm each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Rourke|Raff|2010|loc=Conclusions and Outlook, p. 206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A proposed route across the Pacific to South America could explain early South American finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path, through the Canadian Arctic and down the North American Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Rourke|Raff|2010|loc=Beringian Scenarios, pp. 205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early settlements across the Atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories, ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed, including the [[Solutrean hypothesis]] and some of the [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories]].

[[File:Norse-world.png|thumb|Based on the medieval ''[[Sagas of Icelanders|Íslendingasögur]]'' sagas, including the ''[[Greenland saga|Grœnlendinga saga]]'', this interpretative map of the "Norse World" shows that Norse knowledge of the Americas and the Atlantic remained limited.]]
The [[Norse colonization of North America|Norse settlement]] of the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]] began during the 9th and 10th centuries. A settlement on [[Greenland]] was established before 1000&amp;nbsp;CE, but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early [[Little Ice Age]].  This setback was caused by a range of factors: an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation, while conflicts with the local [[Inuit]] resulted in the failure to adapt their Arctic technologies; a colder climate resulted in starvation; and the colony got economically marginalized as the [[Great Plague]] and [[Barbary pirates]] harvested its victims on Iceland in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dugmore|Keller|McGovern|2007|loc=Introduction, pp. 12–13; The Norse in The North Atlantic, pp. 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Iceland was initially settled 865–930&amp;nbsp;CE following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around {{Convert|2|C}} which made farming favorable at high latitudes.  This did not last, however, and temperatures quickly dropped; at 1080&amp;nbsp;CE summer temperatures had reached a maximum of {{Convert|5|C}}.  The ''[[Landnámabók]]'' (''Book of Settlement'') records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement&amp;nbsp;— "men ate foxes and ravens" and "the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs"&amp;nbsp;— and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for short-season crops such as barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|Dietrich|Holmden|Andrews|2010|pp=5308–5309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic World===
{{Main|Atlantic world|Atlantic history}}
[[File:Philip II's realms in 1598.png|thumb|left|A century after Columbus' first voyage, large parts of the New World had been included into the [[Spanish Empire]].]]
[[Christopher Columbus]] [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovered the Americas]] in 1492 under Spanish flag.&lt;ref name="Chamb-184"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambliss|1989|loc=Piracy, pp. 184–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six years later [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India under Portuguese flag, by navigating south around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], thus proving that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are connected. In 1500, in his voyage to India following Vasco da Gama, [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]] reached Brazil, taken by the currents of the [[South Atlantic Gyre]].&lt;!-- unref --&gt;  Following these explorations, Spain and Portugal quickly [[Colonization of the Americas|conquered and colonized]] large territories in the New World and forced the Amerindian population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found.  Spain and Portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other European nations out, but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of Spanish-Portuguese wars.  A peace treaty mediated by the Pope divided the conquered territories into Spanish and Portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away.  England, France, and the Dutch Republic enviously watched the Spanish and Portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with [[Piracy in the Atlantic World|pirates]] such as [[Henry Mainwaring]] and [[Alexandre Exquemelin]].  They could explore the convoys leaving the Americas because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable.&lt;ref name="Chamb-184" /&gt;

[[File:Atlantic slavetrade estimates.png|thumb|Embarked and disembarked slaves in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] 1525–1863 (first and last slave voyages)]]
In the colonies of the Americas, depredation, disease, and slavery quickly reduced the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population of the Americas]] to the extent that the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had to be introduced to replace them&amp;nbsp;— a trade that became norm and an integral part of the colonization.  Between the 15th century and 1888, when [[Slavery in Brazil|Brazil]] became the last part of the Americas to end slave trade, an estimated ten million Africans were exported as slaves, most of them destined for agricultural labour.  The slave trade was officially abolished in the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British Empire]] and the [[Slavery in the United States|United States]] in 1808, and slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire in 1838 and in the United States in 1865 after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lovejoy|1982|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bravo|2007|loc=The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, pp. 213–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Columbus to the [[Industrial Revolution]] Trans-Atlantic trade, including colonialism and slavery, became crucial for Western Europe.  For European countries with a direct access to the Atlantic (including Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) 1500–1800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in Eastern Europe and Asia.  Colonialism evolved as part of the Trans-Atlantic trade, but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs.  Growth was more rapid in non-absolutist countries, such as Britain and the Netherlands, and more limited in [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist monarchies]], such as Portugal, Spain, and France, where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies.&lt;ref name="Acem-p546"&gt;{{Harvnb|Acemoglu|Johnson|Robinson|2005|loc=Abstract; pp. 546–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trans-Atlantic trade also resulted in an increasing urbanization: in European countries facing the Atlantic urbanization grew from 8% in 1300, 10.1% in 1500, to 24.5% in 1850; in other European countries from 10% in 1300, 11.4% in 1500, to 17% in 1850.  Likewise, GDP doubled in Atlantic countries but rose by only 30% in the rest of Europe.  By end of the 17th century the volume of the Trans-Atlantic trade had surpassed that of the Mediterranean trade.&lt;ref name="Acem-p546" /&gt;

==Economy==
&lt;!-- [[File:Transatlantic Free Trade Area.svg|thumb|Intended to unite the so-called Western World, the proposed [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]], and its possible future expansion, highlights the global importance of trade across the North Atlantic to the exclusion of the continents bordering the South Atlantic.]] --&gt;
The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

The Atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields, fish, [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kubesh |first1=K. |last2=McNeil |first2=N. |last3=Bellotto |first3=K. |title=Ocean Habitats |year=2008 |publisher=In the Hands of a Child |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hMywzK7xuKYC|page=11}} |access-date=5 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221191501/https://books.google.com/books?id=hMywzK7xuKYC&amp;pg=PA11 |archivedate=21 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor, however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through. Currently, there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/gold.html |title=Is there gold in the ocean? |last=Administration |first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric |website=oceanservice.noaa.gov |language=EN-US |access-date=2016-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331103450/http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/gold.html |archivedate=31 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;

===Fisheries===
The [[Continental shelf|shelves]] of the Atlantic hosts one of the world's richest [[Wild fisheries|fishing resources]].  The most productive areas include the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], the [[Scotian Shelf]], [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Bay of Fundy]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks.&lt;ref name="USN-2001" /&gt;
Fisheries have, however, undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the Atlantic: fisheries in the Eastern Central and South-West Atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value, the rest of the Atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks. The third group, "continuously increasing trend since 1950", is only found in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39"&gt;{{Harvnb|FOA|2016|pp=39–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Northeast Atlantic bathymetry.png|thumb|Banks of the North-East Atlantic]]
In the North-East Atlantic total catches decreased between the mid-1970s and the 1990s and reached 8.7 million tons in 2013. [[Blue whiting]] reached a 2.4 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628,000 tons in 2013.  Recovery plans for cod, sole, and plaice have reduced mortality in these species. [[Arctic cod]] reached its lowest levels in the 1960s–1980s but is now recovered. [[Pollachius virens|Arctic saithe]] and [[haddock]] are considered fully fished; [[Sand eel]] is overfished as was [[capelin]] which has now recovered to fully fished.  Limited data makes the state of [[redfish]]es and deep-water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing.  Stocks of [[northern shrimp]] and [[Norwegian lobster]] are in good condition.  In the North-East Atlantic 21% of stocks are considered overfished.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;

[[File:StLawrence Gulf bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Banks of the North-West Atlantic]]
In the North-West Atlantic landings have decreased from 4.2 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.9 million tons in 2013.  During the 21st century some species have shown weak signs of recovery, including [[Greenland halibut]], [[yellowtail flounder]], [[Atlantic halibut]], [[haddock]], [[spiny dogfish]], while other stocks shown no such signs, including cod, [[Witch (righteye flounder)|witch flounder]], and redfish.  Stocks of invertebrates, in contrast, remain at record levels of abundance.  31% of stocks are overfished in the North-west Atlantic.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;
[[File:Time series for collapse of Atlantic northwest cod.png|thumb|left|Capture of Atlantic north-west cod in million tons]]
In 1497 [[John Cabot]] became the first to explore mainland North America and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of [[Atlantic cod]] off Newfoundland.  Referred to as "Newfoundland Currency" this discovery yielded some 200&amp;nbsp;million tons of fish over five centuries.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit [[haddock]], [[mackerel]], and [[lobster]].  From the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of European and Asian distant-water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species.  It also expanded the exploited areas from near-shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep-water species such as [[Sebastes|redfish]], [[Greenland halibut]], witch flounder, and [[Grenadiers (fish)|grenadiers]]. [[Overfishing]] in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but, because this was occurring on [[international waters]], it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made.  In the early 1990s this finally resulted in the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery]].  The population of a number of deep-sea fishes also collapsed in the process, including [[American plaice]], redfish, and Greenland halibut, together with flounder and grenadier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|FAO|2011|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eastern Central Atlantic small [[pelagic fish]]es constitute about 50% of landings with sardine reaching 0.6–1.0 million tons per year.  Pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished, with sardines south of [[Cape Bojador]] the notable exception.  Almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels.  Total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s; reaching 3.9 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;

[[File:Bahamas.A2001138.1550.250m.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bahama Banks]]]]
In the Western Central Atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1.3 million tons in 2013.  The most important species in the area, [[Gulf menhaden]], reached a million tons in the mid-1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished. [[Round sardinella]] was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished. [[Grouper]]s and [[Lutjanidae|snappers]] are overfished and [[northern brown shrimp]] and [[Eastern oyster|American cupped oyster]] are considered fully fished approaching overfished.  44% of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;

[[File:Agulhas Bank NOAA ETOPO1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Agulhas Bank]]]]
In the South-East Atlantic catches have decreased from 3.3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1.3 million tons in 2013. [[Horse mackerel]] and [[hake]] are the most important species, together representing almost half of the landings.  Off South Africa and Namibia [[Merluccius paradoxus|deep-water hake]] and [[Merluccius capensis|shallow-water Cape hake]] have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of [[Southern African pilchard]] and [[Southern African anchovy|anchovy]] have improved to fully fished in 2013.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;

In the South-West Atlantic a peak was reached in the mid-1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1.7 and 2.6 million tons.  The most important species, the [[Illex argentinus|Argentine shortfin squid]], which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to overfished.  Another important species was the [[Brazilian sardinella]], with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished.  Half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels: [[Whitehead’s round herring]] has not yet reached fully fished but [[Cunene horse mackerel]] is overfished.  The sea snail [[Haliotis midae|perlemoen abalone]] is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished.&lt;ref name="NOA-2016-p39" /&gt;

North Atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature (SST) at tropical latitudes, changes that can be attributed to either the natural [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]] (AMO) or to [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mann|Emanuel|2006|pp=233–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2005 report indicated that the Atlantic [[meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC) slowed down by 30% between 1957 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryden|Longworth|Cunningham|2005|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the AMO were responsible for SST variability, the AMOC would have increased in strength, which is apparently not the case.  Furthermore, it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;  Therefore, these changes in SST must be caused by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Webster|Holland|Curry|Chang|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ocean [[mixed layer]] plays an important role heat storage over seasonal and decadal time-scales, whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and has a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer.  This heat uptake provides a time-lag for climate change but it also results in a thermal expansion of the oceans which contribute to sea-level rise.  21st century global warming will probably result in an [[equilibrium level|equilibrium sea-level]] rise five times greater than today, whilst melting of glaciers, including that of the Greenland ice-sheet, expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century, will probably result in a sea-level rise of 3–6&amp;nbsp;m over a millennium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bigg|Jickells|Liss|Osborn|2003|loc=Sea-level change, pp. 1128–1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

[[Marine pollution]] is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian A. Gerlach "Marine Pollution", Springer, Berlin (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[Oceanic gyres|gyres]] and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.

'''Baltistan''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|بلتستان}}}}, {{lang-bft|སྦལ་ཏི་སྟཱན|script=Tibt}} also known as '''Baltiyul''' or '''Little Tibet''' ({{lang-bft|སྦལ་ཏི་ཡུལ་།|script=Tibt}}), is a mountainous region on the border of Pakistan Controlled Kashmir and Indian Controlled Kashmir in the [[Karakoram]] mountains just south of [[K2]] (the world's second-highest mountain). Baltistan borders [[Gilgit]] to the west, [[Xinjiang]] ([[China]]) in the north, [[Ladakh]] on the southeast and the [[Kashmir Valley]] on the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victoria |last=Schofield |authorlink=Victoria Schofield |title=Kashmir in Conflict |publisher=I.

Prior to 1947, Baltistan was part of the princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], having been conquered by Raja [[Gulab Singh]]'s armies in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Proceedings - Punjab History Conference|date=1968|publisher=Punjabi University|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baltistan and Ladakh were administered jointly under one ''wazarat'' (district) of the state.

A small portion of Baltistan, including the village of [[Turtuk]] in the [[Nubra Valley]], was incorporated into Ladakh after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;Atul Aneja, [http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/2001/01/11/stories/0211000h.htm A 'battle' in the snowy heights], The Hindu, 11 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-22690692|title=In pictures: Life in Baltistan|work=bbc.com|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region is inhabited primarily by [[Balti people]] of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] descent. Millennia-old Tibetan culture, customs, norms, language and scripts still exist, although the vast majority of the population follows [[Islam]]. Baltistan is strategically significant to Pakistan and India; the [[Kargil War|Kargil]] and [[Siachen conflict|Siachen War]]s were fought there. The region is the setting for [[Greg Mortenson]]'s book, ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]''.

== Geography ==
[[File:SkarduFromFort1175.JPG|thumbnail|alt=Valley town seen from above|[[Skardu]], capital of Baltistan]]
The 1911 [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopaedia Britannica]] characterises Baltistan as the western extremity of [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  whose natural limits are the [[Indus river]] from its abrupt southward bend around the map point {{coord|35.86|N|74.72|E|name=Bend in the Indus course}} and the mountains to the north and west. These features separate a comparatively peaceful Tibetan population from the fiercer [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] tribes to the west. [[Muslim]] writers around the 16th century speak of Baltistan as the "Little Tibet", and of [[Ladakh]] as the "Great Tibet", emphasising their [[ethnological]] similarity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;
{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ladakh and Baltistan |volume=16 |pages=57–59 |ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ahmad Hassan Dani, Baltistan spreads upwards from the Indus river and is separated from Ladakh by the [[Siachen glacier]].{{sfn|Dani|1998|p=219}} It includes the Indus valley and the lower valley of the [[Shyok river]]{{coord|34.925|N|76.68|E|name=Shyok river|display=none}}.{{sfn|Pirumshoev|Dani|2003|p=243}}

Baltistan is a rocky mass of lofty mountains, the prevailing formation being [[gneiss]].  In the north is the [[Baltoro Glacier]]{{coord|35|44|11|N|76|22|51|E|name=Baltoro glacier|display=none}}, the largest out of the [[arctic]] regions, {{convert|35|mi|km}} long, contained between two ridges whose highest peaks to the south are {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} and to the north {{convert|28265|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The Indus river runs in a narrow [[Canyon|gorge]], widening after receiving the [[Shyok]] river at {{coord|35.23|N|75.92|E|name=Shyok joins Indus}}. It then forms a 20-mile crescent-shaped plain varying between 1 mile and 5 miles wide.{{sfn|Karim|2009|p=62}} The main inhabitable valleys of [[Kharmang]] [[Khaplu]], [[Skardu]] and [[Roundu]] are along the routes of these rivers.

== History ==
[[File:Balti king ahmed shah.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Drawing of a bearded man holding a rifle|Ahmed Shah, the last [[Maqpon dynasty|Maqpon]] king before the 1840 Dogra invasion]]
For centuries, Baltistan consisted of small, independent valley states connected by the blood relationships of its rulers (''[[raja]]s''), trade, common beliefs and cultural and linguistic bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Socio-Political Study of Gilgit Baltistan Province|url=http://www.bzu.edu.pk/PJSS/Vol30No12010/Final_PJSS-30-1-16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The states were subjugated by the [[Dogra]] rulers of [[Kashmir]] during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Gertel&gt;{{cite book|last=Gertel|first=Jörg|title=Economic Spaces of Pastoral Production and Commodity Systems|year=2011|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-1-4094-2531-1|pages=181|author2=Richard Le Heron}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 29 August 2009 the government of [[Pakistan]] announced the creation of Gilgit–Baltistan, a provincial autonomous region with [[Gilgit]] as its capital and [[Skardu]] its largest city.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Baltistan was known as Little Tibet, and the name was extended to include Ladakh.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Ladakh later became known as Great Tibet. Locally, Baltistan is known as ''Baltiyul'' and Ladakh and Baltistan are known as Maryul ("red country").&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf Hussain Abadi, ''A view on Baltistan''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Origin of Baltis and Baltistan}}Origins ===
{{quote|Tibetan [[Kham]]pa entered in [[Khaplu]] through [[Chorbat Valley]] and [[Dardic people|Dardic]] tribes came to Baltistan through [[Roundu Valley]] from [[Gilgit]] prior to civilization, and these groups eventually settled down, creating the Balti people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Mustansar Hussain |last=Tarar |authorlink=Mustansar Hussain Tarar |title=Nanga Parbat |year=1991 |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Old skardu.jpg|thumbnail|left|alt=Drawing of lakes surrounded by mountains|Skardu in 1800]]
Today, the people of [[Kharmang]] and [[Chorbat Valley|Western Khaplu]] have Tibetan features and those in Skardu, [[Shigar]] and the eastern villages of Khaplu are [[Dard people|Dards]].&lt;ref&gt;''Where Indus is Young''&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the Balti people were in the sphere of influence of [[Zhangzhung]]. Baltistan was controlled by the Tibetan king [[Songtsen Gampo]] during the seventh century AD. Culturally influenced by Tibet, the [[Bon]] and [[Animism|animist]] Baltis began to adopt [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Religious artifacts such as ''[[gompa]]s'' and ''[[stupa]]s'' were built, and [[lama]]s played an important role in Balti life.&lt;ref&gt;''Baltistan in History'' by Banat Gul Afridi 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tarekh e jammu, molvi hashmatullah&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hussainabadi, Muhammad Yousuf: ''Baltistan per Aik Nazar'' 1984&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th century, Muslim scholars from Kashmir crossed Baltistan’s mountainous terrain to spread Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baltistan - North Pakistan|url=http://www.marafiefoundation.org/Default.aspx?tabid=78|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615182719/http://www.marafiefoundation.org/Default.aspx?tabid=78|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-15}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kharmang]] came under the control of the [[Namgyal dynasty of Ladakh|Namgyal royal family]] and developed a close relationship with Ladakh when the ''raja'' of Ladakh, Jamyang Mangyal, attacked the principalities in Kargil. Mangyal annihilated the Skardu garrison at Kharbu and put to the sword a number of petty Muslim rulers in the principalities of Purik (Kargil). [[Ali Sher Khan Anchan]], ''raja'' of [[Khaplu]] and [[Shigar]], left with a strong army via [[Marol]]. Passing the Laddakhi army, he occupied [[Leh]] (the capital of Ladakh) and the ''raja'' of Ladakh was taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Hussainabadi, Muhammad Yousuf: ''Tareekh-e-Baltistan'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and Their Exodus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRFvWyqGNzEC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Ali+Sher+Khan+Anchan+ladakh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jftuUaSLKYnXrQeuo4DIBg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ali%20Sher%20Khan%20Anchan%20ladakh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The last colony: Muzaffarabad-Gilgit-Baltistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IngMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ali+Sher+Khan+Anchan+ladakh&amp;dq=Ali+Sher+Khan+Anchan+ladakh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jftuUaSLKYnXrQeuo4DIBg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valley from Khepchne to Kachura was flat and fertile, with abundant fruit trees; the sandy desert now extending from Sundus to [[Skardu Airport]] was a prosperous town. Skardu had hardly recovered from the shock of the death of Anchan when it was flooded. In 1845, the area was seized by the Dogras.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Manzoom (2004, June 12).

Baltistan is a rocky wilderness of around {{convert|27000|sqmi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOUT GILGIT-BALTISTAN|url=http://www.mashabrum.com/gilgit_baltistan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the largest cluster of mountains in the world and the biggest [[glacier]]s outside the polar regions. The [[Himalayas]] advance into this region from India, Tibet and Nepal, and north of them are the Karakoram range. Both ranges run northwest, separated by the [[Indus River]]. Along the Indus and its tributaries are many valleys. Glaciers include [[Baltoro Glacier]], [[Biafo Glacier]], [[Siachen Glacier]], [[Trango Glacier]] and [[Godwin-Austen Glacier]].

== Religion ==
Before the arrival of Islam, Tibetan Buddhism and Bön (to a lesser extent) were the main religions in Baltistan. Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the region during the seventh century. The region has a number of surviving [[Buddhist art|Buddhist]] archaeological sites. These include the [[Manthal Buddha Rock]], a [[rock relief]] of the Buddha at the edge of the village (near [[Skardu]]) and the [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]]. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.

Islam was brought to Baltistan by [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries during the 16th and 17th centuries, and most of the population converted to [[Noorbakshia Islam]]. The scholars were followers of the [[Kubrawiya]] Sufi order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYF|url=http://nyfpk.org/Islam%20in%20Baltistan.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Noorbakhshi Muslims live in Ghanche and Shigar districts, and 30 percent live in the Skardu district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sofia Imamia Noorbakhshia |url=http://noorbakhshia.com/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103616/http://www.noorbakhshia.com/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wild animals include [[ibex]], [[markhor]], [[musk deer]], [[snow leopard]]s, [[brown bear|brown]] and [[Asian black bear|black bears]], [[jackal]]s, [[fox]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and [[marmot]]s.

== Culture ==

=== Balti music and art ===
[[File:Balti children.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Three smiling young boys, with trees and a mountain in the background|Balti children from the [[Shigar Valley]]]]
According to Balti folklore, [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] princess Gul Khatoon (known in Baltistan as Mindoq Gialmo—Flower Queen) brought musicians and artisans with her into the region and they propagated Mughal music and art under her patronage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BALTI MUSIC AND ART|url=http://www.mybaltistan.com/History/History%20of%20Baltistan/English/6.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical instruments such as the ''[[Zurna|surnai]]'', ''karnai'', ''dhol'' and ''[[Fangxiang|chang]]'' were introduced into Baltistan.

==== Dance ====
Classical and other dances are classified as sword dances, ''broqchhos'' and [[Yakkha]] and ''[[ghazal]]'' dances.&lt;ref&gt;Hussainabadi, Muhammad Yousuf: ''Balti Zaban'' 1990&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chhogho Prasul'' commemorates a victory by the [[Maqpon dynasty|Maqpon ''rajas'']]. As a mark of respect, the musician who plays the drum (''dang'') plays for a long time. A Maqpon princess would occasionally dance to this tune. ''Gasho-Pa'', also known as ''Ghbus-La-Khorba'', is a sword dance associated with the Gasho Dynasty of Purik ([[Kargil]]). ''Sneopa'', the marriage-procession dance by ''pachones'' (twelve ''wazirs'' who accompany the bride), is performed at the marriage of a ''raja''.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Chaqchan mosque khaplu.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Chinese-style mosque with enclosed porch and speakers|Chaqchan Mosque in Khaplu]]
Balti architecture has Tibetan and Mughul&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Paul (1996) . A History of Western Himalayas . Penguin Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; influences, and its monastic architecture reflects the Buddhist imprint left on the region. Buddhist-style [[wall painting]]s can be seen in forts and Noorbakhshi ''[[khanqah]]s'', including [[Chaqchan Mosque]] in [[Khaplu]], [[Amburik Mosque]] in Shigar, Khanqah e Muallah Shigar, [[Khaplu Fort]], [[Shigar Fort]] and [[Skardu Fort]].

[[File:Arrondissement Brussels-Periphery Belgium Map.PNG|thumb|The former [[arrondissement of Brussels-Periphery]] within the province of [[Flemish Brabant]], corresponding to the six municipalities with language facilities.]]
The '''Brussels Periphery''' ({{Lang-nl|Brusselse Rand}}, i.e. the "Brussels Rim", or ''Vlaamse Rand'', i.e. the "Flemish Rim", or just ''De Rand'', "the Rim"; {{Lang-fr|périphérie bruxelloise}}) refers to 19 [[List of municipalities of the Flemish Region|Flemish municipalities]] that encircle the [[Brussels-Capital Region]]. The Brussels Region is an [[enclave]] of the province of [[Flemish Brabant]].

Many of these municipalities are essentially [[Metropolitan areas in Belgium|suburbs of Brussels]]. Due to their proximity to Brussels, they have been [[urban sprawl|urbanised]] and their housing prices are high. As a consequence, a lot of well-paid people working in e.g. EU institutions reside here. Another issue, very sensitive in [[Belgian politics]], is the [[Francisation of Brussels|francisation of this area]]. These municipalities all have Dutch as their sole official language, although six municipalities also offer services (known as [[Municipalities with language facilities|language facilities]]) for French-speaking inhabitants, namely [[Drogenbos]], [[Kraainem]], [[Linkebeek]], [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Wemmel]] and [[Wezembeek-Oppem]]. Other municipalities include [[Asse]], [[Beersel]], [[Dilbeek]], [[Grimbergen]], [[Hoeilaart]], [[Machelen]], [[Meise]], [[Merchtem]], [[Overijse]], [[Sint-Pieters-Leeuw]], [[Tervuren]], [[Vilvoorde]] and [[Zaventem]].

Each year, ''[[De Gordel]]'' ("the belt"), a family walking and cycling event, is organised in this area as a symbolic affirmation that the municipalities involved are part of Flanders.

'''Dubrava''' is the district of [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. It is located in the northeastern part of the city and divided by the [[Dubrava Avenue]] into two administrative areas:
* [[Gornja Dubrava]] (''Upper Dubrava'')
* [[Donja Dubrava, Zagreb|Donja Dubrava]] (''Lower Dubrava'')

The name comes from a Slavic toponym for [[oak]] forests. The species of oak that grows in this area is ''[[Quercus robur]]'' L.

== History ==
=== Until 1945 ===
In its earliest days Dubrava was no more than a village, consisting of a couple of houses and gardens. It slowly grew, mostly because of intensive settling of people from all over [[Croatia]] to the city of [[Zagreb]] and surrounding areas. By the 1930s Dubrava had over hundred inhabitants and was connected with Zagreb via road. When [[World War II]] began, Dubrava already had electrical power and 250 inhabitants. During the war it was a [[Yugoslav Partisans|partisan]] base due to its relative distance from other major cities and simultaneous closeness to Zagreb, making it an ideal place from which partisans could operate within Zagreb itself.

As the war progressed, the partisans intensified their activities in Dubrava. Due to the increasing successes of the resistance in Dubrava, the occupation forces were army to occupy Dubrava, where they murdered 13 partisan supporters in December 1944. Following the liberation of Yugoslavia, these people were declared national heroes and several monuments were built in their honor in the Park of December Victims and on the corner of the Konjščinska Street.

'''Ecuador''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Ecuador.ogg|ˈ|ɛ|k|w|ə|d|ɔːr}} {{respell|EK|wə-dor}}, {{IPA-es|ekwaˈðoɾ|lang}}) ({{lang-qu|Ikwayur}}), officially the '''Republic of Ecuador''' ({{lang-es|República del Ecuador}}, &lt;!-- {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðel ekwaˈðoɾ}} --&gt; which literally translates as "Republic of the [[Equator]]"; {{lang-qu|Ikwadur Ripuwlika}}), is a country in northwestern [[South America]], bordered by [[Colombia]] on the north, [[Peru]] on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the [[Galápagos Islands]] in the Pacific, about {{convert|1000|km}} west of the mainland. The capital city is [[Quito]], while the largest city is [[Guayaquil]].

What is now Ecuador was home to a variety of [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Amerindian]] groups that were gradually incorporated into the [[Inca Empire]] during the 15th century. The territory was [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonized by Spain]] during the 16th century, achieving independence in 1820 as part of [[Gran Colombia]], from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830. The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador's ethnically diverse population, with most of its {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Ecuador}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people being [[mestizo|mestizos]], followed by large minorities of European, [[Indigenous people of Ecuador|Amerindian]], and [[Afro-Ecuadorian|African]] descendants. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population, though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized, including [[Quichua language|Quichua]] and [[Shuar language|Shuar]].

The [[sovereign state]] of Ecuador is a middle-income [[representative democratic]] republic with a [[developing economy]] that is highly dependent on commodities, namely petroleum and agricultural products. It is governed as a democratic [[presidential system|presidential]] republic.

The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500–13,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.

Even though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life; and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.

Over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Cañari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.

In the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.

===Inca era===
[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the maximum Incan God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]
[[File:Múmia de cabeça - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]
When the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers—[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]—to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.

In contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claims that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Huáscar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.

Huáscar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Huáscar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Huáscar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Huáscar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.

A small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.

===Spanish rule===

New infectious diseases, endemic to the Europeans, caused high fatalities among the Amerindian population during the first decades of Spanish rule, as they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]. At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].

After nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan Pío Montúfar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, "''[[Luz de América]]''" ("Light of America"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el día de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Telégrafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 1820, [[Guayaquil]] became the first city in Ecuador to gain its independence from Spain. The people were very happy about the independence and celebrated, which is now Ecuador's independence day, officially on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Simón Bolívar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830 Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.

The 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan José Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[José Joaquín de Olmedo]]; [[José María Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro José de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Ascásubi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jijón]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.

The Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military "Julian Revolution" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[José María Velasco Ibarra]].

===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===
{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian–Peruvian territorial dispute}}
{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}

====President Juan José Flores de jure territorial claims====
Since Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan José Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.

Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.

====Struggle for independence====
During the struggle for independence, before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Jaén with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[José de San Martín|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.

However, [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Simón Bolívar|Bolívar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio José de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.

====Peruvian occupation of Jaén, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====
In the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Marañon cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Jaén, Peru|Jaén de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar in December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.

On July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin and Tumbes and Jaen which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[José de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[José de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.

The war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe river or the Huancabamba river. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Jaén; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Jaén, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.

====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====
[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - División política de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]
[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]

The Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. President Juan José Flores with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popayán]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.

Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogotá and Quito, where the government of Bogotá did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogotá recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de División Territorial de la República de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquetá river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popayán extended its control all the way to the Napo River.

====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====
[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]
When Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.

Peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region which it began calling Loreto with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Marañon-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.

In the early part of the 20th century Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Muñoz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquetá River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquetá region, which ended with the Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.

In July 21, 1924 the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937 the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.

Four years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Marañon Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].

[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian Land Claims after 1916]]

During the course of the [[Ecuadorian–Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.

The 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del Río as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.

[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]
The [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del Cóndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January–February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the "''Cain de Latinoamérica''", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate= July 15, 2013 |url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&amp;regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del Cóndor''. While Ecuador had to give up its decades-old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the Cordillera, as well as to the entire western area of Cenepa headwaters, Peru was compelled to give to Ecuador, in perpetual lease but without sovereignty, {{convert|1|km2|abbr=on}} of its territory, in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza – focal point of the war – had been located within Peruvian soil and which the Ecuadorian Army held during the conflict. The final border demarcation came into effect on May 13, 1999 and the multi-national MOMEP (Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru) troop deployment withdrew on June 17, 1999.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;

===Military governments (1972–79)===
In 1972, a "revolutionary and nationalist" military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra. The [[coup d'état]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodríguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodríguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled José María Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Durán Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.

===Return to democracy===
Elections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Roldós Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentración de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.

Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[León Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdalá Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, "[[¡Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]" ("Alfaro Lives, Dammit!"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.

The emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Gutiérrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005. Vice President [[Alfredo Palacio]] took his place and remained in office until the presidential [[Ecuadorian general election, 2006|election of 2006]], in which [[Rafael Correa]] gained the presidency.&lt;ref name="Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory Carroll, Latin America correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/01/ecuador-president-police-attack |title=Ecuador's president attacked by police  |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= October 1, 2010|accessdate=September 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, president Correa declared Ecuador's [[national debt]] illegitimate, based on the argument that it was [[odious debt]] contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes. He announced that the country would default on over $3 billion worth of bonds; he then pledged to fight creditors in [[international court]]s and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60%.&lt;ref name="TRN2009Win"&gt;''[http://therealnews.com/id/3622/April27,2009/%22Avenger+against+oligarchy%22+wins+in+Ecuador "Avenger against oligarchy" wins in Ecuador]'' [[The Real News]], April 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He brought Ecuador into the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]] in June 2009.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Ecuador}}
[[File:Correarafael15012007.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The former President Rafael Correa assumed office on January 15, 2007]]
The Ecuadorian State consists of five branches of government: the ''Executive Branch'', the ''Legislative Branch'', the ''Judicial Branch'', the ''Electoral Branch'', and ''Transparency and Social Control.''

Ecuador is governed by a democratically elected President, for a four-year term. The current president of Ecuador, [[Lenin Moreno]], exercises his power from the presidential [[Palacio de Carondelet]] in Quito. The [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|current constitution]] was written by the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] elected in 2007, and was approved by referendum in 2008. Since 1936, voting is compulsory for all literate persons aged 18–65, optional for all other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |title=Compulsory Voting |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 18, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612191446/http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm |archivedate=June 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive branch includes 23 ministries. Provincial governors and councilors (mayors, aldermen, and parish boards) are directly elected. The [[National Assembly of Ecuador]] meets throughout the year except for recesses in July and December. There are thirteen permanent committees. Members of the National Court of Justice are appointed by the National Judicial Council for nine-year terms.

===Executive branch===
{{Main|List of heads of state of Ecuador}}
[[File:Quito PalaciodeGobierno.JPG|thumb|[[Palacio de Carondelet]], the executive branch of the Ecuadorian Government]]
The [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] is led by the president, an office currently held by [[Lenin Moreno]]. He is accompanied by the vice-president, currently [[Jorge Glas]], elected for four years (with the ability to be re-elected only once). As head of state and chief government official, he is responsible for public administration including the appointing of national coordinators, ministers, ministers of State and public servants. The executive branch defines foreign policy, appoints the Chancellor of the Republic, as well as ambassadors and consuls, being the ultimate authority over the [[:Military of Ecuador|Armed Forces of Ecuador]], [[National Police of Ecuador]], and appointing authorities. The acting president's wife receives the title of [[First Lady of Ecuador]].

===Legislative branch===
{{Main|National Assembly (Ecuador)}}

The legislative branch is embodied by the [[National Assembly of Ecuador|National Assembly]], which is headquartered in the city of [[Quito]] in the Legislative Palace, and consists of 137 assemblymen, divided into ten committees and elected for a four-year term. Fifteen national constituency elected assembly, two Assembly members elected from each province and one for every 100,000 inhabitants or fraction exceeding 150,000, according to the latest national population census. In addition, statute determines the election of assembly of regions, and metropolitan districts.

===Judicial branch===
Ecuador's judiciary has as its main body the Judicial Council, and also includes the National Court of Justice, provincial courts, and lower courts. Legal representation is made by the Judicial Council.
The National Court of Justice is composed of 21 judges elected for a term of nine years. Judges are renewed by thirds every three years pursuant to the Judicial Code. These are elected by the Judicial Council on the basis of opposition proceedings and merits.
The justice system is buttressed by the independent offices of public prosecutor and the public defender. Auxiliary organs are as follows: [[Civil law notary|notaries]], court auctioneers, and court receivers. Also there is a special legal regime for Amerindians.

===Electoral branch===
The electoral system functions by authorities which enter only every four years or when [[Elections in Ecuador|elections or referendums]] occur. Its main functions are to organize, control elections, and punish the infringement of electoral rules. Its main body is the [[National Electoral Council (Ecuador)|National Electoral Council]], which is based in the city of Quito, and consists of seven members of the [[Political parties in Ecuador|political parties]] most voted, enjoying complete financial and administrative autonomy. This body, along with the [[Electoral Tribunal|electoral court]], forms the ''Electoral Branch'' which is one of Ecuador's five [[Separation of powers|branches of government]].

===Transparency and social control branch===
The Transparency and Social Control consists of the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, an [[ombudsman]], the Comptroller General of the State, and the superintendents. Branch members hold office for five years. This branch is responsible for promoting transparency and control plans publicly, as well as plans to design mechanisms to combat corruption, as also designate certain authorities, and be the regulatory mechanism of accountability in the country.

===Human rights===
[[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN's Human Rights Council]]'s (HRC) Universal Periodic Review (UPR) has treated the restrictions on [[freedom of expression]] and efforts to control [[NGO]]s and recommended that Ecuador should stop the criminal sanctions for the expression of opinions, and delay in implementing judicial reforms. Ecuador rejected the recommendation on decriminalization of libel.&lt;ref name=hrw&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ecuador|title=Ecuador|publisher=WORLD REPORT 2013, Human Rights Watch|pages=1–3|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) President Correa has intimidated journalists and subjected them to "public denunciation and retaliatory litigation". The sentences to journalists have been years of imprisonment and millions of dollars of compensation, even though defendants have been pardoned.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt; Correa has stated he was only seeking a retraction for slanderous statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Democracy in Ecuador|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/opinion/democracy-in-ecuador.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to HRW, Correa's government has weakened the [[freedom of press]] and [[Judicial independence|independence of the judicial system]]. In Ecuador's current judicial system, judges are selected in a contest of merits, rather than government appointments. However, the process of selection has been criticized as biased and subjective. In particular, the final interview is said to be given "excessive weighing." Judges and prosecutors that have made decisions in favor of Correa in his lawsuits have received permanent posts, while others with better assessment grades have been rejected.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reformahasta2015&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131102052404/http://diariodigitalcentro.com/index.php/455-reforma-judicial-en-ecuador-debe-hacerse-hasta-el-2015 Reforma judicial en Ecuador debe hacerse hasta el 2015], diariodigitalcentro.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sea lion sleeping on bench in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno 2013.JPG|thumb|Adult [[Galápagos sea lion]] resting on a park bench in [[Puerto Baquerizo Moreno]].]]
The laws also forbid articles and media messages that could favor or disfavor some political message or candidate. In the first half of 2012, twenty private TV or radio stations were closed down.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

In July 2012 the officials warned the judges that they would be sanctioned and possibly dismissed if they allowed the citizens to appeal to the protection of their constitutional rights against the state.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

People engaging in public protests against environmental and other issues are prosecuted for "terrorism and sabotage", which may lead to an eight-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name=hrw/&gt;

===Foreign affairs===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Ecuador}}
Ecuador's principal foreign policy objectives have traditionally included defense of its territory from external aggression and support for the objectives of the [[United Nations]] and the OAS. Ecuador's membership in the OPEC in the 1970s and 1980s allowed Ecuadorian leaders to exercise somewhat greater foreign policy autonomy. In Antarctica, Ecuador has maintained a peaceful research station for scientific study as a member nation of the [[Antarctica Treaty]]. Ecuador has often placed great emphasis on multilateral approaches to international issues. Ecuador is a member of the United Nations (and most of its specialized agencies) and a member of many regional groups, including the [[Rio Group]], the [[Latin American Economic System]], the [[Latin American Energy Organization]], the [[Latin American Integration Association]], the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]], the [[Andean Community of Nations]], the Union of South American Nations ([[UNASUR]]), and The Bank of the South (Spanish: Banco del Sur or BancoSur).

The Ecuadorian government commits itself to upholding a [[progressivism|progressive]] attitude towards [[human migration|migration]] related problems, [[manifesto|declaring]] its [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] ''"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility"'' (Spanish: ''Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y Movilidad Humana''). In 2017, the Ecuadorian parliament adopted a ''Law on human mobility'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cancilleria.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ley_de_movilidad_humana_oficial.pdf Ley Orgánica de Movilidad Humana]&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2018 the ministry presented a new ''Human Mobility National Plan'', based on policies aimed at promoting universal citizenship and free mobility in the international sphere; generate conditions to promote an orderly and safe migration, strengthen the protection of the rights of this population and defend its diversity, integration, and coexistence. 

The [[International Organization for Migration]] lauds Ecuador as the first state to have established the promotion of the concept of universal citizenship in its [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|constitution]], aiming to promote the universal recognition and protection of the human rights of migrants. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iom.int/news/ecuador-launches-new-human-mobility-national-plan|title=Ecuador Launches New Human Mobility National Plan|date=June 8, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

The provinces are divided into [[Cantons of Ecuador|cantons]] and further subdivided into parishes (''parroquias'').

===Regions and planning areas===
Regionalization, or zoning, is the union of two or more adjoining provinces in order to decentralize the administrative functions of the capital Quito.
In Ecuador there are seven regions or zones, each shaped by the following provinces:
* Region 1 (42,126&amp;nbsp;km², or 16,265&amp;nbsp;mi²): [[Esmeraldas (province)|Esmeraldas]], [[Carchi]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], and [[Sucumbios]]. Administrative city: [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]]

The [[Military of Ecuador|Ecuadorian Armed Forces]] (Fuerzas Armadas del Ecuador), consists of the [[Ecuadorian Army|Army]], [[Ecuadorian Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Ecuadorian Navy|Navy]] and have the stated responsibility for the preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory.

The military tradition starts in [[Gran Colombia]], where a sizable army was stationed in Ecuador due to border disputes with Peru, which claimed territories under its political control when it was a Spanish vice-royalty. Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Simón Bolívar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jose Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.

Due to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has four main geographic regions:
*'''La Costa''', or "the coast": The coastal region consists of the provinces to the West of the Andean range&amp;nbsp;– [[Esmeraldas Province|Esmeraldas]], [[Guayas Province|Guayas]], [[Los Ríos Province|Los Ríos]], [[Manabí Province|Manabí]], [[El Oro Province|El Oro]], [[Santa Elena Province|Santa Elena]]. It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].

Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].
*'''La Amazonía''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or "the east": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&amp;nbsp;– [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumbíos Province|Sucumbíos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumbíos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.
*'''La Región Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Galápagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.

Ecuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region. Its largest city is Guayaquil, in the [[Guayas Province]]. [[Cotopaxi]], just south of Quito, is one of the world's highest active volcanoes. The top of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Mount Chimborazo]] (6,268 m, or 20,560&amp;nbsp;ft, above sea level), Ecuador's tallest mountain, is the most distant point from the center of the Earth on the Earth's surface because of the [[ellipsoid]] shape of the planet.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ec.html |title=Ecuador|work=The World Factbook |accessdate= August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Ecuador}}
[[File:Ecuador map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Ecuador map of [[Köppen climate classification]].]]

There is great variety in the climate, largely determined by altitude. It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.

Because of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

===Hydrology===
{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}
[[File:Canyoning en Baños de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Baños de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]

The Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north–south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.

Almost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the La Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the La Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.

[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]
In the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.

Major rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Galápagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.

The Ministry of Information and Tourism was created on August 10, 1992, at the beginning of the government of [[Sixto Durán Ballén]], who viewed tourism as a fundamental activity for the economic and social development of the peoples. Faced with the growth of the tourism sector, in June 1994, the decision was taken to separate tourism from information, so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity.

Ecuador is a country with vast natural wealth. The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna. It has around 1640 kinds of birds. The species of butterflies border the 4,500, the reptiles 345, the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258, among others. Not in vain, Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet's highest biodiversity is concentrated, being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world. Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State. Also, it has a huge culture spectrum. Since 2007, with the government of Rafael Correa, the tourism brand "Ecuador Ama la Vida" has been transformed, with which the nation's tourism promotion would be sold. Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature, natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples. And for this, means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy.

The country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Quito and Cuenca, as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]], such as the Cajas massif. Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.

Among the main tourist destinations are:

*Nature attractions: [[Galapagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Baños de Agua Santa]].

*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.

The roads of Ecuador in recent years have undergone important improvement. The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).

Another major project is developing the road Manta – Tena, the highway Guayaquil – Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba – Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia – San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.

The [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[José Joaquín de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization. In the case of Guayaquil it involved a new air terminal, once considered the best in South America and the best in Latin America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportservicequalityawards.com/best-airport-size-2-5-million-passengers|title=Best airport in the world – 2–5 million passengers - ASQ Awards|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Quito where an entire new airport has been built in Tababela and was inaugurated in February 2013, with Canadian assistance. However, the main road leading from Quito city centre to the new airport will only be finished in late 2014, making current travelling from the airport to downtown Quito as long as two hours during rush hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adventurecruisenews.com/2012/03/13/quito-ecuadors-new-airport-to-open-october-2012/|title=Quito, Ecuador's New Airport – Gateway to the Galápagos|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quito's old city-centre airport is being turned into parkland, with some light industrial use.

Ecuador's population is ethnically diverse and the {{UN_Population|Year}} estimates put Ecuador's population at {{UN_Population|Ecuador}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The largest ethnic group ({{As of|2010|lc=y}}) is the ''[[Mestizo]]s'', who are the descendants of Spanish colonists that interbred with Amerindian peoples, and constitute about 71% of the population. The White Ecuadorians ([[White Latin American]]) account for 6.1% of the population of Ecuador and can be found throughout all of Ecuador primarily around the urban areas. Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]). In addition, there is a small European Jewish ([[Ecuadorian Jews]]) population, which is based mainly in Quito and to a lesser extent in Guayaquil.&lt;ref name=ethn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2011/09/02/1/1356/poblacion-pais-joven-mestiza-dice-censo-inec.html|title=Población del país es joven y mestiza, dice censo del INEC - Data from the national census 2010 (2011-09-02)|author=EL UNIVERSO|work=El Universo|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] account for 7% of the current population. The mostly rural Montubio population of the coastal provinces of Ecuador, who might be classified as [[Pardo]] account for 7.4% of the population. The [[Afro-Ecuadorian people|Afro-Ecuadorians]] is a minority population (7%) in Ecuador, that includes the [[Mulatto]]s and ''[[zambo]]s'', and are largely based in the Esmeraldas province and to a lesser degree in the predominantly Mestizo provinces of Coastal Ecuador - Guayas and Manabi. In the Highland Andes where a predominantly Mestizo, white and Amerindian population exist, the African presence is almost non-existent except for a small community in the province of Imbabura called Chota Valley.

There is a small number of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]], Amerindian religions, Muslims (see [[Islam in Ecuador]]), [[Buddhist]]s and [[Bahá'í]]. According to their own estimates, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] accounts for about 1.4% of the population, or 211,165 members at the end of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/ecuador/|title=LDS Newsroom, Facts and Statistics, Ecuador|publisher=mormonnewsroom.org|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their own sources, in 2017 there were 92,752 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;2017 Service Year Report of Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecuadorian constitution recognizes the "pluri-nationality" of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups. Thus, in addition to ''criollos'', ''mestizos'', and Afro-Ecuadorians, some people belong to the Amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast, Quechua Andean villages, and the Amazonian jungle.

===Population genetics===
According to a 2015 [[genealogical DNA test]]ing, the average Ecuadorian is estimated to be 52.96% [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|Native American]], 41.77% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], and 5.26% [[Sub-Saharan African]] overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Unravelling the hidden ancestry of American admixed populations|journal=Nature Communications|volume=6|pmc=4374169|doi=10.1038/ncomms7596|pmid=25803618|date=March 24, 2015|at=See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4374169/bin/ncomms7596-s2.xlsx Supplementary Data]|last1=Montinaro|first1=F.|last2=Busby|first2=G.

===Population density===
The majority of Ecuadorians live in the central provinces, the Andes mountains, or along the Pacific coast. The tropical forest region to the east of the mountains (El Oriente) remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the population. Birth rate is 2-1 for each death. Marriages are usually from 14 and above using parental consent. About 12.4% of the population is married in the ages 15–19. Divorce rates are moderate.&lt;br /&gt;Population cities (2010)&lt;ref name="censo de 2010"/&gt;

A small east [[Asian Latino]] community, estimated at 2,500, mainly consists of those of Japanese and Chinese descent, whose ancestors arrived as miners, farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

In the early years of World War II, Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants, and in 1939, when several South American countries refused to accept 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship ''Koenigstein'', Ecuador granted them entry permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another perk that draws many expats to Ecuador is its low cost of living. Since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in North America, it's a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget.

Even real estate in Ecuador is much less than its tropical counterparts. However, as more and more North Americans are discovering Ecuador's potential, property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago, particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Ecuador}}
[[File:Cañari people 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Cañari]] children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes]]
Ecuador's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic ''[[mestizo]]'' majority, and, like their ancestry, it is traditionally of Spanish heritage, influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements. The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.

[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]

Since African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.

Ecuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.

Most Ecuadorians speak Spanish, though many speak Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page&lt;/ref&gt; Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Awá), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Tsáchila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}
[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]
The music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the "national genre of music". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on.
[[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It's originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].

[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama "Ollantay", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,&lt;ref&gt;Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the "Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa",&lt;ref name =Boceto/&gt; a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.

Other early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.

Famous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Simón Bolívar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work "Cumanda" or "Tragedy among Savages" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

Contemporary Ecuadorian writers include the novelist [[Jorge Enrique Adoum]]; the poet [[Jorge Carrera Andrade]]; the essayist [[Benjamín Carrión]]; the poets Medardo Angel Silva, Jorge Carrera Andrade, and [[Luis Costales|Luis Alberto Costales]]; the novelist Enrique Gil Gilbert; the novelist [[Jorge Icaza]] (author of the novel ''Huasipungo'', translated to many languages); the short story author Pablo Palacio; and the novelist Alicia Yanez Cossio.

In spite of Ecuador's considerable mystique, it is rarely featured as a setting in contemporary western literature. One exception is "The Ecuadorian Deception," a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.

===Art===
The best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quiteña]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

[[File:Estadio Monumental 6.JPG|thumb|[[Estadio Monumental Isidro Romero Carbo]] of Guayaquil.]]
The most popular [[sport in Ecuador]], as in most South American countries, is football. Its best known professional teams include [[LDU Quito|Liga De Quito]] from [[Quito]]; [[Club Sport Emelec|Emelec]] from [[Guayaquil]];  [[Sociedad Deportivo Quito|Deportivo Quito]], and [[Club Deportivo El Nacional|El Nacional]] from Quito; [[Centro Deportivo Olmedo|Olmedo]] from [[Riobamba]]; and [[Club Deportivo Cuenca|Deportivo Cuenca]] from Cuenca. Currently the most successful football team in Ecuador is LDU Quito, and it is the only Ecuadorian team that has won the ''[[Copa Libertadores]]'', the ''[[Copa Sudamericana]]'', and the ''[[Recopa Sudamericana]]''; they were also runners-up in the [[2008 FIFA Club World Cup]]. The matches of the [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuadorian national team]] are the most-watched sporting events in the country.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Ecuador has qualified for the final rounds of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], &amp; the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The unusually high elevation of the home stadium in Quito often affects the performance of visiting teams. Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] finishing second behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup. They were defeated by [[England national football team|England]] in the second round.

Ecuador has won only two medals in the Olympic Games, both gained by 20-km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) racewalker [[Jefferson Pérez]], who took gold in the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] games and silver [[2008 Summer Olympics|12 years later]].

The current structure of the Ecuadorian public health care system dates back to 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Larrea, Julio. "25 Años de Vida Institucional", Imprenta del Ministerio de Salud Publica, Quito 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99:historia-del-ministerio-de-salud-publica&amp;catid=68:historia&amp;Itemid=61 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317184901/http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99:historia-del-ministerio-de-salud-publica&amp;catid=68:historia&amp;Itemid=61 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 17, 2012 |title=History of the Ministry of Public Health |publisher=Msp.gob.ec |accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of the Public Health (Ministerio de Salud Pública del Ecuador) is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policies and health care plans. The Minister of Public Health is appointed directly by the President of the Republic. The current minister, or Ecuadorian general surgeon, is [[Margarita Guevara]].

The philosophy of the Ministry of Public Health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population,&lt;ref name=health&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=97&amp;Itemid=55 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005042709/http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=97&amp;Itemid=55 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 5, 2010 |title=Program of the Ministry of Public Health – Ecuador |publisher=Msp.gob.ec |accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine.&lt;ref name=health/&gt;

The public healthcare system allows patients to be treated without an appointment in public general hospitals by general practitioners and specialists in the outpatient clinic (''Consulta Externa'') at no cost. This is done in the four basic specialties of pediatric, gynecology, clinic medicine, and surgery.&lt;ref name=healths&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63:mi-hospital-modelo&amp;catid=41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206032316/http://www.msp.gob.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63:mi-hospital-modelo&amp;catid=41 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 6, 2010 |title=Public health care network – Ministry of Public Health – Ecuador |publisher=Msp.gob.ec |accessdate=February 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases, target a particular group of the population, or provide better treatment in some medical specialties. Some examples in this group are the Gynecologic Hospitals, or Maternities, Children Hospitals, Geriatric Hospitals, and Oncology Institutes.

Although well-equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of provinces, there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and [[canton (country subdivision)|canton]] cities for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics, gynecology, clinical medicine, and surgery.&lt;ref name=healths/&gt;

Community health care centers (Centros de Salud) are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas. These are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours.&lt;ref name=healths/&gt;
The doctors assigned to rural communities, where the Amerindian population can be substantial, have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities. The treatment in this case respects the culture of the community.&lt;ref name=healths/&gt;

The public healthcare system should not be confused with the Ecuadorian Social Security healthcare service, which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers. Citizens with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system. The Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS) has several major hospitals and medical sub-centers under its administration across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iess.gob.ec/site.php?content=1669-servicios |title=Medical Services – Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social |publisher=Iess.gob.ec |date=February 19, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221154355/http://www.iess.gob.ec/site.php?content=1669-servicios |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecuadorian Constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a "basic level of education", which is estimated at nine school years.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecuador|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/ecuador.htm|work=The Department of Labor's 2001 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor|publisher=[[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]]|year=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503214040/http://www.dol.gov/ILAB/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/ecuador.htm|archivedate=May 3, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the net primary enrollment rate was 96.9%, and 71.8% of children stayed in school until the fifth grade.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; The cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government, but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

Provision of public schools falls far below the levels needed, and class sizes are often very large, and families of limited means often find it necessary to pay for education.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} In rural areas, only 10% of the children go on to high school.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The Ministry of Education states that the mean number of years completed is 6.7.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[File:Colegio Maldonado Riobamba.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Maldonado High School of [[Riobamba]]]]
Ecuador has 61 universities, many of which still confer [[terminal degree]]s according to the traditional Spanish education system,&lt;ref&gt;Spanish Education System, [[:es:Sistema educativo de España|Spanish Education System (Text in Spanish)]]&lt;/ref&gt; honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the Americas: University of San Fulgencio, founded in 1586 by the Augustines; San Gregorio Magno University, founded in 1651 by the Jesuits; and University of Santo Tomás of Aquino, founded in 1681 by the Dominican order.

Among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering, physics, chemistry, or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes. These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.

However, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''médico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a "médico" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.
[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]
This new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''décano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.

A debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).

About 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.

The most notable icons in Ecuadorian sciences are the mathematician and cartographer [[Pedro Vicente Maldonado]], born in Riobamba in 1707, and the printer, independence precursor, and medical pioneer [[Eugenio Espejo]], born in 1747 in Quito.
Among other notable Ecuadorian scientists and engineers are Lieutenant [[Submarine#First military models|Jose Rodriguez Lavandera]],&lt;ref&gt;Lavandera, J.R.

The major areas of scientific research in Ecuador have been in the medical fields, tropical and infectious diseases treatments, agricultural engineering, pharmaceutical research, and bioengineering. Being a small country and a consumer of foreign technology, Ecuador has favored research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology. The antivirus program ''Checkprogram'', banking protection system ''MdLock'', and Core Banking Software ''Cobis'' are products of Ecuadorian development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniverso.com/2009/02/01/0217/220/3A2B9B57BD244019AC0760C8CBF7C0EB.html |title=Checkprogram press release |publisher=Eluniverso.com |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around physics, statistics, and partial differential equations in mathematics.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} In the case of engineering fields, the majority of scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions: Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral - ''[[Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral|ESPOL]]'', Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas - ''[[ESPE]]'', and Escuela Politécnica Nacional ''[[National Polytechnic School|EPN]]''. The [[Center for Research and Technology Development in Ecuador]] is an autonomous center for research and technology development funded by [[Senecyt]].

EPN is known for research and education in the  [[applied science]], [[astronomy]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[engineering]] and [[physical sciences]]. The [[Geophysics]] Institute &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igepn.edu.ec/ "Instituto Geofísico - EPN - Home"]. ''igepn.edu.ec''.&lt;/ref&gt; monitors over the country's [[volcanoes]] in the [[Andes Mountains]] of Ecuador and in the [[Galápagos Islands]], all of which is part of the [[Ring of Fire]]. EPN adopted the [[History of European research universities|polytechnic university model]] that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering.

The oldest observatory in South America is the [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] and is located in Quito, Ecuador. The Quito Astronomical Observatory, which gives the global community of a Virtual Telescope System that is connected via the Internet and allows the world to watch by streaming, is managed by EPN.

Contemporary Ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are Eugenia del Pino (born 1945), the first Ecuadorian to be elected to the United States [[National Academy of Science]], and [[Arturo Villavicencio]], who was part of the working group of the IPCC, which shared the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Al Gore]] for their dissemination of the effects of climate change.

Currently, the politics of research and investigation are managed by the National Secretary of Higher Education, Science, and Technology (''Senescyt'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senescyt.gob.ec|title=Secretaria Nacional de Educacion Superior, Ciencia y Tecnologia|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eden Patera''' is a feature located in the [[Mare Acidalium quadrangle]] on the planet [[Mars]]. In October 2013 the feature gained some attention when it was speculated it may be a [[supervolcano]] rather than an [[impact crater]], according to research from the [[Planetary Science Institute]] in [[Tucson]], led by Joseph R. Michalski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy.com/news/2013/10/mars-crater-may-actually-be-ancient-supervolcano Mars crater may actually be ancient supervolcano]&lt;/ref&gt; The research postulated the crater was formed by the volcano's [[caldera]] collapsing, rather than from an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24348673|title=Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2013-10-02|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of reasons for suspecting that Eden Patera is a collapsed caldera not an impact crater are its irregular shape, an apparent lack of a raised rim or central peak, and lack of impact [[ejecta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24348673|title=Supervolcanoes ripped up early Mars|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2013-10-02|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">In [[data analysis]] involving geographical locations, '''geo-imputation''' or '''geographical imputation''' methods are steps taken to replace [[missing value]]s for exact locations with approximate locations derived from associated data. They assign a reasonable location or geographic based attribute  (e.g., [[census tract]]) to a person by using both the demographic characteristics of the person
and the population characteristics from a larger geographic aggregate area in which the person was geocoded (e.g., postal delivery area or county). For example if a person's census tract was known and no other address information was available then geo-imputation methods could be used to probabilistically assign that person to a smaller geographic area, such as a census block group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Henry, Kevin A., Boscoe, Francis P.,|title=Estimating the accuracy of geographical imputation|journal=International Journal of Health Geographics|year=2008 |volume=7 |issue=3 |doi=10.1186/1476-072X-7-3|pmid=18215308|pages=3|pmc=2266732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GeoTime''' is [[geospatial analysis]] software that allows the visual analysis of events over time. It adds time as the [[third dimension]] to a [[two-dimensional]] map (which can include [[3D projection]] of terrain [[elevation]] [[geodata]] or any abstract diagrammatic space), allowing users to see changes within [[time series]] data. Users can view real-time animated playback of data and use automated analysis tools within the software to identify location patterns, connections between events, and trends.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oculusinfo.com/geotime/ |title=GeoTime Overview - Oculus |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GeoTime can import data in many formats, such as [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]], [[Shapefile]], [[KML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], [[geotagged photo]]s, and from live data sources via [[GeoRSS]] and [[RSS]] web feeds and [[Web Map Service|WMS]] servers. It supports most [[Telecommunications data retention|telecommunication carrier reporting]] formats ([[Call detail record|CDR]]), including tower/sector information. These features allow users to aggregate data from [[satellite]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, [[social networking]] web sites, [[web server]] logs and many other sources. GeoTime can export data to other [[GIS software]] such as [[Google Earth]] and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] [[ArcGIS]] via [[KML]] format, and to other applications via [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], as well as capture [[video]] of data animations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-%281%29/Features---Benefits/Features---Benefits-%281%29.aspx |title=GeoTime: Features |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511031801/http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-(1)/Features---Benefits/Features---Benefits-(1).aspx |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[ArcGIS#Extensions|ArcGIS extension]] is available that allows GeoTime to work alongside the popular ArcGIS [[geographic information system]] with bi-directional data sharing between the two programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-%281%29/GeoTime-for-ArcGIS.aspx |title=GeoTime for ArcGIS |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601114817/http://www.geotime.com/Product/GeoTime-(1)/GeoTime-for-ArcGIS.aspx |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oculusinfo.com/geotime-arcgis-compatibility/ |title=GeoTime ArcGIS Compatibility |publisher=Oculus Info Inc. |accessdate=29 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Costa Rica Topography.png|thumb|right|Topography of Costa Rica]]

'''[[Costa Rica]]''' is located on the [[Central American Isthmus]], surrounding the point 10° north of the [[equator]] and 84° west of the [[prime meridian]]. It borders both the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] (to the west), with a total of 1,290&amp;nbsp;km of coastline (212&amp;nbsp;km on the Caribbean coast and 1,016&amp;nbsp;km on the Pacific).

Costa Rica shares a border with [[Nicaragua]] to the north (313&amp;nbsp;km long border) and with [[Panama]] to the south (348&amp;nbsp;km long border). The area of Costa Rica is 51,100&amp;nbsp;km² of which 51,060&amp;nbsp;km² is land and 40&amp;nbsp;km² is water, making it slightly smaller than the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

==Physical geography==
[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|right|thumbnail|Extent of Costa Rica's western [[EEZ]] in the Pacific]]
The nation's [[terrain]] is a coastal plain separated by rugged mountains, the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], which form the spine of the country and separate the Pacific and Caribbean [[drainage divide|watershed]]s.  Costa Rica claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}} and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}.

The spine of the country produces many major river systems.  Rivers draining into the Caribbean include:
* [[Colorado River (Costa Rica)|Colorado River]] (''Rio Colorado'')
* [[Pacuare River]] (''Rio Pacuare'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Parismina'')
* [[Reventazón River]] (''Rio Reventazon'')
* [[Sixaola River]] (''Rio Sixaola'')

Rivers draining into the [[Lake Nicaragua]] or the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] (''Rio San Juan''), whose waters eventually drains into the Caribbean, include:
* [[Sapoá River]] (''Rio Sapoá'')
* [[Frío River (Costa Rica)|Frío River]] (''Rio Frío'')
* [[San Carlos River (Costa Rica)|San Carlos River]] (''Rio San Carlos'')
* [[Sarapiquí River]] (''Rio Sarapiquí'')

Rivers draining into the Pacific Ocean include:
* [[Abangares River]] (''Rio Abangares'')
* [[Guacimal River]] (''Rio Guacimal'')
* [[Sierpe River]] (''Rio Sierpe'') 
* [[Tempisque River]] (''Rio Tempisque'')
* [[Térraba River]] (''Rio Terraba'')

In the eastern half of the country, the San Juan River forms the northern border with [[Nicaragua]].

===Mountain ranges===

====Cordillera de Tilarán====
The Tilaran Range is part of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] east of [[Lake Arenal]] and the nearby [[active volcano]] [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]], and running into the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] range further east.  It is located in the [[Abangares Canton|Abangares]] district of the province of [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]].

At the edge of the range is the [[Monteverde]] [[cloud forest]] preserve, a major [[ecotourism]] destination.

====Cordillera Centro====
The [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Central Range]] continues the [[Continental Divide]] east of [[Cordillera de Tilarán]]. It has four large volcanoes: [[Poás Volcano|Poás]], [[Barva Volcano|Barva]], [[Irazú Volcano|Irazú]] and [[Turrialba Volcano|Turrialba]]. The highest peak is Irazú at 3,432 m.

====Cordillera de Guanacaste====
The [[Cordillera de Guanacaste|Guanacaste Range]] is in northern Costa Rica near the border with [[Nicaragua]]. The range forms part of the southern region of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], the highest peak being the [[extinct]] [[stratovolcano]] [[Miravalles Volcano|Miravalles]] at 2,028 m.  Peaks include:
* [[Tenorio Volcano National Park|Tenorio Volcano]] (1,913 m)
* [[Miravalles Volcano]] (2,028 m)
* [[Orosí Volcano]] (1,659 m)
* [[Rincón de la Vieja Volcano]] (1,916 m)
*[[Arenal Volcano]] (1,671)

====Cordillera de Talamanca====
Much of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca|Talamanca Range]] is included in the [[La Amistad International Park]], which is shared between Costa Rica and Panama. The country's highest peaks lie in this mountain range: the [[Cerro Chirripó]] and the [[Cerro Kamuk]]. Much of the region is covered by the [[Talamancan montane forests|forest]].

====Cerros de Escazú====

[[Image:Rainforest at Puentes Colgantes.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rainforest]] in Costa Rica]]
Like all Central American countries, [[Costa Rica]] is considered a [[biodiversity hotspot]]. According to the [[INBio]], about 4.5% of the world's biodiversity can be found in Costa Rica.
Costa Rica is home to about 12,119 species of [[plant]]s, of which 950 are [[endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref name="rainforests.mongabay.com"&gt;[http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Costa_Rica.htm Costa Rica Forest Information and Data]. rainforests.mongabay.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are 117 native trees and more than 1,400 types of [[orchid]]s; a third of them can be found in the [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]]. Almost a half of the country's land is covered by forests, though only 3.5% is covered by primary forests.&lt;ref name="rainforests.mongabay.com"/&gt; [[Deforestation in Costa Rica|Deforestation]] is a devastating process, with more than 8,100 ha of forest being lost annually. The main reason for such high deforestation levels is to make plains for cattle ranching.

[[Wildlife of Costa Rica|Wildlife diversity]] is very high; there are 441 species of [[amphibian]]s and [[reptile]]s, 838 species of [[bird]]s, 232 species of [[mammal]]s and 181 species of fresh water fish. Costa Rica has high levels of [[endemism]]; 81 species of amphibians and reptiles, 17 species of birds and 7 species of mammals are endemic to the country. However, many species are [[endangered]]. According to the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], 209 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians and plants are endangered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep-wcmc.org/ Home]. Unep-Wcmc. Retrieved on 2012-01-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the country's most endangered species are the [[Harpy eagle]], the [[Giant anteater]], the [[Golden toad]] and the [[Jaguar]]. [[IUCN]] reports the [[Golden toad]] as extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{IUCNlink|3172|Incilius periglenes}} [[IUCN Red List]]'s article about the [[Golden toad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected areas ==
{{See also|National Parks of Costa Rica|List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica}}

Costa Rica is famous for its 26 [[national park]]s and more than 160 protected areas.  The other types of protected areas in Costa Rica are National Wildlife Refuges, Biological Reserves, Protection Zones, and Absolute Nature Reserves.  Together the protected areas comprise over one-fourth of Costa Rican territory. 9.3% of the country is protected under [[IUCN]] categories I-V.

===Tortuguero National Park===
The creation of the [[Tortuguero National Park]] in 1970 gave much needed protection to one of the region's most important and unique natural resources: a 22&amp;nbsp;km stretch of shoreline that serves as the principal nesting site for sea turtles.

== Environmental issues ==
Environmental issues include [[deforestation]], largely a result of the clearing of land for cattle ranching; soil [[erosion]]; coastal [[marine pollution]]; fisheries protection; solid waste management; and air pollution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">The '''geology of [[Barbados]]''' includes exposures of reef-related carbonate rocks spanning 85 percent of the island's surface. This Coral Rock Formation is 70 meters thick and dates to the [[Pleistocene]]. Unlike neighboring islands in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc, Barbados is unusual because it is not a volcanic island (the only volcanic rocks are some ash beds from eruptions on neighboring islands). Instead, the island of Barbados is the exposed part of the Barbados Ridge Accretionary Prism, left as deep ocean sediments "scraped" to the surface as the Atlantic oceanic crust subducted beneath the Caribbean Plate.

The oldest rocks are in the Scotland Formation and include [[Eocene]] age [[turbidite]] and radiolarites. This unit is 4.5 kilometers thick from the sea floor to the surface. It is overlain by a [[syncline]] basin called the Woodbourne Trough, which includes pelagic sediments. [[Nappe]] formations of the Oceanic Formation, from a [[Miocene]] forearc basin filled with calcareous pelagic sediments and volcanic ash is thrusted on top of the two older units. Mud, rich in organic molecules intrudes all of these units with diapirs—rising tendrils of mud with behavior similar to salt domes.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=C94abSVasmAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA381&amp;dq=geology+of+barbados&amp;ots=kxfGjcZ4On&amp;sig=SMvAc2SaQUwui2YpxqvN3BjaiFA#v=onepage&amp;q=geology%20of%20barbados&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ifremer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00245/35674/|website=archimer.ifremer.fr|title=Geology of Barbados&amp;#058; Implications for an Accretionary Origin|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geology of [[Thailand]]''' includes deep crystalline metamorphic basement rocks, overlain by extensive sandstone, limestone, turbidites and some volcanic rocks. The region experienced complicated tectonics during the [[Paleozoic]], long-running shallow water conditions and then renewed uplift and erosion in the past several million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=718-724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
Medium- and high-grade metamorphic rocks form the basement of Thailand and geologists have debated based on radiometric dating whether metamorphism took place during the [[Precambrian]] or [[Mesozoic]] (if during the Mesozoic, it likely overprinted and recrystallized older rocks). In the northwest, many rocks near Chiang Mai and Kanchanaburi are metamorphosed to [[amphibolite]] or [[epidote]] grade on the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]]. The region has a paragneiss-schist and anatectic-migmatic sequence. 

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
Early [[Paleozoic]] rocks are only known in western Thailand, such as sandstones on Tarutao Island in the Andaman Sea with [[Cambrian]] and [[Ordovician]] [[trilobite]] fossils. Together with non-fossil bearing strata on the mainland, they make up the Tarutao Group. Primarily sandstones, some make direct contact visible at the surface with underlying [[gneiss]]. 

[[Limestone]] commonly deposited in the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]], forming the Thung Song Group, with a large component of [[argillite]] in the upper and lower part of the group. There is also a [[shale]] horizon called the Ban Na Shale, interbedded with Ordovician limestone. The presence of shale suggests a deeper water environment in the Silurian. 
The Thong Pha Phum Group conformably overlies the Thung Song Group in the west with a thick sequence of non-fossil bearing clastic marine sedimentary rocks that likely deposited in a forearc basin. Volcanic activity was common in the [[Devonian]] and [[Carboniferous]] as limestone accumulated on a western facing continental margin (exposures of these rocks are visible at Petchabun-Loei in east-central Thailand). 

Carboniferous and [[Permian]] [[turbidite]] sequences overlie these groups in south, west and central Thailand. Thick sequences of clastic sediment in the Kaeng Krachan Formation extends from the center-west into Myanmar. Some geologists have interpreted pebbly diamictite mudstone and turbidites in the Mergui Group as glacial sediments, with possible origin in India or northwest Australia. One interpretation holds that the Mergui Group was thrust on top of the Shan-Thai Block from the west during the Mesozoic, forming a [[nappe]]. Extensional tectonics in the north led to mafic volcanic activity within the Shan-Thai Block in the Carboniferous, continuing into the [[Permian]]. Some red beds also formed during the same period. 

During the Permian, almost the entire region was submerged during a major [[marine transgression]]. Carbonates deposited in shallow, shelf seas and today form dramatic [[karst]] landscapes. The warm water Saraburi Group in the east has numerous fossils, while the Ratburi Group in the west does not. In peninsular Thailand, sandstone is predominant interfingered with Ratburi Group limestones. Along the western edge of the Khorat Plateau, a limestone dominated shelf sequence abuts turbidites and [[pyroclastic flow]] deposits. A magmatic arc around a west-dipping subduction zone produced intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks in the north around Lampang to the east of Chiang Mai. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=719-720}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
During the [[Triassic]], a major marine transgression flooded Thailand. Conglomerate is common at the base of units from this time period, overlain by limestone that thickens to the westward. East of Chiang Mai, the Lampang Group has marine shale, sandstone, limestone and conglomerate three kilometers thick, overlain by an additional two kilometers of [[flysch]]. Geologists have interpreted it as shallow-water deposition in a forearc basin over a west-dipping subduction zone. 

Marine conditions lasted into the [[Norian]], or as late as the [[Jurassic]] in the west. The Mae Moei Group is a major limestone unit in the northwest equivalent to the Lampang Group with Jurassic strata at the top and overlain by [[Cretaceous]] [[red beds]]. 

By contrast to the patterns of marine deposition, the Khorat Plateau in the northeast is underlain by Triassic-Cretaceous continental deposits. Offshore islands and the Cambodian border have numerous sandstones related to the plateau. With calc-alkaline volcanic rock at its base, the Khorat Plateau is diachronous giving the appearance that basin deposition moved further west through the [[Mesozoic]]. The Khorat Group is five kilometers thick in the northeast and holds occasional dinosaur, plant and bivalve fossils. Much of the deposition took place in a lake environment. The Khorat Group begins with 2.5 kilometers of red beds, overlain by light-colored sandstones, red beds and evaporites such as carallite, tachydrite, halite and sylvite. The [[carnallite]] zone is up to 95 meters thick and the halite deposit is one of the thickest on Earth. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=720}}

Thailand has intrusive [[granitoid]] everywhere but the Khorat Plateau. I- and S-type plutons are dominant along the border with Myanmar and extending to the Phuket Island. Typically, they are small and isolated with [[biotite]] and [[muscovite]]-rich granite as well as potassium feldspar megacrysts, [[hornblende]] and large mica-tourmaline or [[lepidolite]] [[pegmatites]]. S-type granites in this belt commonly have tin-tungsten mineralization. Triassic S-type granitoid batholiths, often associated with orthogneiss and migmatite, form a central belt in western Thailand the peninsula.
 
===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
[[Cenozoic]] sedimentary rocks are mainly found in low-lying areas in the north and west, but also at several areas in the south. In the north, graben formations filled with sediment two kilometers thick. For much of the Cenozoic, Thailand was comparatively flat until rapid uplift began in the north, accompanied by block faulting and [[horst and graben]] formation in the [[Pliocene]] and [[Pleistocene]], leaving valley floors to fill with gravel and sand. Large quantities of natural gas and some petroleum have been found in the blended terrestrial and marine sedimentary strata along the Andaman Sea coast, ranging in age from [[Oligocene]] to Pliocene. Marine influence is modest and common later in the sequence, which is up to eight kilometers thick. 

The Chao Paya Basin around Bangkok and Pitsanulok Basin in the north both have extensive [[Quaternary]] sedimentary cover from the last 2.5 million years. Based on aerial magnetic surveys and boreholes, geologists have inferred that the Chao Paya Basin is believed to be a composite graben with uneven underlying topography.

Throughout the Quaternary, as uplift continued sediments eroded off the rising highlands and deposited in low-lying areas. During the [[Pleistocene]] ice ages, the Gulf of Thailand resembled its present geography, although sea levels did rise and extend more than 100 kilometers north of Bangkok, leaving behind the 20 meter thick Bangkok Clay in the [[Holocene]]. An alkaline basalt province erupted across northern Thailand and into Cambodia and Vietnam, leaving behind small vents, plugs and flows. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=720-721}}

==Natural resource geology==
Thailand is a leading global producer of tin, almost exclusively from [[cassiterite]]. In a few locations, very small occurrences of malayaite and stannite—other examples of tin minerals—have been found. 

Cassiterite is found in quartz veins, skarn deposits, [[aplite]], [[pegmatite]] and greisenized granite intrusions, often with accessory minerals such as fluorite, muscovite, wolframite, columbite, tantalite, tourmaline, topaz, zircon and beryl. Sulfide minerals like chalcopyrite, pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena and bismuthinite are found in association with cassiterite in the north and south. Virtually all deposits display some form of hydrothermal formation. In the west and along the Malaysian border are tin-bearing granites. In fact, the Ranong-Phuket area near the Andaman Sea coast and the southern peninsula of Thailand produces 85 percent of its tin output. Onshore and offshore placer deposits are the key tin source. 

Additionally, Thailand has some production of gypsum, limestone, kaolin, sapphire, zircon, tantalite, columbite, antimony, lead, zinc, barite and fluorite. Examples include Jurassic sandstones with copper-uranium mineralization or Ordovician limestones with lead-zinc sulfides. Onshore and offshore [[Cenozoic]] basins have lignite, oil shale and some petroleum. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=725}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7012">==Toponymy==
Erroneously, it was once assumed that [[Oslo]] meant "the mouth of the Lo river", referring to a lost name of the river [[Alna]]. This apocryphal story is not only ungrammatical (the correct form would be Loaros, cf. Nidaros), but the name Lo is not recorded anywhere before [[Peder Claussøn Friis]] first used it in the same work in which he proposed this etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Peder_Clauss%C3%B8n_Friis/utdypning |title=Peder Claussøn Friis |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |language=Norwegian |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |last=Jørgensen |first=Jon G. |location=Oslo |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Lo is now believed to be a back-formation arrived at by Friis in support of his spurious etymology for Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Alna/elv_i_Oslo Alna – elv i Oslo], Store Norske Leksikon (in Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] the name was initially spelt "Ánslo" or "Áslo" and later "Óslo" or "Opslo".&lt;ref&gt;Aftenposten, 12 October 2014, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Osloby&gt;[http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Han-har-kartlagt-Christianias-karthistorie-7810898.html Han har kartlagt Christianias karthistorie], ''Osloby'', 8 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier spelling suggests that the first component ''ás'' might refer to the [[Ekeberg]] ridge southeast of the medieval town. The word ''ás'' (in modern Norwegian ''ås'') with the meaning 'ridge' or 'hill' is a common component in Norwegian place names (as in [[Ås, Akershus|Ås]] and [[Åsnes]]). In that case, it would read "the meadow beneath the ridge".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oslos historie|last=Bull|first=Edvard|publisher=Cappelen|year=1922|isbn=|location=Kristiania|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation could be "the meadow of the gods" (the word ''áss'' or ''ansu'' in [[Old Norse]] refers to the [[Æsir]]). The word ''ás'' with the meaning "god" is rare in place names, and Bull concludes that the name most likely has a topographical origin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Christiania (1624-1924)==
A fire in 1624 destroyed much of the medieval city, and when the city was rebuilt it was moved westwards to be closer to [[Akershus Fortress]]. King [[Christian IV of Denmark and Norway]] named the reborn city [[Oslo|Christiania]]. The old site east of Aker river was not abandoned however and the village of Oslo remained as suburb outside the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;http://snl.no/Oslo/historie read online May 31, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to an official spelling reform (that changed '''ch''' to '''k''') the form was changed to ''Kristiania'' in 1877. (The same year the city names ''Christiansand'' and ''Christiansund'' were changed to [[Kristiansand]] and [[Kristiansund]] - and the name of the county ''Christians Amt'' was changed to [[Oppland|Kristians Amt]].) The new form was used in all official documents and publications of the Norwegian State, but not by the municipality itself. The city continued to use the old form until 1897, then they also changed to ''Kristiania'' (without any formal or official decision).{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Change from "Kristiania" to "Oslo"==
After the 1624 establishment of Christiania near Akershus fortress, the original site of the town was rebuilt and served as suburb outside the city gates. This village east of the river had preserved the name "Oslo". A 1783 map, the oldest existing of the city, uses "Christiania" for the new town west of the river, while "Opslo" is used for the easternmost settlement near Ekeberg hill. A map published in 1827 also indicates "Opslo" as the village or suburb outside the city proper. A map published by ''[[Aftenposten]]'' in 1923 labels the eastern suburb as "Oslo" and the nearby port as "Oslo harbour".&lt;ref name=Osloby/&gt; After the 1859 and 1878 expansion of city borders to include the surrounding Aker municipality, the village of Oslo was included in Christiania municipality.&lt;ref name=Byleksikon&gt;''Oslo byleksikon''. Edited by Reidar Hanssen. Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire city was named "Oslo" by a law of 11 July 1924, effective 1 January 1925—a decision that caused much debate. The change was proposed in 1918 by 29 civil servants. ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' compiled a list of 28,000 signatures against the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Da-Kristiania-ble-Oslo-6940340.html Da Kristiania ble Oslo] Osloby/Aftenposten, 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigrid Undset]] wrote that she would be ashamed if the city would try to cheat and pretend to be its predecessor on the other side of the Aker river.&lt;ref&gt;Bård Alsvik: [http://www.byarkivet.oslo.kommune.no/OBA/tobias/tobiasartikler/tob2001-1_01.htm "Oslo leve!" - Om navneendringen fra Kristiania til Oslo], ''Tobias'' 1/2001, published by Oslo byarkiv (City of Oslo Archives).&lt;/ref&gt;

When the city in general now took up the name of Oslo, the eastern district of the city that had preserved the name became known simply as ''Gamlebyen'' "the Old Town of Oslo" in the borough (district) of ''[[Gamle Oslo]]'' "Old Oslo". The old square of Christian IV's city was named ''Christiania torv'' in 1958, and this name (with the old ch-form) is still in use on signs and maps.&lt;ref name=Byleksikon/&gt; Christian IV's city with straight streets and right angles is now known as ''Kvadraturen'' ("the Square") and covers large parts of modern Oslo's centre, in 2009 it was proposed to rename this area Christiania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.osloby.no/nyheter/Oslo-sentrum-blir-Kristiania-6609482.html|title=Oslo sentrum blir Kristiania|last=|first=|date=2009-02-12|work=Aftenposten/Osloby|access-date=2013-05-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A street in Gamlebyen was named "Oslo gate" ('Oslo street') when the name ''Oslo'' still was the name of a suburb in ''Kristiania''. The street name is still in use. "Oslo torg" (Oslo market square) is the old name for the centre of old Oslo at the intersection of Bispegata and Oslo gate, and was reintroduced by the city council in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Bjørvika og Middelalderbyen vegg i vegg|last=|first=|date=2016-01-13|work=Aftenposten|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
The city was referred to as Tigerstaden (the City of Tigers) by the author [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] around 1870, due to his perception of the city as a cold and dangerous place. This name has over the years achieved an almost official status, to the extent that the 1000-year anniversary was celebrated by a row of tiger sculptures around [[city hall]]. The prevalence of homeless and other beggars in more recent times led to the slight rewording of the nickname into Tiggerstaden (the City of Beggars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Vårløsning|last=|first=|date=2009-05-09|work=[[Dagbladet]]|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also completed a course of study at the Theological Hall of the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland|United Presbyterian Church]] in [[Edinburgh]], but did not go into a religious career.&lt;ref name="Obit"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hugh Robert Mill | title = Obituary: Sir John Scott Keltie | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 69 | issue = 3 | year = 1927 | pages = 281–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keltie later moved to [[London]] in 1871 to join [[Macmillan Publishers]], where in 1873 he became sub-editor of the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and began separately to write articles on geography for ''[[The Times]]''. In 1880, he was taken on as editor of ''[[The Statesman's Yearbook]]'' for Macmillan.&lt;ref name="Obit"/&gt;

In 1883, Keltie joined the Royal Geographical Society and quickly became heavily involved in its activities. He was later appointed its Inspector of Geographical Education in 1884, and undertook a thorough review of the state of geography education in the UK, producing an influential 150-page report. In 1885, he became the Society's librarian, and upon the death of [[Henry Walter Bates]] in 1892, succeeded him as Assistant Secretary of the Society (in effect its Secretary, as the official Secretary was a figurehead from the nobility). Among his first tasks was the relaunching of the ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'' as the ''[[Geographical Journal]]'' in 1893, in order to appeal to a wider audience. He was officially given the title of Secretary in 1896.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

Keltie retired as Secretary of the Society in 1915 and was succeeded by [[Arthur Robert Hinks]], though he remained as joint editor (with Hinks) of the ''Geographical Journal'' until 1917.

He died in London in 1927.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

==Awards==
Keltie received various awards during his long career. In 1917, he was presented the Society's [[Victoria Medal (geography)|Victoria Medal]]. He also received the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] of the [[American Geographical Society]], and the gold medals of the Paris and Royal Scottish Geographical Societies.&lt;ref name="Obit" /&gt;

In 1918, Keltie was made a [[Knight Bachelor]].&lt;ref name="kt" /&gt;

==In popular culture==
Keltie was portrayed by [[Clive Francis]] in the 2016 film ''[[The Lost City of Z (film)|The Lost City of Z]]''.

The '''Latin Union''' was an [[international organization]] of nations that used [[Romance languages]] that existed as a functional institution from 1983 to 2012.  Its aim was to protect, project, and promote the common cultural heritage of [[Italic peoples|Latin peoples]] and unifying identities of the [[Latin]], and Latin-influenced, world. It was created in 1954 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and its membership rose from 12 to 36 states, including countries in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unilat.org/SG/Organisation/Presentation/EtatsMembres/index.es.asp |title=Unión Latina; Estados miembros |accessdate=2009-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228203150/http://www.unilat.org/SG/Organisation/Presentation/EtatsMembres/index.es.asp |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official names of the Latin Union were: '''{{lang|fr|Union Latine}}''' in  [[French language|French]], '''{{lang|it|Unione Latina}}''' in [[Italian language|Italian]], '''{{lang|pt|União Latina}}''' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], '''{{lang|ro|Uniunea Latină}}''' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]],'''{{lang|es|Unión Latina}}''' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and '''{{lang|ca|Unió Llatina}}''' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Official languages==
The official languages of the Latin Union were [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese were used as working languages. All the texts of general diffusion were translated into these four languages, with some also going into Romanian and Catalan.

==Organization==
The Union was composed of three main bodies, namely, the Congress, the Executive Council, and the General Secretariat.

===Congress===
The Congress, which consisted of the representatives of all the Member States, met in ordinary assembly every two years. Its main functions were

* to adopt the budget,
* to define the general direction of the Union,
* to receive the new Member States formally, and
* to elect and appoint different Member States to be the Presidents, Vice-Presidents, and members of the sub-organisations of the Union.

A President and two Vice-Presidents were also elected by the Congress. [[Oleg Serebrian]] from the [[Republic of Moldova]] was the last President.

There were also two auxiliary bodies of the Congress, namely, the Commission of Adhesions and the Commission of Candidacies.

* The Commission of Adhesions was composed of 10 Member States and was responsible for promoting the adherence of all the Member States of the Union.
* The Commission of Candidacies was composed of 9 Member States and was responsible for examining the validity of the candidacies, taking account of the geographical and linguistic-cultural division.

===Executive Council===
The Executive Council was the executive branch of the Union. It consisted of 12 Member States, which were elected by the Congress every four years, and led by a President and two Vice-Presidents, which were also elected by the Congress. 

There were also two auxiliary commissions sub-ordinated to the Executive Council: 
* The Commission of Finance and Programmes
* The Commission of Statues

===General Secretariat===
The Latin Union was directed by a Secretary-General appointed every four years by the Congress. The Secretary was in charge of the execution of the programmes and implemented the decisions made by the Congress and the Executive Council in the matter of budget and general direction. [[Jose Luis Dicenta Ballester]] was at one time Secretary-General of the Union.

Subordinated to the Secretary-General, there were 4 directors:
* Director of Administration and Finance
* Director of Culture and Communication
* Director of Promotion and Education of the Languages
* Director of Terminology and Industry of the Language

===Finance===
The finance of the Union was mainly supported by the obligatory contributions from the Member States. For some activities, the Union may have collaborated with other public or private institutions.

The technology company '''Google''' "prides itself on being a playful company" and has added '''Easter eggs''' and [[List of Google April Fools' Day jokes|April Fools' Day jokes and hoaxes]] into many of [[List of Google products|its products and services]], such as [[Google Search]], [[YouTube]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] since at least 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Being A Teen Hacker.: A Beginners Guide To Ethical Hacking &amp; Computer Security Awareness. VOL-I|page=95|author=Hariom Choudhary|date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] are hidden features or messages, [[inside jokes]], and cultural references inserted into media. They are often well hidden, so that users find it gratifying when they discover them, helping form bonds between [[Google]] and its users. The Easter eggs are sometimes created by employees during their [[20% time]]. Google avoids adding Easter eggs to popular search pages, as they do not want to negatively impact usability.&lt;ref name=readwrite&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Jon|title=How A Google Engineer Built A Universe In An Easter Egg - ReadWrite|url=https://readwrite.com/2012/10/05/how-a-google-engineer-built-a-universe-in-an-easter-egg/|website=ReadWrite|access-date=December 22, 2017|date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hidden meaning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wiley|first1=Jon|title=Hidden Meaning|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/articles/hidden-meaning.html|website=Think with Google|access-date=March 25, 2017|language=en-gb|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Google Search}}
{{A note}} As Google searches are [[case insensitive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.labnol.org/internet/search/case-sensitive-google-search/6279/|website=labnol.org|title=Perform Case Sensitive Search with Google|first=Amit|last=Agarwal|date=July 15, 2012|access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; search terms are listed in [[lower case]] except where case sensitivity is explicitly referenced.

A Google web search for:
* "a long time ago in a galaxy far far away" resulted in the same tilted, scrolling style that the introductions to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies were presented in.&lt;ref name="Mashable Taylor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=Spectacular Google easter egg pays homage to ''Star Wars'' opening crawl|website=Mashable|date=November 24, 2015|url=http://mashable.com/2015/11/23/google-long-time-ago/|access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the music,&lt;ref name="Mashable Taylor" /&gt; which was muted but could be heard by clicking on or selecting the muted speaker icon on the page.

* Since the version 2.3 ([[Android Gingerbread|Gingerbread]]) of Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]] an Easter egg containing an animation has been hidden. The Easter egg can be accessed through the "Settings" application, in the "About phone" section, by repeatedly tapping the "Android version" section. The animation is different in every version of the OS.&lt;ref&gt;TDW. [https://www.thedigitalworm.com/google-gravity-search-tricks/ "Google Gravity, Anit-Gravity and Many More Google Search Tricks"], The Digital Worm (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

** In 3.0 – 3.2.6 ([[Android Honeycomb|Honeycomb]]) there is a blue [[honeybee]]. Below it, there is the text "REZZZZZZZ…" as a reference to ''[[Tron: Legacy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
** In 4.0 – 4.0.4 ([[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Ice Cream Sandwich]]) there is [[pixel art]] of an [[ice cream sandwich]] android. Long-pressing it will result in many ice cream sandwich androids flying across the screen, dubbed the "nyan droid" as they are a tribute to [[Nyan Cat]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
** In 4.1 – 4.3.1 ([[Android Jelly Bean|Jelly Bean]]) a red jelly bean appears, which if pressed will show its face along with the [[Operating system|OS]] version. If this jelly bean is then long-pressed, an interactive jelly bean mini-game will appear. This is where one can fling the jelly beans around.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
** In 4.4 ([[Android KitKat|KitKat]]) a rotating letter "K" appears, which if continually tapped turns into the text "Android" in the styling of a KitKat logo. If the Android logo is then long-pressed or twisted with two fingers a tile interface, known as "a daydream" called "Dessert Case", loads with icons from all previous versions of Android. It appears to be a mock of the [[Windows Phone]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Secret Easter Eggs and Daydreams in Google Android Devices – AskVG|url=http://www.askvg.com/hidden-secret-easter-eggs-and-daydreams-in-google-android-devices/|website=askvg|access-date=February 22, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 5.x ([[Android Lollipop|Lollipop]]) and 6.x ([[Android Marshmallow|Marshmallow]]), a colored circle appears (or a circle with a stylized M inside in Marshmallow). If continuously tapped, it will turn into a [[lollipop]] with the text ''lollipop'' inside (or the M changes into a [[marshmallow]] in 6.x). Tapping the circle changes the color. When long-pressed, a game of ''[[Flappy Bird]]'' starts with the Android mascot instead. In Marshmallow, tapping the plus sign adds extra players (up to five), which can be controlled by the user or other players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidauthority.com/android-marshmallow-easter-egg-flappy-bird-game-with-multiplayer-647378/|title=The Android 6.0 Marshmallow Easter egg is another Flappy Bird-style game, with a twist|work=Android Authority|access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Android Daydream: How to Setup and Unlock Hidden Features|url=http://techmunchie.com/a-guide-to-android-daydream-how-to-setup-and-unlock-hidden-features|website=Techmunchie|access-date=May 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527022012/http://techmunchie.com/a-guide-to-android-daydream-how-to-setup-and-unlock-hidden-features|archivedate=May 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 7.0 ([[Android Nougat|Nougat]]), an "N" appears, which will enable another Easter egg if tapped. This Easter egg, titled "Android Neko" as a reference to the cat collecting mobile game ''[[Neko Atsume]]'', can be accessed from the Quick Settings menu, and allows the user to create virtual treats, which will eventually attract kittens. The kittens can be viewed in a gallery-style screen. Additionally, long-pressing on the aforementioned "N" repeatedly will alternate between displaying the [[no symbol]] and the cat face emojis, respectively toggling the Easter egg on and off. "No" and "cat" is a [[mondegreen]] for "nougat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kellen|title=There is More to This Android N DP5 Easter Egg and It Involves Catching Cats (Updated)|url=http://www.droid-life.com/2016/07/18/android-n-dp5-easter-egg-involves-catching-cats/|website=Droid Life|access-date=April 22, 2017|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 8.0 ([[Android Oreo|Oreo]]), instead of the normal way of going to the Easter egg, heading to System &gt; About Phone and tapping on the Android version repeatedly will launch the Easter egg. An orange circle appears, representing an "O" for Oreo. Long pressing on the center will open a blue screen representing a sea with an octopus floating around. The "O" in octopus represents Oreo while the eight legs on the octopus represent the version (8.0). The octopus can be moved by dragging the head around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John McCann|title=Android Oreo: 10 things you need to know|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-android-oreo|website=TechRadar|}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** In 9.0 ([[Android Pie|Pie]]), the Easter egg is found by going to System &gt; About Phone &gt; Android version and then tapping three times on the Android version on the next screen. A white, extended "P" will then appear, usually with concentric colored circles disappearing into the "P". Each time the Easter egg is invoked, it displays different colors. The animation can be pinched to zoom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Gao|title=Android P feature spotlight: The Easter egg is animated and way too colorful|url=https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/07/android-p-feature-spotlight-easter-egg-animated-way-colorful/|website=AndroidPolice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "webdriver torso" will return the results but with a red background and a blue rectangle around some videos. It also says "&lt;code&gt;aqua.flv – Slide 000[0–9]&lt;/code&gt;" at the bottom left of the page. This is a reference to the [[Webdriver Torso]] mystery.

This '''list of birds of Great Britain''' comprises all [[bird]] species which have been recorded in a wild state in [[Great Britain]]. In general the [[British avifauna|avifauna of Britain]] is similar to that of the rest of Europe, although with fewer breeding species. There are 600 species of birds on the British list {{as of|2018|1|22|lc=yes}}, the latest additions being the [[Dalmatian pelican]] (''Pelecanus crispus'') and [[eastern Orphean warbler]] (''Sylvia crassirostris'').&lt;ref name= Bou2018&gt;{{cite web |date= |title= British List announcements |url= https://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/recent-announcements/ |publisher= British Ornithologists' Union |access-date=29 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The species order and scientific names used here follow that of the official British list, maintained by the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] (BOU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/ |title= The British List|author= British Ornithologists’ Union|date= 2013 |journal=Ibis |volume=155 |pages=635–676 |doi=10.1111/ibi.12069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions relating to the British list are published by the [[British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee]] (BOURC) in its annual reports in the ''[[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]'', the journal of the BOU. These reports were formerly geographically based and included the whole of the British Isles, but records for the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are now published by their own ornithological associations. Records from the [[Isle of Man]], although adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society, continue to be published in the BOU reports.&lt;ref name= bou&gt;{{cite journal | last= Dudley | first= Steve P | last2= Gee |first2=Mike |last3=Kehoe|first3=Chris|last4=Melling|first4=Tim M|last5=The British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) | year= 2006| title= The British List:A Checklist of Birds of Britain (7th edition) | journal= Ibis | volume= 148 | pages= 526–563 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118619822/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BOU uses the following categories for British bird species:&lt;ref name= bou/&gt;
*A: species which have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.
*B: species which were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.
*C: species that, although originally introduced by man, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.
Categories A, B and C constitute the Official British List. Birds can be listed in more than one category, for example the [[Canada goose]] has a large introduced population, but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, so it meets the criteria for categories A and C. Two further categories are used for record keeping only.
*D: species that would otherwise appear in Categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.
*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are thought not to be self-sustaining.
Birds in Categories D and E are not on the official British list and are not included here. A sixth category, Category F, is being compiled to include species recorded before 1800 including fossil species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/|title= Species categories|author= BOURC|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species listed as '''rare''' here are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the [[British Birds Rarities Committee]]. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.

Because of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. There are also a number of species, such as the [[Common pied oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], that are resident in this island, but migrants elsewhere. Also because of its position, Britain receives a number of vagrants from [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. Some American [[gull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[wader]]s are regular enough not to be considered rare. These include the [[ring-billed gull]], [[surf scoter]] and [[pectoral sandpiper]].

==Ducks, geese and swans==
'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]

The swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and [[beak|bills]] which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The family is well represented in Britain, especially in winter when large numbers visit from [[Greenland]], [[Scandinavia]] and [[Russia]]. There are about 160 species worldwide with 55 in Britain.

==Divers==
'''Order''': [[loon|Gaviiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[loon|Gaviidae]]

Divers are aquatic birds the size of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly adequately but are almost helpless on land, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body. They feed on [[fish]] and other aquatic animals. There are five species worldwide, all of which occur in Britain.

During the [[Cold War]], when the area was part of [[East Germany]], the eastern part of the [[Zingst]] peninsula on the German [[Baltic Sea]] coast in [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] was a restricted military area, used for meteorological rocket experiments. Various experiments were conducted between 1970 and 1992 in an area known as Sundi Meadows. There were 5 launches of the Polish rocket [[Meteor (rocket)|Meteor 1E]] in the early 1970s. On 21 October 1988 launches of Russian of the [[MMR06|MMR06-M]] type rockets began. The restricted area measured just 23.6 kilometres by 25.5 kilometres. As the rockets reached heights up to 80 kilometres, the launch angle of the unguided rockets had to be determined with an accuracy of 2 degrees in order to prevent an impact outside the restricted area.

The first launches of MMR06-M rockets were not successful due to various technical difficulties. The first successful launch with a meteorological payload occurred on 12 April 1989. Additional launches continued for a short time after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and German reunification (3 October 1990). They were finally ended on 19 December 1990 for safety and technological reasons.

Nevertheless, between 14 February and 10 April 1992 a total of 19 Russian rockets of the MMR06-M type were launched at Zingst, of which 6 were successful. Although further rockets were still available for testing, the launches of MMR06-M rockets in Zingst were stopped in April 1992 because of the removal of [[German Army|German Federal Armed Forces]] from the place.

This article includes two versions of the '''list of countries by crude [[mortality rate]]'''.

== Methodology ==
Crude mortality rate refers to the number of deaths over a given period divided by the person-years lived by the population over that period. It is usually expressed in units of deaths per 1,000 individuals per year(&lt;big&gt;‰&lt;/big&gt;).

The first list is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) "2011 annual statistics". It contains the crude death rate of 236 countries and territories in 2011.

The second list is based on [[CIA World Factbook]] 2014 estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2066rank.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent territories and not fully recognized states are not ranked.

'''Maramureș''' ({{lang-ro|Maramureș}} {{IPA-ro|maraˈmureʃ|pron|Ro-Maramureș.ogg}}; {{lang-uk|Мармарощина}}, ''Marmaroshchyna'') is a geographical, historical and cultural region in northern [[Romania]] and western [[Ukraine]]. It is situated on the northeastern [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], along the upper [[Tisza River|Tisa River]]; it covers the Maramureș Depression and the surrounding Carpathian mountains.

Alternatively, the name Maramureș is used for the [[Maramureș County]] of Romania, which contains the southern section of the historical region.

==Name in other languages==
Alternative names for Maramureș include {{lang-uk|Мармарощина}} (Marmaroshchyna), {{lang-ru|Мараморош}} (''Maramoroš''), {{lang-hu|Máramaros}}, {{lang-de|Maramuresch}}, {{lang-tr|Marmaroş}}, and {{lang-la|Marmatia}}.

==Geography==
Maramureș is a valley enclosed by mountains Oaș, Gutâi, Țibleș and Rodnei to the west and south, [[Maramureș Mountains]] and Ukrainian Carpathians ("Wooded Carpathians") to the east and north, with a thin opening at [[Khust]].  Several dozen small mountain rivers and creeks flow into the river [[Tisza|Tisa]]. It is forested and not easily accessible.

The limits of the region are between the parallels of 47°33' N and 40°02' N and the meridians of 23°15' E and 25°03' E. Maramureș represents one of the largest depressions in the Carpathians, covering an area of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km².

Its length from [[Khust]] to [[Prislop Pass]] is about 150&amp;nbsp;km and width from North to South is up to 80&amp;nbsp;km.

The main mountain passes linking Maramureș with the neighboring regions are high and in the past were hardly accessible in the winter. Prislop Pass (1,414 m high) links the region in the east towards Moldavia, Dealul Ștefăniței (1,254 m) in the south towards Transylvania, Pintea Pass (987 m) towards Baia Mare, and Fărgău (587 m) in the west towards Oaș Country, while Frasini Pass ([[Yasinia]]; 931 m) links the region in the north to [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]].

The mountains surrounding this region occupy more than half of the area. A few peaks reach above 2,000 m, such as Pietrosul (2,303 m) in the Rodnei Mountains to the south and Hovârla (2,061 m) in Muntele Negru (Cernahora) to the north.

The heavy forested mountains sustain many protected species of plants, such as [[Taxus baccata|yew]] (''Taxus baccata''), [[larch]] (''Larix decidua''), [[Swiss pine]] (''Pinus cembra''), [[edelweiss]] (''Leontopodium alpinum''); and animals, such as [[lynx]] (''Lynx lynx''), [[chamois]] (''Rupicapra rupicapra''), [[alpine marmot]] (''Marmota marmota''), [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), and [[capercaillie]] (''Tetrao urogallus'').

The last [[wisent]] from present-day Romania territory, a symbol of Maramureş, was hunted to extinction in 1852. Lostriţa, a local variety of salmon, still live in the mountain rivers.

Several protected areas have been created in Maramureș. Rodnei Mountains National Park was designated in 1930, Maramureș Mountains Natural Park in 2004, and there are many other caves, gorges, cliff formations, and lakes which are officially-protected areas.

==History==
[[File:Maramures Josephinische Landesaufnahme 1782-1785 Background.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Máramaros County|Marmaroscher Comitat]] on the map of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]], 1780-84. The present-day borders of Romania are projected to the historical map.]]
[[File:Marmatia.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Máramaros County]] (''Hungarian'': Máramaros vármegye; ''Romanian'': Comitatul Maramureş; ''Ukrainian'': Комітат Марамарош), 1905]]
{{Main|History of Maramureș}}
In ancient times, this area was settled by [[Celts]], [[Dacians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. In the first century BC, it was part of the [[Dacian Kingdom]] under [[Burebista]], while in the early Middle Ages, it was ruled by the [[Huns|Hunnic Empire]], the [[Gepids|Kingdom of the Gepids]], the [[Pannonian Avars|Kingdom of the Avars]], the [[White Croatia]] and the [[Kievan Rus']].

The territory was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (medieval)|Kingdom of Hungary]] from the 11th century and was nominally divided between the [[Gyepű]] border region, [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|comitatus]] of [[Szatmár]] and comitatus of [[Borsova]]. Later, the whole region was included into the comitatus of [[Máramaros]]. Initially, the inhabitants of the region were allowed to preserve their native political organization, the ''Voevodates'', which formed many small autonomous areas. The King long struggled{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} to convince the [[Voivode]]s to accept the title of [[Count]], with the implied losing independence in political and financial matters. During the [[Middle Ages]], the people in many mountain villages, where each family by definition had a considerable domain, were called ''nameşi'', meaning free peasants taking pride in their family (the origin of the word is disputed, in the Kingdom of Hungary, free people possessing land were called "nemes" in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''neam'' means extended family).

In the 16th century, medieval Kingdom of Hungary was invaded and destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire]], and area came under administration of the semi-independent Ottoman [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] and later (in the end of the 17th century) under administration of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (later known as the [[Austrian Empire]]). During Habsburg administration, region was firstly part of the Habsburg Principality of Transylvania, but was later (in 1732) included into the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]]. In 1867, the Austrian Empire was transformed into the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the region was included into the [[Transleithania]] or [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] part of the Monarchy.

After the [[First World War]], the region was divided between Romania and [[Czechoslovakia]] at the territory of [[Hutsul Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://tyzhden.ua/Publication/7431 Hutsul coup]. [[The Ukrainian Week]]. November 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1940 the whole area became part of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] again and was controlled during World War II until 1944. After [[World War II]], the southern section remained within the Romanian borders and is now part of [[Maramureș County]]; the [[Northern Maramuresh|northern section]] was incorporated into the Soviet Union and is now part of [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] of independent Ukraine.

==People==
In the [[Maramureş County|southern area]], the majority of the population are [[Romanians]]. There are also some [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], [[Rusyns]] ([[Ukrainians]]), [[Zipser Germans]], [[Jews]], and [[Romani people|Roma]]. In the [[Northern Maramuresh|northern area]], the majority are [[Rusyns|Ruthenes]]{{cn|date=July 2014}}, with smaller Romanian, Hungarian and German communities.

In the northern area most people speak the [[Rusyn language|Ruthene language]]{{cn|date=July 2014}}, while in the southern area most speak Romanian, which is why the region was split into two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maramureş region|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CM%5CA%5CMaramureK1region.htm|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine|publisher=Mykola Pavliuk, Arkadii Zhukovsky|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=July 2014}} Since the 1940s there have been villages cut in two by the state border. There are some villages in the north (within Ukraine) that have a sizeable Romanian population, as well as some villages in Romania that have a sizeable Ukrainian population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15923">'''Nicholas John Spykman''' (pronounced "Speak-man", 13 October 1893 – 26 June 1943) was an [[United States|American]] [[political scientist]] who was one of the founders of the classial [[realism (international relations)|realist]] school in American foreign policy, transmitting [[Eastern European]] political thought to the United States. A [[Sterling Professor]] of International Relations, teaching as part of the Institute for International Studies at [[Yale University]], one of his prime concerns was making his students [[geography|geographically]] literate, as geopolitics was impossible without geographic understanding.

His work on geopolitics and geostrategy led him to be to known as the "[[people known as the father or mother of something|godfather of]] [[containment]]."

==Early life==
Spykman was born on 13 October 1893 in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1943/06/27/85107840.html?pageNumber=33 | title=Dr. N. J. Spykman of Yale Dies at 49 | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 27, 1943 | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Delft University]] and the [[University of Cairo]].&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt;

==Career==
He worked as a journalist in various parts of the world during much of the 1910s and also served as a diplomatic assistant for the [[Netherlands]] in [[Egypt]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssr-1943"&gt;{{cite journal | title="Nicholas J. Spykman 1893–1943 | journal=Sociology and Social Research | volume=28 | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=muMbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Nicholas+Spykman%22+%22university+of+california%22&amp;dq=%22Nicholas+Spykman%22+%22university+of+california%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXp9n05NTOAhWFeCYKHQPrDPUQ6AEIKjAB 312]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then came to the United States around 1920 to enter a doctoral program at the [[University of California]], where he received a bachelor's degree in 1921, a master's degree in 1922, and a Ph.D. in 1923.&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt;  The subject of his dissertation, which he subsequently revised for publication, was [[Georg Simmel]].&lt;ref name="crit-geo"&gt;{{cite book | title=Critical Geopolitics: The Politics of Writing Global Space | author=Gearóid Ó Tuathail | page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4z31O4RWg0C&amp;pg=PA50 50]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then was an instructor in political science and sociology there from 1923 to 1925.&lt;ref name="crit-geo"/&gt; He became a naturalized [[citizen of the United States]] in 1928.&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt;

==Professor==
In 1925, he came to [[Yale University]], where he was an assistant professor of international relations. He became a full professor in 1928&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt; and the chair of the university's department of international relations in 1935.&lt;ref name="crit-geo"/&gt;  Also in 1935, he was a co-founder of the [[Yale Institute of International Studies]] and was its first director.&lt;ref name="nyt-spykman-obit"/&gt; He held that position until 1940, when he became ill and relinquished it.

==Author==
Spykman published two books on foreign policy. 

''America's Strategy in World Politics'' was published in 1942, soon after the entry of the United States into [[World War II]]. Concerned with the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]], he argued that [[isolationism]], which relied on the oceans to protect the United States ("[[Western Hemisphere|hemispheric]]" or "quarter defense"), was bound to fail. His object was to prevent another US retreat, as what occurred after World War I. [[Isaiah Bowman]] commented in 1942, "On grounds of merit and public value ''America’s Strategy in World Politics'' should be read in not less than a million American home. Every government official responsible for policy should read it once a year for the next twenty years—even if he may not agree with some of the remedies proposed."&lt;ref&gt;"Political Geography of Power," ''Geographical Review'', 32/1, (1942): p 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Geography of the Peace'' was published the year after Spykman's death.  He explained his geostrategy and argued that the balance of power in [[Eurasia]] directly affected US security.

In his writings on geography and foreign policy, Spykman was somewhat of a [[environmental determinism|geographical determinist]]. Since geography was "the most fundamentally conditioning factor because of its relative permanence," it is of primary relevance in analyzing a state's potential foreign policy.

==Death==
He died of [[cancer]] on 26 June 1943, at the age of 49, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

==Personal life==
He was married to the children's novelist [[E. C. Spykman]].

== Geostrategic ideas ==
He could be considered as a disciple and critic of both geostrategists [[Alfred Mahan]], of the [[United States Navy]], and [[Halford Mackinder]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] geographer.  Spykman's work is based on assumptions similar to Mackinder, the unity of world politics and the unity of the world sea, but extends it to include the unity of the air.  The exploration of the entire world means that the foreign policy of any nation will affect more than its immediate neighbors; it will affect the alignment of nations throughout the world's regions.  [[Navigation|Maritime]] mobility opened up the possibility of a new geopolitical structure: the overseas [[empire]].

Spykman adopts Mackinder's divisions of the world but renames some:
*the Heartland
*the Rimland (analogous to Mackinder's "inner or marginal crescent")
*the Offshore Islands &amp; Continents (Mackinder's "outer or insular crescent")

=== Heartland ===

At the same time, even if he gives credit to the strategic importance of maritime space like Mackinder,{{clarify|date=February 2017}} he does not see it as a region that will be unified by powerful [[transportation]] or [[communication]] infrastructure in the near future. As such, it will not be in a position to compete with US [[sea power]]. Spykman agrees that the Heartland offers a uniquely-defensive position, but that is all Spykman grants its occupier.

While the [[USSR]] encompassed a great expanse of land, its [[arable land]] remained in a small portion of its territory, mostly in the West. Indeed, the Soviet's raw materials were largely located to the West of the [[Ural Mountains]] as well. Since the political and material center of gravity was in the Western part of the USSR, Spykman sees little possibility of the Soviets exerting much power in [[Central Asia]].

Still, the Soviet Union was to remain the greatest land power in Asia and could be a peacekeeper or a problem.

=== Rimland ===

The [[Rimland]] (Mackinder's "Inner or Marginal Crescent")  sections:
* the [[Europe]]an [[coast]] land;     
* the [[Arabian]]-[[Middle Eastern]] [[desert]] land; and,
* the [[Asia]]tic [[monsoon]] land.

While Spykman accepts the first two as defined, he rejects the simple grouping  the Asian countries into one "monsoon land." [[India]], the [[Indian Ocean]] [[littoral]], and the [[culture of Indi]] had a geography and [[civilization]] separate from the [[China|Chinese]] lands.

The Rimland's defining characteristic is that it is an intermediate region, lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers. As the amphibious buffer zone between the land powers and sea powers, it must defend itself from both sides, the cause of its fundamental security problems. Spykman's conception of the Rimland bears greater resemblance to [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s "debated and debatable zone" than to Mackinder's Inner or Marginal Crescent.

The Rimland has great importance because of its demographic weight, natural resources, and industrial development. Spykman sees that its importance to be the reason that the Rimland will be crucial to containing the Heartland, but Mackinder had believed that the Outer or Insular Crescent would be the most important factor in containing the Heartland.

=== Offshore continents ===

There are two offshore [[continent]]s flanking [[Eurasia]]: [[Africa]] and [[Australia]]. Spykman sees both continents' geopolitical status as determined respectively by the state of control over the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the "Asiatic Mediterranean." Neither has ever been the seat of significant power; chaos prevents Africa from harnessing the resources of its regions, and Australia has too little arable territory.

Other than the two continents, there are offshore islands of significance are Britain, [[Japan]] and the [[New World]], buffered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]].

=== Eurasian dynamics ===

Again, Spykman differs from Mackinder, who sees Eurasian wars as historically pitting the Heartland against the sea powers for control of the rimland, establishing a land power-sea power opposition.  Spykman states that historically, battles have pitted either Britain and Rimland allies against [[Russia]] and its Rimland allies or Britain and Russia together against a dominating Rimland power. In other words, the Eurasian struggle was not the sea powers containing the Heartland but the prevention of any power from ruling the Rimland.

Spykman disagrees with Mackinder's famous dictum:
:''Who controls eastern Europe rules the Heartland;''
:''Who controls the Heartland rules the World Island; and''
:''Who rules the World Island rules the World. ''

He refashions it thus:
:''Who controls the Rimland rules Eurasia;''
:''Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world.''

Therefore, British, Russian, and US power would play the key roles in controlling the European litoral and there the essential power relations of the world.

=== US strategic goals ===

Spykman thought that it was in the American interests to leave [[Germany]] strong after World War II to be able to counter Russia's power. Strategically, there was no difference between Germany dominating all the way to the Ural or Russia controlling all the way to Germany, and as both scenarios were equally threatening to the US.

Spykman predicted that Japan would lose the [[Pacific War]] and that China and Russia would remain to struggle against eac other over boundaries. He also forecast the rise of China, becoming the dominant power in Asia and that the US would thus take responsibility for Japan's defense.

Spykman was opposed to [[European integration]] and argued that US interests favored balanced power in Europe, rather than integrated power. The US was fighting a war against Germany to prevent Europe's conquest, and it would not make sense to [[federation|federalize]] or to unify Europe after a war that had been fought to preserve balance.

==Legacy==
[[John Foster Dulles]] and the founders of the containment strategy would borrow heavily from Spykman, as well as Mackinder, when forging the American [[Cold War]] strategy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Quotations ==

*"Geography is the most fundamental factor in foreign policy because it is the most permanent."
:—from ''The Geography of the Peace''

*"Plans for far-reaching changes in the character of international society are an [[intellectual]] by-product of all great wars."
:&amp;mdash;from ''America's Strategy in World Politics''

*"There are not many instances in history which show great and powerful states creating [[military alliance|alliance]]s and [[international organization|organization]]s to limit their own strength. States are always engaged in curbing the force of some other state. The truth of the matter is that states are interested only in a balance which is in their favor. Not an equilibrium, but a generous margin is their objective. There is no real security in being just as strong as a potential enemy; there is security only in being a little stronger. There is no possibility of action if one's strength is fully checked; there is a chance for a positive foreign policy only if there is a margin of force which can be freely used. Whatever the theory and rationalization, the practical objective is the constant improvement of the state's own relative power position. The balance desired is the one which neutralizes other states, leaving the home state free to be the deciding force and the deciding voice."
:&amp;mdash;from ''America's Strategy in World Politics''

*"[A] political equilibrium is neither a gift of the gods nor an inherently stable condition. It results from the active intervention of man, from the operation of political forces. States cannot afford to wait passively for the happy time when a miraculously achieved balance of power will bring peace and security. If they wish to survive, they must be willing to go to war to preserve a balance against the growing [[hegemony|hegemonic]] power of the period."
:&amp;mdash;from ''America's Strategy in World Politics''

*"Nations which renounce the power struggle and deliberately choose impotence will cease to influence international relations either for evil or good."
:&amp;mdash;from ''America's Strategy in World Politics''

*"The facts of location do not change. The significant of such facts changes with every shift in the means of communication, in routes of communication, in the technique of war, and in the centers of world power, and the full meaning of a given location can be obtained only by considering the specific area in relations to two systems of reference: a geographic system of reference from which we derive the facts of location, and a historical system of reference by which we evaluate those facts."
:&amp;mdash;from "Geography and Foreign Policy I", ''American Political Science Review'', Vol XXXII, No. 1 (February 1938), p. 29.

'''North America''' is a [[continent]] entirely within the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and almost all within the [[Western Hemisphere]]; it is also considered by some to be a northern [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=britannica-northamerica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America|title = North America|publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate = 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the west and south by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the southeast by [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]].

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers&lt;!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --&gt; (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the [[earth|earth's]] land area and about 4.8% of its total surface.
North America is the third largest continent by area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nalandst.htm|title=North America Land Forms and Statistics|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of continents by population|fourth]] by population after Asia, Africa, and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nafacts.htm|title=North America Fast Facts|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 independent states]], or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably the [[Caribbean]]) are included.

North America was reached by its [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first human populations]] during the [[last glacial period]], via crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic or Meso-Indian]] period). The [[Classic stage]] spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The [[Pre-Columbian era]] ended in 1492, and the [[transatlantic migrations]]—the arrival of European settlers during the [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kinds of interactions between [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] and their descendants.

European influences are strongest in the northern parts of the continent while indigenous and African influences are relatively stronger in the south.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Because of the history of colonialism, most North Americans speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect [[Western civilization|Western traditions]].

== Name ==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
[[File:Historisch Nordamerika.jpg|thumb|Map of North America, from 1621]]
[[The Americas]] are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] by the German cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626894/Amerigo-Vespucci |title= Amerigo Vespucci |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first [[Europe]]an to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller produced a world map, in which he placed the word "America" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book ''Cosmographiae Introductio'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bOg4Nroos4C |title=The Cosmographiæ Introductio of Martin Waldseemüller in Facsimile |others=Translated by Edward Burke and Mario E. Cosenza, introduction by Joseph Fischer and Franz von Wieser |editor-last=Herbermann |editor-first=Charles George |place=New York |publisher=The United States Catholic Historical Society |year=1907 |page=9 |quote={{lang-la|"Quarta pars per Americum Vesputium (ut in sequentibus audietur) inventa est, quam non video, cur quis jure vetet, ab Americo inventore sagacis ingenii viro Amerigen quasi Americi terram sive Americam dicendam, cum et Europa et Asia a mulieribus sua sortita sint nomina."}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|la|... ab Americo inventore ... quasi Americi terram sive Americam}} (from Americus the discoverer ... as if it were the land of Americus, thus America).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Waldseemüller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its feminine form "America", following the examples of "Europa", "Asia" and "Africa".

Later, other mapmakers extended the name ''America'' to the northern continent, In 1538, [[Gerard Mercator]] used ''America'' on his map of the world for all the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html |title=The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves |author=Jonathan Cohen |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from "Amerigo Vespucci" could be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=John |authorlink=John Lloyd (producer) |last2=Mitchinson |first2=John |title=The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=978-0-307-39491-0 |page=95 |quote=New countries or continents were never named after a person's first name, but always after the second ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the "Amerrique" mountains of Central America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the ''Amerrique'' mountains of [[Central America]], which connected his discoveries to those of [[Christopher Columbus]].

[[Alfred Hudd|Alfred E. Hudd]] proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named [[Richard Amerike]] from [[Bristol]], who is believed to have financed [[John Cabot]]'s voyage of discovery from England to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient [[Visigothic]] name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

== &lt;span id="Usage of the term"&gt;Extent&lt;/span&gt; ==

The United Nations formally recognizes "North America" as comprising three areas: Northern America, Central America, and The Caribbean. This has been formally defined by the UN Statistics Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#panel-11|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#panel-12|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''North America'' maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context. In [[Canadian English]], ''North America'' generally refers to the land mass as a whole consisting of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, although it is generally ambiguous which other countries are included, and is mostly defined by context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/north_america-amerique_nord/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=The North American relationship|last=Government of Canada|first=Global Affairs Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/usmca-aeumc/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)|last=Government of Canada|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/issues/north-america/|title=North America – Business Council of Canada|work=Business Council of Canada|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States of America, usage of the term may refer only to Canada and the USA, and sometimes includes [[Greenland]]&lt;ref name="CIAGreenland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountryReports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eNotes"/&gt; and Mexico (as in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]),&lt;ref name="CountryReports"&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries in North America – Country Reports |url=http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |publisher=Country Reports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427050055/http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |archivedate=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trilateral&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Region |url=http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |publisher=The Trilateral Commission |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021204534/http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epa" /&gt;&lt;ref name=About.com /&gt; as well as offshore islands.

In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], [[Greece]], and the countries of Latin America, the [[cognate]]s of ''North America'' usually designate a subcontinent of the Americas comprising Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130015145/http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archivedate=30 January 2009 |title=Norteamérica |trans-title=North America |language=Spanish|quote=In Ibero-America, ''North America'' is considered a subcontinent containing Canada, the United States, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six or Seven Continents on Earth|url=http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/qt/qzcontinents.htm|accessdate=18 December 2016|language=English}} "In Europe and other parts of the world, many students are taught of six continents, where North and South America are combined to form a single continent of America.

North America has been historically referred to by other names. Spanish North America ([[New Spain]]) was often referred to as ''[[Northern America]]'', and this was the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|first official name]] given to Mexico.&lt;ref name=AGN&gt;{{cite web|title=Acta Solemne de la Declaración de Independencia de la América Septentrional|trans-title=Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/documentos.html|work=Archivos de la Independencia|publisher=Archivo General de la Nación|accessdate=8 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically the North American continent has many regions and subregions. These include cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions included those formed by trade blocs, such as the North American Trade Agreement bloc and Central American Trade Agreement. Linguistically and culturally, the continent could be divided into [[Anglo-America]] and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of Northern America, [[Belize]], and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations (though sub-national entities, such as [[Louisiana]] and [[Quebec]], have large [[Francophone]] populations; in Quebec, French is the sole official language&lt;ref name=language&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|title=Status of the French language|author=Office Québécois de la langue francaise|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=10 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514153402/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|archivedate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Original French: http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/charte/charte/clflgoff.html --&gt;).

The largest countries of the continent, Canada and the United States, also contain well-defined and recognized regions. In the case of Canada these are (from east to west) [[Atlantic Canada]], Central Canada, [[Canadian Prairies]], the [[British Columbia Coast]], and Northern Canada. These regions also contain many subregions. In the case of the United States – and in accordance with the US Census Bureau definitions – these regions are: [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], [[South Atlantic States]], [[East North Central States]], [[West North Central States]], [[East South Central States]], [[West South Central States]], [[Mountain States]], and [[Pacific States]]. Regions shared between both nations included the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]]. [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolises]] have formed between both nations in the case of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Great Lakes Megaregion]].

=== Geologic history ===
[[File:NorthAmerica-WaterDivides.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Principal hydrological divides of Canada, the United States and Mexico]]

[[Laurentia]] is an ancient [[craton]] which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Shield]] is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late [[Paleozoic]] to Early [[Mesozoic]] eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], with [[Eurasia]] to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which [[Taconic orogeny|formed]] some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago, North America became part of [[Laurasia]], before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |last2=Skinner |first2=Brian J. |title=Visualizing Earth Science |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-41847-5|date=9 January 2009 }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the [[Laramide orogeny]], between 80 and 55 million years ago. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/50450-when-panama-land-bridge-appeared.html|title=Land Bridge Linking Americas Rose Earlier Than Thought|work=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Lakes]] (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

[[Pre-Columbian|Before contact with Europeans]], the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, from small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families to large empires. They lived in several "[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|culture areas]]", which roughly correspond to [[Geography of North America|geographic and biological zones]] and give a good indication of the main [[lifeway]] or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g., the [[Plains Bison|bison]] [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of the [[Plains Indian|Great Plains]], or the farmers of [[Mesoamerica]]). Native groups can also be classified by their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language family]] (e.g., [[Athabaskan languages|Athapascan]] or [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]). Peoples with similar languages did not always share the same [[material culture]], nor were they always [[allies]]. Anthropologists think that the Inuit people of the high [[Arctic]] came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of [[Dorset culture]] artifacts from the [[archaeological record]], and their replacement by the [[Thule people]].

During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the [[Clovis culture]] of modern [[New Mexico]]. Later cultures include the [[Mississippian culture]] and related [[Mound builder (people)|Mound building]] cultures, found in the [[Mississippi river]] valley and the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Pueblo culture]] of what is now the [[Four Corners]]. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the [[domestication]] of many common [[crops]] now used around the world, such as tomatoes and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn).

The earliest verifiable instance of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] by any European culture with the landmasses that geologically constitute the "mainland" of modern North America has been dated to the end of the 10th century CE – this site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named [[Newfoundland]], is known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], where unmistakable evidence of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement was uncovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ingstad and A. Stine Ingstad, ''The Viking Discovery of America'' (2000), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the [[Maya civilization]] developed a [[Maya script|writing system]], built [[Mesoamerican pyramids|huge pyramids and temples]], had a [[Maya calendar|complex calendar]], and developed the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] around 400 CE, a few hundred years after the [[Mesopotamians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-origin-of-zer | title = What is the origin of zero? How did we indicate nothingness before zero? | author = Robert Kaplan | publisher = Scientific American | date = 16 January 2007 | accessdate =19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayan culture was still present in [[Yucatan Peninsula|southern Mexico]] and Guatemala when the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]] explorers arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the [[Aztec Empire]] whose capital city [[Tenochtitlan]] was located further north in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''"La folle aventure d'Hernan Cortés''", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007 {{incomplete short citation|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Timeline of the European colonization of North America|British America|French America|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Russian colonization of the Americas}}

During the [[Age of Discovery]], Europeans explored and staked claims to various parts of North America. Upon their arrival in the "[[New World]]", the Native American population [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|declined substantially]], because of violent conflicts with the invaders and the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of World Population: An Introduction to Population Processes |last=Massimo Livi Bacci |first=Malden |place=Massachusetts |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-631-22335-1 |pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native culture changed drastically and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups [[Language death|died out]], and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures that Europeans recorded were not necessarily the same as the names they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

Britain, [[Spain]], and France took over extensive territories in North America – and fought over them. In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th, independence movements that sprung up across the continent, led to the creation of the modern countries in the area. The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic coast declared independence in 1776, becoming the [[United States of America]]. Canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by Britain and France. New Spain, a territory that stretched from modern-day southern US to Central America, declared independence in 1810, becoming the [[First Mexican Empire]]. In 1823 the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], then part of the Mexican Empire, became the first [[sovereign state|independent state]] in Central America, officially changing its name to the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]].

The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by [[Hudson Bay]]. Others include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Before the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the [[West Indies]] delineate a submerged former [[land bridge]], which had connected North and South America via what are now [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]].

There are numerous islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the [[Bahamas]], [[Turks &amp; Caicos]], the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] (some of which are in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] proper), the [[Alexander Archipelago]], the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the [[list of islands by area|world's largest]], is on the same [[tectonic plate]] (the [[North American Plate]]) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] over 100 million years ago. The nearest landmass to it is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]]. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to [[Virginia]] and other parts of the continent.
[[File:Moraine Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of [[California]], including the cities of [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], lie on the eastern edge of the [[Pacific Plate]], with the two plates meeting along the [[San Andreas fault]]. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the [[Caribbean Plate]], whereas the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos plates]] border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the [[Great Plains]] stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], [[Geography of California|California]] and [[Alaska]]; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long [[plateau]]s and [[American cordillera|cordilleras]], falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coast ranges]] in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]], with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is [[Denali]] in Alaska.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120722022527/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html United States Geographical Survey (USGS)] states that the geographic center of North America is "6 miles [10 km] west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]" at about {{Coord|48|10|N|100|10|W}}, about {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip}} from [[Rugby, North Dakota]].

Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]].

Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |title=3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly |accessdate=13 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

=== United States geology ===
The [[Continental United States|lower 48 US states]] can be divided into roughly five [[physiography|physiographic]] provinces:
# The American cordillera
# The Canadian Shield&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"/&gt; Northern portion of the upper midwestern United States.
# The stable platform
# The coastal plain
# The Appalachian [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt

The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of [[Neogene]] [[volcano|volcanics]] erupted over a [[hotspot (geology)|hot spot]].

[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|right|{{legend|#FAD4AF|Central America rests in the [[Caribbean Plate]].}}]]

Central America is geologically active with [[volcanic eruption]]s and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquake]], killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|earthquake]] devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in [[2009 Honduras earthquake|Honduras]] a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.

Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many [[mountain range]]s; the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]], and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.

=== Languages ===
{{main article|Languages of North America}}
[[File:Languages of the Americas.PNG|thumb|Languages spoken in the Americas]]
The dominant [[languages in North America]] are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Caribbean]]. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the [[English language|anglophone]] countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the United States, but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]]. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the [[Romance language]]s, derived from [[Latin language|Latin]], of Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (but French speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]] (France), and the [[Falkland Islands]] (UK)).

The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of [[New Brunswick]]. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of [[Ontario]] (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of [[Manitoba]] (co-official as ''[[de jure]]'' with English), the [[French West Indies]] and [[Saint-Pierre et Miquelon]], as well as the US state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] alongside English.

In the United States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]], Cascadia, Florida, [[Front Range Urban Corridor|Front Range]], Great Lakes Megaregion, [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast Megaregion]], [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast]], [[Northern California]], [[Piedmont Atlantic]], Southern California, and the [[Texas Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). "Defining U.S. Megaregions." New York: [[Regional Plan Association]].{{full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] – both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megaregion – and megalopolis of [[Central Mexico]]. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet [[United States megapolitan areas#Megaregions and planning: A brief history|megaregion criterion]] have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.&lt;ref name=RPA08&gt;Regional Plan Association (2008).

The Caribbean trade bloc – CARICOM – came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a [[CARICOM passport|common passport]] for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on [[Free Trade Agreement]]s and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) free trade agreements have been signed into effect.

Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. Recent implementation of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) has left the future of the CACM unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American Community and Market |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0811094.html |publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate= 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the United States, Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs. Currently under proposal, the [[Canada – Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CA4) would operate much the same as CAFTA with the United States does.

These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]] with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The United States has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]] between itself and the [[European Union]]; the [[US-Middle East Free Trade Area]] between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.

=== &lt;span id="Infrastructure"&gt;Transport&lt;/span&gt; ===
{{main article|Transportation in North America}}
[[File:PanAmericanHwy.png|thumb|The full [[Pan American Highway]] (including South America), from [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] to [[Ushuaia]], Argentina]]

The [[Pan-American Highway]] route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly {{Convert|48000|km|mi|abbr = on}} in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly {{convert|16000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

[[File:Class1rr.png|thumb|left|2006 map of the North American [[Class I railroad]] network]]

The First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern US with California on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous [[golden spike]] event at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the [[U.S. West|American West]], catalyzing the transition from the [[wagon train]]s of previous decades to a modern transportation system.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 10 May 1869 |accessdate = 20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than {{convert|2055|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as [[Port Huron, Michigan]], through [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

=== Communications ===
A shared telephone system known as the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) is an integrated [[telephone numbering plan]] of 24 countries and territories: the United States and its [[Insular area|territories]], Canada, Bermuda, and 17 [[Caribbean]] nations.

== Culture ==
Canada and the United States were both [[British America|former British colonies]]. There is frequent cultural interplay between the United States and English-speaking Canada. Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous people of Canada but is considered [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] and has strong Danish ties due to [[Danish colonization of the Americas|centuries of colonization by Denmark]]. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common past as former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the Maya developed, indigenous people preserve traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity.

Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of [[Monterrey]], Tijuana, [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Mexicali]], is strongly influenced by the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] and [[American way|way of life of the United States]]. Of the aforementioned cities, Monterrey has been regarded as the most [[Americanization|Americanized]] city in Mexico.&lt;ref name="MonterreyFall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Special report: If Monterrey falls Mexico falls – Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=1 June 2011 |last=Emmot |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immigration to the United States]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]] remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the US. The [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean states]] have witnessed the decline of the [[British Empire]] and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America. In the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people [[expatriate|living abroad]] than those remaining at home. Northern Mexico, the Western United States and [[Alberta]], Canada share a [[cowboy]] culture.

==Setting==
The Northern Indochina subtropical forests occupy the highlands of northern [[Indochina]], extending from Northeastern [[Vietnam]], where they cover the upper portion of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] watershed and to the northern [[Annamite Range]], across northern [[Laos]] and northernmost [[Thailand]] and southeastern [[Yunnan]] to [[Shan State]] in eastern [[Myanmar]].

The Northern Indochina subtropical forests are a transition between the tropical forests of Indochina and the subtropical and temperate forests of China and the Tibetan Plateau.

'''Organic horticulture''' is the science and art of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plants by following the essential principles of [[Organic farming|organic agriculture]] in soil building and conservation, pest management, and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom variety]] preservation.

The Latin words ''hortus'' (garden plant) and ''cultura'' (culture) together form ''[[horticulture]]'', classically defined as the culture or growing of garden plants. ''Horticulture'' is also sometimes defined simply as “agriculture minus the plough.” Instead of the [[plough]], horticulture makes use of human labour and gardener’s hand tools, although some small machine tools like [[rotary tiller]]s are commonly employed now.

==General==
[[Mulch]]es, [[cover crop]]s, [[compost]], [[manure]]s, [[vermicompost]], and mineral supplements are soil-building mainstays that distinguish this type of farming from its commercial counterpart. Through attention to good healthy soil condition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/soils.html National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service on healthy soils] Retrieved 2009-3-8&lt;/ref&gt; it is expected that insect, fungal, or other problems that sometimes plague plants can be minimized. However, [[Pheromone#Sex pheromones|pheromone traps]], [[insecticidal soap]] sprays, and other pest-control methods available to organic farmers&lt;ref&gt;[https://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/summaries/summary.php?pub=133 Organic pest control strategies] Retrieved 2009-3-8&lt;/ref&gt; are also utilized by organic horticulturists.

Horticulture involves five areas of study. These areas are [[floriculture]] (includes production and marketing of floral crops), [[Landscaping|landscape horticulture]] (includes production, marketing and maintenance of landscape plants), [[olericulture]] (includes production and marketing of vegetables), [[pomology]] (includes production and marketing of fruits), and [[postharvest physiology]] (involves maintaining quality and preventing spoilage of horticultural crops). All of these can be, and sometimes are, pursued according to the principles of organic cultivation.

Organic horticulture (or organic gardening) is based on knowledge and techniques gathered over thousands of years. In general terms, organic horticulture involves natural processes, often taking place over extended periods of time, and a sustainable, holistic approach - while chemical-based horticulture focuses on immediate, isolated effects and reductionist strategies.

==Organic gardening systems==
There are a number of formal organic gardening and farming systems that prescribe specific techniques. They tend to be more specific than, and fit within, general organic standards. [[Forest gardening]], a fully organic food production system which dates from [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], is thought to be the world's oldest and most resilient [[agroecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biodynamic agriculture|Biodynamic farming]] is an approach based on the esoteric teachings of [[Rudolf Steiner]]. The Japanese farmer and writer [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] invented a [[No-till farming|no-till]] system for small-scale grain production that he called Natural Farming. [[French intensive gardening]] and [[biointensive]] methods and SPIN Farming ('''S'''mall '''P'''lot '''IN'''tensive) are all small scale gardening techniques. These techniques were brought to the United States by Alan Chadwick in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Travis Beck and Martin F. Quigley, [http://extension.missouri.edu/sare/documents/intensiveorganicgardening.pdf Intensive Organic Gardening], Ohio State University Extension Factsheet&lt;/ref&gt;  This method has since been promoted by John Jeavons, Director of Ecology Action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://growbiointensive.org|title=Ecology Action: Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A garden is more than just a means of providing food, it is a model of what is possible in a community - everyone could have a garden of some kind (container, growing box, raised bed) and produce healthy, nutritious organic food, a farmers market, a place to pass on gardening experience, and a sharing of bounty, promoting a more sustainable way of living that would encourage their local economy. A simple 4' x 8' (32 square feet) raised bed garden based on the principles of bio-intensive planting and square foot gardening uses fewer nutrients and less water, and could keep a family, or community, supplied with an abundance of healthy, nutritious organic greens, while promoting a more sustainable way of living.

Organic gardening is designed to work with the ecological systems and minimally disturb the Earth’s natural balance. Because of this organic farmers have been interested in reduced-tillage methods. Conventional agriculture uses mechanical tillage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/organic-gardening|title=Organic Gardening|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is plowing or sowing, which is harmful to the environment. The impact of tilling in organic farming is much less of an issue. Ploughing speeds up erosion because the soil remains uncovered for a long period of time and if it has a low content of organic matter, the structural stability of the soil decreases. Organic farmers use techniques such as mulching, planting cover crops, and intercropping, to maintain a soil cover throughout most of the year. The use of compost, manure mulch and other organic fertilizers yields a higher organic content of soils on organic farms and helps limit [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safepestcontrolreno.com/organic-gardening-benefits/|title=Benefits of Organic Gardening|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

Other methods such as [[composting]] or [[vermicomposting]] can also be used to supplement an existing garden. These practices are ways of recycling organic matter into some of the best organic fertilizers and soil conditioner. Vermicompost is especially easy. The byproduct is also an excellent source of nutrients for an organic garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vcompost.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208222213/http://www.vcompost.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-08 |title=Build a Vermicompost Bin |accessdate=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Pest control approaches==
Differing approaches to pest control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.poweredbythepeople.com/categories/pest_control.php|title=Organic Pest Control|publisher=The Powered by the People Pest Control team| date=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are equally notable. In chemical horticulture, a specific insecticide may be applied to quickly kill off a particular insect pest. Chemical controls can dramatically reduce pest populations in the short term, yet by unavoidably killing (or starving) natural control insects and animals, cause an increase in the pest population in the long term, thereby creating an ever-increasing problem. Repeated use of insecticides and herbicides also encourages rapid natural selection of resistant insects, plants and other organisms, necessitating increased use, or requiring new, more powerful controls.

In contrast, organic horticulture tends to tolerate some pest populations while taking the long view. Organic pest control requires a thorough understanding of pest life cycles and interactions, and involves the cumulative effect of many techniques, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/pp/resourceguide/ Organic Pest and Disease Management Guide, Cornell Univ] Retrieved 2009-3-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Allowing for an acceptable level of pest damage &lt;br /&gt;
* Encouraging predatory beneficial insects to flourish and eat pests&lt;br /&gt;
* Encouraging beneficial microorganisms &lt;br /&gt;
* Careful plant selection, choosing disease-resistant varieties&lt;br /&gt;
* Planting companion crops that discourage or divert pests&lt;br /&gt;
* Using row covers to protect crop plants during pest migration periods&lt;br /&gt;
* Rotating crops to different locations from year to year to interrupt pest reproduction cycles&lt;br /&gt;
* Using insect traps to monitor and control insect populations

Each of these techniques also provides other benefits, such as soil protection and improvement, fertilization, pollination, water conservation and season extension. These benefits are both complementary and cumulative in overall effect on site health. Organic pest control and [[biological pest control]] can be used as part of [[integrated pest management]] (IPM). However, IPM can include the use of chemical pesticides that are not part of organic or biological techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omri.org/ Organic Materials Review Institute on allowed substances] Retrieved 2009-3-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on the global food supply==
One controversy associated with organic food production is the matter of the amount of food produced per acre. Even with good organic practices, organic agriculture may be five to twenty-five percent less productive than conventional agriculture, depending on the crop.&lt;ref name="Biello"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harball&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/copious-fertilizer-down-on-the-farm-means-more-global-warming-pollution-up-in-the-sky/ |title=Copious Fertilizer Down on the Farm Means More Global Warming Pollution up in the Sky |last=Harball |first=Elizabeth |publisher=Scientific American |date=11 June 2014 |website=Scientific American |access-date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the productivity advantage of conventional agriculture is associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Biello"/&gt; However, the use, and especially the overuse, of nitrogen fertilizer has negative effects such as nitrogen runoff harming natural water supplies and increased global warming.&lt;ref name=Harball/&gt;
 
Organic methods have other advantages, such as healthier soil, that may make organic farming more resilient, and therefore more reliable in producing food, in the face of challenges such as climate change.&lt;ref name="Biello"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/organic-farming-yields-and-feeding-the-world-under-climate-change/ |title=Will Organic Food Fail to Feed the World? |last=Biello |first=David |publisher=Scientific American |date=25 April 2012 |website=Scientific American |access-date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, world hunger is not primarily an issue of agricultural yields, but distribution and waste.&lt;ref name="Biello"/&gt;

The '''Paps of Anu''' ({{lang-ga|Dá Chích Anann}}, "the [[breast]]s of Anu") are a pair of [[breast shaped mountains]] near [[Killarney]] in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithomania.com/show/site/1413 The Paps of Anu - Prehistoric and Early Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;  The eastern summit, '''The Paps East''', is {{convert|694|m|ft}} high&lt;ref&gt;[http://mountainviews.ie/summit/116/ The Paps East]. MountainViews.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; and the western top, '''The Paps West''' is {{convert|690|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mountainviews.ie/summit/125/ The Paps West]. MountainViews.ie.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mountains are named after [[Anu (goddess)|Anu]]; believed to have been an ancient [[mother goddess]]. ''[[Sanas Cormaic|Cormac's Glossary]]'' describes Anu or [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]] as "the mother of the gods of Ireland".&lt;ref name=monaghan20&gt;Monaghan, Patricia. ''The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore''. Infobase Publishing, 2004. p.20&lt;/ref&gt; On each summit is a prehistoric [[cairn]], which may be miniature [[passage grave]]s or house burial [[cist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Frank. ''[http://www.kerrycoco.ie/en/allservices/heritage/publications/thefile,7533,en.pdf An Upland Archaeological Study on Mount Brandon and The Paps, County Kerry]''. 2006. pp.21-22&lt;/ref&gt; The cairn on the eastern Pap is slightly larger, with a height of {{convert|4|m|ft}} and diameter of {{convert|16|m|ft}}. They have been described as "stone nipples on the great breasts of the mother goddess".&lt;ref name=monaghan20/&gt; A line of stones, known as ''Na Fiacla'', connects the two tops and is believed to have been a processional route.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tempan&gt;Tempan, Paul. [http://mountainviews.ie/features/names/List2010/MVHillList09.pdf Irish Hill and Mountain Names]. MountainViews.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; Archeologist Frank Coyne suggested that the mountains were seen as sacred and said "There is little doubt that the mountaintops of both The Paps…were utilized for ritual in prehistory". To the ancients, the mountains reinforced the idea that the Earth was a motherly body.&lt;ref&gt;Monaghan, p.451&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a stream running between the mountains. One half flows north into a small lake called Lough Nageeha and the other half flows south into the Clydagh River.

==Cahercrovdarrig==
To the northeast of the peaks is an ancient circular stone enclosure called Cahercrovdarrig (''Cathair Crobh Dearg,'' 'Red Claw Fort/City') or 'The City'&lt;ref name=armao&gt;Armao, Frederic. [https://www.estudiosirlandeses.org/2017/10/cathair-crobh-dearg-from-ancient-beliefs-to-the-rounds-2017/ Cathair Crobh Dearg: From Ancient Beliefs to the Rounds 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. The Paps can be clearly seen from Cahercrovdarrig and it appears that the two sites are linked. It contains a possible ruined megalithic tomb, an [[ogham]] stone, an earthen mound, a [[holy well]] and a cross-inscribed stone altar.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; When the water table is high enough, the water "noisily bubbles up from its depths".&lt;ref name=voices&gt;[http://www.voicesfromthedawn.com/city-and-the-paps/ The City and the Paps of Anu]. Voices from the Dawn: The Folklore of Ireland's Ancient Monuments.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the site is named after the goddess [[Crobh Dearg]] and was originally used for [[Beltane]] rituals&lt;ref name=armao2&gt;Armao, Frederic. [http://cecille.recherche.univ-lille3.fr/IMG/pdf/Conformismes_et_resistances-3.pdf Conformismes et résistances], p.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;and festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the site and the festivities became somewhat Christianized. A yearly [[May Day]] festival was held there up until [[World War II]]. According to local folklorist Dan Cronin, the festival involved music, dancing, drinking, and "champions…performing feats of valour".&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Dan. ''In the Shadow of the Paps''. Killarney: Crede, Sliabh Luachra Heritage Group, 2001. pp.38-40&lt;/ref&gt; People would circle the well and the other features of the site while reciting prayers. They would also walk their cattle around the well as a purification ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 the festivities "were augmented…for the first time in modern memory, with the inclusion of a Mass".&lt;ref name=cronin48&gt;Cronin, pp.48-49&lt;/ref&gt; In his sermon, the priest commented that "The pagan danger is now past. Paganism is dead, or rather all the best elements in it have been absorbed into Christianity".&lt;ref name=cronin48/&gt; After World War II, "all that remained of the event were the penitential rites, observed by the occasional visitor on any day of the year, and by a small crowd celebrating Mass there each May Day".&lt;ref name=voices/&gt; A statue of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] has been erected at the site. In 1983 a local affiliate of [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]], the Irish cultural organization, working with the parish priest, reintroduced music and dance to the May Day festival at Cahercrovdarrig.&lt;ref name=voices/&gt;

[[File:Peter Martyr d'Anghiera03a.jpg|right|thumb|Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, 1825 stipple engraving by Henry Hoppner Meyer]]
'''Peter Martyr d'Anghiera''' ({{lang-la|Petrus Martyr Anglerius}} or ''ab Angleria''; {{lang-it|Pietro Martire d'Anghiera}}; {{lang-es|Pedro Mártir de Anglería}}; 2 February 1457&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; October 1526), formerly known in [[English language|English]] as '''Peter Martyr of Angleria'''&lt;!--sic, per Richard Eden--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;D'Anghiera, Peter Martyr. ''De Orbo Novo'' {{la icon}}. Trans. [[Richard Eden]] as [https://archive.org/stream/firstthreeenglis00arberich#page/148/mode/2up/search/zauana ''The decades of the newe worlde or west India conteynyng the nauigations and conquestes of the Spanyardes with the particular description of the moste ryche and large landes and Ilands lately founde in the west Ocean perteynyng to the inheritaunce of the kinges of Spayne'', {{nowrap|Book III}}, §3.] William Powell (London), 1555.&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] at the service of [[Spain]] during the [[Age of Exploration]]. He wrote the first accounts of explorations in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] in a series of letters and reports, grouped in the original [[Latin]] publications of 1511 to 1530 into sets of ten chapters called "decades." His ''Decades'' are of great value in the history of geography and discovery. His ''De Orbe Novo'' (On the New World, 1530) describes the first contacts of Europeans and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], Native American civilizations in the Caribbean and North America, as well as Mesoamerica, and includes, for example, the first [[Europe]]an reference to [[India rubber]]. It was first translated into English in 1555, and in a fuller version in 1912.

==Life==
Martyr was born February 2, 1457 at [[Lake Maggiore]] in [[Arona, Piedmont|Arona]] in [[Piedmont]] and later named for the nearby city of [[Angera]]. He studied under [[Giovanni Borromeo]], then the count of Arona.  He went to Rome at the age of twenty, and met important men in the hierarchy of the [[Catholic Church]]. After meeting the Spanish ambassador in Rome, Martyr accompanied him to [[Zaragoza]] in August 1487. Martyr soon became a notable figure among the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of Spain.  In 1488 he lectured in [[Salamanca]] on the invitation of the [[University of Salamanca|university]]. The [[new learning]] was supported by highly placed patrons in the society. Martyr would become [[chaplain]] to the court of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].
[[File:Deorbonovo (1).jpg|frame|right|Frontispiece of ''De orbo novo'']]
After 1492, Martyr's chief task was the education of young nobles at the Spanish court. In 1501 he was [[Peter Martyr's mission to Egypt|sent to Egypt]] on a diplomatic mission to dissuade the [[Burji dynasty|Sultan of Egypt]] from taking vengeance on the [[Christians]] in Egypt and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for the defeat of the [[Moors]] in Spain and the [[Fall of Granada]].  This he achieved by strongly asserting that there were no forced conversions and that Granada Muslims had asked for baptism of their own volition - plus, more importantly, promising Spanish help to Egypt against the threat of conquest by the [[Ottomans]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=-_uFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT415&amp;lpg=PT415&amp;dq=%22Peter+Martyr+d'Anghiera%22+%2B+%22Sultan+of+Egypt%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXfKFvhy7M&amp;sig=ceSSrCFKgbX3nPoC0QCPiaOo4C8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj94unGkfzTAhWjKsAKHX9SD9EQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Peter%20Martyr%20d'Anghiera%22%20%2B%20%22Sultan%20of%20Egypt%22&amp;f=false]. He described his voyage through Egypt in the ''Legatio Babylonica,'' which was published in the 1511 edition of his ''Decades''.  Following the success of this mission, he received the title of ''maestro de los caballeros'' (master of knights).

In 1520 Martyr was given the post of chronicler (''cronista'') in the newly formed [[Council of the Indies]], commissioned by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] to describe what was occurring in the explorations of the [[New World]]. In 1523 Charles gave him the title of [[Count Palatine]], and in 1524 called him once more into the Council of the Indies.  Martyr was [[investiture|invested]] by [[Pope Clement VII]], as proposed by Charles V, as [[Abbot]] of [[Jamaica]]. Although Martyr never visited the island, as abbot he directed construction of the first stone [[Church (building)|church]] there.

He died in [[Granada]] in 1526.

Peter Martyr was a prolific writer.  He is estimated to have composed some eight hundred letters addressed to various illustrious persons relating events in Spain and the Spanish court, written in a journalistic style, often quite gossipy. Moving in court circles, Peter Martyr was personally acquainted with most of the leading figures of the day, and it is from his letters that historians have drawn much of the details about their physical appearance, personality, quirks and anecdotes.

It was as a chronicler that Martyr performed his most notable literary work. He collected documents and accounts from the discoverers as well as personally interviewing them. He learned from the letters of [[Christopher Columbus]] and made use of the reports of the Council of the Indies. He had a great grasp of geographical issues; he was the first European to realize the significance of the [[Gulf Stream]].

In 1511, his publications included the first historical account of the Spanish discoveries:  ''Opera, Legatio, Babylonica, Oceanidecas, Paemata, Epigrammata'' (Seville, 1511). The ''Decas'' consisted of ten reports, two of which Martyr had previously sent as letters describing the voyages of Columbus, to Cardinal [[Ascanius Sforza]] in 1493 and 1494.  In 1501 Martyr, as requested by the Cardinal [[Luigi d'Aragona]], added eight chapters on the voyage of Columbus and the exploits of [[Martin Alonzo Pinzón]].  In 1511 he added a supplement giving an account of events from 1501 to 1511.

Jointly with this ''Decade'', he published a narrative of his experiences in Egypt with a description of the inhabitants, their country, and history. By 1516 he had finished two other ''Decades'':
* The first was devoted to the exploits of [[Alonso de Ojeda]], [[Diego de Nicuesa]], and [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]
* The second gave an account of [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]]'s discovery of the [[Pacific Ocean]], Columbus' fourth voyage, and the expeditions of [[Pedrarias Dávila]].
* Three appeared together at [[Alcalá de Henares]] in 1516 under the title: ''De orbe novo decades cum Legatione Babylonica''.
* The ''Enchiridion de nuper sub D. Carolo repertis insulis'' (Basle, 1521) was printed as the fourth ''Decade'', describing the voyages of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (discoverer of Yucatán)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]], [[Juan de Grijalva]], and [[Hernán Cortés]].
* The fifth ''Decade'' (1523) dealt with the conquest of Mexico and the [[circumnavigation]] of the world by [[Ferdinand Magellan]].
* The sixth ''Decade'' (1524) gave an account of Dávila's discoveries on the west coast of [[Americas|America]].
* The seventh ''Decade'' (1525) had collected descriptions of the customs of the natives in present-day [[South Carolina]], including the "Testimony of [[Francisco de Chicora]]", a Native American taken captive there; as well as those of natives in [[Florida]], [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], and [[Darién, Panama|Darién]].
* The eighth ''Decade'' (1525) told the story of the march of Cortés against [[Cristobal de Olid]], (1488–1524).

In 1530 the eight ''Decades'' were published together for the first time at Alcalá.  Later editions of single or of all the ''Decades'' appeared at [[Basel]] (1533), [[Cologne]] (1574), [[Paris]] (1587), and [[Madrid]] (1892). A German translation was published in Basle in 1582; an English version may be found in Arber, ''The first three English books on America'' (Birmingham, 1885); a French one by [[Gaffarel]] in ''Recueil de voyages et de documents pour servir à l'histoire de la Geographie'' (Paris, 1907).

Martyr also wrote the historical account, ''Opus epistolarum,'' although it was not edited or published until after his death. This collection consists of 812 letters to or from ecclesiastical dignitaries, generals, and statesmen of Spain and Italy, dealing with contemporary events, and especially with the history of Spain between 1487 and 1525. It was published first at Alcalá in 1530; a new edition was issued by the [[House of Elzevir]] at [[Amsterdam]] in 1670.

:''Not to be confused with [[Pieter van Woensel (politician)]].''
'''Pieter van Woensel''' ([[Haarlem]], 1747 – [[The Hague]], 1808) was a physician, adventurer, travel writer, navy medical officer, political cartoonist and a colourful, atheist author under the Turkish pseudonym Amurath-Effendi Hekim-Bachi (‘Chief Physician Mister Amurath’) in the satirical [[almanac]] ''de Lantaarn'' (the Lamp).  Typical for Van Woensel is his love for the peculiar, dislike for the easy route and inborn tendency towards the paradoxical.

==Life==
Van Woensel was a student at the [[Leiden University]].  In 1771 he left for [[Saint Petersburg]] as an army physician. For an appointment at  the Hospital of the Petersburg Cadets he had [[Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen]] to thank.  In 1780, he returned to Amsterdam. His brief communications in 1780 and 1782 on his findings of improving the treatment of whooping cough (in young Russian cadets) continued to be cited in the specialist literature well into the 1830s. In 1781, he published ''the Present State of Russia'', a book that was translated in French, German, Polish, Italian and Russian.  In 1782, he published ''Précis'', a much reworked  French summary of [[Guillaume Thomas François Raynal|Abbot Raynal]]’s ''[[Histoire des deux Indes]]'', followed by a further abridged and paraphrased Dutch version, as ''Tafreel'', in 1784. Curiously, he appears to have removed all its content regarding anti-colonialism and the abolition of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis in Laban Kaptein (ed.) Pieter van Woensel, ''Remarks'' (2015), Commentary (Part II), pp. 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unrest drove him and in 1784, he spent one and a half years in [[Constantinople]] and published on Turkish society in 1791, an important reason why his work caused so much interest.

He joined a group of Englishmen travelling to India, via Bagdad, but already in [[Diyarbakır]] he decided to travel by himself, because the company bored him.  After a stay in [[Erzurum]], he crossed the [[Pontic Mountains]] in bad weather, and spent several days in plague-ridden [[Trabzon]] on the [[Black Sea]], before sailing to the [[Crimea]], where he settled in [[Sevastopol]] for two years as navy doctor in Russian service.&lt;ref&gt;For the stages of Van Woensel’s itinerary, see map in Bakker, ''Reizen'' (2008), pp. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the visit of [[Catharina II of Russia]] at the newly conquered territory.  His research on the plague appeared in French in St. Petersburg (1788), and was translated into Russian by Andrej Kazimirovitsj Mejer (Moscow, 1791). Later, in ''Aanteekeningen'' (''Remarks'') he went one step further, elaborating on the fundamental natural law of self-preservation. To deter the superior Russians, the Turks, thus Van Woensel, were allowed to threaten biological warfare, in the form of deliberately spreading the plague.&lt;ref&gt;''Aanteekeningen'' (''Remarks'') vol. 1 (1791), pp. 355-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Amsterdam, he was appointed naval-physician to the [[Admiralty of Amsterdam]].  Van Woensel travelled as a ship doctor with the fleet to [[Surinam]], [[Demerara]] and [[Berbice]]. His typically Woenselian, sometimes acrid account of local (slavery) conditions in ''De Lantaarn voor 1796'' acquired lasting notoriety in Surinamica.  In 1797, he travelled  again to Russia as a secret agent, seeing the coronation of [[Paul I of Russia]] on 5 April.

In his almanac Van Woensel wrote in favour of a divorce procedure and, an atheist himself, a healthy dose of self-reflection regarding Muslims and Jews. (Nevertheless, though feeling that the Turks, among all nations, treated Jews 'the most ''christianly'',' he found that non-Muslims living under the Turks were ‘kept in utter abasement, [and] are basically treated like dogs.’) &lt;ref&gt;Van Woensel, ''De Lantaarn voor 1792'', pp. 122, 125, and ''Mémoire sur la peste'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the prime function of the state is to provide work for its inhabitants.  The almanac was banned because he wrote under a pseudonym, banned since the state regulation of 1798.  Apart from his work on Raynal, he also translated [[Thomas Paine]], ''[[The decline and fall of the English system of finance]]'' into Dutch, as ''De daaling en val van het systhema der Engelsche finantiën'' (1796).&lt;ref&gt; Nieuwenhuis, ''Satire'' (2014), pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, Van Woensel, a Cervantista by his own admission, published a much abridged and reworked Dutch version (based on a hitherto unknown source) of ''[[Don Quixote]]''. With illustrations assumed to be by his own hand, and written in modern, lively Dutch, it finally replaced [[Lambert van den Bosch]]’s antiquated classic after almost 150 years.  In 1804 his ''Rusland beschouwd'' (Russia considered...) was published.  Van Woensel called a spade a spade and uttered his opinions on slavery and [[serfdom]].  He was critical of Russian policies carried out by [[Grigori Potemkin]], a wind bag according to Van Woensel.

{{Politics of Artsakh}}

The '''President of Artsakh''' is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] of the ''de facto'' [[Republic of Artsakh]].

In a [[Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum, 2017|constitutional referendum]] held in 2017, citizens of the Republic voted in favor of transforming Artsakh into a [[presidential system]]. On 19 July 2017 the [[National Assembly (Artsakh)|National Assembly]] voted to elect the President for the next three years until the next [[Artsakhian general election, 2020|general election]] which will be held in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://massispost.com/2017/07/karabakh-parliament-elect-new-president-july-19/ Karabakh Parliament to Elect New President on July 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent, Bako Sahakyan, was [[Artsakhian presidential election, 2017|re-elected]]. If it wasn’t for the amendment to the constitution, he would have had to step down in 2017 after serving two consecutive five-year terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3247">The '''SCR-277''' was a mobile, trailer mounted [[radio range]] [[Signal Corps Radio|set]] for radio guidance of [[aircraft]]. It was standardized by the [[U.S. Army]] in June 1941.
[[Image:K-29_trailer_for_SCR-277_radio_navigation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|title|K-29 trailer for SCR-277, 1944]]

==Specifications==
The SCR-277 was used as a navigation aid. It included the BC-467 [[radio transmitter|transmitter]] with an [[radio frequency|RF]] output power of 800 [[watt]]s, the BC-468 [[Goniometer]], and [[BC-342]] [[radio receiver|receiver]]. Frequencies utilized were 200-400 [[kHz]] for transmission and 1.5-18 [[MHz]] for reception. Radio range homing equipment transmitted tone identification signals to aircraft that lacked a [[radio compass]] but were equipped with [[ARC-5|command sets]]. Range was approximately 300 miles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gordon.army.mil/ocos/museum/ScrComponents/scrPart1.asp#SCR-277 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205020349/http://gordon.army.mil/OCOS/Museum/ScrComponents/scrPart1.asp |date=2009-02-05 }} Fort Gordon Military Museum&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a single PE-90 generator.

==Use==
In operation the transmitter sends out signals coded "A" or "N" in each of the four quadrants around the beacon. The signals overlap on the range, providing the pilot of the aircraft an indication of his position in relation to location of the beacon. Thus, if he is heading toward the beacon he will receive an aural signal coded "A" or "N" if he is between the beam, and when he is on the beam he will receive "AN" signal. Over land areas the beacon has a range of about 300 miles, while over water areas the range is extended to about 1,000 miles. Charts prepared for air navigation show the position and the orientation of the various beacons.&lt;ref&gt;Graphic Survey of Radio and Radar Equipment Used by the Army Airforce. section 3 Radio Navigation Equipment Dated may 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Klein''' ({{lang-he-n|שמואל קליין}}; lived 17 November 1886 – 21 April 1940) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born rabbi, historian and [[historical geographer]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. 

==Biography==
Born in [[Hungary]] to Idel Hertzfeld and to Avraham Zvi Klein, a rabbi of Szilas-Balhas in western Hungary, he initially received a traditional Jewish education (1893–1897), graduating from the Government Gymnasium at Budapest in 1905. From there he went on to study at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Berlin where he was ordained in the rabbinate. From 1906–1909, he was enrolled at the Hochschule für Wissenschaft des Judentums, and in the Freidrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin, before advancing to [[Heidelberg University]] where he wrote a thesis entitled: ''Beiträge zur Geographie und Geschichte Galiläas'' (Leipzig 1909) (Contributions to the Geography and History of Galilee), his first important contributions to the science of Historical Topography of the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yeivin |first=S. |title=The late Professor Rabbi Samuel Klein |journal=Bulletin of the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society |accessdate=28 August 2018 |volume= |issue= |pages= I-IV |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23724427 |date=1940|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}} (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he gave an incisive analysis of the topographical and historical material preserved in the liturgical poems of [[Kalir]], and by which novel work he received in 1909 his [[PhD]]. 

He served as a rabbi in the city of [[Tuzla]] in Bosnia from 1909–1913, during which time, in 1911, the ''Association for Jewish Studies'' in Berlin awarded him a research grant of 500 [[German gold mark|Marks]] which enabled him to conduct research in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. After he had taken a wife in 1913, he then served as the rabbi of the town of Érsekújvár ([[Nové Zámky]]) (1913-1928). During the [[First World War]], Klein was conscripted in the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army as a rabbi, and became the patron and benefactor of some 200 refugees who came to Nové Zámky in search of a new life. 

In 1924, Klein became the first professor of the newly opened ''Institute of Jewish Studies'', which was to form part of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1927, Klein was an instructor at the ''Hebrew Pedagogical Institute'' in [[Vienna]], an institute involved in training of Hebrew teachers for the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. In 1929 he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] where he began work as Professor of Geography of the Land of Israel at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and worked in this capacity until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Tamás Turán &amp; Carsten Wilke, ''Modern Jewish Scholarship in Hungary: The 'Science of Judaism' between East and West'', Berlin 2016, p.

Klein's research on the geography of the Land of Israel has helped promote a greater understanding of the map of ancient Israel / [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and whose works have been incorporated in Hebrew schools in the Diaspora and in Israel.

==Death and legacy==
In Mandatory Palestine, he became a member of the [[Hebrew Language Committee]], as well as participated in committees on Geography and Archaeology. In his final years, he served as the President of the [[Jewish Palestine Exploration Society]], a consortium of British Mandate scholars.

Klein's greatest contribution to scholastic research is his identification of old [[place names]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the classical period, drawn principally from the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Mishnah]], [[Tosefta]], [[Talmud]], and from the writings of [[Josephus]] in transliterated Greek-form, as well as from other [[epigraphic]] texts of antiquity.

'''Schrofen''', a German mountaineering term, is steep terrain, strewn with rocks and rock outcrops, that is laborious to cross, but whose rock ledges (''schrofen'') offer many good steps and hand holds. It is usually rocky terrain on which grass has established itself, but it can also refer to purely rocky slopes. ''Schrofen'' are found especially where the rock has broken off against its [[angle of dip]].

''Schrofen'' differs from trackless terrain in that hands are needed in order to negotiate it. Often there are route markings that only indicate a rough direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpin.de/onlinekurse/news/07731f61-386f-4f55-9076-c582698e89e4 ''So gehen Sie sicher im Schrofengelände''] ("How to negotiate ''schrofen'' terrain safely") at www.alpin.de. Accessed on 31 Dec 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Schrofen'' terrain requires at least [[sure-footedness]] and is typical of [[climbing grade|grade I climbing]] routes. In wet weather ''schrofen'' can become very dangerous because of the increased risk of slipping, particularly in the descent. In addition, the risk of falling in ''schrofen'' terrain is often underestimated.

In keeping with the base meaning of the word ("rock spikes"), ''schrofen'' also forms part of the name of numerous mountains in the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. Alpine farms near a ''schrofen'' are often named after it, as are their access roads, e.g.: ''Ob dm Schrofa, Schrofaweg''. The word is linked to the German adjective ''schroff'' which means rugged, steep or craggy.

''' Semnan Space Center''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]:{{lang|fa|پایگاه فضایی سمنان}}) is the primary Iranian Space Center, located 50&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the city of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] in the north of the country.

==History==
On occasion of the 10th anniversary of the 1998 [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1|Kwangmyongsong 1]] satellite launch attempt, program conducted by North Korea in close cooperation with Iran and [[Pakistan]], the [[Iranian Space Agency]] has proceeded with its own test. According to practice also observed by [[North Korea]], Iranian authorities announced to their Chinese allies on August 16, 2008 the imminent launch of a satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.irna.ir/ch/news/view/line-52/0808167168204858.htm|title=伊朗将于下周发射自主生产的卫星|publisher=伊通社|date=August 16, 2008|accessdate=August 18, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912173246/http://www2.irna.ir/ch/news/view/line-52/0808167168204858.htm|archivedate=September 12, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 17, 2008 on the occasion of the birthday anniversary of Shia's 12th Imam [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]], Iran proceeded as preannounced with the second test launch of a three stages [[Safir (rocket)|Safir]] SLV from a site {{coord|35|14|5|N|53|55|15|E|}} south of [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]] in the northern part of the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Dasht-e-Kavir desert]].

===Circular Launch Platform===
The circular launch platform is the oldest launch pad and also recognizable by the light blue background with the original logo of the [[Iran Space Agency]] (ISA).The platform has a simplified character and consists of a leveled terrain with a circular asphalted section of a diameter of 65 m, at the center of which is a service tower.

===Main Launch Platform===

&lt;br /&gt;- auxiliary service facilities]]
The main launch Platform is located at the east of the complex on a specially enclosed octagonal area measuring 900 x 660 m and covering an area of 51.4 ha, representing the largest single element of the new space center.The units are accessed by a road from the northwest, which is within the perimeter of the three rays and forms two main inner zones – almost completely built lower and newly initiated upper (state of 2015).  The lower zone consists of spacious launching platforms with towers and four larger compartments for installation and storage.

It was founded by [[Rebecca Lolosoli]], a [[Samburu people|Samburu]] woman, as a sanctuary for homeless survivors of [[violence against women]], and young girls running from forced marriages. The women of the Samburu people do not agree with violence and the traditional subordinate position of women.

They run a primary school, cultural center and camping site for tourists visiting the adjacent [[Samburu National Reserve]]. They create and sell jewellery to benefit the village.

==History==
[[Samburu people|Samburu]] women have a subordinate position in their society.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lolosoli|first=Rebecca|last2=Armstrong|first2=Lisa|date=October 2006|title=It Takes a Village|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=22301863&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Essence|volume=37|issue=6|pages=165|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not allowed to own land or other types of property, such as livestock. Women themselves are considered property of their husbands.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They can be subject to [[female genital mutilation]], forced marriage with the elders, rape and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In the early 1990s, there were over 600 reports of Kenyan women who were [[Rape|raped]] by [[British Army|British soldiers]]. Since then, a case was brought up against the military for the rapes of over 1,400 Samburu women. The case was cleared.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=mag|first=Satya|date=2007|title=interview with Rebecca Lolosoli}} &lt;/ref&gt;  These women were abandoned by their husbands because they were considered to be "defiled."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedlin|first=Jennifer|date=March 2005|title=Kenya: A Village of Sisters|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=16410985&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Marie Claire|volume=12|issue=3|pages=92|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other men drove the women out of their houses fearing they would now contract [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] from their raped wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/world/africa/from-broken-lives-kenyan-women-build-place-of-unity.html|title=From Broken Lives, Kenyan Women Build Place of Unity|last=Lacey|first=Marc|date=2004-12-07|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many women found themselves without homes, they created Umoja.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801775.html|title=A Place Where Women Rule|last=Wax|first=Emily|date=2005-07-09|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=1|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rebecca Lolosoli]] is one of the founders of Umoja,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 2009|title=Violence Against Women in Kenya|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=lfh&amp;AN=48301119&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Sister Namibia|volume=21|issue=4|pages=44|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came up with the idea of creating a village for women when she was recovering after being beaten for speaking out.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Eventually fifteen women came together to found the original village in 1990.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In response, some men established their own, eventually unsuccessful villages nearby.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The men tried to set up a rival craft business or would try to dissuade tourists from stopping at Umoja.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/1494173/Thriving-women-only-village-is-attacked-by-jealous-locals.html|title=Thriving women-only village is attacked by jealous locals|last=Pflanz|first=Mike|date=16 July 2005|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women eventually bought the land the men were occupying.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The villagers first started out by selling vegetables they bought from others, since they did not know how to farm themselves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was not very successful, and the village turned to selling traditional crafts to tourists.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The [[Kenya Wildlife Service|Kenya Wildlife Services]] took notice and helped the women learn from successful groups in areas such as the [[Maasai Mara]], in order to improve Umoja's business.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The women also had help from Kenya's Heritage and Social Services and the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/kenya-s-umoja-village-sisterhood-preserves-past-prepares-future-n634391|title=In Kenya's Umoja Village, a sisterhood preserves the past, prepares the future|last=Dyer|first=Ervin|date=9 September 2016|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lolosoli visited the United Nations in 2005, men in the neighboring village filed a court case against her, hoping to shut down the village.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/08/AR2005070801775.html|title=A Place Where Women Rule|last=Wax|first=Emily|date=2005-07-09|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|page=2|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Lolosoli's former husband attacked the village, threatening her life.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=e16449266cba9902b5f1ea0ce3643ceb|title=Gunman Attacks Women's Village in Kenya|last=Schell|first=Brittany|date=22 August 2009|work=New America Media|access-date=21 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521131839/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=e16449266cba9902b5f1ea0ce3643ceb|archive-date=21 May 2013|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, the women fled the village for their safety.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The '''Vulture''' ({{lang-it|'''Il Vulture'''|italic=no}}, {{IPA-it|ˈvulture|IPA}}), also known as the '''Vulture-Melfese''' or '''Vulture-Alto Bradano''' is a geographical and historical region in the northern part of the [[province of Potenza]], in the [[Basilicata]] region of Italy.

==Geography==
The area consists of the [[comuni]] of [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]], [[Barile]], [[Ginestra]], [[Melfi]], [[Rapolla]], [[Ripacandida]], [[Rionero in Vulture]], [[Maschito]], [[Venosa]], [[Ruvo del Monte]], [[Rapone]], and [[San Fele]]. The area takes its name from the extinct volcano [[Monte Vulture]] (1326 m). Sights include the two lakes of Monticchio within the crater of the volcano, and the castles of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Empire|Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] at [[Castel Lagopesole]] and [[Melfi]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Produce==
The fertile volcanic soil of the Vulture is suitable for the cultivation of grapes and olives. The [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] wine [[Aglianico del Vulture]] is produced in the region, as are Aglianico dolce, a dessert wine, Aglianico di Filiano, [[Malvasia]] del Vulture and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Moscato]] del Vulture. The area of Monte Vulture has numerous springs, and several brands of [[mineral water]] are bottled there.&lt;ref name=vult/&gt;
