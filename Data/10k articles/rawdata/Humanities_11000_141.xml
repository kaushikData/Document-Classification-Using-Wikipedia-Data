Writing in the ''[[i (newspaper)|I newspaper]]'' in 2016, Roberts dismissed the [[aquatic ape hypothesis]] (AAH) as a distraction "from the emerging story of human evolution that is more interesting and complex", adding that AAH has become "a theory of everything" that is simultaneously "too extravagant and too simple". She concluded by saying that "science is about evidence, not wishful thinking".&lt;ref&gt;The "i" newspaper, 17 September 2016, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/sorry-david-attenborough-we-didnt-evolve-from-aquatic-apes-heres-why-65570 |title=Sorry David Attenborough, we didnât evolve from âaquatic apesâ â hereâs why |last=Roberts |first=Alice |website=The Conversation |date=16 September 2016 |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anxiety/Uncertainty Management''' ('''AUM''') theory was introduced by William B. Gudykunst to define how humans effectively communicate based on their balance of anxiety and uncertainty in social situations.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing About Intercultural Communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9780761927495|editor-last=|editor-first=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Gudykunst believed that in order for successful [[intercultural|intercultural communication]] a reduction in anxiety/uncertainty must occur. This is assuming that one person within the intercultural encounter is a stranger. AUM is a theory based on the [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory]] (URT) which was introduced by Berger and Calabrese in 1974.&lt;ref name="Berger&amp;Calabrese"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Charles R.|last2=Calabrese|first2=Richard J.|date=1975-12-01|title=Some explorations in initial interaction and beyond: Toward a developmental theory of interpersonal communication|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=99â112|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1975.tb00258.x|issn=1468-2958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Mitchell R.|last2=Wiseman|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasmussen|first3=J.

==Differences between URT/AUM and the introduction of anxiety==

URT is based on the human's thought process and their approach to social situation in which they have uncertainty. URT suggests that uncertainty stems from the human's attempts to "[proactively predict] ''the other's attitudes, values, feelings, beliefs and behaviors''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; during social encounters. Humans attempt to reduce their uncertainty in social encounters when there is a motivation to do so,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; URT highlights three core motivations; they anticipate other social interaction at another point in time, the recipient has something the human needs or wants as a form of reward and/or the recipient is acting in a strange or deviant which is unexpected.&lt;ref name="Berger2"&gt;Berger, C. 1979. ''The contact hypothesis in ethnic relations''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

Berger identified 7 axioms and 21 theorems within URT&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (theoretical statements which are generally excepted, but can be used to observe behaviours to be further proved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theorem|title=the definition of theorem|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with these theorems providing the inspiration for a multitude of expansions to the theory, one of which is AUM. AUM uses the foundations of URT to formulate 47 axioms, with AUM integrating the human anxiety management within social situations, as well as their uncertainty management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; AUM builds on URT's focus on individual or one-to-one communication, as the axioms and theorems focus on intercultural and intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Gudykunst3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Young Yun|last2=Gudykunst|first2=William B.|date=1988|title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation: Current Approaches.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED351737|journal=International and Intercultural Communication Annual|language=en|volume=11|pages=|issn=0270-6075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

AUM incorporates both the URT and the works of Stephan and Stephan on anxiety within his axioms to expand URT to explain intergroup communications.&lt;ref name="Stephan&amp;Stephan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Walter G.|last2=Stephan|first2=Cookie White|date=1985-10-01|title=Intergroup Anxiety|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=157â175|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; AUM focuses on both anxiety and uncertainty reduction, this highlights the major difference between URT and AUM, with the intended outcome of URT being simply to reduce [[uncertainty]], whereas AUM's outcome was for cultural adaptation and not solely the reduction of uncertainty. The inherent difference is that managing anxiety is to maintain it between minimum and maximum thresholds along a spectrum while reducing anxiety is unidirectional. This realization, along with the introduction of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] as a factor of effective communication, led Gudykunst to finally designate an appropriate name for his research: Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory (AUM).

Gudykunst assumed that at least one person in an intercultural encounter is a stranger. He argues that strangers undergo both anxiety and uncertainty; they donât feel secure and they arenât sure how to behave. Gudykunst noted that strangers and in-group members experience some degree of anxiety and uncertainty in any new interpersonal situation, but when the encounter takes place between people of different cultures, strangers are hyperaware of cultural differences. They then tend to overestimate the effect of cultural identity on the behavior of people in an alien society, while blurring individualsâ distinctions.

The purpose of the first iteration of AUM was to be a practical application with a high degree of utility. The format of AUM includes numerous [[axioms]], which in turn converge on one another moving in the direction of effective communication. (See Figure X). The specific number of [[axioms]] has varied over the last fifteen years according to updated research in the field of cross-cultural communication.

==Scope of AUM==
Communication theories commonly focus on 4 levels: [[individual]], [[interpersonal]], [[intergroup]], and [[cultural]].&lt;ref name="Doise"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/levels-of-explanation-in-social-psychology/oclc/13004532|title=Levels of explanation in social psychology|last=Doise|first=Willem|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press ; Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l'Homme|isbn=978-0521307482|location=Cambridge [Cambridgeshire]; New York; Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

â¢ The [[individual]] level is the motivation for human communication, influencing the ways humans create and interpret messages (for example the need for group inclusion and self-concept support).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

â¢ The [[interpersonal]] level is the way the message is exchanged when humans are communicating as an individual (for example one-on-one communication, intimate relationships and social networks).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

â¢ The [[intergroup]] level is the exchange of messages when humans are communicating as a collective (for example social identities, collective self-esteem).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

â¢ The [[cultural]] level is how people communicate similarly or differently dependant on their culture (for example dimensions of cultural variability).&lt;ref name="Doise"/&gt;

AUM focuses on interpersonal and intergroup levels of communication, with Gudykunst's [[axioms]] fitting into either the interpersonal or the intergroup categories. AUM discriminates between interpersonal and intergroup communications by examining predictions of behaviour. If the behaviour can be explained with cultural norms or with sociological norms, it can be classified as intergroup communication. When the behavior is best explained by psychological factors it is likely interpersonal communication. A second effective differentiator is to examine the identities that guide human behavior. When our behavior is guided by personal or human factors, interpersonal behaviors tend to occur. When it is guided by social factors the opposite is true.

==Working assumptions==
Complex theories such as AUM need to accept certain assumptions as true before the real content can be explored. Some metatheoretical assumptions Gudykunst makes on AUM are on the nature of reality, the way we gain knowledge, and the basis of human behavior. Gudykunst assumes that the basic processes of communication are the same across cultures; only the methods of interpretation vary. Also, he assumes these interpretations are how we gain data to create theories. Finally, and vital to AUM, he assumes that when humans are mindful they have greater control over their communications behaviors. This aspect of human nature is sometimes referred to as determinism.

Gudykunst also employs several theoretical assumptions. The first is that strangers will trigger both interpersonal and intergroup anxiety. The perspective he takes for the sake of developing axioms is that of the stranger immersed in an ingroup.

Another assumption deals with the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold keeps us from getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.

[[Anxiety]] for the purposes of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the fear of negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing [[prejudiced]] when dealing with an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing [[eustress]] and [[Distress (medicine)|distress]] to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared"&lt;ref name="Deutsch"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/45409297|title=The Resolution of Conflict : Constructive and Destructive Processes|last=Deutsch|first=Morton|date=1973|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300016833|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.

Another term needing a working definition for the purpose of anxiety/uncertainty management is "effective communication". Simply put, effective communication is the extent to which a message is interpreted by its recipient with the intended meaning from the sender. Communication is more effective when both the sender and receiver use the same frames of reference. However, in [[intercultural communication]] this is often untrue and interactions with strangers can in turn prove more difficult.

Finally, the mechanism around which anxiety/uncertainty management revolves is [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]]. When people communicate mindlessly, they tend to utilize broad categories and [[stereotypes]] to predict behavior. As mindfulness increases, the categories become more specific and typically more accurate predictors. Since being mindful makes us open to more information we are more likely to correctly identify the receiver's frame of interpretation.

Mindfulness refers to a conscious choice rather than scripted behavior. Em Griffin, author of the Communication book; "A First Look At Communication Theory" and Professor Emeritus of Communications at Wheaton College in Illinois defines mindfulness as "the way that in-group members and strangers can reduce their anxiety and uncertainty to optimum levels".&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Scripted behavior serves us well in familiar situations, but not in cross-cultural communication. William Howell suggests four levels of communication competence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* '''Unconscious incompetence:''' We are unaware that we're misinterpreting others' behavior.
* '''Conscious incompetence:''' We know that we're misinterpreting others' behavior but don't do anything about it.
* '''Conscious competence:''' We think about our communication and continually work to become more effective.
* '''Unconscious competence:''' Our communication skills are automatic.

Gudykunst defined mindfulness as stage three (Conscious competence), in Howell's model. In this stage cognitive choice moderates the destructive force of doubt or fear. The last stage (Unconscious competence), is less competent than stage three and can quickly shift into oblivious incompetence. Mindfulness involves the creation of new categories, a new process of thinking, and formation of a kin which reinforces Delia's description of how a cognitively complex person uses a lot of interpersonal constructs.

==Theory constructions==
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Graphical Representation.svg|thumb|Schematic describing Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory]]
Gudykunst uses two types of theoretical statements to construct his theory; axioms and theorems. Axioms are "propositions that involve variables that are taken to be directly linked causally; axioms should therefore be statements that imply direct causal links among variables"&lt;ref name="Blalock"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/25192027|title=Theory construction : from verbal to mathematical formulations|last=Blalock|first=Hubert M|date=1969|publisher=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. : Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0139133435|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} Some axioms do not apply in all situations. Boundary conditions specify when the axioms hold. The axioms can be combined to derive theorems. When combined the axioms and theorems form a "casual process" theory&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;Reynolds, P. D. 1971.{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A primer in theory construction. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc. that explains effective communication.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2018}} Dialectical processes influence much of our communication within specific interactions. To illustrate, uncertainty involves a dialectic between predictability and novelty. In the current version of the theory, dialectics are incorporated as boundary conditions for the axioms where applicable.

Gudykunst states that in generating the axioms for the theory he assumed that managing anxiety and uncertainty are âbasic causesâ influencing effective communication. Other variables (e.g. self-concepts, motivation, reactions to strangers, social categorization, situational processes, connections with strangers, ethical interactions, anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness and effective communication), are treated as "superficial causes" of effective communication. The influence of these âsuperficial causesâ on effective communication is mediated through anxiety and uncertainty. Being mindful allows us to engage in anxiety and uncertainty management.

Gudykunst uses 47 [[axioms]] as building blocks for the theorems of AUM. Axioms can be thought of as the lowest common denominators from which all causal theorems are derived.

==Self-concepts==
Axioms one through five all relate to our views of ourselves, or self-concepts. Gudykunst includes personal identities, social identities, and collective self-esteem in this category. Social identities are employed when we try to predict intergroup behavior and personal identities are naturally employed for interpersonal behavior. They both act in such a way as to help us manage uncertainty and anxiety by sufficiently predicting behavior. If either of these identities feels threatened, Gudykunst believes that we will attempt to raise collective self-esteem and hence fostering a more positive outcome. The greater our self-esteem, the better we are able to manage our anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth and Death of Meaning: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on the Problem of Man.|last=Ernest.|first=Becker|date=1972|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|isbn=978-0029021903|location=|pages=|oclc=651907062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Motivation==
Gudykunst's next set of axioms suggest that our motivation to interact with strangers is directly related to the fulfillment of needs. First, we have a need to trust others to behave favorably or at least in an expected manner. Second, and only in the context of intergroup relations, we need to feel inclusion with the group or anxiety will surely develop. Paradoxically, the third need that Gudykunst points out is our need for self-concept confirmation. We want to be included in the group, but not to the extent that our identity is lost in the crowd.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Reactions to strangers==
We tend to act more favorably toward strangers whose mannerisms and beliefs converge with our own. In this case, we have a greater propensity to exhibit empathy, tolerate more ambiguity, and have a less rigid social posture when seeking closure. A rigid attitude, or close-minded thinking, leads us to seek closure to an interaction in the most direct way possible. If we were to exhibit [[empathy]] and attempt to think more objectively about the perspective of the stranger, we should in turn be postured to accept more ambiguity and seek the most appropriate solution instead of the most direct.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Social categorization of strangers==
The next seven axioms of this theory focus on how people order their social environments into categories. When people categorize themselves, they become aware of being members of [[ingroup]]s and [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]]s, which generates [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]]. People tend to have more categories for their ingroup than they do for an outgroup, but the more familiar they are with an outgroup, the more categories they see. The categories that people create for outgroups will lead to expectations about the behavior of a member of that group, which can be either positive or negative. Expectations then help people predict, accurately or inaccurately, a stranger's behavior.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Situational processes==
The next four [[axioms]] are based on the situations in which communication occurs. People have different [[behavioral script|scripts]] they expect to follow for a given situation, much like actors may follow a [[movie script]]. Miscommunication occurs when people follow a script they assume the stranger with whom they are communicating to be familiar. People also react to strangers differently based on the conditions in which they interact. For example, cooperation was found to lead to positive feelings towards those one is working with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/276646|title=Cooperation: the basis of sociability|last=Argyle|first=Michael|date=1991|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415035453|location=London ; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People also tend to have less anxiety when there are other members of their ingroups present. Power also affects communication, and a person who feels they have less power than the stranger in an interaction will feel more anxiety towards that interaction.

==Connections with strangers==
The next five axioms are based on connections between people. What the axioms come to is the more connected people feel to strangers, the less [[anxiety]] and [[uncertainty]] they feel in communicating with them. These connections come from [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], [[interdependence]], levels of [[intimacy]], and number of the same people both communicators know.

|}&lt;ref name="Gudykunst"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethical interactions==
The next three axioms are based on [[dignity]] and [[respect]]. Both dignity and respect are assumed to be returned when given to a stranger. This leads to moral inclusiveness, which is good for interactions with strangers because both sides expect the rules of fair play to apply to them. When strangers are considered morally excluded, they are treated almost as nonexistent, or as not deserving of respect or dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opotow|first=Susan|date=1990-04-01|title=Moral Exclusion and Injustice: An Introduction|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=1â20|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00268.x|issn=1540-4560}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral inclusiveness applies not only to communication, but also to bystanders not actively involved in communication with strangers. For example, if a person makes an anti-[[prejudice]] statement, the people he or she is with are less likely to make a [[prejudiced]] statement towards a stranger.

==Anxiety, uncertainty, mindfulness, and effective communication==
Langer states that mindfulness involves creating new categories, an openness to new information, and being aware of strangers' perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindfulness|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|date=1989|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub. Co|isbn=978-0201523416|location=Reading, Mass.|pages=|oclc=18779775}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness is essential for effective communication and one needs to develop mindful ways of learning about strangers. Langer concludes that this should involve: openness to "novelty", awareness of distinctions, being sensitive to different contexts, an awareness of multiple perspectives, and an orientation to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The power of mindful learning|last=Langer|first=Ellen J.|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=978-0738219080|edition=|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=914195352}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, strangers are usually more mindful and able to "negotiate potentially problematic social interactions more effectively" than ingroup members.&lt;ref&gt;Devine, P., Evett, S., &amp; Vasquez-Suson, K. (1996). "Exploring the interpersonal dynamics of intergroup contact". In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition''. (Vol 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;423â464). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ingroup members should be mindful of the process of communicating as opposed to being mindful of the outcome of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=305|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following five axioms are essential for effective communication because they focus on the basic causes and processes of effective communication whereas the previous 34 axioms focused on managing our anxiety and uncertainty when communicating with strangers.

==Cross-cultural variability in AUM processes==
Gudykunst believes that for the theory to be complete there must be a cultural level of analysis included and that the axioms regarding cultural variability should only be tested on the cultural level. It is necessary to address cross-cultural variability in the major components of the theory because different types of anxiety are emphasized more in some cultures than in others. This is because there are differences in the dynamics of stranger-ingroup relationships across cultures. For example, Triandis offers that collectivist cultures tend to make a stronger distinction between ingroup and outgroup members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individualism And Collectivism|authorlink1=Harry C. Triandis|last=Triandis|first=Harry C.|date=1995-05-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780813318509|location=Boulder, Colo.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} whereas members of individualistic cultures usually only draw as sharp of distinctions among differing ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theorizing about intercultural communication|last=Gudykunst|first=William B.|date=2005|publisher=Sage|others=|isbn=9780761927495|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=307|oclc=55800766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
There are many ways AUM theory can be applied. It can be effective in studying the behavior of a stranger adjusting to a new culture, as well as in examining how individuals communicate with strangers and often accurately predict their behavior; this is done when we are mindful. Gudykunst explains that some axioms can be combined to form theorems. These theorems that are generated might be consistent with previous research, while others might be useful for future study. He notes that not all axioms can be combined to form a new theorem. Huber and Sorrentino&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, G., &amp; Sorrentino, R. (1996). ''Uncertainty in interpersonal and intergroup relations.'' In R. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), ''Handbook of motivation and cognition'' (Vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;591â619). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}} differentiate between certaintyâoriented individuals and uncertainty-oriented individuals and argue that theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations have an "uncertainty orientation" bias. Gudykunst gives three reasons why AUM theory is not limited to uncertainty-oriented individuals. First, uncertainty-orientation is incorporated into the theory. Second, the superficial causes or factors that influence our uncertainty in a situation influence the amount of uncertainty we feel. Lastly, our personality characteristics influence our behavior only when we are not mindful. Gudykunst also defends the number of axioms in the theory because when the goal of a theory is to improve communication, one cannot afford to be vague. Gudykunst acknowledges that there are certain areas where additional research is needed. For instance, one cannot always be mindful when communicating. Potential problems then refer to the recognition of instances in which mindfulness is needed and defining the optimal levels of anxiety or uncertainty. Future research needs to develop ways to measure an individual's minimum and maximum thresholds of uncertainty and anxiety in the same way that anxiety and uncertainty are measured. AUM theory is in a constant state of revision and even the current version of the theory is not complete.

===Critiques by Griffin and Ting-Toomey ===
Griffin identifies the complexity of the AUM theory as a weakness arguing, "hypothetically, the 47 axioms could spawn over a thousand theorems."&lt;ref name="Critique"&gt;.{{Cite journal|last=Yoshitake|first=M.|date=2002|title=Anxiety/uncertainty management (AUM) theory: A critical examination of an intercultural communication theory|url=https://web.uri.edu/iaics/files/13-Masaki-Yoshitake.pdf|journal=Intercultural Communication Studies|volume=11|pages=177â193|via=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Potential expansion of the axioms as a result of incorporation of more cultural variability indicates the possibility of causing greater confusion and complication.

Ting-Toomey explores the content of AUM theory as a potential weakness demanding further revision of the theories. She points out five conceptual issues in relation to URT and the social penetration theory.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

''' Conceptual issues of URT and Social Penetration Theory:'''&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;
## the need for motivational factors and other variables of the host side that influence the uncertainty reduction process;
## the lack of attention to relational changes;
## the necessity of actual research on dyadic effect of reciprocity;
## the inevitability of integration of more contextual dimensions into the theories and research;

===Limited focus: effective communication===
[[File:Anxiety-Uncertainty Management Theory - Critique.svg|thumb|Visual representation of Yoshitake's critique of AUM theory.]]

The AUM theory regards effective communication as a primary construct, defining effective communication as the attribution of the closest meaning to incoming messages as intended by the sender which would minimise misunderstanding. This view leads to two potential problems as the definition of effective communication and effective communication as the goal of ICC.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of the definition of effective communication===
There are various reasons for human communication which lead to questioning the possibility and the necessity of attributing the closest meaning to such great variety of communication situations. The AUM theory regards effective communication as attribution of the closest  meaning to the intended meaning diminishes communication mechanical and linear activity "where messages are transferred from sender to receiver".&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Problem of effective communication as a goal of ICC===

AUM theory defines the goal of effective communication as the decrease of miscommunication. Such perspective on communication is mechanical with little emotional attachment, regarding pure communication without misattribution as ideal. As great importance is given to efficiency, culture is referred to as ânoiseâ that obstructs the smooth transition of communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Excessive reliance on consciousness===
Anxiety/uncertainty management theory has been criticised for its heavy focus on the person being mindful during communications, with there being an assumption that a person should have to adopt a high level of consciousness throughout communication. However the theory is difficult to apply to instances where a person is compelled by emotion or irrationality, which overrides conscious thought to reach an end goal during communication.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

===Meta-theoretical critique===
The meta-theoretical assumptions specific to Anxiety/Uncertainty Management theory have been critiqued by Masaki Yoshitake of the University of Oklahoma, who suggests that anxiety/uncertainty management theory is inherently inefficient when attempting to describe a universal experience shared between strangers and members of different cultures. Yoshitake states that it is questionable whether interpersonal communication is really a pure form of communication and suggests a difficulty to determine what is in the mind of a person from another culture altogether. Yoshitake asserts that pure communication never exists in the first place, as every attempt to share a direct experience is mitigated by the limitations of a person's own perceptions. This results in an ever-present "otherness" in communication. Such commentary is a product of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] thought.&lt;ref name="Critique"/&gt;

An '''arrow''' is a [[fin]]-stabilized [[projectile]] that is launched via a [[bow (weapon)|bow]], and usually consists of a long straight stiff shaft with [[stabilizer (aeronautics)|stabilizer]]s called [[fletching]]s, as well as a weighty (and usually sharp and pointed) [[arrowhead]] attached to the front end, and a slot at the rear end called the [[nock (arrow)|nock]] for engaging the [[bowstring]].  The use of bows and arrows by humans predates [[recorded history]] and is common to most [[culture]]s.  A craftsman who makes arrows is a ''[[fletching|fletcher]]'', and one that makes arrowheads is an ''arrowsmith''.&lt;ref name=Paterson56&gt;Paterson ''Encyclopaedia of Archery'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of archery}}
The oldest evidence of stone-tipped projectiles, which may or may not have been propelled by a bow (c.f. [[atlatl]]), dating to c. 64,000 years ago, were found in [[Sibudu Cave]], current [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyn Wadley]] from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] (2010); [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11086110 BBC: Oldest evidence of arrows found]&lt;/ref&gt;
The oldest evidence of the use of bows to shoot arrows dates to about 10,000 years ago; it is based on [[pine]]wood arrows found in the [[Ahrensburg culture|Ahrensburg valley]] north of [[Hamburg]]. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow.&lt;ref&gt;McEwen E, Bergman R, Miller C. Early bow design and construction. Scientific American 1991 vol. 264 pp76-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest bow so far recovered is about 8,000 years old, found in the  [[HolmegÃ¥rd]] swamp in Denmark.
Archery seems to have arrived in the Americas with the [[Arctic small tool tradition]], about 4,500 years ago.

== Size ==
[[Image:arrow.svg|300px|thumb|Schematic of an arrow with many parts.]]
Arrow sizes vary greatly across cultures, ranging from eighteen inches to five feet (45&amp;nbsp;cm to 150&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="stone-glossary-arrow"&gt;[[George Cameron Stone|Stone, George Cameron]] (1934). ''A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration, and Use of Arms and Armor in All Countries and in All Times'', Mineola: Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-40726-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most modern arrows are {{convert|75|cm|in}} to {{convert|96|cm|in}}; most war arrows from [[Mary Rose|an English ship sunk in 1545]] were {{convert|76|cm|in}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maryrose.org/ship/bows2.htm Anon: The Mary Rose; Armament p.7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225160036/http://www.maryrose.org/ship/bows2.htm |date=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very short arrows have been used, shot through a guide attached either to the bow (an "overdraw") or to the archer's wrist (the Turkish "siper").&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Archery and the Composite Bow. Paul E. Klopsteg {{ISBN|1-56416-093-9}} {{ISBN|978-1564160935}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may fly farther than heavier arrows, and an enemy without suitable equipment may find himself unable to return them.

=== Shaft ===
[[Image:Easton Carbon One 900.png|thumb|A sideprofile of an Easton Carbon One arrow with a spine of 900, taken with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The arrow is a bond of two carbon tubes, an inner and an outer tube (black wires). In between both carbon layers, another fiber is used (white fiber). This second fiber is an Mg-Al-Si-fiber. The "white" fiber is twisted around the inner carbon tube. The fibers of the carbon tubes are not twisted, to ensure a maximum of possible mechanical tension of the arrow. The Mg-Al-Si-fiber enhances the flexibility of the arrow. The diameter of a single carbon fiber is approx. 7 Âµm.]]
The shaft is the primary structural element of the arrow, to which the other components are attached. Traditional arrow shafts are made from strong, lightweight [[wood]], [[bamboo]] or [[Phragmites|reeds]], while modern shafts may be made from [[aluminium]], [[carbon fibre reinforced plastic]], or a combination of materials. Such shafts are typically made from an [[aluminium]] core wrapped with a [[carbon fibre]] outer. A traditional premium material is [[Port Orford Cedar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stickbow|url=http://www.stickbow.com/FEATURES/ARROWMAKING/wood.cfm|website=Stickbow.com|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spine ====
The [[stiffness]] of the shaft is known as its ''spine'', referring to how little the shaft bends when compressed, hence an arrow which bends less is said to have more spine.  In order to strike consistently, a group of arrows must be similarly spined.  "Center-shot" bows, in which the arrow passes through the central vertical axis of the bow riser, may obtain consistent results from arrows with a wide range of spines. However, most traditional bows are not center-shot and the arrow has to deflect around the handle in the [[archer's paradox]]; such bows tend to give most consistent results with a narrower range of arrow spine that allows the arrow to deflect correctly around the bow.  Bows with higher draw weight will generally require stiffer arrows, with more spine (less flexibility) to give the correct amount of flex when shot.

==== GPI rating ====
The weight of an arrow shaft can be expressed in GPI ([[grain (unit)|grain]]s per [[inch]]).&lt;ref&gt;GPI explained by [http://www.huntersfriend.com/carbon_arrows/whatsthis3.htm an arrow vendor] (referred to from [http://www.huntersfriend.com/carbon_arrows/hunting_arrows_main_custom_all_specifications.htm their listing of carbon arrows])&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of a shaft in [[inch]]es multiplied by its GPI rating gives the weight of the shaft in [[grain (unit)|grains]]. For example, a shaft that is 30 inches long and has a GPI of 9.5 weighs 285 grains, or about 18 [[gram]]s. This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.

==== Footed arrows ====
Sometimes a shaft will be made of two different types of wood fastened together, resulting in what is known as a footed arrow. Known by some as the finest of wood arrows,&lt;ref name="Langston"&gt;{{cite book |last=Langston |first=Gene |title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible - Volume Three |year=1994 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location=Guilford |isbn=1-58574-087-X |chapter=Custom Shafts }}&lt;/ref&gt; footed arrows were used both by early Europeans and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Footed arrows will typically consist of a short length of [[hardwood]] near the head of the arrow, with the remainder of the shaft consisting of [[softwood]]. By reinforcing the area most likely to break, the arrow is more likely to survive impact, while maintaining overall flexibility and lighter weight.

=== Arrowhead ===
{{main|Arrowhead}}
[[Image:Arrowhead.jpg|thumb|[[Obsidian]] broadhead]]
[[Image:Arrow-head Olynthus BM GR1912.4-19.4.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] bronze arrowhead, 4th century BC,  from [[Olynthus]], [[Chalcidice]]]]

[[Image:CrÃ©cy-en-Ponthieu 24-09-2008 12-11-33.JPG|thumb|Modern replicas of various [[medieval Europe]]an arrowheads]]
The arrowhead or [[projectile point]] is the primary functional part of the arrow, and plays the largest role in determining its purpose. Some arrows may simply use a sharpened tip of the solid shaft, but it is far more common{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} for separate arrowheads to be made, usually from metal, horn, or some other hard material. Arrowheads are usually separated by function:

*'''[[Bodkin point]]s''' are short, rigid points with a small cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron and may have been used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research&lt;ref name="royalarmouries.org"&gt;[http://www.royalarmouries.org/what-we-do/research/analytical-projects/armour-piercing-arrowheads Royal Armouries: 6. Armour-piercing arrowheads]&lt;/ref&gt; has found no hardened bodkin points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated [[Damascus]] [[Mail (armour)|chain armour]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunting with the Bow and Arrow, by Saxton Pope.
https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8hbow10.txt "To test a steel bodkin pointed arrow such as was used at the battle of Cressy, I borrowed a shirt of chain armor from the Museum, a beautiful specimen made in Damascus in the 15th Century. It weighed twenty-five pounds and was in perfect condition. One of the attendants in the Museum offered to put it on and allow me to shoot at him. Fortunately, I declined his proffered services and put it on a wooden box, padded with burlap to represent clothing.

Indoors at a distance of seven yards (6 m), I discharged an arrow at it with such force that sparks flew from the links of steel as from a forge. The bodkin point and shaft went through the thickest portion of the back, penetrated an inch of wood and bulged out the opposite side of the armor shirt. The attendant turned a pale green. An arrow of this type can be shot about two hundred yards, and would be deadly up to the full limit of its flight."&lt;/ref&gt; However, archery was not effective against [[plate armour]], which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland M, Hardy R. The Great Warbow. Sutton Publishing 2005. Page 272&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Blunts''' are unsharpened arrowheads occasionally used for types of target shooting, for shooting at stumps or other targets of opportunity, or hunting small game when the goal is to concuss the target without penetration. Blunts are commonly made of metal or hard rubber. They may stun, and occasionally, the arrow shaft may penetrate the head and the target; safety is still important with blunt arrows.
*'''Judo points''' have spring wires extending sideways from the tip. These catch on grass and debris to prevent the arrow from being lost in the vegetation. Used for practice and for small game.
*'''Broadheads''' were used for war and are still used for hunting. Medieval broadheads could be made from steel,&lt;ref name="royalarmouries.org" /&gt; sometimes with hardened edges. They usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive [[bleeding]] in the victim. Their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill as quickly as possible by cleanly cutting major blood vessels, and cause further trauma on removal. They are expensive, damage most targets, and are usually not used for practice.
:There are two main types of broadheads used by hunters: the '''fixed-blade''' and the '''mechanical''' types.  While the fixed-blade broadhead keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broadhead at all times, the mechanical broadhead deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies better because it is more streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingblades.com/mevsfiblbr.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925203752/http://www.huntingblades.com/mevsfiblbr.html |archivedate=2009-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=This is completely false if the blade is expanded by energy stored in a spring.|date=November 2015}}
*'''Field tips''' are similar to target points and have a distinct shoulder, so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps. They are also used for shooting practice by hunters, by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as broadheads, without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal.
*'''Target points''' are bullet-shaped with a conical point, designed to penetrate [[Archery butt|target butts]] easily without causing excessive damage to them.
*'''Safety arrows''' are designed to be used in various forms of reenactment combat, to reduce the risk when shot at people. These arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded, such as the large foam ball tip used in [[archery tag]]. In combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length, these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armoured people. The parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants. For instance, [[Society for Creative Anachronism|SCA]] combat rules require a padded head at least 1{{fraction|1|4}}" in diameter, with bows not exceeding {{convert|28|in|mm}} and {{convert|50|lb|abbr=on}} of draw for use against well-armoured individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/docs/marshal_handbook.pdf SCA marshall's handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrowheads may be attached to the shaft with a cap, a socketed [[Tang (tools)|tang]], or inserted into a split in the shaft and held by a process called [[hafting]].&lt;ref name="stone-glossary-arrow" /&gt; Points attached with caps are simply slid snugly over the end of the shaft, or may be held on with [[Hot melt adhesive|hot glue]]. Split-shaft construction involves splitting the arrow shaft lengthwise, inserting the arrowhead, and securing it using a [[ferrule]], sinew, or wire.&lt;ref name="TBB-steel_points"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Glenn |authorlink= |title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible - Volume Two |year=1992 |publisher=The Lyons Press |location=Guilford |isbn=1-58574-086-1 |chapter=Steel Points }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fletchings ===
{{main|Fletching}}
[[Image:DFRArrow (1).jpg|thumb|Straight parabolic [[fletching]]s on an arrow.]]
[[Image:Poprad CoA - new version.svg|thumb|150px|An arrow as a heraldic symbol| Coat of arms of [[Poprad]] in Slovakia. (An arrow as a heraldic symbol.)]]
Fletchings are found at the back of the arrow and act as [[airfoil]]s to provide a small amount of force used to stabilize the flight of the arrow. They are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly damping down any tendency to [[flight dynamics|pitch or yaw]].  Some cultures, for example most in [[New Guinea]], did not use fletching on their arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Gardens of War: Life and Death in the New Guinea Stone Age. Robert Gardner. Deutsch 1969. {{ISBN|0-233-96140-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-233-96140-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, arrows without fletching (called '''bare shaft''') are used for training purposes, because they make certain errors by the archer more visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stonebraker|first1=Rick|title=Tune for Tens|url=http://texasarchery.org/BoardMembers/RickStonebrakerPages/TuningForTens/TuningForTens.html|website=texasarchery.org|accessdate=23 June 2016|date=2000|quote=WHY A BARE SHAFT? If shot at short distance through paper into a butt, a bare shaft will reveal improper thrust effects since aerodynamics will not have time to straighten out the flight of the arrow. It will literally fly sideways through the paper creating a tell-tale pattern if the tune is bad. Fletching would straighten out the arrow's flight and make this first stage of tuning more difficult.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fletchings are traditionally made from [[feather]]s (often from a [[goose]] or [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]) bound to the arrow's shaft, but are now often made of [[plastic]] (known as "vanes"). Historically, some arrows used for the [[proofing of armour]] used [[copper]] vanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ffoulkes|first=Charles |authorlink = Charles ffoulkes|title=The Armourer and his Craft|year=1988|origyear=1912|edition=Dover reprint|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-25851-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight archers may use razor blades for fletching, in order to reduce air resistance. With conventional three-feather fletching, one feather, called the "cock" feather, is at a right angle to the nock, and is normally nocked so that it will not contact the bow when the arrow is shot. Four-feather fletching is usually symmetrical and there is no preferred orientation for the nock; this makes nocking the arrow slightly easier.

Natural feathers are usually prepared by splitting and sanding the quill before gluing.  Further, the feather may be trimmed to shape, die-cut or burned by a hot electrically-heated wire. It's crucial that all the feathers of an arrow have the same drag, so manual trimming is rarely used by modern fletchers. The burning-wire method is popular because different shapes are possible by bending the wire, and the fletching can be symmetrically trimmed after gluing by rotating the arrow on a fixture.

Some fletchings are dyed. Two-toned fletchings usually make each fletching from two feathers knit together. The front fletching is often camouflaged, and the rear fletching bright so that the archer can easily track the arrow.

Artisans who make arrows by hand are known as "fletchers," a word related to the French word for arrow, ''flÃ¨che.''  This is the same derivation as the verb "fletch," meaning to provide an arrow with its feathers. Glue and thread are the traditional methods of attaching fletchings.  A "fletching jig" is often used in modern times, to hold the fletchings in exactly the right orientation on the shaft while the glue hardens.

Whenever natural fletching is used, the feathers on any one arrow must come from the same wing of the bird. The most common being the right-wing flight feathers of turkeys.  The slight cupping of natural feathers requires them to be fletched with a right-twist for right wing, a left-twist for left wing. This rotation, through a combination of gyroscopic stabilization and increased drag on the rear of the arrow, helps the arrow to fly straight away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huntersfriend.com/archery-help/hunting-target-arrows-selection-guide-chapter-1.html|title=Carbon Arrow University|website=www.huntersfriend.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial ''helical'' fletchings have the same effect. Most arrows will have three fletches, but some have four or even more. Fletchings generally range from two to six inches (152&amp;nbsp;mm) in length; flight arrows intended to travel the maximum possible distance typically have very low fletching, while hunting arrows with broadheads require long and high fletching to stabilize them against the aerodynamic effect of the head.  Fletchings may also be cut in different ways, the two most common being ''parabolic'' (i.e. a smooth curved shape) and ''shield'' (i.e. shaped as one-half of a very narrow shield) cut.

In modern archery with screw-in points, right-hand rotation is generally preferred as it makes the points self-tighten.  In traditional archery, some archers prefer a left rotation because it gets the hard (and sharp) quill of the feather farther away from the arrow-shelf and the shooter's hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huntersfriend.com/archery-help/traditional-recurve-bow-and-longbow-selection-guide.html|title=Traditional Bow Selection Guide|website=www.huntersfriend.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Flu-Flu Arrow|flu-flu]] is a form of fletching, normally made by using long sections of full length feathers taken from a turkey, in most cases six or more sections are used rather than the traditional three. Alternatively two long feathers can be spiraled around the end of the arrow shaft. The extra fletching generates more drag and slows the arrow down rapidly after a short distance, about 30 m or so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Flu-Flu arrows are often used for hunting birds, or for children's archery, and can also be used to play [[Flu-Flu Golf]].

=== Nocks ===
In English it is common to say "nock an arrow" when one readies a shot. A nock is a notch in the rearmost end of an arrow.  It helps keep the arrow correctly rotated. It also keeps the arrow from slipping sideways during the draw or after the release. It also helps maximize the arrow's energy (i.e. its range and lethality) by helping an archer place the arrow at the fastest-moving place on the bowstring. Some archers mark the nock position with beads, knots or wrappings of thread.

The main purpose of a nock is to control the rotation of the arrow. Arrows bend when released. If the bend hits the bowstave, the arrow's aim will be thrown off.  Wooden arrows have a preferred bending-plane. Synthetic arrows have a designed bending plane. Usually this plane is determined by the grain of the wood of the arrow, or the structure of a synthetic arrow. The nock's slot should be rotated at an angle chosen so that when the arrow bends, it avoids or slides on the bowstave. Almost always this means that the slot of the nock must be perpendicular to the wood's grain, viewed from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Nocks|url=http://www.stickbow.com/FEATURES/ARROWMAKING/selfnock.CFM|website=Stickbow.com|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Self nocks'' are slots cut in the back of the arrow. These are simple, but can break at the base of the slot. Self nocks are often reinforced with glued servings of fiber near the base of the slot. The sturdiest nocks are separate pieces made from wood, plastic, or horn that are then attached to the end of the arrow.&lt;ref name="TBB-self_arrows"&gt;Massey, Jay(1992). "Self Arrows" in ''The Traditional Bowyer's Bible - Volume One'', Guilford: The Lyons Press. {{ISBN|1-58574-085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern nocks, and traditional Turkish nocks, are often constructed so as to curve around the string or even pinch it slightly, so that the arrow is unlikely to slip off.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;[[George Cameron Stone|Stone, G.C.]] "A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of
Arms and Armor"&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient Arab archery sometimes used "nockless arrows." In shooting at enemies, Arabs saw them pick up Arab arrows and shoot them back. So Arabs developed bowstrings with a small ring tied where the nock would normally be placed. The rear end of the arrow would be sharpened to a point, rather than slit for a nock. The rear end of the arrow would slip into the ring. The arrow could be drawn and released as usual. Then the enemy could collect the arrows, yet not shoot them back with a conventional bow. Also, since there was no nock, the nock could not break, and the arrow was less expensive. A piece of battle advice was to have several rings tied to the bowstring in case one broke.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, Nabih Amin, and Robert Potter Elmer. Chapter XLIV. "On Stunt Shooting." IN: Arab archery. An Arabic manuscript of about A.D. 1500, "A book on the excellence of the bow &amp; arrow" and the description thereof. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1945. Pages 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; A practical disadvantage compared to a nock would be preserving the optimal rotation of the arrow, so that when it flexes, it does not hit the bowstave. The bend direction of the arrow might have been indicated by its fletching.

==Finishes and cresting==
Arrows are usually finished so that they are not softened by rain, fog or condensation. Traditional finishes are [[varnish]]es or [[lacquer]]s. Arrows sometimes need to be repaired, so it's important that the paints be compatible with glues used to attach arrowheads, fletchings and nocks. For this reason, arrows are rarely protected by waxing.

Crests are rings of color painted on arrows in a unique arrangement to indicate the owner of the arrow. An arrow is usually crested on a lathe-like tool called a cresting machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stickbow|url=http://www.stickbow.com/FEATURES/ARROWMAKING/CREST1.cfm|website=Stickbow.com|accessdate=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

Bankson T. Holcomb Jr. was born on April 14, 1908, in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], the son of prominent insurance businessman Bankson T. Holcomb Sr. and his wife Julian Newton Holcomb. His family moved to [[China]] in 1921 and Bankson Jr. attended [[Peking]] American High School within the [[Peking American Legation|American Legation]].

Following his 17th birthday, impressed by the local Marine detachment, Banks decided to enlist in the Marine Corps in April 1925. Holcomb served as enlisted man for next six months and was decorated with [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal]] for his service.&lt;ref name='U.S. Navy Codebreakers, Linguists, and Intelligence Officers against Japan' /&gt;&lt;ref name='U.S. Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association'&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=George P.|author2= |title=U.S. Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association|publisher=Turner Publishing Company|location=|year=1996|pages=20|isbn=|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=AbjIjcU7JXcC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Bankson+T.+Holcomb&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Bankson%20T.%20Holcomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=April 9, 2017|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His superior recommended him for [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]]. However Holcomb failed the [[Ancient history]] exam and was transferred to the [[Private school|private]] [[Hampton Roads Academy|Virginia Preparatory School in Hampton Roads]]. He was successful the second time and was admitted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] in June 1927. Four years later, Holcomb graduated with the Class of 1931 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps in June 1931.&lt;ref name="Valor awards for Bankson T. Holcomb" /&gt; Because of his knowledge of [[Chinese language]] and interest in [[Orient]], he was nicknamed "Chink" by his classmates.&lt;ref name='U.S. Navy Codebreakers, Linguists, and Intelligence Officers against Japan' /&gt;&lt;ref name='U.S. Naval Cryptologic Veterans Association' /&gt; Banks was also active in the [[Track and field|track]], [[Cross country running|cross country running team]], [[Gymkhana (equestrian)|Gymkhana]] or was a member of radio club.&lt;ref name="Lucky Bag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usna.com/|title= Lucky Bag - USNA Class of 1931|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartleby.com''' is an [[e-text|electronic text]] archive, headquartered in Los Angeles and named after [[Herman Melville]]'s story "[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]." It was founded under the name "Project Bartleby" in January 1993 by Steven H. van Leeuwen as a personal, non-profit collection of classic literature on the website of [[Columbia University]]. In February 1994 he published the first classic book in [[HTML]], Whitman's ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 it moved to its own domain, bartleby.com, and was called "The New Bartleby Library", where it continued to publish highly accurate transcriptions. In September 1999 Bartleby.com was incorporated and started to focus on reference works, including the contemporary 6th edition of the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]''.

In June 2009, licensed reference works from Columbia University Press and [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] were removed from the site "due to financial and usage considerations." By January 2013, on its twentieth anniversary, more than one billion pages had been accessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Significance ==
For [[Giorgio Melchiori]], it is suggestive of the idea that in [[literary text]]s, there is not a single language, but a multitude of languages, a different one for each reader of the text.&lt;ref name="Melchiori1988"/&gt;{{rp|16}} It has been compared with the language of Joyce's novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Emory University| last = Ferris| first = Kathleen Richard| title = James Joyce, Wandering Jew| location = United States -- Georgia| accessdate = 2016-05-17| date = 1989| url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/303794530/abstract/CE031289D61944E4PQ/7|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also provided the inspiration for [[C.

Linguist [[John Haiman (linguist)|John Haiman]] compares Bellsybabble to ordinary [[language]] in the way it continually shapes, and is in turn shaped by, the utterances spoken within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-511524-6| last = Haiman| first = John| title = Talk is cheap : sarcasm, alienation, and the evolution of language| location = Oxford| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|178}} This challenges the rigid [[Langue and parole|separation]] between [[Linguistic competence|code]] and [[linguistic performance|message]]. On one hand, the language determines the presupposed content and boundaries of possible messages, as shown by the concept of [[linguistic relativity]]. On the other hand, the message may also affect the code used by that very message.&lt;ref&gt;In English, this can happen in sentences of the type "A is B", where "A" differs from "B" in person or number. Here the grammatical pattern that requires a verb to [[Grammatical agreement|agree]] with its subject can give way, allowing agreement with whatever is asserted to be identical to the subject. Thus in the sentence "[[Our Father]], who ''are'' in heaven," it is only the use of "Our Father" as a term of address that allows the verb "are" to be in the second person. (Haiman 1998, p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bombard The Headquarters â My Big-Character Poster''''' ({{Zh|c=ç®æå¸ä»¤é¨ââæçä¸å¼ å¤§å­æ¥}}) was a short document written by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] on August 5, 1966 during the 11th Plenary Session of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and published on the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]'s official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' a year later, on August 5, 1967.

It is commonly believed that this "poster" directly targeted Chinese President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and senior leader [[Deng Xiaoping]], who were then in charge of Chinese government's daily affairs and who tried to cool down the mass hysteria which had been coming into shape in several universities in [[Beijing]] since the [[Cultural Revolution#May 16 notification|May 16 Notice]], through which Mao officially launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], was issued.

Much larger scale of mass persecutions came after the publication of this [[big-character poster]], resulting in turmoil of the whole country and the death of thousands of "class enemies", including President Liu Shaoqi.

The original text of the poster was:

English translation:
{{quote|China's first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster and Commentator's article on it in People's Daily are indeed superbly written! Comrades, please read them again. But in the last fifty days or so some leading comrades from the central down to the local levels have acted in a diametrically opposite way. Adopting the reactionary stand of the bourgeoisie, they have enforced a bourgeois dictatorship and struck down the surging movement of the great cultural revolution of the proletariat. They have stood facts on their head and juggled black and white, encircled and suppressed revolutionaries, stifled opinions differing from their own, imposed a white terror, and felt very pleased with themselves. They have puffed up the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and deflated the morale of the proletariat. How poisonous! Viewed in connection with the Right deviation in 1962 and the wrong tendency of 1964 which was 'Left' in form but Right in essence, shouldn't this make one wide awake?}}

The '''Confederate States of America''' ('''CSA''' or '''C.S.'''), commonly referred to as the '''Confederacy''' and '''the South''', was an [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognized country]] in North America that existed from 1861 to 1865. The Confederacy was originally formed by seven [[secession]]ist slave-holding [[U.S. state|states]]â[[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], and [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]]âin the [[Deep South|Lower South]] region of the United States, whose economy was heavily dependent upon agriculture, particularly cotton, and a [[Plantations in the American South|plantation system]] that relied upon the labor of [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].&lt;ref name="IndEcon"/&gt;

Each state declared its secession from the United States, which became known as the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the ensuing [[American Civil War|civil war]], following the [[United States presidential election, 1860|November 1860 election]] of [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the U.S. presidency on a platform which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Before Lincoln took office in March, a new Confederate government was established in February 1861, which was considered illegal by the government of the United States. States volunteered militia units and the new government hastened to form its own [[Confederate States Army]] from scratch practically overnight. After the [[American Civil War]] began in April, four slave states of the [[Upper South]]â[[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]]âalso declared their secession and joined the Confederacy.  The Confederacy later accepted [[Confederate government of Missouri|Missouri]] and [[Confederate government of Kentucky|Kentucky]] as members, although neither officially declared secession nor were they ever largely controlled by Confederate forces; Confederate [[wikt:shadow government|shadow governments]] attempted to control the two states but were later exiled from them.

Red represents southern seceded states in rebellion, also known as the Confederate States of America. Uncolored areas were U.S. territories, with the exception of the [[Indian Territory]] (later [[Oklahoma]]).]]

The government of the United States ([[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]]) rejected the claims of secession and considered the Confederacy illegally founded. The War began with the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Confederate attack upon Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, a Union fort in the harbor of [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

On February 22, 1862, the [[Confederate States Constitution|Confederate Constitution]] of seven state signatories â [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]], [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], [[Florida in the American Civil War|Florida]], [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]], [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the American Civil War|Louisiana]], and [[Texas in the American Civil War|Texas]] â replaced the [[Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States|Provisional Constitution]]  of February 8, 1861, with one stating in its preamble a desire for a "permanent federal government". Four additional slave-holding states â [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the American Civil War|Tennessee]], and [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] â declared their secession and joined the Confederacy following [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|a call]] by U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] for troops from each state to recapture [[Fort Sumter|Sumter]] and other seized federal properties in the South.&lt;ref name="online"&gt;David R. Zimring, "'Secession in Favor of the Constitution': How West Virginia Justified Separate Statehood during the Civil War." ''West Virginia History'' 3.2 (2009): 23â51. [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/361971/summary online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] and [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] were represented by partisan factions adopting the forms of state governments without control of substantial territory or population in either case. The antebellum state governments in both maintained their representation in the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. Also fighting for the Confederacy were two of the "[[Five Civilized Tribes]]" â the [[Choctaw]] and the [[Chickasaw]] â in [[Indian Territory]] and a new, but uncontrolled, [[Confederate Arizona|Confederate Territory of Arizona]]. Efforts by certain factions in [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]] to secede were halted by federal imposition of [[martial law]]; [[Delaware in the American Civil War|Delaware]], though of divided loyalty, did not attempt it. A [[Restored Government of Virginia|Unionist government]] was formed in opposition to the secessionist state government in Richmond and administered the western parts of Virginia that had been occupied by Federal troops. The Restored Government later recognized the new state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]], which was admitted to the Union during the war on June 20, 1863, and re-located to [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name="online"/&gt;

Confederate control over its claimed territory and population in congressional districts steadily shrank from 73% to 34% during the course of the [[American Civil War]] due to the Union's successful overland campaigns, its control of the inland waterways into the South, and its [[Union blockade|blockade]] of the southern coast.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, Kenneth C., op. cit., 1994, pp. 43â53.&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on January 1, 1863, the Union made abolition of slavery a war goal (in addition to reunion). As Union forces moved southward, large numbers of plantation slaves were freed. Many joined the Union lines, enrolling in service as soldiers, teamsters and laborers. The most notable advance was Sherman's "[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]" in late 1864. Much of the Confederacy's infrastructure was destroyed, including telegraphs, railroads and bridges. Plantations in the path of Sherman's forces were severely damaged. Internal movement became increasingly difficult for Southerners, weakening the economy and limiting army mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Burke Davis, ''Sherman's march'' (2016) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

These losses created an insurmountable disadvantage in men, [[materiel]], and finance. Public support for Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]]'s administration eroded over time due to repeated military reverses, economic hardships, and allegations of autocratic government. After four years of campaigning, Richmond was captured by Union forces in April 1865. A few days later General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], effectively signalling the collapse of the Confederacy. President Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, and jailed in preparation for a treason trial that was ultimately never held.&lt;ref&gt;Weigley (2000), p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:CSA states evolution.gif|thumb|upright=1.8|Evolution of the Confederate States, December 20, 1860 â July 15, 1870]]
The initial Confederacy was established in the [[Montgomery Convention]] in February 1861 by seven states ([[South Carolina in the Civil War|South Carolina]],  [[Mississippi in the Civil War|Mississippi]], [[Alabama in the Civil War|Alabama]], [[Florida in the Civil War|Florida]], [[Georgia in the Civil War|Georgia]], [[Louisiana in the Civil War|Louisiana]], adding [[Texas in the Civil War|Texas]] in March before Lincoln's inauguration), expanded in MayâJuly 1861 (with [[Virginia in the Civil War|Virginia]], [[Arkansas in the Civil War|Arkansas]], [[Tennessee in the Civil War|Tennessee]], [[North Carolina in the Civil War|North Carolina]]), and was disintegrated in AprilâMay 1865. It was formed by delegations from seven slave states of the [[Lower South]] that had proclaimed their secession from the Union. After the fighting began in April, four additional slave states seceded and were admitted. Later, two slave states (Missouri and Kentucky) and two territories were given seats in the Confederate Congress. Southern [[California in the American Civil War|California]], although having some pro-Confederate sentiment, was never organized as a territory.

That regionalism became a Southern nationalism, or the "Cause". For the duration of its existence, the Confederacy underwent trial by war.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas. ''The Confederate Nation''. pp. 3â4.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Southern Cause" transcended the ideology of [[states' rights]], tariff policy, or internal improvements. This "Cause" supported, or descended from, cultural and financial dependence on the South's slavery-based economy. The convergence of race and slavery, politics, and economics raised almost all South-related policy questions to the status of moral questions over way of life, commingling love of things Southern and hatred of things [[Yankee]] (the North). Not only did national political parties split, but national churches and interstate families as well divided along sectional lines as the war approached.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas. ''The Confederate Nation''. pp. 4â5 and notes.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian John M. Coski,

Southern Democrats had chosen [[John C. Breckinridge|John Breckinridge]] as their candidate during the U.S. presidential election of 1860, but in no Southern state (other than South Carolina, where the legislature chose the electors) was support for him unanimous; all of the other states recorded at least some popular votes for one or more of the other three candidates (Abraham Lincoln, [[Stephen A. Douglas]] and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]). Support for these candidates, collectively, ranged from significant to an outright majority, with extremes running from 25% in Texas to 81% in Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1860|title=1860 Presidential General Election Results |publisher= |accessdate= September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were minority views everywhere, especially in the upland and plateau areas of the South, with western Virginia and eastern Tennessee of particular concentration.&lt;ref&gt;The first six signatory states establishing the Confederacy counted about one-fourth its population. They voted 43% for pro-Union candidates. The four states which entered after the attack on Fort Sumter held almost half the population of the Confederacy and voted 53% for pro-Union candidates. The three big turnout states voted extremes. Texas, with 5% of the population, voted 20% for pro-Union candidates. Kentucky and Missouri, with one-fourth the Confederate population, voted a combined 68% for the pro-Union Lincoln, Douglas and Bell. See Table of election returns at [[United States presidential election, 1860]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following South Carolina's unanimous 1860 secession vote, no other Southern states considered the question until 1861, and when they did none had a unanimous vote. All had residents who cast significant numbers of Unionist votes in either the legislature, conventions, popular referendums, or in all three. Voting to remain in the Union did not necessarily mean that individuals were northern sympathizers. Once hostilities began, many of these who voted to remain in the Union, particularly in the Deep South, accepted the majority decision, and supported the Confederacy.&lt;ref name="personal.tcu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/Crofts.htm |title=Reluctant Confederates |publisher= Personal.tcu.edu |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Civil War became an American tragedy, what some scholars termed the "Brothers' War", pitting "brother against brother, father against son, kin against kin of every degree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coulter |first=E.

===A revolution in disunion===
{{Main|Origins of the American Civil War}}
{{See also|Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War}}
According to historian Avery O. Craven in 1950, the Confederate States of America was created by [[Secession in the United States|secessionists]] in Southern slave states who believed that the federal government was making them second-class citizens and refused to honor their belief that [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was beneficial to the [[African American|Negro]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated350"&gt;Craven, Avery O., ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism. 1848â1861'' (1953). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; They judged the agent of change to be [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and anti-slavery elements in the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], whom they believed used repeated insult and injury to subject them to intolerable "humiliation and degradation".&lt;ref name="autogenerated350"/&gt; The "Black Republicans" (as the Southerners called them) and their allies soon dominated the U.S. House, Senate, and Presidency. On the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] (a presumed supporter of slavery) was 83 years old, and ailing.

During [[United States presidential election, 1860|the campaign for president in 1860]], some secessionists threatened disunion should Lincoln (who opposed the expansion of slavery into the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]) be elected, most notably [[William L. Yancey]]. Yancey toured the North calling for secession as [[Stephen A. Douglas]] toured the South calling for union in the event of Lincoln's election.&lt;ref name="disunion_v_ii"&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Freehling |first1= William W. |title= The Road to Disunion: Volume II, Secessionists Triumphant |year=1990 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York }} p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; To the Secessionists the Republican intent was clear: to contain slavery within its present bounds, and, eventually, to eliminate it entirely. A Lincoln victory presented them with a momentous choice (as they saw it), even before his inauguration â "the Union without slavery, or slavery without the Union".&lt;ref&gt;Craven. ''The Growth of Southern Nationalism''. p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Causes of secession====
The immediate catalyst for secession was the victory of the Republican Party and the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in the 1860 elections. American Civil War historian [[James M. McPherson]] suggested that, for the Southerners, the most ominous feature of the Republican victories in the Congressional and Presidential elections of 1860 was the magnitude of those victories. Republicans captured over 60 percent of the Northern vote, and won three-fourths of its Congressional delegations. The Southern press said that such Republicans represented the anti-slavery portion of the North, "a party founded on the single sentiment&amp;nbsp;... of hatred of African slavery", and now the controlling power in national affairs. The "Black Republican party" could overwhelm conservative Yankees. ''The New Orleans Delta'' said of the Republicans, "It is in fact, essentially, a revolutionary party" to overthrow slavery.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson. pp. 232â233.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, sectional disagreements between North and South relate primarily to the maintenance or expansion of [[slavery in the United States]]. Historian [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] observed that "leaders of the secession movement across the South cited slavery as the most compelling reason for southern independence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Faust |first= Drew Gilpin |authorlink= Drew Gilpin Faust |title= The Creation of Confederate Nationalism: Ideology and Identity in the Civil War South |year=1988 |publisher= Louisiana State University Press |location= Baton Rouge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most white Southerners did not own slaves, the majority supported the institution of slavery and benefited in indirect ways from the slave society. For struggling yeomen and subsistence farmers, the slave society provided a large class of people ranked lower in the social scale than they.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Murrin |first=John |title= Liberty, Equality, Power |year=2001 |page=1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary differences related to issues of free speech, runaway slaves, expansion into Cuba, and [[states' rights]].

Historian [[Emory Thomas]] assessed the Confederacy's self-image by studying the correspondence sent by the Confederate government in 1861â62 to foreign governments. He found that Confederate diplomacy projected multiple contradictory self-images:

{{quote|The Southern nation was by turns a guileless people attacked by a voracious neighbor, an 'established' nation in some temporary difficulty, a collection of bucolic aristocrats making a romantic stand against the banalities of industrial democracy, a cabal of commercial farmers seeking to make a pawn of [[King Cotton]], an apotheosis of nineteenth-century nationalism and revolutionary liberalism, or the ultimate statement of social and economic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Emory M. Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation: 1861â1865'' (1979), pp. 83â84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Alexander Stephens -1855.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander H. Stephens. CSA Vice President; author of 'Cornerstone Speech']]

In what later became known as the [[Cornerstone Speech]], C.S. Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens]] declared that the "cornerstone" of the new government "rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery â subordination to the superior race â is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson p. 244, quoting Stephens' "Cornerstone Speech".&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Stephens made efforts to qualify his remarks, claiming they were extemporaneous, metaphorical, and intended to refer to public sentiment rather than "the principles of the new Government on this subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Davis |first1=William C. |title=A Government of Our Own: The Making of the Confederacy |year=1994 |publisher= Free Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-02-907735-1|pages=294â295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What I Really Said in the Cornerstone Speech" {{Cite book |last1=Stephens |first1=Alexander Hamilton |authorlink1=Alexander H.

Georgia also claimed a general Federal policy of favoring Northern over Southern economic interests. Texas mentioned slavery 21 times, but also listed the failure of the federal government to live up to its obligations, in the original annexation agreement, to protect settlers along the exposed western frontier. Texas resolutions further stated that governments of the states and the nation were established "exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity". They also stated that although equal civil and political rights applied to all white men, they did not apply to those of the "African race", further opining that the end of racial enslavement would "bring inevitable calamities upon both [races] and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states".&lt;ref name="Thetext" /&gt;

Alabama did not provide a separate declaration of causes. Instead the Alabama ordinance stated "the election of Abraham Lincoln&amp;nbsp;... by a sectional party, avowedly hostile to the domestic institutions and to the peace and security of the people of the State of Alabama, preceded by many and dangerous infractions of the Constitution of the United States by many of the States and people of the northern section, is a political wrong of so insulting and menacing a character as to justify the people of the State of Alabama in the adoption of prompt and decided measures for their future peace and security". The ordinance invited "the slaveholding States of the South, who may approve such purpose, in order to frame a provisional as well as a permanent Government upon the principles of the Constitution of the United States" to participate in a February 4, 1861 [[Montgomery Convention|convention]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/history/constitutions/1861/1861ord1_20.html#anchor588392 |title=Constitution of 1861, Ordinances 1 â 20 |publisher=Legislature.state.al.us |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426223827/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/history/constitutions/1861/1861ord1_20.html#anchor588392 |archivedate= April 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secession ordinances of the remaining two states, Florida and Louisiana, simply declared their severing of ties with the federal Union, without stating any causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ufdc.ufl.edu/SA00000002/00002 |title= Ordinance of secession |publisher= Ufdc.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.youngsanders.org/youngsandersordinance.html |title=Young Sanders Center |work= Youngsanders.org |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterward, the Florida secession convention formed a committee to draft a declaration of causes, but the committee was discharged before completion of the task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarcauses.org/florida-dec-details.htm "More details on Florida's 'declaration of causes'"]&lt;/ref&gt; Only an undated, untitled draft remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarcauses.org/florida-dec.htm "Florida Declaration of Causes"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the Upper South states initially rejected secession until after the clash at Ft. Sumter (Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina).&lt;ref name="personal.tcu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/Civil-War/Secession.htm |title= Library of Virginia: Civil War Research Guide â Secession |publisher= Lva.virginia.gov |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.butlercenter.org/civilwararkansas/history.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140326011329/http://www.butlercenter.org/civilwararkansas/history.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= March 26, 2014 |title= A Nation Divided: Arkansas in the Civil War â History |publisher= Butlercenter.org |date=  |accessdate= April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.ncsu.edu/projects/cwnc/items/show/102 |title= Civil War Era NC &amp;#124; North Carolina voters rejected a secession convention, February 28, 1861 |publisher= History.ncsu.edu |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Whiteaker |first= Larry H. |url= http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=265 |title= Civil War &amp;#124; Entries |publisher= Tennessee Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate= April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's ordinance stated a kinship with the slave-holding states of the Lower South, but did not name the institution itself as a primary reason for its course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/ordinanceofsecession.html |title=Virginia Ordinance of Secession |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arkansas's secession ordinance primarily revolved around strong objection to the use of military force to maintain the Union as its motivating factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#Arkansas |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the outbreak of war, the Arkansas Convention had on March 20 given as their first resolution: "The people of the Northern States have organized a political party, purely sectional in its character, the central and controlling idea of which is hostility to the institution of African slavery, as it exists in the Southern States; and that party has elected a President&amp;nbsp;... pledged to administer the Government upon principles inconsistent with the rights and subversive of the interests of the Southern States."&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Both Sessions of the Conventions of the State of Arkansas: Which Were Begun and Held in the Capitol, in the City of Little Rock'', 1861, pp. 51â54&lt;/ref&gt;

North Carolina and Tennessee limited their ordinances to simply withdrawing, although Tennessee went so far as to make clear they wished to make no comment at all on the "abstract doctrine of secession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#North%20Carolina |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/csa/ordinances_secession.htm#Tennessee |title=Ordinances of Secession |publisher=Constitution.org |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a message to the Confederate Congress on April 29, 1861 [[Jefferson Davis]] cited both the tariff and slavery for the South's secession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=524-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22annual+register,+1861%22#v=onepage Annual Register... for 1861] (1862) pp.233â239&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secessionists and conventions====
The [[Fire-Eaters]], calling for immediate secession, were opposed by two factions. "[[Cooperationists]]" in the Deep South would delay secession until several states went together, maybe in a Southern Convention. Under the influence of men such as Texas Governor [[Sam Houston]], delay would have had the effect of sustaining the Union.&lt;ref name="Freehling, pp. 448"&gt;Freehling, pp. 448+&lt;/ref&gt; "Unionists", especially in the Border South, often former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], appealed to sentimental attachment to the United States. Southern Unionists' favorite presidential candidate was [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of Tennessee, sometimes running under an "Opposition Party" banner.&lt;ref name="Freehling, pp. 448"/&gt;

&lt;gallery style="float:right; text-align:center;" perrow="2"&gt;

File:William Henry Gist.jpg|[[William Henry Gist]], {{small|Governor of South Carolina, called the Secessionist Convention}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Many secessionists were active politically. Governor [[William Henry Gist]] of South Carolina corresponded secretly with other Deep South governors, and most southern governors exchanged clandestine commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]]'s secessionist "1860 Association" published over 200,000 pamphlets to persuade the youth of the South. The most influential were: "The Doom of Slavery" and "The South Alone Should Govern the South", both by John Townsend of South Carolina; and James D. B. De Bow's "The Interest of Slavery of the Southern Non-slaveholder".&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 391â394&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in South Carolina started a chain of events. The foreman of a jury refused the legitimacy of federal courts, so [[Andrew Magrath|Federal Judge Andrew Magrath]] ruled that U.S. judicial authority in South Carolina was vacated. A mass meeting in Charleston celebrating the Charleston and Savannah railroad and state cooperation led to the South Carolina legislature to call for a Secession Convention. [[James Chesnut, Jr.|U.S. Senator James Chesnut, Jr.]] resigned, as did [[James Henry Hammond|Senator James Henry Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections for Secessionist conventions were heated to "an almost raving pitch, no one dared dissent", said Freehling. Even onceârespected voices, including the Chief Justice of South Carolina, [[John Belton O'Neall]], lost election to the Secession Convention on a Cooperationist ticket. Across the South mobs expelled Yankees and (in Texas) executed [[German-Americans]] suspected of loyalty to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, pp. 418+&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, seceding conventions which followed did not call for a referendum to ratify, although Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee did, as well as Virginia's second convention. Kentucky declared neutrality, while Missouri had its own civil war until the Unionists took power and drove the Confederate legislators out of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ralph Young|title=Dissent: The History of an American Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUWbBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA193|year=2015|publisher=NYU Press|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts to thwart secession====
In the antebellum months, the [[Corwin Amendment]] was an unsuccessful attempt by the [[United States Congress|Congress]] to bring back the seceding states to the Union and to prevent the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Samuel Eliot Morison]]|title=The Oxford History of the American People|year=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] by [[Thomas Corwin|Ohio Congressman Thomas Corwin]] that would shield "domestic institutions" of the states (which in 1861 included slavery) from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress.&lt;ref name='AmendmentsNotRatified'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|title=Constitutional Amendments Not Ratified|accessdate=2013-11-21|publisher=United States House of Representatives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702135703/http://www.house.gov/house/Amendnotrat.shtml|archivedate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghostamendment.com/|title=Ghost Amendment: The Thirteenth Amendment That Never Was|last=Walter|first=Michael|year=2003|access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was passed by the [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|36th Congress]] on March 2, 1861. The House approved it by a vote of 133 to 65 and the United States Senate adopted it, with no changes, on a vote of 24 to 12. It was then submitted to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gettysburgcompiler.org/2017/04/10/the-corwin-amendment-the-last-last-minute-attempt-to-save-the-union/|title=The Corwin Amendment: The Last Last-Minute Attempt to Save the Union|last=Christensen|first=Hannah|date=April 2017|website=The Gettysburg Compiler|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural address Lincoln endorsed the proposed amendment.

The text was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Had it been ratified by the required number of states prior to 1865, it would have made institutionalized slavery immune to the constitutional amendment procedures and to interference by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/failure-compromise/resources/proposed-thirteenth-amendment-prevent-secession-1861|title=A proposed Thirteenth Amendment to prevent secession, 1861|last=|first=|date=|website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=R.

====Inauguration and response====
[[File:1861 Davis Inaugural.jpg|thumb|upright|right|float|The inauguration of [[Jefferson Davis]] in Montgomery, Alabama]]
The first secession state conventions from the Deep South sent representatives to meet at the [[Montgomery Convention]] in Montgomery, Alabama, on February 4, 1861. There the fundamental documents of government were promulgated, a provisional government was established, and a representative Congress met for the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name="Freehling"&gt;Freehling, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 'provisional' Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] issued a call for 100,000 men from the various states' militias to defend the newly formed Confederacy.&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt; All Federal property was seized, along with gold bullion and coining dies at the U.S. mints in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], North Carolina; [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], Georgia; and [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt; The Confederate capital was moved from Montgomery to Richmond, Virginia, in May 1861. On February 22, 1862, Davis was inaugurated as president with a term of six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Wright|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_wpKWzSmvUC&amp;pg=PA150|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly inaugurated Confederate administration pursued a policy of national territorial integrity, continuing earlier state efforts in 1860 and early 1861 to remove U.S. government presence from within their boundaries. These efforts included taking possession of U.S. courts, custom houses, post offices, and most notably, arsenals and forts. But after the Confederate attack and capture of [[Fort Sumter]] in April 1861, Lincoln called up [[75,000 volunteers|75,000 of the states' militia]] to muster under his command. The stated purpose was to re-occupy U.S. properties throughout the South, as the U.S. Congress had not authorized their abandonment. The resistance at Fort Sumter signaled his change of policy from that of the Buchanan Administration. Lincoln's response ignited a firestorm of emotion. The people of both North and South demanded war, and young men rushed to their colors in the hundreds of thousands. Four more states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) refused Lincoln's call for troops and declared secession, while Kentucky maintained an uneasy "neutrality".&lt;ref name="Freehling" /&gt;

===Secession===
Secessionists argued that the [[United States Constitution]] was a contract among sovereign states that could be abandoned at any time without consultation and that each state had a right to secede. After intense debates and statewide votes, seven [[Deep South]] cotton states passed secession ordinances by February 1861 (before Abraham Lincoln took office as president), while secession efforts failed in the other eight slave states. Delegates from those seven formed the CSA in February 1861, selecting [[Jefferson Davis]] as the provisional president. Unionist talk of reunion failed and Davis began raising a 100,000 man army.&lt;ref&gt;February 28, 1861, Congress authorized Davis to accept state militias into national service. Confederate Act of Congress for "provisionals" on March 6, 1861, authorized 100,000 militia and volunteers under Davis' command. May 6, Congress empowered Davis to accept volunteers directly without state intermediaries. Keegan, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7O0FYunvPwC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=confederate+called+up+100,00+militia&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6#v=onepage The American Civil War: a military history] 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26343-8}}, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

====States====
Initially, some secessionists may have hoped for a peaceful departure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Emory T., ''The Confederate Nation: 1861â1865'', 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-090703-7}} Chapter 3. "Foundations of the Southern Nation". pp. 59, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Moderates in the Confederate Constitutional Convention included a provision against importation of slaves from Africa to appeal to the Upper South. Non-slave states might join, but the radicals secured a two-thirds hurdle for them.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Emory T., ''The Confederate Nation: 1861â1865'', 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-090703-7}} Chapter 3. "Foundations of the Southern Nation".&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven states declared their secession from the United States before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. After the Confederate attack on [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] April 12, 1861, and Lincoln's subsequent call for troops on April 15, four more states declared their secession:&lt;ref&gt;Some southern unionists blamed Lincoln's call for troops as the precipitating event for the second wave of secessions. Historian James McPherson argues that such claims have "a self-serving quality" and regards them as misleading. He wrote:
{{quote|As the telegraph chattered reports of the attack on Sumter April 12 and its surrender next day, huge crowds poured into the streets of Richmond, Raleigh, Nashville, and other upper South cities to celebrate this victory over the Yankees. These crowds waved Confederate flags and cheered the glorious cause of southern independence. They demanded that their own states join the cause. Scores of demonstrations took place from April 12 to 14, before Lincoln issued his call for troops. Many conditional unionists were swept along by this powerful tide of southern nationalism; others were cowed into silence.| McPherson p. 278}}
Historian Daniel W. Crofts disagrees with McPherson. Crofts wrote:
{{quote|The bombardment of Fort Sumter, by itself, did not destroy Unionist majorities in the upper South. Because only three days elapsed before Lincoln issued the proclamation, the two events viewed retrospectively, appear almost simultaneous. Nevertheless, close examination of contemporary evidence&amp;nbsp;... shows that the proclamation had a far more decisive impact.|Crofts p. 336}}
Crofts further noted that, {{quote|Many concluded&amp;nbsp;... that Lincoln had deliberately chosen "to drive off all the Slave states, in order to make war on them and annihilate slavery".| Crofts pp. 337â338, quoting the North Carolina politician [[Jonathan Worth (Governor)|Jonathan Worth]] (1802â1869).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] declared neutrality but after Confederate troops moved in, the state government asked for Union troops to drive them out. The splinter Confederate [[Confederate government of Kentucky|state government]] relocated to accompany western Confederate armies and never controlled the state population. By the end of the war, 90,000 Kentuckians had fought on the side of the Union, compared to 35,000 for the Confederate States.&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/01/why-do-people-believe-myths-about-the-confederacy-because-our-textbooks-and-monuments-are-wrong/ |work=Washington Post |date=July 1, 2015 |author=James W.

In [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], a [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861â63)|constitutional convention]] was approved and delegates elected by voters. The convention rejected secession 89â1 on March 19, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal and Proceedings of the Missouri State Convention Held at Jefferson City and St. Louis, March 1861'', George Knapp &amp; Co., 1861, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  The governor maneuvered to take control of the [[St. Louis Arsenal]] and restrict Federal movements. This led to confrontation, and in June Federal forces drove him and the [[Missouri General Assembly|General Assembly]] from Jefferson City. The executive committee of the constitutional convention called the members together in July. The convention declared the state offices vacant, and appointed a Unionist interim state government.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Morrow Violette, ''A History of Missouri'' (1918). pp. 393â395&lt;/ref&gt; The exiled governor called a rump session of the former General Assembly together in Neosho and, on October 31, 1861, passed an [[Missouri secession|ordinance of secession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/secessionacts.html|title=Secession Acts of the Thirteen Confederate States|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308171406/http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/secessionacts.html|archivedate=March 8, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weigley (2000) p. 43 See also, [http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/misouord.htm Missouri's Ordinance of Secession].&lt;/ref&gt; It is still a matter of debate as to whether a quorum existed for this vote. The Confederate state government was unable to control very much Missouri territory. It had its capital first at Neosho, then at Cassville, before being driven out of the state. For the remainder of the war, it operated as a government in exile at Marshall, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. C.

Neither Kentucky nor Missouri was declared in rebellion in Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The Confederacy recognized the pro-Confederate claimants in both Kentucky (December 10, 1861) and Missouri (November 28, 1861) and laid claim to those states, granting them Congressional representation and adding two stars to the Confederate flag. Voting for the representatives was mostly done by Confederate soldiers from Kentucky and Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilfred Buck Yearns|title=The Confederate Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rV-XNj4eJ3wC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|pages=42â43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia took two steps toward secession, first by secession convention vote on April 17, 1861, and then by ratification of this by a popular vote conducted on May 23, 1861. A Unionist [[Restored government of Virginia]] also operated. Virginia did not turn over its military to the Confederate States until June 8, 1861.

In Virginia, the populous counties along the Ohio and Pennsylvania borders rejected the Confederacy. Unionists held a [[Wheeling Convention|Convention]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia#Industrialization and anti-secession sentiment|Wheeling]] in June 1861, establishing a "restored government" with a [[Restored government of Virginia|rump legislature]], but sentiment in the region remained deeply divided. In the 50 counties that would make up the state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]], voters from 24 counties had voted for disunion in Virginia's May 23 referendum on the ordinance of secession.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Richard Orr, ''A House Divided, A Study of Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860 [[United States presidential election, 1860|Presidential election]] "Constitutional Democrat" Breckenridge had outpolled "Constitutional Unionist" Bell in the 50 counties by 1,900 votes, 44% to 42%.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Otis K. and Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia, A History'', Univ. of Kentucky Press, 1993, 2nd edition, pg. 112. Another way of looking at the results would note the pro-union candidates winning 56% with Bell 20,997, Douglas 5,742, and Lincoln 1,402 versus Breckenridge 21,908. But the "deeply divided sentiment" point remains.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of scholarly disputes over election procedures and results county by county, altogether they simultaneously supplied over 20,000 soldiers to each side of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvculture.org/HISTORY/wvcivilwar.html The Civil War in West Virginia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015135703/http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvcivilwar.html |date=2004-10-15 }} "No other state serves as a better example of this than West Virginia, where there was relatively equal support for the northern and southern causes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Mark A., ''West Virginia and the Civil War, Mountaineers Are Always Free'', History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, 2011, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives for most of the counties were seated in both state legislatures at Wheeling and at Richmond for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Cynthia Miller, ''The General Assembly of Virginia, July 30, 1619 â January 11, 1978: A Bicentennial Register of Members'', Virginia State Library, Richmond, Virginia, 1978, pgs. 478â493&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to secede from the Confederacy by some counties in [[East Tennessee]] were checked by martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aotc.net/Marxen.htm |title=Marx and Engels on the American Civil War |publisher=Army of the Cumberland and George H.

Regiments of Marylanders fought in Lee's [[Army of Northern Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Glatthaar, Joseph T., ''General Lee's Army: from victory to collapse'', 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-684-82787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; But overall, 24,000 men from Maryland joined the Confederate armed forces, compared to 63,000 who joined Union forces.&lt;ref name="Why?"/&gt;

Delaware never produced a full regiment for the Confederacy, but neither did it emancipate slaves as did Missouri and West Virginia. District of Columbia citizens made no attempts to secede and through the war years, referendums sponsored by President Lincoln approved systems of compensated emancipation and slave confiscation from "disloyal citizens".&lt;ref&gt;Freedmen &amp; Southern Society Project, [http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm Chronology of Emancipation during the Civil War], University of Maryland.

====Territories====
{{Main|Confederate Arizona|New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Elias Boudinot2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elias Cornelius Boudinot|Elias Boudinot]] secessionist, Rep. Indian Territory, Cherokee]]

Citizens at [[Mesilla, New Mexico|Mesilla]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the southern part of [[New Mexico Territory]] formed a secession convention, which voted to join the Confederacy on March 16, 1861, and appointed [[Lewis Owings]] as the new territorial governor. They won the [[First Battle of Mesilla|Battle of Mesilla]] and established a territorial government with Mesilla serving as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy proclaimed the Confederate [[Arizona Territory (Confederate States of America)|Arizona Territory]] on February 14, 1862, north to the [[34th parallel north|34th parallel]]. [[Marcus H. MacWillie]] served in both Confederate Congresses as Arizona's delegate. In 1862 the Confederate [[New Mexico Campaign]] to take the northern half of the U.S. territory failed and the Confederate territorial government in exile relocated to San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History of Arizona, |volume=2 |first=Thomas Edwin |last=Farish |year=1915 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9HkUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=%22Act+to+organize+the+Territory+of+Arizona%22++Jefferson+Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate supporters in the trans-Mississippi west also claimed portions of United States [[Indian Territory in the American Civil War|Indian Territory]] after the United States evacuated the federal forts and installations. Over half of the American Indian troops participating in the Civil War from the Indian Territory supported the Confederacy; troops and one general were enlisted from each tribe. On July 12, 1861, the Confederate government signed a treaty with both the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indian nations. After several battles Union armies took control of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;Troy Smith. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v059/59.3.smith.html "The Civil War Comes to Indian Territory"], ''Civil War History'' (2013) 59#3 pp. 279â319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Territory was never formally ceded into the Confederacy by American Indian councils, but like Missouri and Kentucky, the Five Civilized Nations received representation in the Confederate Congress and their citizens were integrated into regular Confederate Army units. After 1863 the tribal governments sent representatives to the [[Congress of the Confederate States|Confederate Congress]]: [[Elias Cornelius Boudinot]] representing the [[Cherokee]] and [[Samuel Benton Callahan]] representing the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]. The [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], aligning with the Confederacy, alleged northern violations of the Constitution, waging war against slavery commercial and political interests, abolishing slavery in the Indian Territory, and that the North intended to seize additional Indian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilwarhome.com/cherokeecauses.htm ''Declaration by the People of the Cherokee Nation of the Causes Which Have Impelled Them to Unite Their Fortunes With Those of the Confederate States of America''].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capitals====
[[History of Montgomery, Alabama#Montgomery in the Civil War|Montgomery, Alabama]] served as the capital of the Confederate States of America from February 4 until May 29, 1861, in the [[Alabama State Capitol]]. Six states created the Confederate States of America there on February 8, 1861. The Texas delegation was seated at the time, so it is counted in the "original seven" states of the Confederacy; it had no roll call vote until after its referendum made secession "operative".&lt;ref&gt;The Texas delegation was seated with full voting rights after its statewide referendum of secession on March 2, 1861. It is generally counted as an "original state" of the Confederacy. Four upper south states declared secession following Lincoln's call for volunteers: Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina. "The founders of the Confederacy desired and ideally envisioned a peaceful creation of a new union of all slave-holding states, including the border states of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri." Kentucky and Missouri were seated in December 1861. Kenneth C. Martis, ''The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America 1861â1865'' (1994) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held in Montgomery, adjourning May 21.&lt;ref&gt;The sessions of the Provisional Congress were in Montgomery, Alabama, (1) First Session February 4 â March 10, and (2) Second Session April 29 â May 21, 1861. The Capital was moved to Richmond May 30. The (3) Third Session was held July 20 â August 31. The (4) Fourth Session called for September 3 was never held. The (5) Fifth Session was held November 18, 1861 â February 17, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; The Permanent Constitution was adopted there on March 12, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 7â8.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The permanent capital provided for in the Confederate Constitution called for a state cession of a ten-miles square (100 square mile) district to the central government. Atlanta, which had not yet supplanted [[Milledgeville, Georgia#Life in the antebellum capital|Milledgeville]], Georgia as its state capital, put in a bid noting its central location and rail connections, as did [[Opelika, Alabama]], noting its strategically interior situation, rail connections and nearby deposits of coal and iron.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond, Virginia]] was chosen for the interim capital at the [[Virginia State Capitol]]. The move was used by Vice President Stephens and others to encourage other border states to follow Virginia into the Confederacy. In the political moment it was a show of "defiance and strength". The war for southern independence was surely to be fought in Virginia, but it also had the largest Southern military-aged white population, with infrastructure, resources and supplies required to sustain a war. The Davis Administration's policy was that, "It must be held at all hazards."&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 101. Virginia was practically promised as a condition of secession by Vice President Stephens. It had rail connections south along the east coast and into the interior, and laterally west into Tennessee, parallel the U.S. border, a navigable river to the Hampton Roads to menace ocean approaches to Washington DC, trade via the Atlantic Ocean, an interior canal to North Carolina sounds. It was a great storehouse of supplies, food, feed, raw materials, and infrastructure of ports, drydocks, armories and the established Tredegar Iron Works. Nevertheless, Virginia never permanently ceded land for the capital district. A local homeowner donated his home to the City of Richmond for use as the Confederate White House, which was in turn rented to the Confederate government for the Jefferson Davis presidential home and administration offices.&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of Richmond as the new capital took place on May 30, 1861, and the last two sessions of the Provisional Congress were held in the new capital. The Permanent Confederate Congress and President were elected in the states and army camps on November 6, 1861. The First Congress met in four sessions in Richmond from February 18, 1862, to February 17, 1864. The Second Congress met there in two sessions, from May 2, 1864, to March 18, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

As war dragged on, Richmond became crowded with training and transfers, logistics and hospitals. Prices rose dramatically despite government efforts at price regulation. A movement in Congress led by [[Henry S. Foote]] of Tennessee argued for moving the capital from Richmond. At the approach of Federal armies in mid-1862, the government's archives were readied for removal. As the [[Overland Campaign|Wilderness Campaign]] progressed, Congress authorized Davis to remove the executive department and call Congress to session elsewhere in 1864 and again in 1865. Shortly before the end of the war, the Confederate government evacuated Richmond, planning to relocate farther south. Little came of these plans before Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Virginia on April 9, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, "Confederate States of America", p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis and most of his cabinet fled to [[Danville, Virginia]], which served as their headquarters for about a week.

===Unionism===
Unionism was widespread in the Confederacy, especially in the mountain regions of [[Appalachia]] and the [[Ozarks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Kenneth W. |editor-last=Noe |editor2-first=Shannon H. |editor2-last=Wilson |title=Civil War in Appalachia |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unionists, led by [[Parson Brownlow]] and Senator [[Andrew Johnson]], took control of eastern Tennessee in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert Tracy |last=McKenzie |title=Contesting Secession: Parson Brownlow and the Rhetoric of Proslavery Unionism, 1860â1861 |journal=Civil War History |year=2002 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=294â312 |doi=10.1353/cwh.2002.0060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unionists also attempted control over western Virginia but never effectively held more than half the counties that formed the new state of [[History of West Virginia#Civil War and split|West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9Lna2shH7oC&amp;pg=PA54 |first=Richard O. |last=Curry |title=A House Divided, Statehood Politics and the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia |publisher=Univ. of Pittsburgh |year=1964 |page=8 |isbn=9780822977513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James C. |last=McGregor |title=The Disruption of Virginia |year=1922 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_px4SAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David R. |last=Zimring |title='Secession in Favor of the Constitution': How West Virginia Justified Separate Statehood during the Civil War |journal=West Virginia History |year=2009 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=23â51 |doi=10.1353/wvh.0.0060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:1860-61 Secession in Appalachia by County.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Map of the county secession votes of 1860â1861 in Appalachia within the [[Appalachian Regional Commission|ARC]] definition.

That changed as the occupiers became perceived as oppressive, callous, radical and favorable to the Freedmen. Occupiers engaged in pillaging, freeing of slaves, and eviction of those refusing to take or reneging on the loyalty oaths, as ex-Unionists began to support the Confederate cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judkin |last=Browning |title=Removing the Mask of Nationality: Unionism, Racism, and Federal Military Occupation in North Carolina, 1862â1865 |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |year=2005 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=589â620 |jstor=27648821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the Confederacy was perhaps weakest in Texas; Claude Elliott estimates that only a third of the population actively supported the Confederacy. Many unionists supported the Confederacy after the war began, but many others clung to their unionism throughout the war, especially in the northern counties, the German districts, and the Mexican areas.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Claude |last=Elliott |title=Union Sentiment in Texas 1861â1865 |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |year=1947 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=449â477 |jstor=30237490 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ernest Wallace: "This account of a dissatisfied Unionist minority, although historically essential, must be kept in its proper perspective, for throughout the war the overwhelming majority of the people zealously supported the Confederacy&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Wallace |title=Texas in Turmoil |location= |publisher= |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph B.

He characterizes Texas Civil War history as "a morose story of intragovernmental rivalries coupled with wide-ranging disaffection that prevented effective implementation of state wartime policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dale |last=Baum |title=The Shattering of Texas Unionism: Politics in the Lone Star State during the Civil War Era |location= |publisher=LSU Press |year=1998 |page=83 |isbn=0-8071-2245-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas local officials harassed unionists and engaged in large-scale massacres against unionists and Germans. In Cooke County 150 suspected unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot.&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"/&gt;

Civil liberties were of small concern in North and South. Lincoln and Davis both took a hard line against dissent. Neely explores how the Confederacy became a virtual police state with guards and patrols all about, and a domestic passport system whereby everyone needed official permission each time they wanted to travel. Over 4,000 suspected unionists were imprisoned without trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark E.

===Diplomacy===

====United States, a foreign power====
During the four years of its existence under trial by war, the Confederate States of America asserted its independence and appointed dozens of diplomatic agents abroad. None were ever officially recognized by a foreign government. The United States government regarded the southern states in rebellion and so refused any formal recognition of their status.

Even before [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], U.S. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] issued formal instructions to the American minister to Britain, [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]]:
{{quote|[Make] no expressions of harshness or disrespect, or even impatience concerning the seceding States, their agents, or their people, [those States] must always continue to be, equal and honored members of this Federal Union, [their citizens] still are and always must be our kindred and countrymen.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 &gt;William Seward to Charles Francis Adams, April 10, 1861 in Marion Mills Miller, (ed.) ''Life And Works Of Abraham Lincoln'' (1907) Vol 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seward instructed Adams that if the British government seemed inclined to recognize the Confederacy, or even waver in that regard, it was to receive a sharp warning, with a strong hint of war:
{{quote|[if Britain is] tolerating the application of the so-called seceding States, or wavering about it, [they cannot] remain friends with the United States&amp;nbsp;... if they determine to recognize [the Confederacy], [Britain] may at the same time prepare to enter into alliance with the enemies of this republic.&lt;ref name=SewardToAdams1861 /&gt;}}

The United States government never declared war on those "kindred and countrymen" in the Confederacy, but conducted its military efforts beginning with a presidential proclamation issued April 15, 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Sandburg|title=Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and the War Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nL5xCYLFs0C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1940|page=151|isbn=9781402742880}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for troops to recapture forts and suppress what Lincoln later called an "insurrection and rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Lincoln|title=Abraham Lincoln; Complete Works, Comprising His Speeches, State Papers, and Miscellaneous Writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX8_AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA542|year=1920|publisher=Century|pages=542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mid-war parleys between the two sides occurred without formal political recognition, though the [[laws of war]] predominantly governed military relationships on both sides of uniformed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Violations of the rules of law were precipitated on both sides and can be found in historical accounts of guerilla war, units in cross-racial combat and captives held in prisoner of war camps, brutal, tragic accounts against both soldiers and civilian populations.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the part of the Confederacy, immediately following Fort Sumter the Confederate Congress proclaimed that "war exists between the Confederate States and the Government of the United States, and the States and Territories thereof". A state of war was not to formally exist between the Confederacy and those states and territories in the United States allowing slavery, although Confederate Rangers were compensated for destruction they could effect there throughout the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rebellion Record|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RKB2AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Moore,%20Frank,%20#v=onepage&amp;q=war%20exists%20between|last=Moore|first=Frank|volume=I|publisher=G.P. Putnam|year=1861|pages=195â197|isbn=0-405-10877-X}} Doc. 140. The places excepted in the Confederate States proclamation that "a war exists" were the places where slavery was allowed: States of Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Missouri, and Delaware, and the Territories of Arizona, and New Mexico, and the Indian Territory south of Kansas.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--I find nowhere on these pages, nor anywhere in the volume that the war is given a name--&gt;

Concerning the international status and nationhood of the Confederate States of America, in 1869 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in {{ussc|name=Texas v. White|74|700|1869|Wall.|7|el=no}} ruled Texas' declaration of secession was [[Void (law)|legally null and void]].&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0074_0700_ZO.html ''Texas v. White''], 74 U.S. 700 (1868) at [[Cornell University Law School]] Supreme Court collection.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jefferson Davis]], former President of the Confederacy, and Alexander H. Stephens, its former Vice-President, both wrote postwar arguments in favor of secession's legality and the international legitimacy of the Government of the Confederate States of America, most notably Davis' ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]''.

====International diplomacy====
Once war with the United States began, the Confederacy pinned its hopes for survival on military intervention by Great Britain and [[Second French Empire|France]]. The Confederates who had believed that "[[King Cotton|cotton is king]]" â that is, that Britain had to support the Confederacy to obtain cotton â proved mistaken. The British had stocks to last over a year and had been developing alternative sources of cotton, most notably [[British Raj|India]] and [[Egypt]]. They were not about to go to war with the U.S. to acquire more cotton at the risk of losing the large quantities of food imported from the North.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Stanley|last= Lebergott|title= Why the South Lost: Commercial Purpose in the Confederacy, 1861â1865|journal= [[Journal of American History]]|year= 1983|volume= 70|issue= 1|page= 61|jstor= 1890521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate government repeatedly sent delegations to Europe, but historians give them low marks for their poor diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal (1966); Jones (2009); Owsley (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; [[James M. Mason]] went to London and [[John Slidell]] traveled to Paris. They were unofficially interviewed, but neither secured [[diplomatic recognition|official recognition]] for the Confederacy.

In late 1861 the seizure of two senior Confederate diplomats aboard a British ship by the U.S. navy outraged Britain and led to a war scare in the [[Trent Affair]]. Queen Victoria insisted on giving the Americans an exit route and Lincoln took it, releasing the two diplomats. Tensions cooled, and the Confederacy gained no advantage. In recent years most historians argue that the risk of actual war over the Trent Affair was small, because it would have hurt both sides.&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Carroll, "The American Civil War and British Intervention: The Threat of Anglo-American Conflict." ''Canadian Journal of History'' (2012) 47#1 pp. 94â95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the early years of the war, British foreign secretary [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], Emperor [[Napoleon III]] of France, and, to a lesser extent, British Prime Minister [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], showed interest in recognition of the Confederacy or at least mediation of the war. [[William Ewart Gladstone]], the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (finance minister, in office 1859â1866), whose family wealth was based on slavery, was the key Minister calling for intervention to help the Confederacy achieve independence. He failed to convince prime minister Palmerston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Richard Shannon|authorlink = Richard Shannon (historian)|title= Gladstone: God and Politics|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H9TUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA144|year= 2008|page= 144|isbn = 9781847252036}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 1862 the Union victory at the [[Battle of Antietam]], Lincoln's preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and abolitionist opposition in Britain put an end to these possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Paterson, et al. ''American foreign relations: A history, to 1920: Volume 1'' (2009) pp.&amp;nbsp;149â155.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to Britain of a war with the U.S. would have been high: the immediate loss of American grain-shipments, the end of British exports to the U.S., and the seizure of billions of pounds invested in American securities. War would have meant higher taxes in Britain, another invasion of Canada, and full-scale worldwide attacks on the British merchant fleet. Outright recognition would have meant certain war with the United States; in mid-1862 fears of race war (as had transpired in the [[Haitian Revolution]] of 1791â1804) led to the British considering intervention for humanitarian reasons. Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] did not lead to interracial violence, let alone a bloodbath, but it did give the friends of the Union strong talking points in the arguments that raged across Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War'' (2002), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Slidell]], the Confederate States emissary to France, did succeed in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from [[FrÃ©dÃ©ric Ãmile d'Erlanger|Erlanger]] and other French capitalists. The money went to buy ironclad warships, as well as military supplies that came in with blockade runners.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Fenner Gentry, "A Confederate Success in Europe: The Erlanger Loan", ''Journal of Southern History'' (1970) 36#2 pp. 157â188 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205869 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; The British government did allow the construction of [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] in Britain; they were owned and operated by British financiers and sailors; a few were owned and operated by the Confederacy. The British investors' goal was to get highly profitable cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lebergott, "Through the blockade: the profitability and extent of cotton smuggling, 1861â1865".

Several European nations maintained diplomats in place who had been appointed to the U.S., but no country appointed any diplomat to the Confederacy. Those nations recognized the Union and Confederate sides as [[belligerent]]s. In 1863 the Confederacy expelled European diplomatic missions for advising their resident subjects to refuse to serve in the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander DeConde, ed.

Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running During the Civil War'', (1991), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kq7diciSsQC&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86].&lt;/ref&gt; Both Confederate and Union agents were allowed to work openly in British territories. Some state governments in northern Mexico negotiated local agreements to cover trade on the Texas border.&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Stephen R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kq7diciSsQC ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running During the Civil War'']. University of South Carolina Press, 1991 {{ISBN| 0-87249-799-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-87249-799-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kq7diciSsQC&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]. An example of agents working openly occurred in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] in Bermuda, where a Confederate agent openly worked to help blockade runners.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius IX]] wrote a [[Pope Pius IX and the United States#Political involvement during the Civil War|letter]] to Jefferson Davis in which he addressed Davis as the "Honorable President of the Confederate States of America". The Confederacy appointed [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]] as special agent to the Holy See on September 24, 1863. But the [[Holy See]] never released a formal statement supporting or recognizing the Confederacy. In November 1863, Mann met [[Pope Pius IX]] in person and received a letter supposedly addressed "to the Illustrious and Honorable Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America"; Mann had mistranslated the address. In his report to Richmond, Mann claimed a great diplomatic achievement for himself, asserting the letter was "a positive recognition of our Government". The letter was indeed used in propaganda, but Confederate Secretary of State [[Judah P. Benjamin]] told Mann it was "a mere inferential recognition, unconnected with political action or the regular establishment of diplomatic relations" and thus did not assign it the weight of formal recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The American Catholic Historical Researches|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m7c7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA227|year= 1901|pages= 27â28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014) pp 257â270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Confederacy was seen internationally as a serious attempt at nationhood, and European governments sent military observers, both official and unofficial, to assess whether there had been a ''[[de facto]]'' establishment of independence. These observers included [[Arthur Lyon Fremantle]] of the British Coldstream Guards, Fitzgerald Ross of the Austrian Hussars and [[Justus Scheibert]] of the Prussian Army.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', pp. 219â220&lt;/ref&gt; European travelers visited and wrote accounts for publication. Importantly in 1862, the Frenchman [[Charles FrÃ©dÃ©ric Girard|Charles Girard]]'s ''Seven months in the rebel states during the North American War'' testified "this government&amp;nbsp;... is no longer a trial government&amp;nbsp;... but really a normal government, the expression of popular will".&lt;ref&gt;Scholars such as Emory M. Thomas have characterized Girard's book as "more propaganda than anything else, but Girard caught one essential truth", the quote referenced. (Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', p. 220.)&lt;/ref&gt;
Fremantle went on to write in his book ''Three Months in the Southern States'' that he had
&lt;blockquote&gt;not attempted to conceal any of the peculiarities or defects of the Southern people. Many persons will doubtless highly disapprove of some of their customs and habits in the wilder portion of the country; but I think no generous man, whatever may be his political opinions, can do otherwise than admire the courage, energy, and patriotism of the whole population, and the skill of its leaders, in this struggle against great odds. And I am also of opinion that many will agree with me in thinking that a people in which all ranks and both sexes display a unanimity and a heroism which can never have been surpassed in the history of the world, is destined, sooner or later, to become a great and independent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fremantle |first= Arthur |date= 1864 |title= Three Months in the Southern States|url= |publisher= University of Nebraska Press|page= 124 |isbn= 9781429016667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

French Emperor Napoleon III assured Confederate diplomat [[John Slidell]] that he would make "direct proposition" to Britain for joint recognition. The Emperor made the same assurance to British Members of Parliament [[John A. Roebuck]] and John A. Lindsay.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Roebuck in turn publicly prepared a bill to submit to Parliament June 30 supporting joint Anglo-French recognition of the Confederacy. "Southerners had a right to be optimistic, or at least hopeful, that their revolution would prevail, or at least endure."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 219, 220, 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the dual reverses at Vicksburg and Gettysburg in July 1863, the Confederates "suffered a severe loss of confidence in themselves", and withdrew into an interior defensive position. There would be no help from the Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1864 Davis considered sacrificing slavery in order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent Duncan F. Kenner to Europe with a message that the war was fought solely for "the vindication of our rights to self-government and independence" and that "no sacrifice is too great, save that of honor". The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A compilation of the messages and papers of the Confederacy: including the diplomatic correspondence, 1861â1865 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQ0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA697#v=onepage |editor= Richardson, James D. |others= Volume II |publisher= United States Publishing Company |location= Nashville |year= 1905 |page =697 |accessdate= March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis's message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential. European leaders all saw that the Confederacy was on the verge of total defeat.&lt;ref name="levine-248"&gt;

===Confederacy at war===

====Motivations of soldiers====
{{Main|Confederate States Army#Morale and motivations}}
The great majority of young white men voluntarily joined Confederate national or state military units. Perman (2010) says historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years:
{{quote|Some historians emphasize that Civil War soldiers were driven by political ideology, holding firm beliefs about the importance of liberty, Union, or state rights, or about the need to protect or to destroy slavery. Others point to less overtly political reasons to fight, such as the defense of one's home and family, or the honor and brotherhood to be preserved when fighting alongside other men. Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Michael Perman|editor2=Amy Murrell Taylor|title=Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rPbZT_hrncC&amp;pg=PA178|year= 2010|publisher=Cengage |page=178|isbn=0618875204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James McPherson, ''For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Military strategy====
Civil War historian [[E. Merton Coulter]] noted that for those who would secure its independence, "The Confederacy was unfortunate in its failure to work out a general strategy for the whole war". Aggressive strategy called for offensive force concentration. Defensive strategy sought dispersal to meet demands of locally minded governors. The controlling philosophy evolved into a combination "dispersal with a defensive concentration around Richmond". The Davis administration considered the war purely defensive, a "simple demand that the people of the United States would cease to war upon us".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 342â343&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[James M. McPherson]] is a critic of Lee's Offensive Strategy: "Lee pursued a faulty military strategy that ensured Confederate defeat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James M. McPherson Professor of American History Princeton University|title=Drawn with the Sword: Reflections on the American Civil War: Reflections on the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KejHFo7A8eQC&amp;pg=PA152|year=1996|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=152|isbn=9780199727834}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Confederate government lost control of territory in campaign after campaign, it was said that "the vast size of the Confederacy would make its conquest impossible". The enemy would be struck down by the same elements which so often debilitated or destroyed visitors and transplants in the South. Heat exhaustion, sunstroke, endemic diseases such as malaria and typhoid would match the destructive effectiveness of the Moscow winter on the [[French invasion of Russia|invading armies]] of Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 348. "The enemy could not hold territory, a hostile people would close in behind. The Confederacy still existed wherever there was an army under her unfurled banners."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seal of the Confederate States of America.svg|thumb|The Great Seal, symbols of an independent agricultural Confederacy surrounding an equestrian Washington, sword encased&lt;ref&gt;The cash crops circling the Great Seal are wheat, corn, tobacco, cotton, rice and sugar cane. Like Washington's equestrian statue honoring him at [[Union Square (New York City)#Union Square Partnership|Union Square]] NYC 1856, slaveholding Washington is pictured in his uniform of the Revolution securing American independence. While armed, he does not have his sword drawn as he is depicted in the [[George Washington#Monuments and memorials|equestrian statue]] at the Virginia Capitol, Richmond, Virginia. The plates for the Great Seal were engraved in England but never received due to the Union Blockade.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Early in the war both sides believed that one great battle would decide the conflict; the Confederate won a great victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], also known as [[First Manassas]] (the name used by Confederate forces). It drove the Confederate people "insane with joy"; the public demanded a forward movement to capture Washington, relocate the Confederate capital there, and admit [[Maryland in the Civil War|Maryland]] to the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; A council of war by the victorious Confederate generals decided not to advance against larger numbers of fresh Federal troops in defensive positions. Davis did not countermand it. Following the Confederate incursion halted at the [[Battle of Antietam]] in October 1862, generals proposed concentrating forces from state commands to re-invade the north. Nothing came of it.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; Again in early 1863 at his incursion into Pennsylvania, Lee requested of Davis that Beauregard simultaneously attack Washington with troops taken from the Carolinas. But the troops there remained in place during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]].

The eleven states of the Confederacy were outnumbered by the North about four to one in white men of military age. It was overmatched far more in military equipment, industrial facilities, railroads for transport, and wagons supplying the front.

Confederate military policy innovated to slow the invaders, but at heavy cost to the Southern infrastructure. The Confederates burned bridges, laid land mines in the roads, and made harbors inlets and inland waterways unusable with sunken mines (called "torpedos" at the time). Coulter reports:
{{quote|Rangers in twenty to fifty-man units were awarded 50% valuation for property destroyed behind Union lines, regardless of location or loyalty. As Federals occupied the South, objections by loyal Confederate concerning Ranger horse-stealing and indiscriminate scorched earth tactics behind Union lines led to Congress abolishing the Ranger service two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 333â338.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Confederacy relied on external sources for war materials. The first came from trade with the enemy. "Vast amounts of war supplies" came through Kentucky, and thereafter, western armies were "to a very considerable extent" provisioned with illicit trade via Federal agents and northern private traders.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 286. After capture by Federals, [[Memphis, Tennessee#19th century|Memphis]], TN became a major source of supply for Confederate armies, comparable to Nassau and its [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]].&lt;/ref&gt; But that trade was interrupted in the first year of war by [[David Dixon Porter|Admiral Porter]]'s river gunboats as they gained dominance along navigable rivers northâsouth and eastâwest.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 306. Confederate units harassed them throughout the war years by laying torpedo mines and loosing barrages from shoreline batteries.&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas blockade running then came to be of "outstanding importance".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287â288. The principal ports on the Atlantic were [[Wilmington, North Carolina in the American Civil War|Wilmington]], North Carolina, [[Charleston, South Carolina#Civil War|Charleston]], South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia for supplies from Europe via Bermuda and Nassau. On the Gulf were Galveston, Texas and [[New Orleans in the American Civil War|New Orleans]], Louisiana for those from Havana, Cuba and Mexican ports of Tampico and Vera Cruz.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 17, President Davis called on privateer raiders, the "militia of the sea", to make war on U.S. seaborne commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 296, 304. Two days later Lincoln proclaimed a blockade, declaring them pirates. Davis responded with [[letters of marque]] to protect privateers from outlaw status. Some of the early raiders were converted merchantmen seized in Southern ports at the outbreak of the war&lt;/ref&gt; Despite noteworthy effort, over the course of the war the Confederacy was found unable to match the Union in ships and seamanship, materials and marine construction.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 299â302. The [[Confederate Secret Service#Torpedo Bureau|Torpedo Bureau]] seeded defensive water-borne mines in principal harbors and rivers to compromise the Union naval superiority. These "torpedoes" were said to have caused more loss in U.S. naval ships and transports than by any other cause. Despite a rage for Congressional appropriations and public "subscription ironclads", armored platforms constructed in blockaded ports lacked the requisite marine engines to become ironclad warships. The armored platforms intended to become ironclads were employed instead as floating batteries for port city defense.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the greatest obstacle to success in the 19th-century warfare of mass armies was the Confederacy's lack of manpower, and sufficient numbers of disciplined, equipped troops in the field at the point of contact with the enemy. During the winter of 1862â63, Lee observed that none of his famous victories had resulted in the destruction of the opposing army. He lacked reserve troops to exploit an advantage on the battlefield as Napoleon had done. Lee explained, "More than once have most promising opportunities been lost for want of men to take advantage of them, and victory itself had been made to put on the appearance of defeat, because our diminished and exhausted troops have been unable to renew a successful struggle against fresh numbers of the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Armed forces====
{{Main|Military of the Confederate States of America}}

The military armed forces of the Confederacy comprised three branches: [[Confederate States Army|Army]], [[Confederate States Navy|Navy]] and [[Confederate States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

The Confederate military leadership included many veterans from the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy]] who had resigned their Federal commissions and had won appointment to senior positions in the Confederate armed forces. Many had served in the [[MexicanâAmerican War]] (including Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis), but some such as [[Leonidas Polk]] (who graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] but did not serve in the Army) had little or no experience.

&lt;gallery style="float:right; text-align:center;" perrow="2"&gt;
File:Conf Navy Jack (light blue).svg |{{small|Navy Jack â light blue cross; also square [[Flag terminology|canton]], white [[Flag terminology|fly]]}}
File:North Virginia Third Bunting.svg |{{small|Battle Flag â square; also without center star}}
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Confederate officer corps consisted of men from both slave-owning and non-slave-owning families. The Confederacy appointed junior and field grade officers by election from the enlisted ranks. Although no Army service academy was established for the Confederacy, some colleges (such as [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]] and [[Virginia Military Institute]]) maintained cadet corps that trained Confederate military leadership. A naval academy was established at [[Drewry's Bluff]], Virginia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navyandmarine.org/ondeck/1862blackCSN.htm|title=1862blackCSN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1863, but no midshipmen graduated before the Confederacy's end.

The soldiers of the Confederate armed forces consisted mainly of white males aged between 16 and 28. The median year of birth was 1838, so half the soldiers were 23 or older by 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph T. Glatthaar, ''Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee'' (2011) p. 3, ch 9&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1862, the Confederate Army was allowed to disintegrate for two months following expiration of short-term enlistments. A majority of those in uniform would not re-enlist following their one-year commitment, so on April 16, 1862, the Confederate Congress enacted the first mass [[conscription]] on the North American continent. (The U.S. Congress followed a year later on March 3, 1863, with the [[Enrollment Act]].) Rather than a universal draft, the initial program was a selective service with physical, religious, professional and industrial exemptions. These were narrowed as the war progressed. Initially substitutes were permitted, but by December 1863 these were disallowed. In September 1862 the age limit was increased from 35 to 45 and by February 1864, all men under 18 and over 45 were conscripted to form a reserve for state defense inside state borders. By March 1864, the Superintendent of Conscription reported that all across the Confederacy, every officer in constituted authority, man and woman, "engaged in opposing the enrolling officer in the execution of his duties".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, E. Merton, ''The Confederate States of America: 1861â1865'', op. cit., p. 313â315, 318.&lt;/ref&gt; Although challenged in the state courts, the Confederate State Supreme Courts routinely rejected legal challenges to conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred L. Brophy]], [http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/necessity-knows-no-law.pdf {{"'}}Necessity Knows No Law': Vested Rights and the Styles of Reasoning in the Confederate Conscription Cases"], ''[[Mississippi Law Journal]]'' (2000) 69: 1123â1180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of slaves served as laborers, cooks, and pioneers. Some freed blacks and men of color served in local state militia units of the Confederacy, primarily in Louisiana and South Carolina, but their officers deployed them for "local defense, not combat".&lt;ref&gt;Rubin p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted by casualties and desertions, the military suffered chronic manpower shortages. In early 1865, the Confederate Congress, influenced by the public support by General Lee, approved the recruitment of black infantry units. Contrary to Lee's and Davis's recommendations, the Congress refused "to guarantee the freedom of black volunteers". No more than two hundred black combat troops were ever raised.&lt;ref&gt;Levine pp. 146â147.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Raising troops=====
[[File:To Arms Confederate Enlistment Poster 1862.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Recruitment poster: "Do not wait to be drafted". Under half re-enlisted.]]

The immediate onset of war meant that it was fought by the "Provisional" or "Volunteer Army". State governors resisted concentrating a national effort. Several wanted a strong state army for self-defense. Others feared large "Provisional" armies answering only to Davis.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&amp;nbsp;308â311. The patchwork recruitment was (a) with and without state militia enrolment, (b) state Governor sponsorship and direct service under Davis, (c) for under six months, one year, three years and the duration of the war. Davis proposed recruitment for some period of years or the duration. Congress and the states equivocated. Governor Brown of Georgia became "the first and most persistent critic" of Confederate centralized military and civil power.&lt;/ref&gt; When filling the Confederate government's call for 100,000 men, another 200,000 were turned away by accepting only those enlisted "for the duration" or twelve-month volunteers who brought their own arms or horses.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 310â311&lt;/ref&gt;

It was important to raise troops; it was just as important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was "greater than could have been reasonably expected". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 328, 330â332. About 90% of West Pointers in the U.S. Army resigned to join the Confederacy. Notably, of Virginia's West Pointers, not 90% but 70% resigned for the Confederacy. Exemplary officers without military training included [[John B. Gordon]], [[Nathan B. Forrest]], [[J. Johnston Pettigrew|James J. Pettigrew]], [[John Hunt Morgan|John H. Morgan]], [[Turner Ashby]] and [[John S. Mosby]]. Most preliminary officer training was had from Hardee's "Tactics", and thereafter by observation and experience in battle. The Confederacy had no officers training camps or military academies, although early on, cadets of the Virginia Military Institute and other military schools drilled enlisted troops in battlefield evolutions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating the need for more "duration" men, in January 1862 Congress provided for company level recruiters to return home for two months, but their efforts met little success on the heels of Confederate battlefield defeats in February.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&amp;nbsp;310â311. Early 1862 "dried up the enthusiasm to volunteer" due to the impact of victory's battle casualties, the humiliation of defeats and the dislike of camp life with its monotony, confinement and mortal diseases. Immediately following the great victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas]], many believed the war was won and there was no need for more troops. Then the new year brought defeat over February 6â23: [[Fort Henry (site of the Battle of Fort Henry)|Fort Henry]], [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]], [[Fort Donelson]], Nashville â the first capital to fall. Among some not yet in uniform, the less victorious "Cause" seemed less glorious.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress allowed for Davis to require numbers of recruits from each governor to supply the volunteer shortfall. States responded by passing their own draft laws.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 312. The government funded parades and newspaper ad campaigns, $2,000,000 for recruitment in Kentucky alone. With a state-enacted draft, Governor Brown with a quota of 12,000 raised 22,000 Georgia militia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The veteran Confederate army of early 1862 was mostly twelve-month volunteers with terms about to expire. Enlisted reorganization elections disintegrated the army for two months. Officers pleaded with the ranks to re-enlist, but a majority did not. Those remaining elected majors and colonels whose performance led to officer review boards in October. The boards caused a "rapid and widespread" thinning out of 1700 incompetent officers. Troops thereafter would elect only second lieutenants.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 313, 332. Officially dropping 425 officers by board review in October was followed immediately by 1,300 "resignations". Some officers who resigned then served honorably as enlisted for the duration or until they were made casualties, others resigned and returned home until conscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1862, the popular press suggested the Confederacy required a million men under arms. But veteran soldiers were not re-enlisting, and earlier secessionist volunteers did not reappear to serve in war. One [[Macon, Georgia]], newspaper asked how two million brave fighting men of the South were about to be overcome by four million northerners who were said to be cowards.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Conscription=====
[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|right|Unionists throughout the Confederate States, resisted the 1862 conscription]]
The Confederacy passed the first American law of national conscription on April 16, 1862. The white males of the Confederate States from 18 to 35 were declared members of the Confederate army for three years, and all men then enlisted were extended to a three-year term. They would serve only in units and under officers of their state. Those under 18 and over 35 could substitute for conscripts, in September those from 35 to 45 became conscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&amp;nbsp;313â314. Military officers including Joseph E. Johnston and Robert E. Lee, advocated conscription. In the circumstances they persuaded Congressmen and newspaper editors. Some editors advocating conscription in early 1862 later became "savage critics of conscription and of Davis for his enforcement of it: Yancey of Alabama, Rhett of the Charleston 'Mercury', Pollard of the Richmond 'Examiner', and Senator Wigfall of Texas".&lt;/ref&gt; The cry of "rich man's war and a poor man's fight" led Congress to abolish the substitute system altogether in December 1863. All principals benefiting earlier were made eligible for service. By February 1864, the age bracket was made 17 to 50, those under eighteen and over forty-five to be limited to in-state duty.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp.&amp;nbsp;313â314, 319. Apart from their respective system exemptions, populations under Federal administration were subject to a "wheel of fortune" draft by aggregate number from each state in each draft, rather than the Confederate's universal selection by age. Overrun areas such as Kentucky and Missouri were not subject to the draft, these areas expanded as the war progressed. The act abolishing the substitute system and nullifying the principal's exemption was challenged in court as a violation of contract, but "no court of importance so held".&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate conscription was not universal; it was a selective service. The First Conscription Act of April 1862 exempted occupations related to transportation, communication, industry, ministers, teaching and physical fitness. The Second Conscription Act of October 1862 expanded exemptions in industry, agriculture and conscientious objection. Exemption fraud proliferated in medical examinations, army furloughs, churches, schools, apothecaries and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 315â317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rich men's sons were appointed to the socially outcast "overseer" occupation, but the measure was received in the country with "universal odium". The legislative vehicle was the controversial [[Twenty Negro Law]] that specifically exempted one white overseer or owner for every plantation with at least 20 slaves. Backpedalling six months later, Congress provided overseers under 45 could be exempted only if they held the occupation before the first Conscription Act.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 320. One such exemption was allowed for every 20 slaves on a plantation, the May 1863 reform required previous occupation and that the plantation of 20 slaves (or group of plantations within a five-mile area) had not been subdivided after the first exemption of April 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of officials under state exemptions appointed by state Governor patronage expanded significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;317â318. There were no organized political parties, but elective offices were also exempted. Virtually every position was contested with as many as twenty candidates for each office. Some scholars such as Martis interpret this as robust democratic society in wartime. Coulter attributes the widely new found enthusiasm for political careers as a means to "get out of the army or keep from getting into it". State Governor patronage expanded most notably in the tens of thousands in Georgia and North Carolina. In Greene County, Georgia, two dozen men ran for three offices; in protest, the women of the county ran a ticket of three men older than the 45 years conscription age.&lt;/ref&gt; By law, substitutes could not be subject to conscription, but instead of adding to Confederate manpower, unit officers in the field reported that over-50 and under-17-year-old substitutes made up to 90% of the desertions.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Conscription Act of February 1864 "radically changed the whole system" of selection. It abolished industrial exemptions, placing detail authority in President Davis. As the shame of conscription was greater than a felony conviction, the system brought in "about as many volunteers as it did conscripts." Many men in otherwise "bombproof" positions were enlisted in one way or another, nearly 160,000 additional volunteers and conscripts in uniform. Still there was shirking.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'' pp. 322â324, 326. The Conscription Bureau was run by Brigadier General [[Gabriel J. Rains]] until May 1863, Brigadier General [[Charles W. Field]] until July 1864, Colonel [[John S. Preston]] until "the bitter end". The "odium and disgrace" of conscription led many to volunteer. The Bureau was "undoubtedly very inefficient" as officers were culled from those unwanted for field service. Virginia had 26,000 volunteers to 9,000 conscripts. Governor Vance NC "vigorously supported conscription", uncharacteristically netting 21,343 conscripts to 8,000 volunteers. Necessary railroad positions once demeaned as "blacks only" were in 1864 taken by whites of military age.&lt;/ref&gt; To administer the draft, a Bureau of Conscription was set up to use state officers, as state Governors would allow. It had a checkered career of "contention, opposition and futility". Armies appointed alternative military "recruiters" to bring in the out-of-uniform 17â50-year-old conscripts and deserters. Nearly 3000 officers were tasked with the job. By late 1864, Lee was calling for more troops. "Our ranks are constantly diminishing by battle and disease, and few recruits are received; the consequences are inevitable." By March 1865 conscription was to be administered by generals of the state reserves calling out men over 45 and under 18 years old. All exemptions were abolished. These regiments were assigned to recruit conscripts ages 17â50, recover deserters, and repel enemy cavalry raids. The service retained men who had lost but one arm or a leg in home guards. Then, in April 1865, Lee surrendered an army of 50,000. Conscription had been a failure.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;323â325, 327. Those governors with constitutional reservations refused to participate in conscription. In Fall 1864, Lee required of Davis a total number of 150,000 to match Grant's numbers, "else I fear a great calamity will befall us". This led to Davis appointing officers such as General Pillow to recruiting positions. As a military recruiting officer, [[Gideon J. Pillow]] for whom [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow]], was named, brought in 25,000 for [[Braxton Bragg]] and [[Joseph E. Johnston]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of the Confederacy depended on a strong base of civilians and soldiers devoted to victory. The soldiers performed well, though increasing numbers deserted in the last year of fighting, and the Confederacy never succeeded in replacing casualties as the Union could. The civilians, although enthusiastic in 1861â62, seem to have lost faith in the future of the Confederacy by 1864, and instead looked to protect their homes and communities. As Rable explains, "This contraction of civic vision was more than a crabbed [[libertarianism]]; it represented an increasingly widespread disillusionment with the Confederate experiment."&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victories: 1861====
The American Civil War broke out in April 1861 with a Confederate victory at the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina in the American Civil War|Charleston]].

In January, President [[James Buchanan]] had attempted to resupply the garrison with the steamship, ''[[Star of the West]]'', but Confederate artillery drove it away. In March, President Lincoln notified South Carolina Governor [[Francis W. Pickens|Pickens]] that without Confederate resistance to the resupply there would be no military reinforcement without further notice, but Lincoln prepared to force resupply if it were not allowed. Confederate President Davis, in cabinet, decided to seize Fort Sumter before the relief fleet arrived, and on April 12, 1861, General Beauregard forced its surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Alexander H.|authorlink=Alexander Stephens|title=A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States|url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionalview02steprich|format=PDF|volume=2|year=1870|page=36|quote=I maintain that it was inaugurated and begun, though no blow had been struck, when the hostile fleet, styled the 'Relief Squadron', with eleven ships, carrying two hundred and eighty-five guns and two thousand four hundred men, was sent out from New York and Norfolk, with orders from the authorities at Washington, to reinforce Fort Sumter peaceably, if permitted 'but forcibly if they must'&amp;nbsp;...}} After the war, Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens maintained that Lincoln's attempt to resupply Sumter was a disguised reinforcement and had provoked the war.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sumter, [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|Lincoln directed states to provide 75,000 troops]] for three months to recapture the Charleston Harbor forts and all other federal property.&lt;ref name=LincolnCallToArms&gt;
[http://www.civilwarhome.com/lincolntroops.htm Lincoln's proclamation calling for troops from the remaining states] (bottom of page); Department of War details to States (top).&lt;/ref&gt; This emboldened secessionists in Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina to secede rather than provide troops to march into neighboring Southern states. In May, Federal troops crossed into Confederate territory along the entire border from the Chesapeake Bay to New Mexico. The first battles were Confederate victories at Big Bethel ([[Battle of Big Bethel|Bethel Church, Virginia]]), First Bull Run ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) in Virginia July and in August, Wilson's Creek ([[Battle of Wilson's Creek|Oak Hills]]) in Missouri. At all three, Confederate forces could not follow up their victory due to inadequate supply and shortages of fresh troops to exploit their successes. Following each battle, Federals maintained a military presence and occupied Washington, DC; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Springfield, Missouri. Both North and South began training up armies for major fighting the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;352â353.&lt;/ref&gt; Union General [[George B. McClellan]]'s forces gained possession of much of northwestern Virginia in mid-1861, concentrating on towns and roads; the interior was too large to control and became the center of guerrilla activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar;cc=moawar;q1=red%20house;rgn=full%20text;idno=waro0005;didno=waro0005;view=image;seq=0580|title= The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies; Series 1|volume= 5|page=56}}4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Otis K. and Stephen W.

Lee]] was defeated at [[Cheat Mountain]] in September and no serious Confederate advance in western Virginia occurred until the next year.

Meanwhile, the Union Navy seized control of much of the Confederate coastline from Virginia to South Carolina. It took over plantations and the abandoned slaves. Federals there began a war-long policy of burning grain supplies up rivers into the interior wherever they could not occupy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Navy began a blockade of the major southern ports and prepared an invasion of Louisiana to capture New Orleans in early 1862.

====Incursions: 1862====
The victories of 1861 were followed by a series of defeats east and west in early 1862. To restore the Union by military force, the Federal strategy was to (1) secure the Mississippi River, (2) seize or close Confederate ports, and (3) march on Richmond. To secure independence, the Confederate intent was to (1) repel the invader on all fronts, costing him blood and treasure, and (2) carry the war into the North by two offensives in time to affect the mid-term elections.

Much of northwestern Virginia was under Federal control.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, Charles, ''Francis H. Pierpont: Union War Governor of Virginia and Father of West Virginia'', Univ. of North Carolina, 1937, p. 419, note 36. Letter of Adjutant General Henry L. Samuels, August 22, 1862, to Gov. Francis Pierpont listing 22 of 48 counties under sufficient control for soldier recruitment.&lt;br /&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsb&amp;fileName=037/llsb037.db&amp;recNum=1996 ''Congressional Globe,'' 37th Congress, 3rd Session, Senate Bill S.531, February 14, 1863] "A bill supplemental to the act entitled 'An act for the Admission of the State of 'West Virginia' into the Union, and for other purposes' which would include the counties of "Boone, Logan, Wyoming, Mercer, McDowell, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Greenbrier, Monroe, Pendleton, Fayette, Nicholas, and Clay, now in the possession of the so-called confederate government".&lt;/ref&gt;
In February and March, most of Missouri and Kentucky were Union "occupied, consolidated, and used as staging areas for advances further South". Following the repulse of Confederate counter-attack at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], Tennessee, permanent Federal occupation expanded west, south and east.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 27. In the Mississippi River Valley, during the first half of February, central Tennessee's [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] was lost and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]] fell with a small army. By the end of the month, [[Tennessee in the american civil war#Twin Rivers Campaign of 1862|Nashville]], Tennessee was the first conquered Confederate state capital. On April 6â7, Federals turned back the Confederate offensive at the Battle of Shiloh, and three days later [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island Number 10]], controlling the upper Mississippi River, fell to a combined Army and Naval gunboat siege of three weeks.&lt;p&gt;Federal occupation of Confederate territory expanded to include northwestern Arkansas, south down the Mississippi River and east up the Tennessee River. The Confederate River Defense fleet sank two Union ships at [[Battle of Plum Point Bend|Plum Point Bend]] (naval Fort Pillow), but they withdrew and [[Fort Pillow, Tennessee|Fort Pillow]] was captured downriver.&lt;/ref&gt; Confederate forces repositioned south along the Mississippi River to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where at the naval [[Battle of Memphis]], its River Defense Fleet was sunk. Confederates withdrew from northern Mississippi and northern Alabama. [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] was captured April 29 by a combined Army-Navy force under U.S. Admiral [[David Farragut]], and the Confederacy lost control of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It had to concede extensive agricultural resources that had supported the Union's sea-supplied logistics base.&lt;ref name="Martis28"&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Confederates had suffered major reverses everywhere, as of the end of April the Confederacy still controlled territory holding 72% of its population.&lt;ref name="Martis27"&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 27. Federal occupation expanded into northern Virginia, and their control of the Mississippi extended south to Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/ref&gt; Federal forces disrupted Missouri and Arkansas; they had broken through in western Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Louisiana. Along the Confederacy's shores, Union forces had closed ports and made garrisoned lodgments on every coastal Confederate state except Alabama and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 354. Federal sea-based amphibious forces captured [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]], North Carolina along with a large garrison in February. In March, Confederates abandoned forts at [[Amelia Island|Fernandia]] and [[St. Augustine in the American Civil War#Early war|St. Augustine]] Florida, and lost [[Battle of New Berne|New Berne]], North Carolina. In April, [[Capture of New Orleans|New Orleans]] fell and Savannah, Georgia was closed by the [[Battle of Fort Pulaski]]. In May retreating Confederates burned their two pre-war Navy yards at Norfolk and Pensacola. See Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287, 306, 302&lt;/ref&gt; Although scholars sometimes assess the Union blockade as ineffectual under international law until the last few months of the war, from the first months it disrupted Confederate privateers, making it "almost impossible to bring their prizes into Confederate ports".&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 294, 296â7. Europeans refused to allow captured U.S. shipping to be sold for the privateers 95% share, so through 1862, Confederate privateering disappeared. The CSA Congress authorized a Volunteer Navy to man cruisers the following year.&lt;/ref&gt; British firms developed small fleets of [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade running]] companies, such as [[George Trenholm|John Fraser and Company]], and the Ordnance Department secured its own blockade runners for dedicated munitions cargoes.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp.&amp;nbsp;288â291. As many as half the Confederate blockade runners had British nationals serving as officers and crew. Confederate regulations required one-third, then one-half of the cargoes to be munitions, food and medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Civil War fleets of [[Ironclad warship|armored warships]] were deployed for the first time in sustained blockades at sea. After some success against the Union blockade, in March the ironclad [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] was forced into port and burned by Confederates at their retreat. Despite several attempts mounted from their port cities, CSA naval forces were unable to break the Union blockade. Attempts were made by Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall]]'s ironclads from Savannah in 1862 with the [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']].&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 287, 306, 302, 306 and [http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org11-2.htm CSS Atlanta, USS Atlanta. Navy Heritage]. In both events, as with the CSS ''Virginia'', the Navy's bravery and fighting skill was compromised in combat by mechanical failure in the engines or steering. The joint combined Army-Navy defense by General [[Robert E. Lee]], and his successor and Commodore [[Josiah Tattnall]], repelled amphibious assault of Savannah for the duration of the war. Union General [[Tecumseh Sherman]] captured Savannah from the land side in December 1864. The British blockade runner [[USS Atlanta (1861)#As Fingal|''Fingal'']] was purchased and converted to the ironclad [[USS Atlanta (1861)|CSS ''Atlanta'']]. It made two sorties, was captured by Union forces, repaired, and returned to service as the ironclad USS ''Atlanta'' supporting Grant's [[Siege of Petersburg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of the Navy [[Stephen Mallory]] placed his hopes in a European-built ironclad fleet, but they were never realized. On the other hand, four new English-built commerce raiders served the Confederacy, and several fast blockade runners were sold in Confederate ports. They were converted into commerce-raiding cruisers, and manned by their British crews.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 303. French shipyards built four corvettes, and two ironclad rams for the Confederacy, but the American minister prevented their delivery. British firms contracted to build two additional ironclad rams, but under threat from the U.S., the British government bought them for their own navy. Two of the converted blockade runners effectively raided up and down the Atlantic coast until the end of the war.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east, Union forces could not close on Richmond. General McClellan landed his army on the [[Peninsula Campaign|Lower Peninsula]] of Virginia. Lee subsequently ended that threat from the east, then Union General John Pope attacked overland from the north only to be repulsed at Second Bull Run ([[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Manassas]]). Lee's strike north was turned back at Antietam MD, then Union [[Ambrose Burnside|Major General Ambrose Burnside's]] offensive was disastrously ended at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] VA in December. Both armies then turned to winter quarters to recruit and train for the coming spring.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 354â356. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign caused the surprised Confederates to destroy their winter camp to mobilize against the threat to their Capital. They burned "a vast amount of supplies" to keep them from falling into enemy hands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to seize the initiative, reprovision, protect farms in mid-growing season and influence U.S. Congressional elections, two major Confederate incursions into Union territory had been launched in August and September 1862. Both [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of Kentucky and [[Battle of Antietam|Lee's invasion]] of Maryland were decisively repulsed, leaving Confederates in control of but 63% of its population.&lt;ref name="Martis27"/&gt; Civil War scholar [[Allan Nevins]] argues that 1862 was the strategic [[Ordinary high water mark|high-water mark]] of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Nevin's analysis of the strategic highpoint of Confederate military scope and effectiveness is in contra-distinction to the conventional "last chance" battlefield imagery of the [[High-water mark of the Confederacy]] found at "The Angle" of the Battle of Gettysburg.&lt;/ref&gt; The failures of the two invasions were attributed to the same irrecoverable shortcomings: lack of manpower at the front, lack of supplies including serviceable shoes, and exhaustion after long marches without adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, ''War for the Union'' (1960) pp 289â290. Weak national leadership led to disorganized overall direction in contrast to improved organization in Washington. With another 10,000 men Lee and Bragg might have prevailed in the border states, but the local populations did not respond to their pleas to recruit additional soldiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September Confederate General [[William W. Loring]] pushed Federal forces from [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston, Virginia]], and the Kanawha Valley in western Virginia, but lacking re-inforcements Loring abandoned his position and by November the region was back in Federal control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rice |first=Otis K. |first2=Stephen W. |last2=Brown |title=West Virginia, A History |publisher=Univ. of Kentucky Press |year=1993 |edition=2nd |pages=134â135 |isbn=0-8131-1854-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh23-1.html|title=The Civil War Comes to Charleston|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anaconda: 1863â64====
The failed Middle [[Tennessee in the Civil War|Tennessee]] campaign was ended January 2, 1863, at the inconclusive Battle of Stones River ([[Battle of Stones River|Murfreesboro]]), both sides losing the largest percentage of casualties suffered during the war. It was followed by another strategic withdrawal by Confederate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy won a significant victory April 1863, repulsing the Federal advance on Richmond at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], but the Union consolidated positions along the Virginia coast and the Chesapeake Bay.

Without an effective answer to Federal gunboats, river transport and supply, the Confederacy lost the Mississippi River following the capture of [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]], Mississippi, and [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] in July, ending Southern access to the trans-Mississippi West. July brought short-lived counters, [[Morgan's Raid]] into Ohio and the [[New York City draft riots]]. Robert E. Lee's strike into Pennsylvania was repulsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], Pennsylvania despite Pickett's famous charge and other acts of valor. Southern newspapers assessed the campaign as "The Confederates did not gain a victory, neither did the enemy."

September and November left Confederates yielding [[Chattanooga Campaign|Chattanooga]], Tennessee, the gateway to the lower south.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the war fighting was restricted inside the South, resulting in a slow but continuous loss of territory. In early 1864, the Confederacy still controlled 53% of its population, but it withdrew further to reestablish defensive positions. Union offensives continued with [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] to take Savannah and Grant's [[Overland Campaign|Wilderness Campaign]] to encircle Richmond and besiege Lee's army at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Martis (1994) p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1863, the C.S. Congress authorized a uniformed Volunteer Navy, many of whom were British.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 297â298. They were required to supply their own ships and equipment, but they received 90% of their captures at auction, 25% of any U.S. warships or transports captured or destroyed. Confederate cruisers raided merchant ship commerce but for one exception in 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilmington and Charleston had more shipping while "blockaded" than before the beginning of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 294. Confederates estimated that the Union Blockade interdicted no more than 10% of the cotton exported, but the Lincoln administration claimed one of every three blockade runners were being captured.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy had altogether eighteen commerce destroying cruisers, which seriously disrupted Federal commerce at sea and increased shipping insurance rates 900%.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', pp. 305â306. The most successful Confederate merchant raider 1863â1864, [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] had ranged the Atlantic for two years, sinking 58 vessels worth {{sic|?|$6,54,000}}, but she was trapped and sunk in June by the chain-clad {{USS|Kearsarge|1861|6}} off Cherbourg, France.&lt;/ref&gt; Commodore Tattnall unsuccessfully attempted to break the Union blockade on the Savannah River in Georgia with an ironclad again in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', in 1862, [http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org11-2.htm CSS Atlanta, USS Atlanta. Navy Heritage], in 1863 the ironclad [[CSS Savannah (ironclad)|CSS ''Savannah'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in April 1864 the ironclad [[CSS Albemarle|CSS ''Albemarle'']] engaged Union gunboats and sank or cleared them for six months on the Roanoke River North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; The Federals closed [[Battle of Mobile Bay|Mobile Bay]] by sea-based amphibious assault in August, ending Gulf coast trade east of the Mississippi River. In December, the [[Battle of Nashville]] ended Confederate operations in the western theater.

Large numbers of families relocated to safer places, usually remote rural areas, bringing along household slaves if they had any. Mary Massey argues these elite exiles introduced an element of defeatism into the southern outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey, ''Refugee Life in the Confederacy'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collapse: 1865====
The first three months of 1865 saw the Federal [[Carolinas Campaign]], devastating a wide swath of the remaining Confederate heartland. The "breadbasket of the Confederacy" in the Great Valley of Virginia was occupied by Philip Sheridan. The Union Blockade captured [[Fort Fisher]] NC, and Sherman finally took [[Second Battle of Charleston Harbor|Charleston]] SC by land attack.&lt;ref name="Martis28"/&gt;

The Confederacy controlled no ports, harbors or navigable rivers. Railroads were captured or had ceased operating. Its major food producing regions had been war-ravaged or occupied. Its administration survived in only three pockets of territory holding one-third its population. Its armies were defeated or disbanding. At the February 1865 [[Hampton Roads Conference]] with Lincoln, senior Confederate officials rejected his invitation to restore the Union with compensation for emancipated slaves.&lt;ref name="Martis28"/&gt; The three pockets of unoccupied Confederacy were southern Virginia-North Carolina, central Alabama-Florida, and Texas, the latter two areas less from any notion of resistance than from the disinterest of Federal forces to occupy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foote |first=Shelby |date=1974 |title=The Civil War, a narrative: Vol III |url= |location= |publisher= |page=967 |quote=Sherman was closing in on Raleigh, whose occupation tomorrow would make it the ninth of the eleven seceded state capitals to feel the tread of the invader; all, that is, but Austin and Tallahassee, whose survival was less the result of their ability to resist than it was of Federal oversight or disinterest. |isbn=0 394 74622 8 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Davis policy was independence or nothing, while Lee's army was wracked by disease and desertion, barely holding the trenches defending Jefferson Davis' capital.

The Confederacy's last remaining blockade-running port, [[Battle of Wilmington|Wilmington]], North Carolina, was lost. When the Union broke through Lee's lines at Petersburg, [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond]] fell immediately. Lee surrendered the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]], Virginia, on April 9, 1865. "The Surrender" marked the end of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, ''The Confederate States of America'', p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Japanese ironclad KÅtetsu#American career as CSS Stonewall|CSS ''Stonewall'']] sailed from Europe to break the Union blockade in March; on making Havana, Cuba it surrendered. Some high officials escaped to Europe, but President Davis was captured May 10; all remaining Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865. The U.S. Army took control of the Confederate areas without post-surrender insurgency or [[guerrilla warfare]] against them, but peace was subsequently marred by a great deal of local violence, feuding and revenge killings.&lt;ref&gt;The French-built ironclad [[Japanese ironclad KÅtetsu#American career as CSS Stonewall|CSS ''Stonewall'']] had been purchased from Denmark and set sail from Spain in March.

Historian [[Gary Gallagher]] concluded that the Confederacy capitulated in early 1865 because northern armies crushed "organized southern military resistance". The Confederacy's population, soldier and civilian, had suffered material hardship and social disruption. They had expended and extracted a profusion of blood and treasure until collapse; "the end had come".&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson Davis' assessment in 1890 determined, "With the capture of the capital, the dispersion of the civil authorities, the surrender of the armies in the field, and the arrest of the President, the Confederate States of America disappeared&amp;nbsp;... their history henceforth became a part of the history of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Jefferson.

Accessed July 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress passed additional Amnesty Acts in May 1866 with restrictions on office holding, and the [[Amnesty Act]] in May 1872 lifting those restrictions. There was a great deal of discussion in 1865 about bringing treason trials, especially against Jefferson Davis. There was no consensus in President Johnson's cabinet and there were no treason trials against anyone. In the case of Davis there was a strong possibility of acquittal which would have been humiliating for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roy Franklin |last=Nichols |title=United States vs. Jefferson Davis, 1865â1869 |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |year=1926 |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=266â284 |jstor=1838262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was indicted for treason but never tried; he was released from prison on bail in May 1867. The amnesty of December 25, 1868, by President Johnson eliminated any possibility of Jefferson Davis (or anyone else associated with the Confederacy) standing trial for treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jefferson Davis|title=The Papers of Jefferson Davis: June 1865 â December 1870|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCFFUrkgy60C&amp;pg=PA96|year=2008|publisher=Louisiana State UP|page=96|isbn=9780807133415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, "United States vs. Jefferson Davis, 1865â1869".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard P.

[[Henry Wirz]], the [[commandant]] of a notorious [[prisoner-of-war]] camp near [[Andersonville, Georgia]], was tried and convicted by a military court, and executed on November 10, 1865. The charges against him involved conspiracy and cruelty, not treason.

The U.S. government began a decade-long process known as [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] which attempted to resolve the political and constitutional issues of the Civil War. The priorities were: to guarantee that Confederate nationalism and slavery were ended, to ratify and enforce the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] which outlawed slavery; the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] which guaranteed dual U.S. and state citizenship to all native-born residents, regardless of race; and the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]], which made it illegal to deny the right to vote because of race.&lt;ref&gt;John David Smith, ed. ''Interpreting American History: Reconstruction'' (Kent State University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1877, the [[Compromise of 1877]] ended Reconstruction in the former Confederate states. Federal troops were withdrawn from the South, where conservative white Southern Democrats had already regained political control of state governments, often through extreme violence and fraud to suppress black voting. Confederate veterans had been temporarily disenfranchised by Reconstruction policy. The prewar South had many rich areas; the war left the entire region economically devastated by military action, ruined infrastructure, and exhausted resources. Continuing to be dependent on an agricultural economy and resisting investment in infrastructure, the region remained dominated by the planter elite into the 20th century. After 1890 the Democratic-dominated legislatures worked to secure their control by passing new constitutions and amendments at the turn of the 20th century that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites]]. This exclusion of blacks from the political system, and great weakening of the Republican Party, was generally maintained until  the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. The [[Solid South]] of the early 20th century was built on white Democratic control of politics. The region did not achieve national levels of prosperity until long after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=William J.|last2=Terrill|first2=Tom E.|title=The American South: a history|year=2009|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=0-7425-6095-3|page=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Texas v. White''====
In ''[[Texas v. White]]'', {{ussc|74|700|1869}} the United States Supreme Court ruled â by a 5â3 majority â that Texas had remained a state ever since it first joined the Union, despite claims that it joined the Confederate States of America. In this case, the court held that the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] did not permit [[United States states|a state]] to unilaterally secede from the United States. Further, that the ordinances of secession, and all the acts of the legislatures within seceding states intended to give effect to such ordinances, were "absolutely [[Void (law)|null]]", under the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Robert Bruce |title=Legal Cases of the Civil War |year=2003 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=0-8117-0059-3 |pages=155â159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This case settled the law that applied to all questions regarding state legislation during the war. Furthermore, it decided one of the "central constitutional questions" of the Civil War: The Union is perpetual and indestructible, as a matter of constitutional law. In declaring that no state could leave the Union, "except through revolution or through consent of the States", it was "explicitly repudiating the position of the Confederate states that the United States was a voluntary compact between sovereign states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuczek |first=Richard |title=Encyclopedia of the Reconstruction Era |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=H80eQweo0V4C&amp;pg=PA649 |chapter=Texas v.

===Theories regarding the Confederacy's demise===

===="Died of states' rights"====
Historian [[Frank Lawrence Owsley]] argued that the Confederacy "died of states' rights".&lt;ref name="Frank L. Owsley 1925"&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank L. |last=Owsley |title=State Rights in the Confederacy |location=Chicago |publisher= |year=1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |title=The Confederate Nation |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owsley |title=Local Defense and the Overthrow of the Confederacy |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=11 |year=1925 |pages=492â525 |jstor=1895910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government was denied requisitioned soldiers and money by governors and state legislatures because they feared that Richmond would encroach on the rights of the states. Georgia's governor [[Joseph E. Brown|Joseph Brown]] warned of a secret conspiracy by Jefferson Davis to destroy states' rights and individual liberty. The first conscription act in North America authorizing Davis to draft soldiers was said to be the "essence of military despotism".&lt;ref&gt;Rable (1994) 257. For a detailed criticism of Owsley's argument see {{cite book |first=Richard E. |last=Beringer |first2=William N. Jr. |last2=Still |first3=Archer |last3=Jones |first4=Herman |last4=Hattaway |title=Why the South Lost the Civil War |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=1986 |pages=443â57 }} Brown declaimed against Davis Administration policies: "Almost every act of usurpation of power, or of bad faith, has been conceived, brought forth and nurtured in secret session."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book |first=Richard |last=Beringer |display-authors=etal |title=Why the South Lost the Civil War |location= |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=1986 |pages=64â83, 424â57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Vice President Alexander H. Stephens feared losing the very form of republican government. Allowing President Davis to threaten "arbitrary arrests" to draft hundreds of governor-appointed "bomb-proof" bureaucrats conferred "more power than the English Parliament had ever bestowed on the king. History proved the dangers of such unchecked authority."&lt;ref name="google258"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rable |year=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaxuu3YTD3oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage |title=The Confederate Republic: A Revolution Against Politics |pages=258, 259 |isbn=9780807821442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The abolishment of draft exemptions for newspaper editors was interpreted as an attempt by the Confederate government to muzzle presses, such as the Raleigh NC ''Standard'', to control elections and to suppress the peace meetings there. As Rable concludes, "For Stephens, the essence of patriotism, the heart of the Confederate cause, rested on an unyielding commitment to traditional rights" without considerations of military necessity, pragmatism or compromise.&lt;ref name="google258"/&gt;

In 1863 governor [[Pendleton Murrah]] of Texas determined that state troops were required for defense against Plains Indians and Union forces that might attack from Kansas. He refused to send his soldiers to the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Moretta |title=Pendleton Murrah and States Rights in Civil War Texas |journal=Civil War History |year=1999 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=126â146 |doi=10.1353/cwh.1999.0101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Zebulon Vance]] of North Carolina showed intense opposition to conscription, limiting recruitment success. Vance's faith in states' rights drove him into repeated, stubborn opposition to the Davis administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Albert Burton |last=Moore |title=Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy |year=1924 |page=295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite political differences within the Confederacy, no national political parties were formed because they were seen as illegitimate. "Anti-partyism became an article of political faith."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2000) p. 462. Rable (1994) pp. 2â3. Rable wrote, "But despite heated arguments and no little friction between the competing political cultures of unity and liberty, antiparty and broader fears about politics in general shaped civic life. These beliefs could obviously not eliminate partisanship or prevent Confederates from holding on to and exploiting old political prejudices.&amp;nbsp;... Even the most bitter foes of the Confederate government, however, refused to form an opposition party, and the Georgia dissidents, to cite the most prominent example, avoided many traditional political activities. Only in North Carolina did there develop anything resembling a party system, and there the central values of the Confederacy's two political cultures had a far more powerful influence on political debate than did organizational maneuvering."&lt;/ref&gt; Without a two-party system building alternative sets of national leaders, electoral protests tended to be narrowly state-based, "negative, carping and petty". The 1863 mid-term elections became mere expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction. According to historian David M. Potter, this lack of a functioning two-party system caused "real and direct damage" to the Confederate war effort since it prevented the formulation of any effective alternatives to the conduct of the war by the Davis administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=David Herbert |editor-last=Donald |title=Why the North Won the Civil War |year=1996 |pages=112â113 }} Potter wrote in his contribution to this book, "Where parties do not exist, criticism of the administration is likely to remain purely an individual matter; therefore the tone of the criticism is likely to be negative, carping, and petty, as it certainly was in the Confederacy. But where there are parties, the opposition group is strongly impelled to formulate real alternative policies and to press for the adoption of these policies on a constructive basis.&amp;nbsp;... But the absence of a two-party system meant the absence of any available alternative leadership, and the protest votes which were cast in the [1863 Confederate mid-term] election became more expressions of futile and frustrated dissatisfaction rather than implements of a decision to adopt new and different policies for the Confederacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Died of Davis"====
The enemies of President Davis proposed that the Confederacy "died of Davis". He was unfavorably compared to [[George Washington]] by critics such as [[Edward Alfred Pollard]], editor of the most influential newspaper the ''[[Richmond Examiner]]''.  Coulter summarizes, "The American Revolution had its Washington; the Southern Revolution had its Davis&amp;nbsp;... one succeeded and the other failed." Beyond the early honeymoon period, Davis was never popular. He unwittingly caused much internal dissension from early on. His ill health and temporary bouts of blindness disabled him for days at a time.&lt;ref name="Coulter pp 105-06"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coulter |title=Confederate States of America |pages=105â106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter says Davis was heroic and his will was indomitable. But his "tenacity, determination, and will power" stirred up lasting opposition of enemies Davis could not shake. He failed to overcome "petty leaders of the states" who made the term "Confederacy" into a label for tyranny and oppression, denying the "[[Flags of the Confederate States of America#First National Flag ("The Stars and Bars") - 1861|Stars and Bars]]" from becoming a symbol of larger patriotic service and sacrifice. Instead of campaigning to develop nationalism and gain support for his administration, he rarely courted public opinion, assuming an aloofness, "almost like an Adams".&lt;ref name="Coulter pp 105-06" /&gt;

Escott argues that Davis was unable to mobilize Confederate nationalism in support of his government effectively, and especially failed to appeal to the small farmers who comprised the bulk of the population. In addition to the problems caused by states rights, Escott also emphasizes that the widespread opposition to any strong central government combined with the vast difference in wealth between the slave-owning class and the small farmers created insolvable dilemmas when the Confederate survival presupposed a strong central government backed by a united populace. The prewar claim that white solidarity was necessary to provide a unified Southern voice in Washington no longer held. Davis failed to build a network of supporters who would speak up when he came under criticism, and he repeatedly alienated governors and other state-based leaders by demanding centralized control of the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Escott |title=After Secession: Jefferson Davis and the Failure of Confederate Nationalism |location= |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-8071-1807-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was not an efficient administrator. He attended to too many details. He protected his friends after their failures were obvious. He spent too much time on military affairs versus his civic responsibilities. Coulter concludes he was not the ideal leader for the Southern Revolution, but he showed "fewer weaknesses than any other" contemporary character available for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coulter |title=Confederate States of America |pages=108, 113, 103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Lee]]'s assessment of Davis as President was, "I knew of none that could have done as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopedia Virginia |url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Davis_Jefferson_1808-1889 |title=Jefferson Davis (1808â1889) |accessdate=March 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==

===Political divisions===
{{Main|List of C.S. states by date of admission to the Confederacy}}
{{CS statehood and territory dates}}

===Constitution===
{{Main|Confederate States Constitution}}
{{Wikisource|Constitution of the Confederate States of America}}

The Southern leaders met in Montgomery, Alabama, to write their constitution. Much of the [[Confederate States Constitution]] replicated the [[United States Constitution]] verbatim, but it contained several explicit protections of the institution of slavery including provisions for the recognition and protection of slavery in any territory of the Confederacy. It maintained the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|ban on international slave-trading]] while protecting the [[Slavery in the United States#Internal slave trade|existing internal trade]] of slaves among slaveholding states.

In certain areas, the Confederate Constitution gave greater powers to the states (or curtailed the powers of the central government more) than the U.S. Constitution of the time did, but in other areas, the states lost rights they had under the U.S. Constitution. Although the Confederate Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, contained a [[commerce clause]], the Confederate version prohibited the central government from using revenues collected in one state for funding [[internal improvement]]s in another state. The Confederate Constitution's equivalent to the U.S. Constitution's [[General Welfare clause|general welfare clause]] prohibited [[protective tariff]]s (but allowed tariffs for providing domestic revenue), and spoke of "carry[ing] on the Government of the Confederate States" rather than providing for the "general welfare". State legislatures had the power to [[impeachment|impeach]] officials of the Confederate government in some cases. On the other hand, the Confederate Constitution contained a [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] and a [[Supremacy Clause]] that essentially duplicated the respective clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The Confederate Constitution also incorporated each of the 12 amendments to the U.S. Constitution that had been ratified up to that point.

The Confederate Constitution did not specifically include a provision allowing states to secede; the Preamble spoke of each state "acting in its sovereign and independent character" but also of the formation of a "permanent federal government". During the debates on drafting the Confederate Constitution, one proposal would have allowed states to secede from the Confederacy. The proposal was tabled with only the South Carolina delegates voting in favor of considering the motion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederate Constitution also explicitly denied States the power to bar slaveholders from other parts of the Confederacy from bringing their slaves into any state of the Confederacy or to interfere with the property rights of slave owners traveling between different parts of the Confederacy. In contrast with the language of the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution overtly asked God's blessing ("...&amp;nbsp;invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God&amp;nbsp;...").

====Executive====
{{main|President of the Confederate States of America}}

The Montgomery Convention to establish the Confederacy and its executive met on February 4, 1861. Each state as a sovereignty had one vote, with the same delegation size as it held in the U.S. Congress, and generally 41 to 50 members attended.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, "Confederate States of America", p. 22. The Texas delegation had four in the U.S. Congress, seven in the Montgomery Convention.&lt;/ref&gt; Offices were "provisional", limited to a term not to exceed one year. One name was placed in nomination for president, one for vice president. Both were elected unanimously, 6â0.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, "Confederate States of America", p. 23. While the Texas delegation was seated, and is counted in the "original seven" states of the Confederacy, its referendum to ratify secession had not taken place, so its delegates did not yet vote on instructions from their state legislature.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davis4-2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Jefferson Davis]]&lt;br /&gt;President 1861â65]]

Jefferson Davis was elected provisional president. His U.S. Senate resignation speech greatly impressed with its clear rationale for secession and his pleading for a peaceful departure from the Union to independence. Although he had made it known that he wanted to be commander-in-chief of the Confederate armies, when elected, he assumed the office of Provisional President. Three candidates for provisional Vice President were under consideration the night before the February 9 election. All were from Georgia, and the various delegations meeting in different places determined two would not do, so Alexander H. Stephens was elected unanimously provisional Vice President, though with some privately held reservations. Stephens was inaugurated February 11, Davis February 18.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, "Confederate States of America", pp.&amp;nbsp;23â26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis and Stephens were elected President and Vice President, unopposed [[Confederate States presidential election, 1861|on November 6, 1861]]. They were inaugurated on February 22, 1862.

Historian E. M. Coulter observed, "No president of the U.S. ever had a more difficult task." Washington was inaugurated in peacetime. Lincoln inherited an established government of long standing. The creation of the Confederacy was accomplished by men who saw themselves as fundamentally conservative. Although they referred to their "Revolution", it was in their eyes more a counter-revolution against changes away from their understanding of U.S. founding documents. In Davis' inauguration speech, he explained the Confederacy was not a French-like revolution, but a transfer of rule. The Montgomery Convention had assumed all the laws of the United States until superseded by the Confederate Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, "Confederate States of America", pp. 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Constitution provided for a President of the Confederate States of America, elected to serve a six-year term but without the possibility of re-election. Unlike the United States Constitution, the Confederate Constitution gave the president the ability to subject a bill to a [[line item veto]], a power also held by some state governors.

The Confederate Congress could overturn either the general or the line item vetoes with the same two-thirds votes required in the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]]. In addition, appropriations not specifically requested by the executive branch required passage by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The only person to serve as president was [[Jefferson Davis]], due to the Confederacy being defeated before the completion of his term.

[[File:Confederate congress.jpg|thumb|'''[[Provisional Confederate Congress|Provisional Congress]]''', Montgomery, Alabama]]

The only two "formal, national, functioning, civilian administrative bodies" in the Civil War South were the Jefferson Davis administration and the Confederate Congresses. The Confederacy was begun by the Provisional Congress in Convention at Montgomery, Alabama on February 28, 1861. It had one vote per state in a unicameral assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Martis |first=Kenneth C. |title=The Historical Atlas of the Congresses of the Confederate States of America: 1861â1865 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |year=1994 |isbn=0-13-389115-1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Confederate Congress was elected and began its first session February 18, 1862. The Permanent Congress for the Confederacy followed the United States forms with a bicameral legislature. The Senate had two per state, twenty-six Senators. The House numbered 106 representatives apportioned by free and slave populations within each state. Two Congresses sat in six sessions until March 18, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The political influences of the civilian, soldier vote and appointed representatives reflected divisions of political geography of a diverse South. These in turn changed over time relative to Union occupation and disruption, the war impact on local economy, and the course of the war. Without political parties, key candidate identification related to adopting secession before or after Lincoln's call for volunteers to retake Federal property. Previous party affiliation played a part in voter selection, predominantly secessionist Democrat or unionist Whig.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 72â73&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of political parties made individual roll call voting all the more important, as the Confederate "freedom of roll-call voting [was] unprecedented in American legislative history.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Key issues throughout the life of the Confederacy related to (1) suspension of habeas corpus, (2) military concerns such as control of state militia, conscription and exemption, (3) economic and fiscal policy including impressment of slaves, goods and scorched earth, and (4) support of the Jefferson Davis administration in its foreign affairs and negotiating peace.&lt;ref&gt;Martis, ''Historical Atlas'', pp. 90â91&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate Constitution outlined a judicial branch of the government, but the ongoing war and resistance from states-rights advocates, particularly on the question of whether it would have appellate jurisdiction over the state courts, prevented the creation or seating of the "Supreme Court of the Confederate States;" the state courts generally continued to operate as they had done, simply recognizing the Confederate States as the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=821 |title="Legal Materials on the Confederate States of America in the Schaffer Law Library", Albany Law School |publisher=Albanylaw.edu |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103033519/http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=821 |archive-date=November 3, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate district courts were authorized by Article III, Section 1, of the Confederate Constitution,&lt;ref name="ReferenceJud"&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Confederate States of America#a3-s1|Constitution of the Confederate States of America â Wikisource, the free online library]]&lt;/span&gt;. Retrieved July 6, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and President Davis appointed judges within the individual states of the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name="Moise, E. Warren 2003"&gt;[Moise, E. Warren, Rebellion in the Temple of Justice (iUniverse 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the same US Federal District Judges were appointed as Confederate States District Judges. Confederate district courts began reopening in early 1861, handling many of the same type cases as had been done before. Prize cases, in which Union ships were captured by the Confederate Navy or raiders and sold through court proceedings, were heard until the blockade of southern ports made this impossible. After a Sequestration Act was passed by the Confederate Congress, the Confederate district courts heard many cases in which enemy aliens (typically Northern absentee landlords owning property in the South) had their property sequestered (seized) by Confederate Receivers.

When the matter came before the Confederate court, the property owner could not appear because he was unable to travel across the [[front line]]s between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred.&lt;ref name="Moise, E. Warren 2003" /&gt; Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/021.html |title=Records of District Courts of the United States, National Archives |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Confederacy was formed and its seceding states broke from the Union, it was at once confronted with the arduous task of providing its citizens with a mail delivery system, and, in the midst of the [[American Civil War]], the newly formed Confederacy created and established the Confederate Post Office. One of the first undertakings in establishing the Post Office was the appointment of [[John H. Reagan]] to the position of Postmaster General, by [[Jefferson Davis]] in 1861, making him the first Postmaster General of the Confederate Post Office as well as a member of Davis' presidential cabinet. Through Reagan's resourcefulness and remarkable industry, he had his department assembled, organized and in operation before the other Presidential cabinet members had their departments fully operational.&lt;ref name="JOHN H. REAGAN - The Old Roman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reaganscvcamp.org/ |title=JOHN H. REAGAN â The Old Roman |publisher= John H.

When the war began, the US Post Office still delivered mail from the secessionist states for a brief period of time. Mail that was postmarked after the date of a state's admission into the Confederacy through May 31, 1861, and bearing US postage was still delivered.&lt;ref name="U.S. Postal used in the Confederacy "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;mode=&amp;tid=2040514 |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |title=U.S. Postal Issue Used in the Confederacy (1893)|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this time, private express companies still managed to carry some of the mail across enemy lines. Later, mail that crossed lines had to be sent by [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Covers|'Flag of Truce']] and was allowed to pass at only two specific points. Mail sent from the South to the North states was received, opened and inspected at [[Fortress Monroe]] on the Virginia coast before being passed on into the U.S. mail stream. Mail sent from the North to the South passed at [[City Point, Virginia|City Point]], also in Virginia, where it was also inspected before being sent on.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Flavius McCaleb, "The Organization of the Post-Office Department of the Confederacy", ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 12, No. 1 (Oct. 1906), pp. 66â74 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1832885 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. R. Garrison, "Administrative Problems of the Confederate Post Office Department I", ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' Vol. 19, No. 2 (Oct. 1915), pp. 111â141 and Vol. 19, No. 3 (Jan. 1916), pp. 232â250 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30234666 in JSTOR] and [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30237275 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the chaos of the war, a working postal system was more important than ever for the Confederacy. The Civil War had divided family members and friends and consequently letter writing increased dramatically across the entire divided nation, especially to and from the men who were away serving in an army. Mail delivery was also important for the Confederacy for a myriad of business and military reasons. Because of the Union blockade, basic supplies were always in demand and so getting mailed correspondence out of the country to suppliers was imperative to the successful operation of the Confederacy. Volumes of material have been written about the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade runners]] who evaded Union ships on blockade patrol, usually at night, and who moved cargo and mail in and out of the Confederate States throughout the course of the war. Of particular interest to students and historians of the American Civil War is ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Prisoner of war mail|Prisoner of War mail]]'' and ''[[Postage stamps and postal history of the Confederate States#Blockade mail|Blockade mail]]'' as these items were often involved with a variety of military and other war time activities. The postal history of the Confederacy along with [[:File:Pow cover 19May1865.jpg|surviving Confederate mail]] has helped historians document the various people, places and events that were involved in the American Civil War as it unfolded.&lt;ref name="Confederate States Post Office"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027888 |title=Confederate States Post Office |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
The Confederacy actively used the army to arrest people suspected of loyalty to the United States. Historian [[Mark E. Neely, Jr.|Mark Neely]] found 4,108 names of men arrested and estimated a much larger total.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1999) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Confederacy arrested pro-Union civilians in the South at about the same rate as the Union arrested pro-Confederate civilians in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1999) p. 172. Neely notes that. "Most surprising of all, the Confederacy at a greater rate than the North arrested persons who held opposition political views at least in part because they held them, despite the Confederacy's vaunted lack of political parties. Such arrests were more common before 1863 while memories of the votes on secession remained fresh."&lt;/ref&gt; Neely argues:

{{quote|The Confederate citizen was not any freer than the Union citizen â and perhaps no less likely to be arrested by military authorities. In fact, the Confederate citizen may have been in some ways less free than his Northern counterpart. For example, freedom to travel within the Confederate states was severely limited by a domestic passport system.&lt;ref&gt;Neely (1993) pp. 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Confederate States of America}}

===Slaves===
Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than loyalty to the old master; [[Bell I. Wiley|Bell Wiley]] says, "It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom." Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bell Irvin |last=Wiley |title=Southern Negroes, 1861â1865 |year=1938 |pages=21, 66â69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]], an executive order of the U.S. government on January 1, 1863, changed the legal status of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free". The long-term effect was that the Confederacy could not preserve the institution of slavery, and lost the use of the core element of its plantation labor force. Slaves were legally freed by the Proclamation, and became free by escaping to federal lines, or by advances of federal troops. Many freed slaves served as volunteers in the federal army as teamsters, cooks, laundresses and laborers, and eventually as soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historynet.com/african-americans-in-the-civil-war|title= African Americans In The Civil War|work= History Net: Where History Comes Alive â World &amp; US History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Leon F. |last=Litwack |title=Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1979 |pages=30â36, 105â66 |isbn=0-394-50099-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By "[[Juneteenth]]" (June 19, 1865, in Texas), the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all its slaves. Their owners never received compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Michael |editor-last=Vorenberg |title=The Emancipation Proclamation: A Brief History with Documents |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Kolchin |title=Reexamining Southern Emancipation in Comparative Perspective |journal=[[Journal of Southern History]] |volume=81 |issue=1 |year=2015 |pages=7â40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===
Most whites were subsistence farmers who traded their surpluses locally. The plantations of the South, with white ownership and an enslaved labor force, produced substantial wealth from cash crops. It supplied two-thirds of the world's cotton, which was in high demand for textiles, along with tobacco, sugar, and naval stores (such as turpentine). These raw materials were exported to factories in Europe and the Northeast. Planters reinvested their profits in more slaves and fresh land, for cotton and tobacco depleted the soil. There was little manufacturing or mining; shipping was controlled by outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 13â14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Douglas Hurt, ''Agriculture and the Confederacy: Policy, Productivity, and Power in the Civil War South'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plantations that enslaved over three million black people were the principal source of wealth. Most were concentrated in "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|black belt]]" plantation areas (because few white families in the poor regions owned slaves.) For decades there had been widespread fear of slave revolts. During the war extra men were assigned to "home guard" patrol duty and governors sought to keep militia units at home for protection. Historian William Barney reports, "no major slave revolts erupted during the Civil War." Nevertheless, slaves took the opportunity to enlarge their sphere of independence, and when union forces were nearby, many ran off to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L. Barney|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R6BpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291|year=2011|publisher=Oxford Up|page=291|isbn=9780199878147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leslie Alexander|title=Encyclopedia of African American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&amp;pg=PA351|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=351|isbn=9781851097746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave labor was applied in industry in a limited way in the Upper South and in a few port cities. One reason for the regional lag in industrial development was top-heavy income distribution. Mass production requires mass markets, and [[Economics of slavery|slaves]] living in small cabins, using self-made tools and outfitted with one suit of work clothes each year of inferior fabric, did not generate consumer demand to sustain local manufactures of any description in the same way a mechanized family farm of free labor did in the North. The Southern economy was "pre-capitalist" in that slaves were put to work in the largest revenue-producing enterprises, not free labor market. That labor system as practiced in the American South encompassed paternalism, whether abusive or indulgent, and that meant labor management considerations apart from productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 12â15&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 85% of both North and South white populations lived on family farms, both regions were predominantly agricultural, and mid-century industry in both was mostly domestic. But the Southern economy was pre-capitalist in its overwhelming reliance on the agriculture of cash crops to produce wealth, while the great majority of farmers fed themselves and supplied a small local market. Southern cities and industries grew faster than ever before, but the thrust of the rest of the country's exponential growth elsewhere was toward urban industrial development along transportation systems of canals and railroads. The South was following the dominant currents of the American economic mainstream, but at a "great distance" as it lagged in the all-weather modes of transportation that brought cheaper, speedier freight shipment and forged new, expanding inter-regional markets.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' pp. 15â16&lt;/ref&gt;

A third count of southern pre-capitalist economy relates to the cultural setting. The South and southerners did not adopt a [[work ethic]], nor the habits of thrift that marked the rest of the country. It had access to the tools of capitalism, but it did not adopt its culture. The Southern Cause as a national economy in the Confederacy was grounded in "slavery and race, planters and patricians, plain folk and folk culture, cotton and plantations".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''The Confederate Nation'' p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====National production====
[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war; the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union]]
The Confederacy started its existence as an agrarian economy with exports, to a world market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and [[sugarcane]]. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of "[[King Cotton]]". When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled up everywhere, but most turned to food production. All across the region, the lack of repair and maintenance wasted away the physical assets.

The eleven states had produced $155 million in manufactured goods in 1860, chiefly from local grist-mills, and lumber, processed tobacco, cotton goods and [[naval stores]] such as turpentine. The main industrial areas were border cities such as Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville and St. Louis, that were never under Confederate control. The government did set up munitions factories in the Deep South. Combined with captured munitions and those coming via blockade runners, the armies were kept minimally supplied with weapons. The soldiers suffered from reduced rations, lack of medicines, and the growing shortages of uniforms, shoes and boots. Shortages were much worse for civilians, and the prices of necessities steadily rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Conn Bryan|title=Confederate Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oeZr20kWbiAC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2009|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|pages=105â9|isbn=9780820334998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy adopted a [[tariff]] or tax on imports of 15%, and imposed it on all imports from other countries, including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/imls/tariff/tariff.html Tariff of the Confederate States of America, May 21, 1861].&lt;/ref&gt; The tariff mattered little; the Union blockade minimized commercial traffic through the Confederacy's ports, and very few people paid taxes on goods smuggled from the North. The Confederate government in its entire history collected only $3.5 million in tariff revenue. The lack of adequate financial resources led the Confederacy to finance the war through printing money, which led to high inflation. The Confederacy underwent an economic revolution by centralization and standardization, but it was too little too late as its economy was systematically strangled by blockade and raids.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Drury, ed. ''American Civil War: Naval &amp; Economic Warfare'' (2003) p. 138. {{ISBN|0-00-716458-0}}. "The Confederacy underwent a government-led industrial revolution during the war, but its economy was slowly strangled."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation systems===
{{Main|Confederate railroads in the American Civil War}}
[[File:Railroad of Confederacy-1861.jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|Main railroads of Confederacy, 1861; colors show the different gauges (track width); the top railroad shown in the upper right is the Baltimore and Ohio, which was at all times a Union railroad]]
[[File:Hensie-fry-hanging-brownlow-1861.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Passers-by abusing the bodies of Union supporters near [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]. The two were hanged by Confederate authorities near the railroad tracks so passing train passengers could see them.]]
In peacetime, the South's extensive and connected systems of navigable rivers and coastal access allowed for cheap and easy transportation of agricultural products. The railroad system in the South had developed as a supplement to the navigable rivers to enhance the all-weather shipment of cash crops to market. Railroads tied plantation areas to the nearest river or seaport and so made supply more dependable, lowered costs and increased profits. In the event of invasion, the vast geography of the Confederacy made logistics difficult for the Union. Wherever Union armies invaded, they assigned many of their soldiers to garrison captured areas and to protect rail lines.

At the onset of the Civil War the South had a rail network disjointed and plagued by changes in [[track gauge]] as well as lack of interchange. Locomotives and freight cars had fixed axles and could not use tracks of different gauges (widths). Railroads of different gauges leading to the same city required all freight to be off-loaded onto wagons for transport to the connecting railroad station, where it had to await freight cars and a [[locomotive#Motive power|locomotive]] before proceeding. Centers requiring off-loading included Vicksburg, New Orleans, Montgomery, Wilmington and Richmond.&lt;ref name="Trains1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hankey|first1= John P.|year= 2011|title= The Railroad War|journal= Trains|publisher= Kalmbach Publishing Company|volume= 71|issue= 3|pages= 24â35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most rail lines led from coastal or river ports to inland cities, with few lateral railroads. Due to this design limitation, the relatively primitive railroads of the Confederacy were unable to overcome the Union naval blockade of the South's crucial intra-coastal and river routes.

The Confederacy had no plan to expand, protect or encourage its railroads. Southerners' refusal to export the cotton crop in 1861 left railroads bereft of their main source of income.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ramsdell, "The Confederate Government and the Railroads, ''American Historical Review'', (1917) 22#4 pp. 794â810 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/1836241 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Many lines had to lay off employees; many critical skilled technicians and engineers were permanently lost to military service. In the early years of the war the Confederate government had a hands-off approach to the railroads. Only in mid-1863 did the Confederate government initiate a national policy, and it was confined solely to aiding the war effort.&lt;ref name="Ersatz"&gt;Mary Elizabeth Massey. ''Ersatz in the Confederacy'' (1952) p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Railroads came under the ''de facto'' control of the military. In contrast, the U.S. Congress had authorized military administration of Union-controlled railroad and telegraph systems in January 1862, imposed a standard gauge, and built railroads into the South using that gauge. Confederate armies successfully reoccupying territory could not be resupplied directly by rail as they advanced. The C.S. Congress formally authorized military administration of railroads in February 1865.

In the last year before the end of the war, the Confederate railroad system stood permanently on the verge of collapse. There was no new equipment and raids on both sides systematically destroyed key bridges, as well as locomotives and freight cars. Spare parts were cannibalized; feeder lines were torn up to get replacement rails for trunk lines, and rolling stock wore out through heavy use.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsdell, "The Confederate Government and the Railroads", pp. 809â810.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Horses and mules====
The Confederate army experienced a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Jones, "The Influence of Horse Supply Upon Field Artillery in the American Civil War", ''Journal of Military History'', (April 2010), 74#2 pp 357â377,&lt;/ref&gt; Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of [[glanders]], a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians.&lt;ref&gt;G. Terry Sharrer, "The great glanders epizootic, 1861â1866", ''Agricultural History'', (1995) 69#1 pp 79â97 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3744026 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1863 the invading Union forces had a policy of shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need â in order to keep them out of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers experienced a growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.&lt;ref&gt;
Keith Miller, "Southern Horse", ''Civil War Times'', (February 2006) 45#1 pp 30â36 [https://web.archive.org/web/20170605233123/http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;hid=18&amp;sid=c4e9ecb5-83b8-46e6-a393-de91880f7354%40sessionmgr13&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=ahl&amp;AN=19359914 online]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial instruments===
Both the individual Confederate states and later the Confederate government printed [[Confederate States of America dollar]]s as paper currency in various denominations, with a total face value of $1.5 billion. Much of it was signed by Treasurer [[Edward C. Elmore]]. Inflation became rampant as the paper money depreciated and eventually became worthless. The state governments and some localities printed their own paper money, adding to the runaway inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William J. |last=Cooper |title=Jefferson Davis, American |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j05vwNRXi-0C&amp;pg=PA378 |year=2010 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=378 |isbn=9780307772640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many bills still exist, although in recent years counterfeit copies have proliferated.

The Confederate government initially wanted to finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried up and the Confederacy increasingly turned to [[Government debt|issuing debt]] and printing money to pay for war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. A tax increase might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states throughout the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Burdekin |first2=Farrokh |last2=Langdana |title=War Finance in the Southern Confederacy, 1861â1865 |journal=Explorations in Economic History |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=352â376 |year=1993 |doi=10.1006/exeh.1993.1015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John D. |last=Wright |title=The Language of the Civil War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3aEJZRIxjDAC&amp;pg=PA41 |year=2001 |page=41 |isbn=9781573561358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederate government took over the three national mints: the [[Charlotte Mint]] in North Carolina, the [[Dahlonega Mint]] in Georgia, and the [[New Orleans Mint]] in Louisiana. During 1861, the first two produced small amounts of gold coinage, the latter half dollars. Since the mints used the current dies on hand, these issues remain indistinguishable from those minted by the Union. In New Orleans the Confederacy used its own reverse design to strike four half dollars. US coinage was hoarded and did not have any general circulation. U.S. coinage was admitted as legal tender up to $10, as were British sovereigns, French Napoleons and Spanish and Mexican doubloons at a fixed rate of exchange. Confederate money was paper and postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coulter |title=Confederate States of America |pages=151â153, 127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food shortages and riots===
{{Main|Southern bread riots}}
[[File:Apr2 richmond riot.jpg|thumb|upright|Richmond bread riot, 1863]]
By mid-1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured goods. Food that formerly came overland was cut off.

Women had charge of making do. They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with flax and peas to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee and it was hard to develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items like flour and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jessica Fordham |last=Kidd |title=Privation and Pride: Life in Blockaded Alabama |journal=Alabama Heritage Magazine |year=2006 |volume=82 |issue= |pages=8â15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Elizabeth |last=Massey |title=Ersatz in the Confederacy: Shortages and Substitutes on the Southern Homefront |year=1952 |pages=71â73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State governments pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food. Most refused. When cotton prices soared in Europe, expectations were that Europe would soon intervene to break the blockade and make them rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. Merton |last=Coulter |title=The Movement for Agricultural Reorganization in the Cotton South during the Civil War |journal=Agricultural History |year=1927 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=3â17 |jstor=3739261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth of omnipotent "[[King Cotton]]" died hard. The Georgia legislature imposed cotton quotas, making it a crime to grow an excess. But food shortages only worsened, especially in the towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. Mildred |last=Thompson |title=Reconstruction In Georgia: Economic, Social, Political 1865â1872 |year=1915 |pages=14â17, 22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in urban areas. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1863, the poor women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, and merchants. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephanie |last=McCurry |title='Bread or Blood!' |journal=Civil War Times |year=2011 |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=36â41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Teresa Crisp |last=Williams |first2=David |last2=Williams |title='The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women |journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly |year=2002 |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=49â83 |jstor=40584640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael B. |last=Chesson |title=Harlots or Heroines?

===Devastation by 1865===
By the end of the war deterioration of the Southern infrastructure was widespread. The number of civilian deaths is unknown. Every Confederate state was affected, but most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, while Texas and Florida saw the least military action. Much of the damage was caused by direct military action, but most was caused by lack of repairs and upkeep, and by deliberately using up resources. Historians have recently estimated how much of the devastation was caused by military action.  Paul Paskoff calculates that Union military operations were conducted in 56% of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida). These counties contained 63% of the 1860 white population and 64% of the slaves. By the time the fighting took place, undoubtedly some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul F. |last=Paskoff |title=Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy |journal=Civil War History |year=2008 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=35â62 |doi=10.1353/cwh.2008.0007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The eleven Confederate States in the 1860 United States Census had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their actual population was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48 million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.&lt;ref name="Paskoff, Measures of War"&gt;Paskoff, "Measures of War"&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic losses affected everyone. Banks and insurance companies were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure was about the same whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer at the end of the war than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Paskoff, Measures of War"/&gt;

The rebuilding took years and was hindered by the low price of cotton after the war. Outside investment was essential, especially in railroads. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Samuel |last=Ezell |title=The South since 1865 |year=1963 |pages=27â28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes&amp;nbsp;... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Effect on women and families===

About 250,000 men never came home, some 30 percent of all white men aged 18 to 40, in 1860. Widows who were overwhelmed often abandoned the farm and merged into the households of relatives, or even became refugees living in camps with high rates of disease and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Lisa Tendrich |editor-last=Frank |title=Women in the American Civil War |location= |publisher= |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old South, being an "old maid" was something of an embarrassment to the woman and her family.

Divorce, while never fully accepted, became more common. The concept of the "New Woman" emerged â she was self-sufficient and independent, and stood in sharp contrast to the "Southern Belle" of antebellum lore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anya |last=Jabour |title=Scarlett's Sisters: Young Women in the Old South |location= |publisher=U of North Carolina Press |year=2007 |pages=273â280 |isbn=978-0-8078-3101-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Confederate Rebel Flag.svg|thumb|This [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Confederate flag|Confederate Flag]] pattern is the one most often thought of as the Confederate Flag today; it was one of many used by the Confederate armed forces. Variations of this design served as the Battle Flag of the Armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee, and as the Confederate Naval Jack.]]
The first official flag of the Confederate States of America â called the "Stars and Bars" â originally had seven stars, representing the first seven states that initially formed the Confederacy. As more states joined, more stars were added, until the total was 13 (two stars were added for the divided states of Kentucky and Missouri). During the First Battle of Bull Run, ([[First Battle of Bull Run|First Manassas]]) it sometimes proved difficult to distinguish the Stars and Bars from the [[Flag of the United States#Historical progression of designs|Union flag]]. To rectify the situation, a separate "Battle Flag" was designed for use by troops in the field. Also known as the "Southern Cross", many variations sprang from the original square configuration. Although it was never officially adopted by the Confederate government, the popularity of the Southern Cross among both soldiers and the civilian population was a primary reason why it was made the main color feature when a new national flag was adopted in 1863. This new standard â known as the "Stainless Banner" â consisted of a lengthened white field area with a Battle Flag canton. This flag too had its problems when used in military operations as, on a windless day, it could easily be mistaken for a flag of truce or surrender. Thus, in 1865, a modified version of the Stainless Banner was adopted. This final national flag of the Confederacy kept the Battle Flag canton, but shortened the white field and added a vertical red bar to the fly end.

Because of its depiction in the 20th-century and popular media, many people consider the rectangular battle flag with the dark blue bars as being synonymous with "the Confederate Flag", but this flag was never adopted as a Confederate national flag. The "Confederate Flag" has a color scheme similar to the official Battle Flag, but is rectangular, not square. (Its design and shape matches the Naval Jack, but the blue bars are darker.) The "Confederate Flag" is a highly recognizable symbol of the South in the United States today, and continues to be a controversial icon.

==Geography==
===Region and climate===
The Confederate States of America claimed a total of {{convert|2919|mi|km}} of coastline, thus a large part of its territory lay on the seacoast with level and often sandy or marshy ground. Most of the interior portion consisted of arable farmland, though much was also hilly and mountainous, and the far western territories were deserts. The lower reaches of the [[Mississippi River]] bisected the country, with the western half often referred to as the [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]]. The highest point (excluding Arizona and New Mexico) was [[Guadalupe Peak]] in Texas at {{convert|8750|ft|m}}.

[[File:Map of CSA 4.png|center|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of the states and territories claimed by the Confederate States of America]]

'''Climate'''

Much of the area claimed by the Confederate States of America had a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters and long, hot, humid summers. The climate and terrain varied from vast [[swamp]]s (such as those in Florida and Louisiana) to semi-arid [[steppe climate|steppes]] and arid [[desert climate|deserts]] west of longitude 100 degrees west. The subtropical climate made winters mild but allowed [[infectious disease]]s to flourish. Consequently, on both sides more soldiers died from disease than were killed in combat,&lt;ref name="StatsWarCost"&gt;Two-thirds of soldiers' deaths occurred due to disease. {{cite web|last=Nofi|first=Al|authorlink=Albert Nofi|title=Statistics on the War's Costs|publisher=Louisiana State University|date=June 13, 2001|url=http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711050249/http://www.cwc.lsu.edu/other/stats/warcost.htm|archivedate=July 11, 2007|accessdate=September 8, 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt; a fact hardly atypical of preâWorld War I conflicts.

In 1860 the areas that later formed the eleven Confederate States (and including the future West Virginia) had 132,760 (1.46%) free blacks. Males made up 49.2% of the total population and females 50.8% (whites: 48.60% male, 51.40% female; slaves: 50.15% male, 49.85% female; free blacks: 47.43% male, 52.57% female).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 All data for this section taken from the University of Virginia Library, Historical Census Browser, Census Data for Year 1860] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |date=October 11, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural and urban population===
[[File:A Home on the Mississippi.png|thumb|upright=1.35|''[[A Home on the Mississippi]]'', [[Currier and Ives]], 1871]]
The CSA was overwhelmingly rural land. Few towns had populations of more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;â the typical [[county seat]] had a population of fewer than 500 people. Cities were rare. Of the twenty largest U.S. cities in the 1860 census, only [[New Orleans]] lay in Confederate territory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab09.txt|title=U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1860, Internet Release date: June 15, 1998|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;â and the Union captured New Orleans in 1862. Only 13 Confederate-controlled cities ranked among the top 100 U.S. cities in 1860, most of them ports whose economic activities vanished or suffered severely in the [[Union blockade]]. The population of Richmond swelled after it became the Confederate capital, reaching an estimated 128,000 in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Dabney 1990 p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Other Southern cities in the Border slave-holding states such as [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Maryland's sympathies|Baltimore]], [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C.]], [[West Virginia in the American Civil War#Guerrilla war|Wheeling]] (W.Va., formerly Va.), [[Alexandria, Virginia#American Civil War|Alexandria]], [[Louisville in the American Civil War|Louisville]], and [[St. Louis in the American Civil War|St. Louis]] never came under the control of the Confederate government.

[[File:St. John's Episcopal Montgomery Feb 2012 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[St. John's Episcopal Church (Montgomery, Alabama)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], established in 1834. The church building was completed in 1855. The Secession Convention of Southern Churches was held here in 1861.]]

The CSA was overwhelmingly [[Protestant]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall M. Miller, Harry S. Stout, and Charles Reagan, eds. ''Religion and the American Civil War'' (1998) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195121295 excerpt and text search]; [https://www.questia.com/read/78824365 complete edition online]&lt;/ref&gt; Both free and enslaved populations identified with [[evangelical Protestantism]]. [[Baptists]] and [[Methodists]] together formed majorities of both the white and the slave population (see ''[[Black church]]''). [[Freedom of religion]] and [[separation of church and state]] were fully ensured by Confederate laws. [[Church attendance]] was very high and chaplains played a major role in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Robinson-Durso, "Chaplains in the Confederate Army." ''Journal of  Church and State'' 33 (1991): 747+.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large denominations experienced a NorthâSouth split in the prewar era on the issue of [[slavery]]. The creation of a new country necessitated independent structures. For example, the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] split, with much of the new leadership provided by [[Joseph Ruggles Wilson]] (father of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]).  In 1861, he organized the meeting that formed General Assembly of the Southern Presbyterian Church and served as its chief executive for thirty-seven years.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel,  "Southern Presbyterians in the Confederacy." ''North Carolina Historical Review'' 44.3 (1967): 231â255.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23517888 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Baptists and Methodists both broke off from their Northern coreligionists over the slavery issue, forming the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel,  "The Southern Baptists in the Confederacy." ''Civil War History'' 6.4 (1960): 389â401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Clinton Prim. "Southern Methodism in the Confederacy". ''Methodist history'' 23.4 (1985): 240â249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elites in the southeast favored the [[Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America]], which reluctantly split off the [[Episcopal Church (USA)]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Legare Pennington,  "The Confederate Episcopal Church and the Southern Soldiers." ''Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church'' 17.4 (1948): 356â383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42972008 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Other elites were [[Presbyterians]] belonging to the 1861-founded [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. Catholics included an Irish working class element in coastal cities and an old French element in southern Louisiana. Other insignificant and scattered religious populations included [[Lutherans]], the [[Holiness movement]], other [[Reformed]], other [[Christian fundamentalists]], the [[Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]], the [[Churches of Christ]], the [[Latter-day Saints movement]], [[Adventists]], [[Muslims]], [[Jews]], [[Native American religion|Native American animists]], [[deists]] and [[irreligious]] people.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Gleeson, ''The Green and the Gray: The Irish in the Confederate States of America'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidney J. Romero, "Louisiana Clergy and the Confederate Army". ''Louisiana History'' 2.3 (1961): 277â300. {{jstor.org|4230621}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. The Southern Baptists started in 1862 and had a total of 78 missionaries. Presbyterians were even more active with 112 missionaries in January 1865. Other missionaries were funded and supported by the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Lutherans. One result was wave after wave of revivals in the Army.&lt;ref&gt;W. Harrison Daniel, "Southern Protestantism and Army Missions in the Confederacy".

It also rejects [[revelation]] as a source of religious knowledge and asserts that [[reason]] and [[observation]] of the [[Nature|natural world]] are sufficient to determine the existence of a [[Creator deity|single creator]] or [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]] of the [[universe]].&lt;!--

Hardwick |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the classical view takes what is called a "cold" approach by asserting the non-intervention of a [[deity]] in the natural behavior of the created universe, while the modern deist formulation can be either "warm" (citing an involved deity) or "cold" (citing an uninvolved deity). These lead to many subdivisions of modern deism, which serves as an overall category of belief.&lt;ref name="modern_deism_categories"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Universe Next Door: A Basic Worldview Catalog | author=James W.

In this sense, Deism was represented as the view of those who reduced the role of God to a mere act of creation in accordance with rational laws discoverable by man and held that, after the original act, God virtually withdrew and refrained from interfering in the processes of nature and the ways of man. So stark an interpretation of the relations of God and man, however, was accepted by very few Deists during the flowering of the doctrine, though their religious antagonists often attempted to force them into this difficult position.

==Overview==
{{See also|Theism}}
Deism is a [[theology|theological]] theory concerning the relationship between a creator and the natural world. Deistic viewpoints emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the 18th-century Enlightenment. Deism stood between the narrow dogmatism of the period and [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Though deists rejected [[atheism]],&lt;ref name="GonzÃ¡lez1984"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Justo L. GonzÃ¡lez|title= The Reformation to the present day|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate= 2010-08-14|year=  1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn= 978-0-06-063316-5|page= 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often were called "atheists" by more traditional theists.&lt;ref name="McLellandReligion1988"&gt;{{Cite book|author1= Joseph C. McLelland|author2= Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion|title= Prometheus rebound: the irony of atheism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=y0LP9AiNS_wC&amp;pg=PA83|accessdate= 2010-08-14|date= November 1988|publisher= Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn= 978-0-88920-974-9|page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of different forms in the 17th and 18th centuries. In England, deists included a range of people from anti-Christian to non-Christian theists.&lt;ref name="ForcePopkin1990"&gt;{{Cite book|author1= James E. Force|author2= Richard Henry Popkin|title= Essays on the context, nature, and influence of Isaac Newton's theology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=modLIHCBCIoC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate= 2010-08-14|year= 1990|publisher= Springer|isbn= 978-0-7923-0583-5|page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For deists, human beings can know God only via reason and the observation of nature, but not by revelation or by supernatural manifestations (such as miracles) â phenomena which deists regard with caution if not [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]]. Deism is related to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] because it credits the formation of life and the universe to a higher power, using only natural processes. Deism may also include a spiritual element, involving experiences of God and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://moderndeism.com/html/deism_defined.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120719064712/http://moderndeism.com/html/deism_defined.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2012-07-19 |title= Deism Defined |publisher= Moderndeism.com |accessdate= 2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''deism'' and ''theism'' both derive from words for "god": the former from Latin ''deus'', the latter from Greek ''theÃ³s'' (Î¸ÎµÏÏ).

{{quote|Prior to the 17th Century the terms ["deism" and "deist"] were used interchangeably with the terms "theism" and "theist", respectively. ... Theologians and philosophers of the 17th Century began to give a different signification to the words... Both [theists and deists] asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator... . But the theist taught that God remained actively interested in and operative in the world which he had made, whereas the Deist maintained that God endowed the world at creation with self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then surrendered it wholly to the operation of these powers acting as second causes.&lt;ref&gt;

Perhaps the first recorded use of the term ''deist'' ({{lang-fr|dÃ©iste}}) occurs in [[Pierre Viret]]'s ''Instruction ChrÃ©tienne en la doctrine de la foi et de l'Ãvangile'' (Christian teaching on the doctrine of faith and the Gospel, 1564), reprinted in [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]]'s ''Dictionnaire'' (1697) entry ''Viret''. Viret, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], flagged the term as a neologism (''un mot tout nouveau''),&lt;ref&gt;

Viret wrote that a group of people believed in "some sort of God" like the Jews and Turks but regarded the doctrine of the evangelists and the apostles as a mere myth.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} According to him Deists wrongly misinterpreted the liberty given to them during the reform period.

In England, the term ''deist'' first appeared in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;

[[Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1583â1648) is considered the "father of English deism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174913/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (1624) the first major statement of deism. Deism flourished in England between 1690 and 1740, at which time [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (1730), also called "The Deist's Bible," gained much attention. Later deism spread to France (notably through the work of [[Voltaire]]), to Germany, and to North America.

==Features==
The concept of deism covers a wide variety of positions on a wide variety of religious issues. [[Leslie Stephen|Sir Leslie Stephen]] describes the core of deism as consisting of "critical" and "constructional" elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stephen|first= Leslie|date= 1881 |title= History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century 3rd Edition 2 vols (reprinted 1949)|url= |location= London|publisher= Smith, Elder &amp; Co|page= |isbn= 978-0844614212|author-link= Leslie Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical''' elements of deist thought included:
* Rejection of religions that are based on books that claim to contain the revealed word of God.
* Rejection of religious dogma and demagogy.
* Skepticism of reports of miracles, prophecies and religious "mysteries".

'''Constructional''' elements of deist thought included:
* God exists and created the universe.
* God gave humans the ability to reason.

Individual deists varied in the critical and constructive elements they argued for. Some{{who|date= November 2018}} rejected miracles and prophecies, but still considered themselves Christians because they believed in what they felt was the pure, original form of Christianity{{spaced ndash}}that is, Christianity as it supposedly existed before it was corrupted by additions of such superstitions as miracles, prophecies, and the doctrine of the Trinity. Some deists rejected the claim of Jesus' divinity but continued to hold him in high regard as a moral teacher, a position known as [[Christian deism]], exemplified by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s famous ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'' and Matthew Tindal's ''Christianity as Old as the Creation.'' Other, more radical deists,{{who|date= November 2018}} rejected Christianity altogether and expressed hostility toward Christianity, which they regarded as pure superstition. In return, Christian writers often charged radical deists with [[atheism]].

Note that the terms ''constructive'' and ''critical'' are used to refer to aspects of deistic thought, not sects or subtypes of deism{{spaced ndash}}it would be incorrect to classify any particular deist author as "a constructive deist" or "a critical deist". As [[Peter Gay]] notes:

{{quote|All Deists were in fact both critical and constructive Deists. All sought to destroy in order to build, and reasoned either from the absurdity of Christianity to the need for a new philosophy or from their desire for a new philosophy to the absurdity of Christianity. Each deist, to be sure, had his special competence. While one specialized in abusing priests, another specialized in rhapsodies to nature, and a third specialized in the skeptical reading of sacred documents. Yet whatever strength the movement hadâand it was at times formidableâit derived that strength from a peculiar combination of critical and constructive elements.|Peter Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'', p. 13}}
It should be noted, however, that the constructive element of deism was not unique to deism. It was the same as the [[natural theology]] that was so prevalent in all English theology in the 17th and 18th centuries. What set deists apart from their more orthodox contemporaries were their critical concerns.

{{quote|Defining the essence of English deism is a formidable task. Like ''[[priestcraft]]'', ''atheism'', and ''freethinking'', ''deism'' was one of the dirty words of the age. Deists were stigmatized{{spaced ndash}}often as atheists{{spaced ndash}}by their Christian opponents. Yet some Deists claimed to be Christian, and as Leslie Stephen argued in retrospect, the Deists shared so many fundamental rational suppositions with their orthodox opponents... that it is practically impossible to distinguish between them. But the term ''deism'' is nevertheless a meaningful one.... Too many men of letters of the time agree about the essential nature of English deism for modern scholars to ignore the simple fact that what sets the Deists apart from even their most [[latitudinarian]] Christian contemporaries is their desire to lay aside scriptural revelation as rationally incomprehensible, and thus useless, or even detrimental, to human society and to religion. While there may possibly be exceptions, ... most Deists, especially as the eighteenth century wears on, agree that revealed Scripture is nothing but a joke or "well-invented flam." About mid-century, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], in his historical and analytical account of the movement [''View of the Principal Deistical Writers''], squarely states that the rejection of revealed Scripture is ''the'' characteristic element of deism, a view further codified by such authorities as [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. ... "DEISM," writes [[William Stephens (minister)|Stephens]] bluntly, "is a denial of all reveal'd Religion." |James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to'' An Account of the Growth of Deism in England ''(1696) by William Stephens}}
One of the remarkable features of deism is that the critical elements did not overpower the constructive elements. As E. Graham Waring observed,&lt;ref name="Waring1967"&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Waring|first=E. Graham |title=Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book
 |year=1967 |pages=Introduction, p. xv
 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A strange feature of the [Deist] controversy is the apparent acceptance of all parties of the conviction of the existence of God." And Basil Willey observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Willey|first=Basil |title=The Eighteenth Century Background|year=1940
 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|M. [[Paul Hazard]] has recently described the Deists of this time 'as rationalists with nostalgia for religion': men, that is, who had allowed the spirit of the age to separate them from orthodoxy, but who liked to believe that the slope they had started upon was not slippery enough to lead them to atheism.}}

===Concepts of "reason"===
According to the deists, reason gives all the information needed:
{{quote|By natural religion, I understand the belief of the existence of a God, and the sense and practice of those duties which result from the knowledge we, by our reason, have of him and his perfections; and of ourselves, and our own imperfections, and of the relationship we stand in to him, and to our fellow-creatures; so that the religion of nature takes in everything that is founded on the reason and nature of things.
|Matthew Tindal, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (II)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Waring|first=E. Graham |title=Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book
 |year=1967 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Consequently, the deists attempted to use reason as a critical tool for exposing and rejecting what they saw as nonsense:
{{quote|I hope to make it appear that the use of reason is not so dangerous in religion as it is commonly represented ... There is nothing that men make a greater noise about than the "mysteries of the Christian religion". The divines gravely tell us "we must adore what we cannot comprehend" ... [Some] contend [that] some mysteries may be, or at least seem to be, contrary to reason, and yet received by faith. [Others contend] that no mystery is contrary to reason, but that all are "above" it. On the contrary, we hold that reason is the only foundation of all certitude ... Wherefore, we likewise maintain, according to the title of this discourse, that ''there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to reason, nor above it; and that no Christian doctrine can be properly called a mystery''.
|John Toland, ''Christianity Not Mysterious: or, a Treatise Shewing That There Is Nothing in the Gospel Contrary to Reason, Nor above It'' (1696)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book'', pp. 1â12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arguments for the existence of a god===
Some deists used the [[cosmological argument]] for the existence of God - as did [[Thomas Hobbes]] in several of his writings:

{{quote|The effects we acknowledge naturally, do include a power of their producing, before they were produced; and that power presupposeth something existent that hath such power; and the thing so existing with power to produce, if it were not eternal, must needs have been produced by somewhat before it, and that again by something else before that, till we come to an eternal, that is to say, the first power of all powers and first cause of all causes; and this is it which all men conceive by the name of God, implying eternity, incomprehensibility, and omnipotence.|Thomas Hobbes, ''Works'', vol. 4, pp. 59â60; quoted in John Orr, ''English Deism'', p. 76}}

===History of religion and the deist mission===
Most deists (see for instance [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' and
[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]'') saw the religions of their day as corruptions of an original, pure religion that was simple and rational. They felt that this original pure religion had become corrupted by "priests" who had manipulated it for personal gain and for the class interests of the priesthood in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Champion|first=J.A.I.|
title=The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken: The Church of England and its Enemies, 1660-1730|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)}} Champion maintains that historical argument was a central component of the deists' defences of what they considered true religion.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this world view, over time priests had succeeded in encrusting the original simple, rational religion with all kinds of superstitions and "mysteries"{{spaced ndash}}irrational theological doctrines. Laymen were told by the priests that only the priests really knew what was necessary for salvation and that laymen must accept the mysteries on faith and on the priests' authority. This kept the laity baffled by the nonsensical "mysteries", confused, and dependent on the priests for information about the requirements for salvation. The priests consequently enjoyed a position of considerable power over the laity, which they strove to maintain and increase. Deists referred to this kind of manipulation of religious doctrine as "priestcraft," a highly derogatory term.  As [[Thomas Paine]] wrote:

{{quote|As priestcraft was always the enemy of knowledge, because priestcraft supports itself by keeping people in delusion and ignorance, it was consistent with its policy to make the acquisition of knowledge a real sin.| ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part 2, p. 129}}

Deists saw their mission as the stripping away of "priestcraft" and "mysteries" from religion, thereby restoring religion to its original, true condition{{spaced ndash}}simple and rational. In many cases, they considered true, original Christianity to be the same as this original [[natural religion]]. As Matthew Tindal put it:{{quote
|It can't be imputed to any defect in the light of nature that the pagan world ran into idolatry, but to their being entirely governed by priests, who pretended communication with their gods, and to have thence their revelations, which they imposed on the credulous as divine oracles. Whereas the business of the Christian dispensation was to destroy all those traditional revelations, and restore, free from all idolatry, the true primitive and natural religion implanted in mankind from the creation.|Matthew Tindal, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (XIV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waring|first=Edward Graham|title=Deism and natural religion: a source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JHXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2013-05-16|year=1967|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co.|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One implication of this deist [[creation myth]] was that primitive societies, or societies that existed in the distant past, should have religious beliefs that are less encrusted with superstitions and closer to those of natural theology.  This position gradually became less plausible as thinkers such as [[David Hume]] began studying the [[Four Dissertations#The Natural History of Religion|natural history of religion]] and suggesting that the origins of religion lay not in reason but in the emotions, specifically the fear of the unknown.

===Freedom and necessity===
Enlightenment thinkers, under the influence of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian science]], tended to view the universe as a vast machine, created and set in motion by a creator being, that continues to operate according to natural law, without any divine intervention. This view naturally led to what was then usually called [[necessitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;David Hartley, for example, described himself as "quite in the necessitarian scheme. See Ferg, Stephen, "Two Early Works of David Hartley", ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1981), pp. 173â89.&lt;/ref&gt; (the modern term is [[determinism]]): the view that everything in the universe â including human behavior â is completely causally determined by antecedent circumstances and natural law. (See, for example, [[La Mettrie]]'s [http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Machine/ ''L'Homme machine''].) As a consequence, debates about [[Free will|freedom]] versus "necessity" were a regular feature of Enlightenment religious and philosophical discussions.

Because of their high regard for natural law and for the idea of a universe without miracles, deists were especially susceptible to the temptations of determinism. Reflecting the intellectual climate of the time, there were differences among deists about freedom and determinism. Some, such as [[Anthony Collins]], actually were necessitarians.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Liberty and Necessity'' (1729).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immortality of the soul===
Deists hold a variety of beliefs about the soul. Some, such as Lord Herbert of Cherbury and [[William Wollaston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John
 |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; held that souls exist, survive death, and in the afterlife are rewarded or punished by God for their behavior in life. Some, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], believed in reincarnation or resurrection. Others, such as [[Thomas Paine]], had definitive beliefs about the immortality of the soul:
{{quote|I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.|Thomas Paine, ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part I}}
{{quote|I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content myself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable to me that I shall continue to exist hereafter than that I should have had existence, as I now have, before that existence began.|Thomas Paine, ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part I, Recapitulation}}
Still others such as Anthony Collins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Thomas Chubb]], and [[Peter Annet]] were materialists and either denied or doubted the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Deist authors â and 17th- and 18th-century theologians in general â referred to God using a variety of vivid circumlocutions such as:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Divine Providence]]
* [[Supreme Being]]
* [[Watchmaker analogy|Divine Watchmaker]]
* Nature's God. Used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]
* Father of Lights. Benjamin Franklin used this terminology when proposing that meetings of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] begin with prayers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E. Eidenmuller |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benfranklin.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin â Constitutional Convention Address on Prayer |publisher=Americanrhetoric.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical deism==

===Historical background===
Deistic thinking has existed since ancient times. Among the Ancient Greeks, [[Heraclitus]] conceived of a [[logos]], a supreme rational principle, and said the wisdom "by which all things are steered through all things" was "both willing and unwilling to be called [[Zeus]] (God)." [[Plato]] envisaged God as a [[Demiurge]] or 'craftsman'. Outside ancient Greece many other cultures have expressed views that resemble deism in some respects. However, the word "deism", as it is understood today, is generally used to refer to the movement toward natural theology or [[freethinking]] that occurred in 17th-century Europe, and specifically in Britain.

Natural theology is a facet of the revolution in world view that occurred in Europe in the 17th century. To understand the background to that revolution is also to understand the background of deism. Several cultural movements of the time contributed to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;The discussion of the background of deism is based on the excellent summary in "The Challenge of the Seventeenth Century" in ''The Historical Jesus Question'' by Gregory W. Dawes (Westminster: John Knox Press, 2001). Good discussions of individual deist writers can be found in ''The Seventeenth Century Background'' and ''The Eighteenth Century Background'' by [[Basil Willey]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discovery of diversity====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'', published by a team of [[Jesuit China mission|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus, sive, Scientia Sinensis Latine Exposita ''[''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'']'' |editor-last=Couplet |editor-first=Philippe |display-editors=1 |editor-link=Philippe Couplet |editor2-last=Intorcetta |editor2-first=Prospero |editor3=Christian Wolfgang Herdtrich |editor4=FranÃ§ois de Rougemont |ref={{harvid|Couplet &amp; al.|1687}} |date=1687 |location=Paris |publisher=Daniel Horthemels }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Humanism|humanist]] tradition of the [[Renaissance]] included a revival of interest in Europe's classical past in ancient Greece and Rome. The veneration of that classical past, particularly pre-Christian Rome, the new availability of Greek philosophical works, the successes of humanism and [[natural science]] along with the fragmentation of Christianity and increased understanding of other faiths, all helped erode the image of the [[Catholic Church]] as the unique source of wisdom, destined to dominate the whole world.

In addition, study of classical documents led to the realization that some historical documents are less reliable than others, which led to the beginnings of [[biblical criticism]]. In particular, when scholars worked on biblical manuscripts, they began developing the principles of textual criticism and a view of the [[New Testament]] being the product of a particular historical period different from their own.

In addition to discovering diversity in the past, Europeans discovered diversity in the present. The voyages of discovery of the 16th and 17th centuries acquainted Europeans with new and different cultures in the Americas, in [[Asia]], and in the Pacific. They discovered a greater amount of cultural diversity than they had ever imagined, and the question arose of how this vast amount of human cultural diversity could be compatible with the biblical account of [[Noah]]'s descendants. In particular, the ideas of [[Confucius]], translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China mission|Jesuit missionaries]] like [[Michele Ruggieri]], [[Philippe Couplet]], and [[FranÃ§ois NoÃ«l (missionary)|FranÃ§ois NoÃ«l]], are thought to have had considerable influence on the deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;"Windows into China", John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Eastern origins of Western civilization", John Hobson, p194-195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, cultural diversity with respect to religious beliefs could no longer be ignored. As Herbert wrote in ''De Religione Laici'' (1645):
{{quote|Many faiths or religions, clearly, exist or once existed in various countries and ages, and certainly there is not one of them that the lawgivers have not pronounced to be as it were divinely ordained, so that the Wayfarer finds one in Europe, another in Africa, and in Asia, still another in the very Indies.}}

====Religious conflict in Europe====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Europe had been plagued by [[Sectarianism|sectarian conflicts]] and [[religious war]]s since the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1642, when [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]]'s ''De Veritate'' was published, the [[Thirty Years War]] had been raging on continental Europe for nearly 25 years. It was an enormously destructive war that (it is estimated) destroyed 15â20% of the population of Germany. At the same time, the [[English Civil War]] pitting King against Parliament was just beginning.

Such massive violence led to a search for natural religious truths{{spaced ndash}}truths that could be universally accepted, because they had been either "written in the book of Nature" or "engraved on the human mind" by God.

====Advances in scientific knowledge====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The 17th century saw a remarkable advance in scientific knowledge, the scientific revolution. The work of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Galileo]] set aside the old notion that the earth was the center of the universe. These discoveries posed a serious challenge to biblical and religious authorities, Galileo's condemnation for heresy being an example. In consequence the Bible came to be seen as authoritative on matters of faith and morals but no longer authoritative (or meant to be) on science.

[[Isaac Newton]]'s (1642â1727) mathematical explanation of universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects here on earth and of objects in the heavens in a way that promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, set it in [[Watchmaker analogy|motion]] controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of the explanatory power of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as [[miracle]]s (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.

===Precursors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Early works of biblical criticism, such as Thomas Hobbes's ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Spinoza]]'s ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', as well as works by lesser-known authors such as [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] and [[Isaac La PeyrÃ¨re]], paved the way for the development of critical deism.

[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Isaac Oliver.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, portrait by [[Isaac Oliver]] (1560â1617)]]
An important precursor to deism was the work of Edward, Lord [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Herbert]] of Cherbury (d. 1648). He has been called the "father of English deism", and his book ''De Veritate'' (''On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') (1624) "the first major statement of deism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Willey
 |first=Basil
 |title=The Seventeenth Century Background
 |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Orr
 |first=John
 |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |year=1934
 |pages=59 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his beliefs in divine intervention, particularly in response to prayer, are at odds with the basic ideas of deism. In Herbert's account of one incident, he prayed "I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, De Veritate; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee give me some Sign from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it" and recounts that the response was "a loud tho' yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth)... I had the Sign I demanded".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury (Dublin, 1771), 244â245, as cited in Waligore p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his contemporary [[Descartes]], Herbert searched for the foundations of
knowledge. In fact, the first two thirds of ''De Veritate'' are devoted to an exposition of Herbert's theory of knowledge. Herbert distinguished truths obtained through experience, and through reasoning about experience, from innate truths and from revealed truths. Innate truths are imprinted on our minds, and the evidence that they are so imprinted is that they are universally accepted. Herbert's term for universally accepted truths was ''notitiae communes''{{spaced ndash}}common notions.

In the realm of religion, Herbert believed that there were five common notions.&lt;ref name="GonzÃ¡lez1984"/&gt;

{{quote|
* There is one Supreme God.
* He ought to be worshipped.
* Virtue and piety are the chief parts of divine worship.
* We ought to be sorry for our sins and repent of them
* Divine goodness doth dispense rewards and punishments both in this life and after it.
|Lord Herbert of Cherbury, ''The Antient Religion of the Gentiles, and Causes of Their Errors'', pp. 3â4, quoted in John Orr, ''English Deism'', p. 62}}

The following lengthy quote from Herbert can give the flavor of his writing and demonstrate the sense of the importance that Herbert attributed to innate Common Notions, which can help in understanding the effect of Locke's attack on innate ideas on Herbert's philosophy:

{{quote|No general agreement exists concerning the Gods, but there is universal recognition of God. Every religion in the past has acknowledged, every religion in the future will acknowledge, some sovereign deity among the Gods. ...
Accordingly that which is everywhere accepted as the supreme manifestation of deity, by whatever name it may be called, I term God.

While there is no general agreement concerning the worship of Gods, sacred beings, saints, and angels, yet the Common Notion or Universal Consent tells us that adoration ought to be reserved for the one God. Hence divine religionâ and no race, however savage, has existed without some expression of itâ is found established among all nations. ...

The connection of Virtue with Piety, defined in this work as the right conformation of the faculties, is and always has been held to be, the most important part of religious practice. There is no general agreement concerning rites, ceremonies, traditions...; but there is the greatest possible consensus of opinion concerning the right conformation of the faculties. ... Moral virtue... is and always has been esteemed by men in every age and place and respected in every land...

There is no general agreement concerning the various rites or mysteries which the priests have devised for the expiation of sin.... General agreement among religions, the nature of divine goodness, and above all conscience, tell us that our crimes may be washed away by true penitence, and that we can be restored to new union with God. ... I do not wish to consider here whether any other more appropriate means exists by which the divine justice may be appeased, since I have undertaken in this work only to rely on truths which are not open to dispute but are derived from the evidence of immediate perception and admitted by the whole world.

The rewards that are eternal have been variously placed in heaven, in the stars, in the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]]... Punishment has been thought to lie in [[metempsychosis]], in hell,... or in temporary or everlasting death. But all religion, law, philosophy, and ... conscience, teach openly or implicitly that punishment or reward awaits us after this life. ... [T]here is no nation, however barbarous, which has not and will not recognise the existence of punishments and rewards. That reward and punishment exist is, then, a Common Notion, though there is the greatest difference of opinion as to their nature, quality, extent, and mode.

It follows from these considerations that the dogmas which recognize a sovereign Deity, enjoin us to worship Him, command us to live a holy life, lead us to repent our sins, and warn us of future recompense or punishment, proceed from God and are inscribed within us in the form of Common Notions.

Revealed truth exists; and it would be unjust to ignore it. But its nature is quite distinct from the truth [based on Common Notions] ... [T]he truth of revelation depends upon the authority of him who reveals it. We must, then, proceed with great care in discerning what actually is revealed.... [W]e must take great care to avoid deception, for men who are depressed, superstitious, or ignorant of causes are always liable to it.
|Lord Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', quoted in Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'', pp. 29 ff.}}

According to Gay, Herbert had relatively few followers, and it was not until the 1680s that Herbert found a true successor in [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] (1654â1693). Blount made one special contribution to the deist debate: "by utilizing his wide classical learning, Blount demonstrated how to use pagan writers, and pagan ideas, against Christianity. ... Other Deists were to follow his lead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Deism in Britain===

====John Locke====
The publication of [[John Locke]]'s ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1689, but dated 1690) marks a major turning point in the history of deism. Since Herbert's ''De Veritate'', [[innate idea]]s had been the foundation of deist [[epistemology]]. Locke's famous attack on innate ideas in the first book of the ''Essay'' effectively destroyed that foundation and replaced it with a theory of knowledge based on experience. ''Innatist'' deism was replaced by ''empiricist'' deism. Locke himself was not a deist. He believed in both miracles and revelation, and he regarded miracles as the main proof of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After Locke, constructive deism could no longer appeal to innate ideas for justification of its basic tenets such as the existence of God. Instead, under the influence of Locke and Newton, deists turned to natural theology and to arguments based on experience and nature: the cosmological argument and the [[argument from design]].

Peter Gay places the zenith of deism "from the end of the 1690s, when the vehement response to [[John Toland]]'s ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696) started the deist debate, to the end of the 1740s when the tepid response to [[Conyers Middleton]]'s ''Free Inquiry'' signalled its close."&lt;ref name="pgdeism1"&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|Among the Deists, only Anthony Collins (1676â1729) could claim much philosophical competence; only Conyers Middleton (1683â1750) was a really serious scholar. The best known Deists, notably John Toland (1670â1722) and Matthew Tindal (1656â1733), were talented publicists, clear without being deep, forceful but not subtle. ... Others, like Thomas Chubb (1679â1747), were self-educated freethinkers; a few, like [[Thomas Woolston]] (1669â1731), were close to madness.|Peter Gay| Deism: An Anthology&lt;ref name = "pgdeism1"/&gt;}}

During this period, prominent British deists included [[William Wollastson]], [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]], and
[[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism|title=Deism {{!}} religious philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential author [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Third Earl of Shaftesbury]] is also usually categorized as a deist. Although he did not think of himself as a deist, he shared so many attitudes with deists that Gay calls him "a Deist in fact, if not in name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=Deism: An Anthology
 |publisher=Van Nostrand |year=1968 |pages=78â79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late-classical deists include [[Peter Annet]] (1693â1769), [[Thomas Chubb]] (1679â1747), [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]] (?â1743), and [[Conyers Middleton]] (1683â1750).

====Matthew Tindal====
Especially noteworthy is Matthew Tindal's ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (1730), which "became, very soon after its publication, the focal center of the deist controversy. Because almost every argument, quotation, and issue raised for decades can be found here, the work is often termed 'the deist's Bible'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waring|first=Edward Graham|title=Deism and natural religion: a source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JHXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2013-05-16|year=1967|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following Locke's successful attack on innate ideas, Tindal's "Deist Bible" redefined the foundation of deist epistemology as knowledge based on experience or human reason. This effectively widened the gap between traditional Christians and what he called "Christian Deists", since this new foundation required that "revealed" truth be validated through human reason.

====David Hume====
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|David Hume]]
The writings of [[David Hume]] are sometimes credited with causing or contributing to the decline of deism. English deism, however, was already in decline before Hume's works on religion (1757,1779) were published.&lt;ref name=deismp140&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=Deism: An Anthology |publisher=Van Nostrand |year=1968 |page=140}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some writers maintain that Hume's writings on religion were not very influential at the time that they were published.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=173}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, modern scholars find it interesting to study the implications of his thoughts for deism.
* Hume's skepticism about miracles makes him a natural ally of deism.
* His skepticism about the validity of natural religion cuts equally against deism and deism's opponents, who were also deeply involved in natural theology. But his famous ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' were not published until 1779, by which time deism had almost vanished in England.

In the ''Natural History of Religion'' (1757),  Hume contends that polytheism, not monotheism, was "the first and most ancient religion of mankind". In addition, contends Hume, the psychological basis of religion is not reason, but fear of the unknown.

{{quote | The primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist. ... And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.
|David Hume, ''The Natural History of Religion'', section XIII}}

As E. Graham Waring saw it;&lt;ref name="Waring1967" /&gt;

{{quote | The clear reasonableness of natural religion disappeared before a semi-historical look at what can be known about uncivilized manâ "a barbarous, necessitous animal," as Hume termed him. Natural religion, if by that term one means the actual religious beliefs and practices of uncivilized peoples, was seen to be a fabric of superstitions. Primitive man was no unspoiled philosopher, clearly seeing the truth of one God. And the history of religion was not, as the deists had implied, retrograde; the widespread phenomenon of superstition was caused less by priestly malice than by man's unreason as he confronted his experience.}}

Experts dispute whether Hume was a deist, an [[atheist]], or something else. Hume himself was uncomfortable with the terms ''deist'' and ''atheist'', and Hume scholar [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] has argued that the best and safest term for Hume's views is ''[[irreligion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

France had its own tradition of religious skepticism and natural theology in the works of [[Montaigne]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], and [[Montesquieu]]. The most famous of the French deists was [[Voltaire]], who acquired a taste for Newtonian science, and reinforcement of deistic inclinations, during a two-year visit to England starting in 1726.

French deists also included [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Rousseau]]. For a short period of time during the French Revolution the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] was the state religion of France.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s identification with deism is controversial. An argument in favor of Kant as deist is Allen Wood's "Kant's Deism," in P. Rossi and M. Wreen (eds.), ''Kant's Philosophy of Religion Reconsidered'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); an argument against Kant as deist is Stephen Palmquist's [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KTS.html "Kant's Theistic Solution"].

===Deism in the United States===
[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Thomas Paine]]

In the United States, Enlightenment philosophy (which itself was heavily inspired by deist ideals) played a major role in creating the principle of religious freedom, expressed in Thomas Jefferson's letters and included in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution]], who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy include Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, [[Cornelius Harnett]], [[Gouverneur Morris]], and [[Hugh Williamson]]. Their political speeches show distinct deistic influence.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Other notable Founding Fathers may have been more directly deist. These include [[James Madison]], possibly [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Ethan Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

and [[Thomas Paine]] (who published ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', a treatise that helped to popularize deism throughout the United States and Europe).

Unlike the many deist tracts aimed at an educated elite, Paine's treatise explicitly appealed to ordinary people, using direct language familiar to the laboring classes. How widespread deism was among ordinary people in the United States is a matter of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/interim/reviews/dilorenzo.shtml#.VV90HvlViko |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302202951/http://www.common-place.org/interim/reviews/dilorenzo.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-02 |title=Culture Wars in the Early Republic |publisher=Common-place |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contributor was [[Elihu Palmer]] (1764â1806), who wrote the "Bible" of American deism in his ''[[Principles of Nature]]'' (1801) and attempted to organize deism by forming the "Deistical Society of New York" and other deistic societies from Maine to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Kerry S.

Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography, 
{{quote | Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker) and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very useful.&lt;ref&gt;

Franklin also wrote that, "The Deity sometimes interferes by his particular Providence, and sets aside the Events which would otherwise have been produc'd in the Course of Nature, or by the Free Agency of Man."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20021114204257/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf2/provdnc.htm On the Providence of God in the Government of the World] (1730).
&lt;/ref&gt;
He later stated, in the Constitutional Convention, that "the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs in the affairs of men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Max Farrand|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1057&amp;Itemid=27|title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1911|volume=1|page=451}}

For his part, Thomas Jefferson is perhaps one of the [[Founding Fathers]] with the most outspoken of deist tendencies, though he is not known to have called himself a deist, generally referring to himself as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. In particular, his treatment of the Biblical gospels, which he titled ''[[The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'', but subsequently became more commonly known as the ''Jefferson Bible'', exhibits a strong deist tendency of stripping away all supernatural and dogmatic references from the Christ story. However, Frazer, following the lead of [[Sydney Ahlstrom]], characterizes Jefferson as not a Deist but a [[Theistic rationalism|"theistic rationalist"]], because Jefferson believed in God's continuing activity in human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregg L.|last=Frazer|title=The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, Revolution|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2012|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sydney E.|last=Ahlstrom|title=A Religious History of the American People|year=2004|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer cites Jefferson's ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', where he wrote, "I tremble" at the thought that "God is just," and he warned of eventual "supernatural influence" to abolish the scourge of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, ''Religious Beliefs of America's Founders,'' p. 128 quoting Jefferson's ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', 1800 ed., p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other scholars call Jefferson a "theistic rationalist" (although that term was coined later), such as {{Cite book|author=Gary Scott Smith|title=Faith and the Presidency: From George Washington to George W.

===Decline and rebirth of deism===
Deism is generally considered to have declined as an influential school of thought by around 1800, but has since experienced an extraordinary resurgence as its simple science- and reason-based philosophy has been rediscovered in the internet Age.

The 2001 [[American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS), which involved 50,000 participants, reported that the number of participants in the survey identifying themselves as deists grew at the rate of 717 percent between 1990 and 2001. If this were generalized to the US population as a whole, it would make deism the [[Claims to be the fastest growing religion|fastest-growing religious classification]] in the US for that period, with the reported total of 49,000 self-identified adherents representing about 0.02% of the US population in 2001.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web

{{quote
|After the writings of Woolston and Tindal, English deism went into slow decline. ... By the 1730s, nearly all the arguments in behalf of Deism ... had been offered and refined; the intellectual caliber of leading Deists was none too impressive; and the opponents of deism finally mustered some formidable spokesmen. The Deists of these decades, Peter Annet (1693â1769), Thomas Chubb (1679â1747), and Thomas Morgan (?â1743), are of significance to the specialist alone. ...

It is probably more accurate, however, to say that deism evolved into, and contributed to, other religious movements. The term ''deist'' became rarely used, but deist beliefs, ideas, and influences remained. They can be seen in 19th-century liberal British theology and in the rise of Unitarianism, which adopted many of deism's beliefs and ideas.

Although this decline has entirely reversed during the early 21st century, some commentators have suggested a variety of reasons for the former decline of "classical" deism (or perhaps actually simply a decline in the use of the term "Deism", rather than in the more universality Deist philosophy).

==Contemporary deism==
Contemporary deism attempts to integrate classical deism with modern philosophy and the current state of scientific knowledge. This attempt has produced a wide variety of personal beliefs under the broad classification of belief of "deism."

Classical deism held that a human's [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through [[divine providence]]. What this means is that God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.

Some modern deists{{who|date= November 2018}} have modified this classical view and believe that humanity's relationship with God is [[transpersonal]], which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that it makes no sense to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, which in turn is why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.

A modern definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deism.com/deism_defined.htm|title=Deism Defined}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created and provided by the World Union of Deists (WUD) that provides a modern understanding of deism:

{{Quote|Deism is the recognition of a universal creative force greater than that demonstrated by mankind, supported by personal observation of laws and designs in nature and the universe, perpetuated and validated by the innate ability of human reason coupled with the rejection of claims made by individuals and organized religions of having received special divine revelation.}}

Because deism asserts the existence of God without accepting claims of divine revelation, it appeals to people from both ends of the religious spectrum. [[Antony Flew]], for example, was a convert from atheism, and Raymond Fontaine was a Roman Catholic priest for over 20 years before converting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deism.com/to-natures-god.net|title=Raymond Fontaine's website: From Catholic Priest to Deist With Nature's God|publisher=deism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 [[American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS), which involved 50,000 participants, reported that the number of participants in the survey identifying themselves as deists grew at the rate of 717 percent between 1990 and 2001. If this were generalized to the US population as a whole, it would make deism the [[Claims to be the fastest growing religion|fastest-growing religious classification]] in the US for that period, with the reported total of 49,000 self-identified adherents representing about 0.02% of the US population at the time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adherents.com"/&gt;

===Modern deistic organizations and websites===

In 1993, Bob Johnson established the first deist organization since the days of Thomas Paine and Elihu Palmer with the World Union of Deists. The WUD offered the monthly paper publication ''THINK!'' Currently the WUD offers two online deist publications, ''THINKonline!'' and ''Deistic Thought &amp; Action!'' As well as using the internet for spreading the deist message, the WUD is also conducting a direct mail campaign.

In 1996 the first web site dedicated to deism, deism.com, was launched by the World Union of Deists. In 1998, Sullivan-County.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/deism.htm |title=Deism and Reason |publisher=Sullivan-county.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally the Virginia/Tennessee affiliate of WUD and the second deism site on the web. It split from deism.com to promote more traditional and historical deist beliefs and history.

The Positive Deism movement began in 2004. Historically and to the present day, deists have been very critical of the revealed religions as well as trying to be constructive. Positive Deists focus their efforts solely on being constructive and avoid criticism of other faiths. In 2009 Chuck Clendenen, one of its adherents, published a book entitled "Deist: so that's what I am!". The aim of the book was to educate those who believed similarly, but did not know the words deism and deist, that there is a name for their belief.

In 2009, the World Union of Deists published a book on deism, ''Deism: A Revolution in Religion, A Revolution in You'' written by its founder and director, Bob Johnson. This book focuses on what deism has to offer both individuals and society. In 2010 the WUD published the book ''An Answer to C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity'', which is a rebuttal to the book ''Mere Christianity'' by the Christian apologist [[C.S. Lewis]]. In 2014, the WUD published its third book, ''God Gave Us Reason, Not Religion'', which describes the difference between God and religion, and promotes innate reason as God's greatest gift to humanity, other than life itself. It proposes that people can have belief in The Supreme Intelligence/God that is beyond a reasonable doubt.

The World Union of Deists in 2016 became a producer of the film adaptation of Ian Ruskin's play [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3826458/ To Begin the World Over Again: The Life of Thomas Paine]. The film includes important coverage of Thomas Paine's profound Deism and his work to promote Deism.

In 2010, the Church of Deism (not affiliated with the World Union of Deists) was formed in an effort to extend the legal rights and privileges of more traditional religions to Deists while maintaining an absence of established dogma and ritual.

===Subcategories of contemporary deism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Modern deists hold a wide range of views on the nature of God and God's relationship to the world. The common area of agreement is the desire to use reason, experience, and nature as the basis of belief.

There are a number of subcategories of modern deism, including [[monodeism]] (this being the default standard concept of deism), [[polydeism]], [[pandeism]], spiritual deism, [[process deism]], [[Christian deism]], [[scientific deism]], and [[humanistic deism]]. Some deists see design in nature and purpose in the universe and in their lives (Prime Designer). Others see God and the universe in a co-creative process (Prime Motivator). Some deists view God in classical terms and see God as observing humanity but not directly intervening in our lives (Prime Observer), while others see God as a subtle and persuasive spirit who created the world, but then stepped back to observe (Prime Mover).

====Pandeism====
{{Main|Pandeism}}
Pandeism combines elements of deism with elements of [[pantheism]], the belief that the universe is identical to God. Pandeism holds that God was a conscious and sentient force or entity that designed and created the universe, which operates by mechanisms set forth in the creation. God thus became an unconscious and nonresponsive being by ''becoming'' the universe. Other than this distinction (and the possibility that the universe will one day return to the state of being God), pandeistic beliefs are deistic. The earliest allusion to pandeism found to date is in 1787, in translator [[Gottfried GroÃe]]'s interpretation of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]:

{{quote|Beym. Plinius, den man, wo nicht Spinozisten, doch einen '''Pandeisten''' nennen konnte, ist Natur oder Gott kein von der Welt getrenntes oder abgesondertes Wesen. Seine Natur ist die ganze SchÃ¶pfung im Konkreto, und eben so scheint es mit seiner Gottheit beschaffen zu seyn.&lt;ref name="GroÃe"&gt;{{Cite book|last=GroÃe|first=Gottfried|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ro9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=pandeisten&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeisten&amp;f=false|title=Naturgeschichte: mit erlÃ¤uternden Anmerkungen|year=1787|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Gottfried says that Pliny is not [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozist]], but 'could be called a pandeist' whose Nature or God 'is not a being separate from the world. Its nature is the whole creation in concrete form, and thus it seems to be designed with its divinity.' The term was used in 1859 by [[German people|German]] philosophers and frequent collaborators [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in ''Zeitschrift fÃ¼r VÃ¶lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft''. They wrote:

{{quote|Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie Theisten, Pan-theisten, Atheisten, Deisten (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)&lt;ref&gt;Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal, ''Zeitschrift fÃ¼r VÃ¶lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' (1859), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is translated as:

{{quote|So we should let these thinkers decide themselves whether they are theists, pan-theists, atheists, deists (and why not even pandeists?)}}

In the 1960s, theologian [[Charles Hartshorne]] scrupulously examined and rejected both deism and pandeism (as well as pantheism) in favor of a conception of God whose characteristics included "absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others" or "AR", writing that this theory "is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism", concluding that "panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Hartshorne|title=Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism|year=1964|page=348|isbn=0-208-00498-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary deist opinions on prayer===
Many classical deists were critical of some types of prayer. For example, in ''[[Matthew Tindal#Christianity as Old as the Creation|Christianity as Old as the Creation]]'', Matthew Tindal argues against praying for miracles, but advocates prayer as both a human duty and a human need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamicdeism.org/library/christianity_as_old_as_the_creat.htm#_Toc86950608|title=External link to portion of text|publisher=|access-date=2007-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209010328/http://www.dynamicdeism.org/library/christianity_as_old_as_the_creat.htm#_Toc86950608#_Toc86950608|archive-date=2007-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, deists hold a variety of opinions about prayer:
* Some contemporary deists{{who|date= November 2018}} believe (with the classical deists) that God has created the universe perfectly, so no amount of supplication, request, or begging can change the fundamental nature of the universe.
* Some deists{{who|date= November 2018}} believe that God is not an entity that can be contacted by human beings through petitions for relief; rather, God can only be experienced through the nature of the universe.
* Most deists do not believe in divine intervention, but still find value in prayer as a form of meditation, self-cleansing, and spiritual renewal. Such prayers are often appreciative (that is, "Thank you for ...") rather than supplicative (that is, "Please, God, grant me ...").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deism.com/deism_defined.htm |title=Deism Defined, Welcome to Deism, Deist Glossary and Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Deism.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some deists practice meditation and make frequent use of [[affirmative prayer]], a non-supplicative form of prayer that is common in the [[New Thought]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lockard |first1=Jim |title=Affirmative Prayer |url=https://newthoughtevolutionary.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/thoughts-prayers/ |website=Affirmative Prayer |publisher=Affirmative Prayer |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent discussion of the role of deism===
[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], in his 2007 book ''[[A Secular Age]]'', showed the historical role of deism, leading to what he calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose [[ontic]] commitment is wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a [[personal God]] and an order of miracles and mystery.

The word '''diorama''' {{IPAc-en|Ë|d|aÉª|É|Ë|r|ÉË|m|É}} can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as [[Model military vehicle|military vehicle modeling]], [[Model figure|miniature figure modeling]], or [[Model airplane|aircraft modeling]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Etymology ==
The word "diorama" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means "through that which is seen", from the [[greek language|Greek]] di- "through" + orama "that which is seen, a sight". The diorama was invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]], first exhibited in [[Paris]] in July 1822 and in [[London]] on September 29, 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|Diorama Theatres - Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2017}} The meaning "small-scale replica of a scene, etc." is from 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/etymology/diorama Diorama - Word Origin &amp; History] - Online Etymology Dictionary - ''Dictionary.com''. Retrieved 1 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.

== The modern diorama ==
[[File:Cooling tower construction diorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cooling tower]] construction diorama]]
The current, popular understanding of the term "diorama" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or [[scale model]] of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.

One of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where the [[Biological museum (Stockholm)|Biological Museum]] opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. 

===Miniatures===
Miniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in [[Chicago]]'s [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] to display [[Rail transport|railroading]]. This diorama employs a common [[Rail transport modelling|model railroading]] scale of 1:87 ([[HO scale]]). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.

An early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. [[William Siborne]], and represents the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/detail.php?acc=1975-05-56-1 |title=Model of the field of Waterloo with troops positioned as at 19.45 hours, 18 June 1815. |publisher=National Army Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama measures {{convert|8.33|by|6|m}} and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the [[National Army Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterloo200.org/200-object/captain-sibornes-model-of-waterloo/ |title=Captain Siborneâs Model of Waterloo |website=Waterloo 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheperd Paine]], a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Full size dioramas ===
[[Image:DSC01677 Diorama isole Lofoten - Museo di storia naturale, Milano - Foto di G. Dall'Orto - 20-12-2006.jpg|thumbnail|A diorama in the Museum of Natural History in [[Milan]] (Italy)]]

Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the [[illusion]] through [[depth perception]] in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the [[binocular disparity|binocular perception]] of depth.

=== Uses ===

[[Image:GenealogicalDiorama.jpg|thumb|A [[genealogy|genealogical]] diorama for an elementary school class project; the featured subject is a maternal great-grandfather of the student]]

Miniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at [[Norway's Resistance Museum]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

Landscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.

Hobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including [[plastic model]]s of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.

In the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.

One of the largest dioramas ever created{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} was a model of the entire State of [[California]] built for the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[San Francisco Ferry Building|Ferry Building]].

Dioramas are widely used in the [[American educational system]], mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological [[biomes]], cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a [[trompe-l'Åil]] in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.

==Historic dioramas==
===The Daguerre and Bouton Dioramas===
[[File:Diorama diagram.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ground-plan of the Diorama Building, London 1823, by A. Pugin and J. Morgan (illustration reproduced from Gernsheim 1968, p 21)]]
The Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular "[[Panorama]]" ([[panoramic painting]]), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.

The size of the [[proscenium]] was {{convert|24|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|21|ft|m}} high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.

The inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were [[Charles Marie Bouton|Charles-Marie Bouton]] (1781â 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre PrÃ©vost, and [[Louis Jacques MandÃ© Daguerre]] (1787â1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the [[daguerreotype]], the first widely used method of [[photography]].

A second Diorama building in [[Regent's Park]] in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midley.co.uk/diorama/Diorama_Wood_1_1.htm|title=The Diorama in Great Britain by R. D. Wood: Introduction|last=Wood|first=R. Derek|website=www.midley.co.uk|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building which exhibited the diorama was designed by [[Augustus Charles Pugin]], father of the notable English architect and designer [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin]]. The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like [[Clarkson Stanfield]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Lambourne, ''Victorian Painting'', London, Phaidon Press, 1999; p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town [[Bry-sur-Marne]], where he lived and died.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/sites/bry/fichier/diaporama_diorama.pdf All about Daguerre's diorama in Bry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.bry94.fr/bry/2308.htm About the diorama on Bry's official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Gottstein Dioramas ===
Until 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum, (formerly the [[Banqueting House]]), in [[Whitehall]]. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout [[England]], some ending up in [[Canada]] and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892â1951) of [[Leipzig]], a Jewish immigrant from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's Germany]], who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of [[Kiel]], Biebel of [[Berlin]] and Muller of [[Erfurt]], all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both [[Germany]] and [[France]] to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.

# The Landing of the Romans under [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 B.C.
# The [[Battle of Hastings]].
# The Storming of [[Siege of Acre (1189â91) | Acre]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Battle of Crecy]]. (Figures by Muller.)
# The [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]].
# The [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] reviewing her troops at [[Tilbury]].
# The [[Battle of Marston Moor]].
# The [[Battle of Blenheim]]. (Painted by Douchkine.)
# The [[Battle of Plessey]].
# The [[Battle of Quebec (1759)|Battle of Quebec]]. (Engraved by Krunert of Vienna.)
# The [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]] at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]].
# The [[Charge of the Light Brigade]].
# The [[Battle of Ulundi]]. (figures by Ochel, and Petrocochino - ''pseudonym of Paul Armont''.)
# The Battle of Fleurs.
# The [[D-Day landings]].

Krunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for ''âThe Battle of Quebecâ''. Unfortunately, the ''âdeath of Wolfeâ'' was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian Ã©migrÃ© who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] on horseback for ''âThe Blenheim Dioramaâ'', one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.

Denny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the [[Ancient Britons]], the [[Normans]] and [[Saxons]], some of the figures of ''âThe Field of the Cloth of Goldâ'' and the [[Elizabethan]] figures for ''âQueen Elizabeth at Tilburyâ''. Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the ''âBattle of Blenheimâ'' diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20&amp;nbsp;mm figures, this diorama representing the ''âD-Day landingsâ''. When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the [[Glenbow Museum]], (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: '''The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.''
 
The state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (''The World of Model Soldiers'') claimed in 1968, that the dioramas "appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) "the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. ''âThe Battle of Hastingsâ'' diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, [[Hastings]], and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up [[Senlac Hill]] towards the Saxon lines. 
'âThe Storming of Acreâ'' is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, [[Woolwich]]. John Garratt, in the "Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers", states that ''âThe Field of the Cloth of Goldâ'' was in the possession of the [[Royal Military School of Music]], [[Kneller Hall]]; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the British Flat Figure Society'': Issue One â April 1986.

===The Frank Wong dioramas===

[[San Francisco, California]] artist '''Frank Wong''' (born 22 September 1932) created [[Dioramas|miniature dioramas]] that depict the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco Chinatown]] of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name = sfchron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guthrie|first1=Julian|title=Frank Wong recalls life in Chinatown through miniature dioramas|url=http://www.sfgate.com/art/article/Frank-Wong-recalls-life-in-Chinatown-through-5706947.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other dioramas ===
[[File:Battle of Midway.jpg|thumb|This photorealistic diorama of the [[Battle of Midway]] was created during World War II on the basis of information then available.]]
Painters of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era like [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Francis Danby]] were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as "Mad Martin," set fire to the roof of [[York Minster]]. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a "safe fire" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the "safe" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.&lt;ref&gt;Lambourne, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.

A small scale version of the diorama called the [[Polyrama Panoptique]] could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10302430&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=1 Science &amp; Society Picture Library: the collections of the Science Museum, the National Railway Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history dioramas==
Natural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to "nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-v1.amnh.org/exhibitions/dioramas/ Diorama Exhibition at the American Natural History Museum] â Retrieved 4 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carla Yanni, Natureâs Museums: Victorian Science and the Architecture of Display, Princeton Architectural Press, New York, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by [[Charles Willson Peale]], an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale "painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 13-4&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, the [[British Museum]] held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.

The first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist [[Carl Akeley]] for the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] in 1889,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006; p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator [[Frank M. Chapman]], Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for [[habitat conservation]]. The modern [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab]] is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York,. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist [[Martha Maxwell]], created a famous habitat diorama for the [[Centennial Exposition|first World's Fair]] in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs.&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Marbury|title=Taxidermy Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoJLBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Artisan|isbn=978-1-57965-558-7|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as   Akeley and [[William Temple Hornaday]].&lt;ref name="Taxidermy Art"/&gt; 

Soon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; though some would be donated by game hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hanson, Animal Attractions: Nature on Display in American Zoos, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the [[American Museum of Natural History#African Mammal Hall|Akeley Hall of African Mammals]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Christopher Quinn, Windows on Nature: The Great Habitat Dioramas of the American Museum of Natural History, Abrams, New York, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the [[American Museum of Natural History]], in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the [[Powell-Cotton Museum]], in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.

===Constructing a diorama===

Natural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:

#The painted background
#The foreground
#Taxidermy specimens

Preparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.

The foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.

Taxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mÃ¢chÃ© mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.

If an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2945">'''Emil Schlagintweit''' (7 July 1835 &amp;ndash; 29 October 1904) was a [[Germany|German]] scholar noted for his work on [[Buddhism]] in [[Tibet]].

==Life==
Schlagintweit was the youngest of the five [[Schlagintweit]] brothers of [[Munich]]. His father was a wealthy eye-surgeon, his mother died when he was quite young, and he was tutored by [[Franz Joseph Lauth]], later a noted [[Egyptologist]]. The brothers' interest in exploration was sparked by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', the first volume of which appeared in 1845, and which led to their explorations of the [[Alps]] and in turn to Asia's mountains.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After his brother Hermann's death in 1882, he inherited SchloÃ JÃ¤gersburg, their large estate near Forchheim, and the brothers' collections and papers. 
Not an explorer himself, he sold 102 Tibetan manuscripts and [[block-book]]s collected by his brothers to the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] where they remain.

His work was later used by [[Helena Blavatsky]] as evidence for her interpretations of "esoteric Buddhism"{{broken link|date=December 2015}} (Blavatsky herself did not approve of the term "esoteric Buddhism," to which she preferred "the Secret Doctrine," Occultism, or Sacred Science).

__NOTOC__
'''Ethnolinguistics''' (sometimes called '''cultural linguistics''')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferraro |first=Gary |title=Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective |location= |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |isbn=0-495-10008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a field of [[linguistics]] that studies the relationship between language and culture and how different [[ethnic group]]s perceive the world. It is the combination between [[ethnology]] and linguistics. The former refers to the way of life of an entire community: all the characteristics that distinguish one community from the other. Such characteristics make the cultural aspects of a community or a society.

Ethnolinguists study the way perception and conceptualization influences language and show how that is linked to different cultures and societies. An example is how spatial orientation is expressed in various cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Heine|Heine, Bernd]] (1997) ''Cognitive Foundations of Grammar''. Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuan, Yi-Fu (1974) ''Topophilia: A study of environmental perception, attitudes, and values.'' Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; In many societies, words for the [[cardinal direction]]s ''east'' and ''west'' are derived from terms for sunrise/sunset. The nomenclature for cardinal directions of [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] speakers of [[Greenland]], however, is based on geographical landmarks such as the river system and one's position on the coast. Similarly, the [[Yurok language|Yurok]] lack the idea of cardinal directions; they orient themselves with respect to their principal geographic feature, the [[Klamath River]].

Cultural Linguistics is a related branch of linguistics that explores the relationship between language and cultural conceptualisations.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"/&gt; Cultural Linguistics draws on and expands the theoretical and analytical advancements in cognitive science (including complexity science and distributed cognition) and anthropology. Cultural linguistics examines how various features of human languages encode cultural conceptualisations, including cultural schemas, cultural categories, and cultural metaphors.&lt;ref name="Sharifian2011"&gt;Sharifian, Farzad (2011). Cultural Conceptualisations and Language: Theoretical Framework and Applications. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{Not a typo|Cultural Linguistics}}, language is viewed as deeply entrenched in the group-level, cultural cognition of communities of speakers. Thus far, the approach of Cultural Linguistics has been adopted in several areas of [[applied linguistic]] research, including [[intercultural communication]], [[second language learning]], Teaching English as an International Language, and [[World Englishes]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharifian, Farzad &amp; Palmer, Gary B. (eds.) (2007) Applied cultural linguistics: Implications for second language learning and intercultural communication. Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}

The '''feminist movement''' (also known as the '''women's movement''', or simply '''feminism''') refers to a series of [[political campaign]]s for reforms on issues such as [[reproductive rights]], [[domestic violence]], [[Parental leave|maternity leave]], [[Equal pay for women|equal pay]], [[women's suffrage]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[sexual violence]], all of which fall under the label of [[feminism]] and the feminist movement. The movement's priorities vary among nations and communities, and range from opposition to [[female genital mutilation]] in one country, to opposition to the [[glass ceiling]] in another.

Feminism in parts of the [[western world]] has gone through three waves. [[First-wave feminism]] was oriented around the station of middle- or upper-class white women and involved suffrage and political equality. [[Second-wave feminism]] attempted to further combat social and cultural inequalities. Although the first wave of feminism involved mainly middle class white women, the second wave brought in women of color and women from other developing nations that were seeking solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pacificu.edu/about-us/news-events/four-waves-feminism|title=Four Waves of Feminism|last=Rampton|first=Martha|date=October 25, 2015|website=www.pacificu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119073645/http://www.pacificu.edu/about-us/news-events/four-waves-feminism|archive-date=2015-11-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third-wave feminism]] is continuing to address the financial, social and cultural inequalities and includes renewed campaigning for greater influence of women in politics and media. In reaction to political activism, feminists have also had to maintain focus on women's reproductive rights, such as the right to abortion.

[[Feminism in China]] started in the 20th century with the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] in 1911. In China, Feminism has a strong association with [[socialism]] and class issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/938114028|title=The transformation of Chinese socialism|last=1952-|first=Lin, Chun,|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0822337983|oclc=938114028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that this close association is damaging to Chinese feminism and argue that the interests of party are placed before those of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654714694|title=Women's rights : a global view|last=1945-|first=Walter, Lynn,|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=031330890X|oclc=654714694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist movement in Western society ===
{{Main|History of feminism}}
Feminism in the United States, Canada and a number of countries in western Europe has been divided into three waves by feminist scholars: [[first-wave feminism|first]], [[second-wave feminism|second]] and [[third-wave feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Humm | first = Maggie | contribution = wave (definition) | editor-last = Humm | editor-first = Maggie | title = The dictionary of feminist theory | page = 251 | publisher = Ohio State University Press | location = Columbus | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780814205075 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker1992&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Rebecca| first1 = Walker| authorlink1 = Rebecca Walker| editor-last=| editor-first =| editor-link=/February| title = Becoming the Third Wave| journal = [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]| issue = | pages = 39â41| location = New York| publisher = Liberty Media for Women| issn = 0047-8318| oclc = 194419734|date= January 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent (early 2010s) research suggests there may be a [[History of Feminism#Fourth wave|fourth wave]] characterized, in part, by [[new media]] platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Baumgardner | first = Jennifer | author-link = Jennifer Baumgardner | contribution = Is there a fourth wave?

The womenâs movement became more popular in May 1968 when women began to read again, more widely, the book [[The Second Sex]], written in 1949 by a defender of womenâs rights, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], (and translated into English for the first time in 1953; later translation 2009).  De Beauvior's writing explained why it was difficult for talented women to become successful. The obstacles de Beauvoir enumerates include womenâs inability to make as much money as men do in the same profession, womenâs domestic responsibilities, societyâs lack of support towards talented women, and womenâs fear that success will lead to an annoyed husband or prevent them from even finding a husband at all. De Beauvoir also argues that woman lack ambition because of how they are raised. Girls are told to follow the duties of their mothers, whereas boys are told to exceed the accomplishments of their fathers. Along with other influences, Simone de Beauvoirâs work helped the feminist movement to erupt, causing the formation of Le Mouvement de LibÃ©ration des Femmes (The Womenâs Liberation Movement). This determined group of women wanted to turn these ideas into actions. Contributors to The Womenâs Liberation Movement include Simone de Beauvoir, [[Christiane Rochefort]], [[Christine Delphy]] and Anne Tristan. Through actions the women were able to get few equal rights for example right to education, right to work, and right to vote. One of the most important issues that The Womenâs Liberation movement faced was the banning of abortion and contraception. The women saw this banning as a violation of womenâs rights and were determined to fight it. Thus, the women made a declaration known as Le Manifeste de 343 which held signatures from 343 women admitting to having had an illegal abortion. The declaration got published in Le Nouvel Observateur and Le Monde, two French newspapers on 5 April 1971. The group gained support upon the publication. Women received the right to abort with the passing of the Veil Law in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuhlman|first1=Olivia|title=Inequalities of Contemporary French Women|url=http://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1061&amp;context=cmc_theses|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's movement effected change in Western society, including [[women's suffrage]], the right to initiate divorce proceedings and "no fault" divorce, the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[abortion]]), and the right to own property.&lt;ref name=Messer-Davidow&gt;{{cite book | last = Messer-Davidow | first = Ellen | title = Disciplining feminism: from social activism to academic discourse | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, [[North Carolina]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780822328438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also led to broad employment for women at more equitable wages, and access to [[university]] education.

In 1918 [[Crystal Eastman]] wrote an article published in the Birth Control Review, she contended that birth control is a fundamental right for women and must be available as an alternative if they are to participate fully in the modern world. âIn short, if feminism, conscious and bold and intelligent, leads the demand, it will be supported by the secret eagerness of all women to control the size of their families, and a suffrage state should make short work of repealing these old laws that stand in the way of birth control.â She stated âI donât believe there is one woman within the confines of this state who does not believe in birth control!â&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Eastman | first1 = Crystal (author) | last2 = Cook | first2 = Blanche Wiesen (editor) | author-link1 = Crystal Eastman | author-link2 = Blanche Wiesen Cook | contribution = Feminist theory and program: birth control in the feminist program | editor-last1 = Eastman | editor-first1 = Crystal (author) | editor-last2 = Cook | editor-first2 = Blanche Wiesen (editor) | editor-link1 = Crystal Eastman | editor-link2 = Blanche Wiesen Cook | title = Crystal Eastman on women and revolution | pages = 46&amp;ndash;49 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780195024463 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''United Nations Human Development Report 2004'' estimated that when both paid employment and unpaid household tasks are accounted for, on average women work more than men. In rural areas of selected developing countries women performed an average of 20% more work than men, or 120% of men's total work, an additional 102 minutes per day. In the [[OECD]] countries surveyed, on average women performed 5% more work than men, or 105% of men's total workâan additional 20 minutes per day. However, men did up to 19 minutes more work per day than women in five out of the eighteen OECD countries surveyed: Canada, Denmark, Hungary, Israel, and The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = Section 28: Gender, Work Burden, and Time Allocation |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr04_complete.pdf |title= United Nations Human Development Report 2004 | page = 233 | format = PDF | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[UN Women]], "Women perform 66 percent of the world's work, produce 50 percent of the food, but earn 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Facts &amp; figures on women, poverty &amp; economics | url = http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/facts_figures.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103173808/http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/facts_figures.html | archivedate = November 3, 2013 | website = unifem.org | publisher = [[UN Women]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movement's agenda includes acting as a counter to the putatively patriarchal strands in the dominant culture. While differing during the progression of waves, it is a movement that has sought to challenge the political structure, power holders, and cultural beliefs or practices.

Although antecedents to feminism may be found far back before the 18th century, the seeds of the modern feminist movement were planted during the late part of that century. [[Christine de Pizan]], a late medieval writer, was possibly the earliest feminist in the western tradition. She is believed to be the first woman to make a living out of writing. Feminist thought began to take a more substantial shape during [[The Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] with such thinkers as [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] and the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] championing women's education. The first [[scientific society]] for women was founded in [[Middelburg]], a city in the south of the [[Dutch republic]], in 1785. Journals for women that focused on issues like science became popular during this period as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The women who made the first efforts towards women's suffrage came from more stable and privileged backgrounds, and were able to dedicate time and energy into making change. Initial developments for women, therefore, mainly benefited white women in the middle and upper classes.

=== Feminism in China ===
{{Main article|Feminism in China}}
{{Refimprove science|section|date=October 2017}}
Prior to the 20th century, women in China were considered{{By whom|date=July 2017}} essentially different from men.

In the patriarchal society, the struggle for women's emancipation means to enact laws that guarantee women's full equality of race, sex, property and freedom of marriage. In order to further eliminate the legacy of the class society of patriarchal women (drowning of infants, [[corset]], [[Foot binding|footbinding]], etc.), discrimination, play, mutilate women's traditional prejudice and habitual forces on the basis of the development of productive forces, it is gradually needful on achieving gender in politics, economy, social and family aspects of equality.

Before the westernization movement and the reform movement, women had set off a wave of their own strength in the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] (1851â1864). However, there are too many women from the bottom identities in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. It is difficult to get rid of the fate of being used. Until the end of the Qing Dynasty, women with more knowledges took the initiative in the fight for women's rights and that is where feminism basically started.

The term 'feminism' was first transmitted to China in 1791 which was proposed by Olympe de Gouges and promoted the 'women's liberation'. The feminist movement in China was mainly kickstarted and driven by male feminists prior to female feminists.&lt;ref name="shen pdf1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dr Shen|first1=Yifei|title=Feminism in China An Analysis of Advocates, Debates, and Strategies|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/bueros/china/12947.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key male feminists in China in the 19th to 20th century included Liang Qichao, Ma Junwu and Jin Tianhe. In 1897, Liang Qichao proposed banning of foot-binding and encouraged women to engage in the workforce, political environment and education. The foot-binding costume had long been established in China which was an act to display the beauty and social status of women by binding their feet into an extremely small shoe with good decorations and ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Rui|last2=Bae|first2=Soojeong|title=A Formative Beauty of Chinese Foot-Binding Shoes and the Meaning of Chinese Costume History|url=http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=HGPSBI_2015_v19n4_57|publisher=The Korean Society of Fashion Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liang Qichao proposed the abolishment of this act due to concern the health of female being a supportive wives and caring mothers. He also proposed to reduce the number of female dependents in family and encouraged women to receive the rights of education and enter the workforce to be economic independent from men and finally help the nation to reach higher wealth and prosperity. For feminist Ma Junwu and Jin Tianhe, they both supported the equality between husbands and wives, women enjoy legitimate and equal rights and also rights to enter the political sphere. A key assertion from Jin Tianhe was  women as the mother of the nation. These views from male feminists in early feminism in China represented the image of ideal women in the imagination of men.&lt;ref name="shen pdf1"/&gt;

Key female feminists in China in the 19th to 20th century included Lin Zongsu, He Zhen, Chen Xiefen and Qiu Jin. The female feminists in early China focused more on the methods or ways that women should behave and liberate themselves to achieve equal and deserved rights and independence. He Zhen expressed her opinion that women's liberation was not correlated to the interest of the nation and she analysed three reasons behind the male feminists included: following the Western trend, to alleviate their financial burdens and high quality of reproduction. Besides, Li Zongsu  proposed that women should strive for their legitimate rights which includes broader aspects than the male feminists: call for their own right over men, the Qing Court and in an international extent.&lt;ref name="shen pdf1"/&gt;

In the Qing Dynasty, the discussion on feminism had two dimensions including the sex differences between men and women such as maternal role and duties of women and social difference between genders; the other dimension was the aim of liberation of women. The view of the feminists were diverse: some believed feminism was benefiting the nation and some believed feminism was associated with the individual development of female in improving their rights and welfare.&lt;ref name="shen pdf1"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the Marxist philosophy about female and feminism was transmitted to China and became the guiding principle of feminism movement in China by introducing class struggle theories to address gender quality. In the 1990s, more female scholars were adapted to feminism in Western countries, and they promoted feminism and equal rights for women by publishing, translating and carrying out research on global feminism and made feminism in China as one part of their study to raise more concern and awareness for gender equality issues.&lt;ref name="shen pdf1"/&gt;

=== Language ===

Feminists are sometimes, though not exclusively, proponents of using [[non-sexist language]], such as using "[[Ms.]]" to refer to both married and unmarried women. Feminists are also often proponents of using ''gender-inclusive'' language, such as "humanity" instead of "mankind", or "they" in place of "he" where the gender is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872743087|title=Gender and language : theory and practice|last=Lia,|first=Litosseliti,|isbn=1134121733|oclc=872743087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-neutral language is [[Word usage|language usage]] which is aimed at minimizing assumptions regarding the [[gender]] of human referents. The advocacy of gender-neutral language reflects, at least, two different agendas: one aims to clarify the ''inclusion'' of both sexes or genders (gender-inclusive language); the other proposes that gender, as a category, is rarely worth marking in language (gender-neutral language). Gender-neutral language is sometimes described as ''non-sexist language'' by advocates and ''politically correct language'' by opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usask.ca/policies/2_03.htm |title= University of Saskatchewan Policies 2001: Gender Neutral Language |accessdate=March 25, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061028110505/http://www.usask.ca/policies/2_03.htm  |archivedate = October 28, 2006 | publisher = [[University of Saskatchewan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has the movement come to change the language into gender neutral but the feminist movement has brought up how people use language. Emily Martin describes the concept of how metaphors are gendered and ingrained into everyday life. Metaphors are used in everyday language and have become a way that people describe the world. Martin explains that these metaphors structure how people think and in regards to science can shape what questions are being asked. If the right questions are not being asked then the answers are not going to be the right either. For example, the aggressive sperm and passive egg is a metaphor that felt 'natural' to people in history but as scientists have reexamined this phenomenon they have come up with a new answer. "The sperm tries to pull its getaway act even on the egg itself, but is held down against its struggles by molecules on the surface of the egg that hook together with counterparts on the sperm's surface, fastening the sperm until the egg can absorb it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Freedman | first = David H. | title = New theory on how the aggressive egg attracts sperm | journal = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover Magazine]] | volume = 6 | issue = 13 | page = 55 | publisher = [[Kalmbach Publishing]] | date = June 1992 | url = http://discovermagazine.com/1992/jun/theaggressiveegg55 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a goal in feminism to see these gendered metaphors and bring it to the public's attention. The outcome of looking at things in a new perspective can produce new information.

=== Heterosexual relationships ===

The increased entry of women into the workplace beginning in the 20th century has affected gender roles and the [[division of labor]] within households. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] in ''The Second Shift'' and ''The Time Bind'' presents evidence that in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework.&lt;ref name=Hochschild1&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Russell Hochschild | first1 = Arlie | last2 = Machung | first2 = Anne | author-link1 = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = [[The Second Shift|The second shift: working families and the revolution at home]] | publisher = Penguin Books | location = New York | year = 2003 }} {{ISBN|9780142002926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hochschild2&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell Hochschild | first = Arlie | author-link = Arlie Russell Hochschild | title = [[Time bind|The time bind: when work becomes home and home becomes work]] | publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co. | location = New York | year = 2001 }} {{ISBN|9780805066432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist writer [[Cathy Young]] responds to Hochschild's assertions by arguing that, in some cases, women may prevent the equal participation of men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Young | first = Cathy | authorlink = Cathy Young | title = The Mama Lion at the Gate | url = http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/ | date = June 12, 2000 | accessdate = July 8, 2008 | website = Salon.com | publisher = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Mark Aguiar and Erik Hurst calculate that the amount of time spent on housework by women since the 1960s has dropped considerably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aguiar | first1 = Mark | last2 = Hurst | first2 = Erik | title = Measuring trends in leisure: the allocation of time over five decades | journal = [[Quarterly Journal of Economics|The Quarterly Journal of Economics]] | volume = 122 | issue = 3 | pages = 969&amp;ndash;1006 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1162/qjec.122.3.969 | date = August 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/qjec.122.3.969 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2006/wp0602.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Leisure for both men and women has risen significantly and by about the same amount for both sexes.

Feminist criticisms of men's contributions to child care and domestic labor in the Western middle class are typically centered around the idea that it is unfair for women to be expected to perform more than half of a household's domestic work and child care when both members of the relationship perform an equal share of work outside the home. Several studies provide statistical evidence that the financial income of married men does not affect their rate of attending to household duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = South | first1 = Scott J. | last2 = Spitze | first2 = Gelnna | title = Housework in marital and nonmarital households | journal = [[American Sociological Review]] | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&amp;ndash;348 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | jstor = 2095937 | doi = 10.2307/2095937 | date = June 1994 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2095937 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Fenstermaker Berk | first1 =Sarah | last2 = Shih | first2 = Anthony |contribution=Contributions to household labour: comparing wives' and husbands' reports |series=SAGE Yearbooks on Women and Politics Series  |title=Women and household labour  |year=1980 |editor-last=Fenstermaker Berk | editor-first =Sarah |publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]]  |location=Beverly Hills, California | isbn = 9780803912113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Dubious Conceptions'', [[Kristin Luker]] discusses the effect of feminism on teenage women's choices to bear children, both in and out of wedlock. She says that as childbearing [[Legitimacy (family law)|out of wedlock]] has become more socially acceptable, young women, especially poor young women, while not bearing children at a higher rate than in the 1950s, now see less of a reason to get married before having a child. Her explanation for this is that the economic prospects for poor men are slim, hence poor women have a low chance of finding a husband who will be able to provide reliable financial support due to the rise of unemployment from more workers on the market, from just men to women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Luker | first = Kristin | author-link = Kristin Luker | title = Dubious conceptions: the politics of teenage pregnancy | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780674217034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have suggested that both men and women perceive feminism as being incompatible with romance. However, a recent survey of U.S. undergraduates and older adults found that feminism actually has a positive impact on relationship health for women and sexual satisfaction for men, and found no support for negative stereotypes of feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rudman | first1 = Laurie A. | last2 = Phelan | first2 = Julie E. | author-link1 = Laurie A.

[[Virginia Satir]] said the need for relationship education emerged from shifting gender roles as women gained greater rights and freedoms during the 20th century:
{{Quotation|"As we moved into the 20th century, we arrived with a very clearly prescribed way that males and females in marriage were to behave with one another&amp;nbsp;... The pattern of the relationship between husband and wife was that of the dominant male and submissive female&amp;nbsp;... A new era has since dawned&amp;nbsp;... the climate of relationships had changed, and women were no longer willing to be submissive&amp;nbsp;... The end of the dominant/submissive model in relationships was in sight. However, there was very little that had developed to replace the old pattern; couples floundered&amp;nbsp;... Retrospectively, one could have expected that there would be a lot of chaos and a lot of fall-out. The change from the dominant/submissive model to one of equality is a monumental shift. We are learning how a relationship based on genuine feelings of equality can operate practically."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Satir |first=Virginia |author-link=Virginia Satir |contribution=Introduction to for our future, for our family |editor-last=PAIRS Foundation |editor-link=PAIRS Foundation |title=For our future, for our family: participant handbook |url=http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx |location=Broward County, Florida |page=6 |publisher=[[PAIRS Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305044746/http://www.pairsusa.com/p-42-for-our-future-for-our-family-participant-handbook.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }} (Participant handbook for PAIRS 30-hour curriculum for Supporting Healthy Marriages.)

=== Religion ===
{{main|Feminist theology}}
{{see also|Christian feminism|Dianic Wicca|Islamic feminism|Jewish feminism|New feminism}}
[[Feminist theology]] is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining the place of women in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book | last = Bundesen | first = Lynne | title = The feminine spirit: recapturing the heart of Scripture: the woman's guide to the Bible | publisher = Jossey-Bass | location = San Francisco | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780787984953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist movement has affected [[religion]] and [[theology]] in profound ways. In liberal branches of [[Protestant Christianity]], women are now allowed to be ordained as [[clergy]], and in [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] [[Judaism]], women are now allowed to be ordained as [[rabbi]]s and [[Hazzan|cantor]]s. In some of these groups, some women are gradually obtaining positions of power that were formerly only held by men, and their perspectives are now sought out in developing new statements of belief. These trends, however, have been resisted within most sects of [[Islam]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Within Roman Catholicism, most women understand that, through the dogma of the faith, they are to hold, within the family, a place of love and focus on the family. They also understand the need to rise above that doesn't necessarily constitute a woman to be considered less than, but in fact equal to, that of her husband who is called to be the patriarch of the family and provide love and guidance to his family as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=John Paul II |first=Pope |author-link=Pope John Paul II |title=Letter of Pope John Paul II to women |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1995/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_29061995_women.html |website=vatican.va |publisher=[[Libreria Editrice Vaticana]] (Vatican Publishing House) |access-date=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020192551/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/letters/1995/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_29061995_women.html |archivedate=20 October 2015 |df= }} See also: [[Letter to Women]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to reinterpret and understand [[Christianity]] in light of the equality of women and men (Feminine Genius, St. Pope John Paul II, Vatican.va).{{Incomplete short citation|date=September 2015}} While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of biologically determined characteristics such as sex.

Early feminists such as [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] concentrated almost solely on "making women equal to men." However, the Christian feminist movement chose to concentrate on the language of religion because they viewed the historic gendering of God as male as a result of the pervasive influence of patriarchy. [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]] provided a systematic critique of Christian theology from a feminist and theist point of view.&lt;ref name=Ochs&gt;{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Carol | title = Behind the sex of God: toward a new consciousness - transcending matriarchy and patriarchy | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 1977 | isbn = 9780807011126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton was an agnostic and Reuther is an agnostic who was born to Catholic parents but no longer practices the faith.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Islamic feminism]] is concerned with the role of [[Women and Islam|women in Islam]] and aims for the full equality of all [[Muslims]], regardless of gender, in public and private life. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm |publisher=feminismeislamic.org |author=Catalan Islamic Board |title=II International Congress on Islamic Feminism|accessdate=9 July 2008 |date=24â27 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321140633/http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/index.htm  |archivedate = 21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the movement seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the [[Quran]] and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]), and ''[[sharia]]'' (law) towards the creation of a more equal and just society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Badran | first = Margot | url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm | title = Al-Ahram Weekly: Islamic Feminism: What's in a Name? | accessdate = 9 July 2008 | date = 17â23 January 2002 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074746/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm | archivedate = 20 March 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within [[Judaism]] and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. In its modern form, the movement can be traced to the early 1970s in the United States. According to [[Judith Plaskow]], who has focused on feminism in [[Reform Judaism]], the main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;{{citation |last=Plaskow | first =Judith | author-link = Judith Plaskow |contribution=Jewish feminist thought |editor-last1=Frank | editor-first1 = Daniel H. |editor-last2 = Leaman | editor-first2 = Oliver | editor-link2 = Oliver Leaman |title=History of Jewish philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415324694 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women's health ===
{{main|Women's health}}
Historically there has been a need to study and contribute to the health and well-being of a woman that previously has been lacking. [[Londa Schiebinger]] suggests that the common biomedical model is no longer adequate and there is a need for a broader model to ensure that all aspects of a woman are being cared for. Schiebinger describes six contributions that must occur in order to have success: political movement, academic women studies, affirmative action, health equality act, geo-political forces, and professional women not being afraid to talk openly about women issues. Political movements come from the streets and are what the people as a whole want to see changed. An academic women study is the support from universities in order to teach a subject that most people have never encountered. [[Affirmative action]] enacted is a legal change to acknowledge and do something for the times of neglect people were subjected to. Women's Health Equity Act legally enforces the idea that medicine needs to be tested in suitable standards such as including women in research studies and is also allocates a set amount of money to research diseases that are specific towards women. Research has shown that there is a lack of research in autoimmune disease, which mainly affects women. "Despite their prevalence and morbidity, little progress has been made toward a better understanding of those conditions, identifying risk factors, or developing a cure" this article reinforces the progress that still needs to be made. Geo-political forces can improve health, when the country is not at a sense of threat in war there is more funding and resources to focus on other needs, such as women's health. Lastly, professional women not being afraid to talk about women's issues moves women from entering into these jobs and preventing them for just acting as men and instead  embracing their concerns for the health of women. These six factors need to be included in order for there to be change in women's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Schiebinger | first = Londa | author-link = Londa Schiebinger | contribution = Medicine | editor-last = Schiebinger | editor-first = Londa | editor-link = Londa Schiebinger | title = Has feminism changed science? | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780674381131 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants. These businesses flourished as part of the [[Second-wave feminism|second]] and [[Third-wave feminism|third-waves]] of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975.|last=Echols|first=Alice|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=269â278.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminist Bookstore Movement: Lesbian Antiracism and Feminist Accountability|last=Hogan|first=Kristen|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gonzales v. Carhart''''', 550 U.S. 124 (2007), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that upheld the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Enrolled as Agreed to or Passed by Both House and Senate)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081129195414/http://www.nrlc.org//abortion/pba/partial_birth_abortion_Ban_act_final_language.htm |date=2008-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the high court after [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] appealed a ruling of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in favor of [[LeRoy Carhart]] that struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Also before the Supreme Court was the consolidated appeal of '''''Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood''''' from the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which had struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

The Supreme Court's decision upheld Congress's ban and held that it did not impose an undue burden on the [[Due Process Clause|due process]] right of women to obtain an abortion, "under precedents we here assume to be controlling,"&lt;ref name="Opinion"&gt;{{ussc|name=Gonzales v. Carhart|550|124|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]].'' In a legal sense, the case distinguished but did not overrule ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), in which the Court dealt with related issues. However, ''Gonzales'' was widely interpreted as signaling a shift in Supreme Court jurisprudence toward a restriction of abortion rights, occasioned in part by the retirement of [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] and her replacement by [[Samuel Alito]].&lt;ref name="nyt-greenhouse"&gt;{{cite news | title = Justices Back Ban on Method of Abortion | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | work = [[New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/washington/19scotus.html | date = April 19, 2007 | accessdate = August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm-death"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = N Engl J Med | author = Charo RA | title = The partial death of abortion rights | pmid = 17452437 | year = 2007 | volume = 356 | pages = 2125&amp;ndash;8 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/356/21/2125 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp078055 | issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nejm-abortion-scotus"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = N Engl J Med | author = Annas GJ | title = The Supreme Court and abortion rights | year = 2007 | volume = 356| issue = 21 | pages = 2201&amp;ndash;7 | pmid = 17476003 | url = http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/356/21/2201 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMhle072595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court found that there is "uncertainty [in the medical community] over whether the barred procedure is ever necessary to preserve a woman's health"; and in the past the court "has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty."&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt;

==History of case==
The [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] was signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] on November 5, 2003. It was found unconstitutional in the [[United States district court|U.S. District Courts]] for the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]], the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], and the [[United States District Court for the District of Nebraska|District of Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/abortion/ppash60104ord.pdf ''Planned Parenthood v. Ashcroft'', Order Granting Permanent Injunction, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in Support Thereof], United States District Court for the Northern District of California (June 1, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/rulings/03CV8695_Order_083004.pdf ''National Abortion Federation v.

Ashcroft'', Memorandum and Order], United States District Court for the District of Nebraska (September 8, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government appealed the district court rulings, first bringing ''Carhart v. Gonzales'' before a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. The panel unanimously affirmed the ruling of the Nebraska court on July 8, 2005. Finding that the government offered no "new evidence which would serve to distinguish this record from the record reviewed by the Supreme Court in ''Stenberg''," they held that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the woman.&lt;ref name="Eighth"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/8th/043379p.pdf ''Gonzales v. Carhart''], United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (July 8, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney General Gonzales petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Eighth Circuit decision on September 25, 2005. Meanwhile, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] also found the law unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0416621p.pdf ''Planned Parenthood Federation v.

==Decision==
Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote for the Court that the [[respondent]]s had failed to prove that Congress lacked authority to ban this abortion procedure. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]], Justice [[Samuel Alito]], Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] agreed with the Court's judgment, joining Kennedy's opinion.

The Court left the door open for as-applied challenges, citing its recent precedent in ''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of New England]]''. According to ''Washington Post'' reporter Benjamin Wittes, "The Court majority, following the path it sketched out last year in the New Hampshire case, decided to let the law stand as a facial matter and let the parties fight later about what, if any, applications need to be blocked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court decided to "assume ... for the purposes of this opinion" the principles of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''.

The Court said that the lower courts had repudiated a central premise of ''Casey'' â that the state has an interest in preserving [[fetal]] life â and the Court held that the ban fit that interest so as not to create an undue burden. The opinion did not rely deferentially on Congress's findings that this [[intact dilation and extraction]] procedure is never needed to protect the health of a pregnant woman; in fact the Court found that "evidence presented in the District Courts contradicts that conclusion." However, Kennedy wrote that a health exception was unnecessary: where medical testimony disputes Congress's findings, Congress is still entitled to regulate in an area where the medical community has not reached a "consensus."&lt;ref name="Opinion" /&gt;

In addition, the Court distinguished this case from the ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart|Stenberg]]'' case (in which the Court struck down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law) by holding that the state statute at issue in ''Stenberg'' was more ambiguous than the later federal statute at issue in ''Carhart''.&lt;ref name="Opinion" /&gt;

Without discussing the constitutional rationale of the Court's prior abortion cases (i.e. "[[due process]]"), the majority opinion stated it disagreed with the Eighth Circuit's determination that the federal statute conflicted with "the Due Process Clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]], [which] is textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]."&lt;ref name="Eighth" /&gt;

==Concurrence==
Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justice Scalia, which mentions saving for another day the issue of whether Congress had sufficient power under the [[Commerce Clause]] to enact this ban.&lt;ref name="Opinion" /&gt; The Commerce Clause (the only Constitutional clause mentioned explicitly in any of the decision's three opinions) was also mentioned in the majority opinion.

The concurrence also stated that Justices Thomas and Scalia joined the Court's opinion "because it accurately applies current jurisprudence." In addition, the concurrence reiterated the justices' view that current abortion jurisprudence "has no basis in the Constitution." [[Nadine Strossen]], president of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] at the time, pointed out that "no less an anti-abortion proponent than [[w:Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] joined by [[w:Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]], in his separate opinion, chided the majority for not coming out and explicitly saying that they had overturned not ''Roe v. Wade'', but the [[Stenberg v. Carhart|prior partial-birth abortion ban case]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush|Interview with Nadine Strossen]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissent==
Joined by justices [[David Souter]], [[John Paul Stevens]], and [[Stephen Breyer]], Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissented,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZD.html ''Gonzales v. Carhart'', Ginsburg, J., dissenting], U.S. Supreme Court (April 18, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  contending that the ruling was an "alarming" one that ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent and "refuse[d] to take ''Casey'' and ''Stenberg'' seriously." Referring in particular to ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', Ginsburg sought to ground the Court's abortion jurisprudence based on concepts of personal autonomy and equal citizenship rather than the Court's previous privacy approach: "Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature."&lt;ref name="Opinion"/&gt;

Ginsburg also took issue with the lack of a health exception, writing that "the absence of a health exception burdens all women for whom it is relevantâwomen who, in the judgment of their doctors, require an intact D&amp;E because other procedures would place their health at risk." In general, the dissent criticized the usurpation of medical decision-making by legislators and the minimization of "the reasoned medical judgments of highly trained doctors ... as 'preferences' motivated by 'mere convenience'."&lt;ref name="nejm-abortion-scotus"/&gt;

Observing that the majority opinion in ''Carhart'' did not touch upon the question of whether the Court's prior decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''Planned Parenthood v. Casey'' were valid, Justice Ginsburg wrote, "Casey's principles, confirming the continuing vitality of 'the essential holding of Roe,' are merely 'assume[d]' for the moment ... rather than 'retained' or 'reaffirmed.'" She concluded by criticizing the majority for abandoning the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'', writing that "a decision so at odds with our jurisprudence should not have staying power."

==Reactions==
According to an [[ABC News]] poll, the majority of Americans (69%) oppose the legality of [[Intact dilation and extraction|D&amp;X]] or what opponents call "partial-birth" abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90413 |title=Poll: Abortion Support Conditional |last=Sussman |first=Dalia |work=ABC News |date=January 22, 2003 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medical groups expressed concern that the Court, in supporting the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], endorsed the substitution of congressional legislation for medical judgment. The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], which had submitted an [[amicus brief]] opposing the Act, described the Court's decision as "shameful and incomprehensible", ignorant of medical consensus, and chilling for the medical profession.&lt;ref name="acog-statement"&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] | title = ACOG Statement on the US Supreme Court Decision Upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 | url = http://www.acog.org/About_ACOG/News_Room/News_Releases/2007/ACOG_Statement_on_the_US_Supreme_Court_Decision | date = April 18, 2007 | accessdate = October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' criticized the intrusion of politicians into medical decision-making, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Until this opinion, the Court recognized the importance of not interfering with medical judgments made by physicians to protect a patient's interest. For the first time, the Court permits congressional judgment to replace medical judgment.&lt;ref name="nejm-abortion-scotus"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor and academic [[Geoffrey R. Stone]] has argued that the religion of Supreme Court judges played an important role in the decision, given that the five judges in the majority were Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/justice-sotomayor-justice_b_271229.html |title=Justice Sotomayor, Justice Scalia and Our Six Catholic Justices |author=Geoffrey R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8253">The '''Grammarians of Basrah''' were grammarians and language scholars of Basra in the [[Islamic Golden Age]], who laid down the rules of grammar and of literary style, and whose teachings and writings became the canon of the [[Arabic language]].  Shortly after the school's foundation in Basra, a rival school was established in Kufa, by the '''[[Grammarians of Kufa]]'''.  The book ''Kitab al-Fihrist'' by the tenth century author, Ibn Ishaq al-Warraq, known as "[[Ibn Nadim|al-Nadim]]", provides biographical details of the leading figures  and is the principal source for early accounts of the two schools. The schools represent the two main branches in the development of Arabic grammar and punctuation, linguistics, [[philology]], Quranic exegesis and recital, [[Hadith]], poetry and literature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1726">'''Head''' describes [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] consisting of fragmented material which, following [[weathering]], have moved downslope through a process of [[solifluction]]. The term has been used by British geologists since the middle of the 19th century to describe such material in a range of different settings from flat hilltops to the bottoms of valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Melville , R.V. and Freshney, R.C. 1982 ''British Regional Geology: the Hampshire Basin and adjoining areas'' 4th edn Institute of Geological Sciences p125 {{ISBN|011884203X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas identified as head include deposits of [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] origin such as [[blown sand]] and [[loess]], slope deposits such as [[Gelifluction|gelifluctates]] and [[Solifluction|solifluctates]], and recently eroded [[soil]] material, called [[colluvium]]. With geologists becoming more interested in studying the near-surface environment and its related processes, the term head is becoming obsolete.

A related term is 'combe (or coombe) rock', descriptive of a body of [[chalk]] and [[flint]] fragments contained within a mass of chalky earth typically found on the [[chalk downland]]s of south-east England and resulting from freeze-thaw processes. Where the mass is also soliflucted, it is considered a variety of head.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, D.G.A. and Brooks, J.R.V. 1972 ''The Penguin Dictionary of Geology'' {{ISBN|0140510494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melville , R.V. and Freshney, R.C. 1982 ''British Regional Geology: the Hampshire Basin and adjoining areas'' 4th edn Institute of Geological Sciences p125 {{ISBN|011884203X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11255">'''Hellenoturkism''' is a political concept that encompasses two things: a) a fact of civilization i.e. the co-habitation and interdependence, since the 11th century A.D., of the [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] peoples and cultures and b) a political ideology based on the above civilizational phenomenon, which aims at establishing a Greek-Turkish political ensemble.

==From Empire to Confederation==
From the time of the [[Persian Empire]] and [[Alexander the Great]], to the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 20th century A.D., the [[Intermediate Region]] has been covered by an ecumenical empire that had common civilizational characteristics, despite the fact that it passed into the hands successively of the Persians, to the Greeks, to the Romans, to the Byzantines and, finally, to the Ottomans. This central civilization of the Intermediate Region, existing since the time of Cyrus the Great, bore the characteristics, since the 11th century A.D. and for the last thousand years, of Greek and Turkish cultures. The Ecumenicity of the Empire was Hellenoturkism.&lt;ref&gt;ÐÐ° Ð¿ÐµÑÐµÐºÑÐµÑÑÐºÐµ ÑÐ¸Ð²Ð¸Ð»Ð¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¹: ÐÐ¾Ð»Ñ ÐÐµÐ¼ÐµÑÐ»Ñ, ÐÑÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ñ ÐÐ¸Ð·Ð°Ð½ÑÐ¸Ð¸.

In the 15th century, a Greek philosopher, [[George of Trebizond]], 1395-1484 (the date of his death varies from 1472 to 1486 depending on the sources), who aimed at synthesizing Turkish Islam in the form of [[Bektashism]] and Christianity in the form of [[Greek Orthodoxy]],&lt;ref&gt;ÎÎµÏÏÎ³Î¹Î¿Ï á½ Î¤ÏÎ±ÏÎµÎ¶Î¿ÏÎ½ÏÎ¹Î¿Ï, Î ÎµÏÎ¯ Ïá¿Ï á¼Î»Î·Î¸ÎµÎ¯Î±Ï Ïá¿Ï Ïá¿¶Î½ ÏÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¹Î±Î½á¿¶Î½ ÏÎ¯ÏÏÎµÏÏ, Athens, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; is considered by supporters of Hellenoturkism as the founder of their ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Georgios Zoras, ÎÎµÏÏÎ³Î¹Î¿Ï  á½ Î¤ÏÎ±ÏÎµÎ¶Î¿ÏÎ½ÏÎ¹Î¿Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î±á¼± ÏÏá½¸Ï á¼Î»Î»Î·Î½Î¿ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎºÎ¹Îºá½´Î½ ÏÏÎ½ÎµÎ½Î½ÏÎ·ÏÎ¹Î½ ÏÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ¬Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î±Î¹ Î±á½ÏÎ¿á¿¦ -Athens, University of Athens, 1954 &amp; Konstantinos Amantos, Î£ÏÎ­ÏÎµÎ¹Ï á¼Î»Î»Î®Î½ÏÎ½ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¤Î¿ÏÏÎºÏÎ½ á¼Ïá½¸ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼Î½Î´ÎµÎºÎ¬ÏÎ¿Ï Î±á¼°á¿¶Î½Î¿Ï Î¼Î­ÏÏÎ¹ Ïá½¸ 1821 - Athens, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed the new ruler of the Empire, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]], in a letter of 1466, as the legal emperor of the Romans and of the whole Universe and also as the common emperor of both Greeks and Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Babinger, Mehmed der Eroberer und seine Zeit. WeltenstÃ¼rmer einer Zeitenwende. MÃ¼nchen, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, after the founding of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the majority of the Greek population remained in the Ottoman Empire and were divided between two trends: the nationalists of the so-called Western Party and the federalists of the so-called Eastern Party.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, L'Empire ottoman, Paris, Presses Universitaires de France,1985&lt;/ref&gt; The latter wanted to stay in the Empire and transform it into a purely Greek-Turkish Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, TÃ¼rk-Yunan Ä°mparatorluÄu.

An inquiry into Ottoman History through the prism of the Intermediate Region)&lt;/ref&gt; The two trends also developed in the State of Greece with the most vocal defender of a Greek-Turkish common State being the member of Parliament of Greece, in 1864, Georgios Typaldos-Iakovatos.&lt;ref&gt;Georgios Metallinos, Î Î¿Î»Î¹ÏÎ¹Îºá½´ ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÎÎµÎ¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±:á¼¸Î´ÎµÎ¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹Î± ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÏÎ¬Î¾Î· ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¿¥Î¹Î¶Î¿ÏÏÎ¬ÏÏÎ· ÏÎ¿Î»Î¹ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¿á¿¦ ÎÎµÏÏÎ³Î¯Î¿Ï Î¤ÏÏÎ¬Î»Î´Î¿Ï-'ÎÎ±ÎºÏÎ²Î¬ÏÎ¿Ï, Katerini, Tertios, 1990.

In the 20th century, the ideology of Hellenoturkism was revived by the historian [[Dimitri Kitsikis]] who since 1966, in his numerous books, articles and conference papers, as well as with his political activity in both Greece and Turkey, as adviser of Greek President [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] the Elder and Turkish President [[Turgut Ãzal]], has striven to establish the basis of a Turkish-Greek Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri Kitsikis, Î£ÏÎ³ÎºÏÎ¹ÏÎ¹Îºá½´ á¼¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î± á¼Î»Î»Î¬Î´Î¿Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î¤Î¿ÏÏÎºÎ¯Î±Ï ÏÏá½¸Î½ 20Ï Î±á¼°á¿¶Î½Î± - Athens, Hestia, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eleftherios Venizelos]] on the 10th of May 1933, in a meeting of the Committee of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declared and repeated three times the following: "One day will come when we will create with Turkey an Eastern Federation".&lt;ref&gt;Î ÏÎ±ÎºÏÎ¹Îºá½° Î£ÏÏÎºÎ­ÏÎµÏÏ Ïá¿Ï ÎÎµÎ³Î¬Î»Î·Ï á¼ÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¿Ïá¿Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á½ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ³ÎµÎ¯Î¿Ï á¼Î¾ÏÏÎµÏÎ¹Îºá¿¶Î½, Athens, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Venizelos' close collaborator, Leon Makkas, in his Souvenirs, referring to his meetings with the founder of Turkey, [[Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]], wrote: "Kemal was the apostle of a large Greco-Turkish Empire in the East, a double-headed Empire, with two administrative capitals and one spiritual capital, the Augustian city which was successively called [[Byzantium]], [[Constantinople]], [[Istanbul]] and which will always remain, by its very geographical position, the Queen City of a whole Eastern world. I did not anymore have in front me the [[Peter the Great]] of [[Turkey]], but rather a [[Victor Hugo]] chanting his ''Orientales''".&lt;ref&gt;Leon Maccas, Â«AtatÃ¼rk et InÃ¶nÃ¼, Ã  travers quelques souvenirs personnelsÂ», ''Les Balkans'' , Athens,  X-4, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bilingual "Greek Turkish Confederation" (''East Mediterranean Confederation'') between [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]] (with national capitals in [[Athens]], [[Ankara]] and [[Nicosia]], and Confederation parliament in [[Istanbul]]) would (to an extent) be a reincarnation of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]/[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires; thus filling the political, cultural and economic vacuum that's left behind by the absence of these two historic superpowers in the East Mediterranean region. It would have the largest economy and military in the area covering the [[Balkans]], the [[Middle East]], the [[Levant|East Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]], and become one of the key global [[great power]]s due to its geographic location. During the 2010-2015 Greek financial crisis, the Greek-Turkish Confederation idea was brought back with renewed insistence in Turkey as well as in Greece&lt;ref&gt;Tom Ginsburg, "A Novel Solution for the Greek Debt Crisis: Join Turkey", The Huffington Post, July 8, 2015, with 189 comments. See also the many interviews in favor of a Greek-Turkish Union given by Dimitri Kitsikis, in the Turkish Press and the Turkish TV &amp; Radio stations, during 2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2016}}

'''Inconnu Art Group''' (later the '''Inconnu Independent Art Group''') is the name of a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] group of maverick [[fine art]]ists from the [[communism|communist]] and postcommunist eras. The original members were Bokros PÃ©ter, MolnÃ¡r TamÃ¡s, CsÃ©csei MihÃ¡ly, MÃ©szÃ¡ros BÃ¡nk, Letenyei JÃ³zsef, Sipos MihÃ¡ly, KopÃ¡cs KovÃ¡cs MiklÃ³s, and Morva Ibolya. The foundation date of the group is unknown, but as PÃ©ter Bokros remembers (in 2005), they started their common activities in 1978, [[CeglÃ©d]], but the name "inconnu" came later.

They  took part in (often illegal) exhibitions and performances in the eighties; and were considered as an important part of the Hungarian democratic opposition both in Hungary and in abroad. From 1979 they were subject to serious manhunt by the Hungarian authorities, and they were continuously followed and eyed by secret agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galantai.hu/festo/1982/820614.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Post-Communism==
After 1994 some members became active again and continued &amp;ndash; in their words &amp;ndash; their "[[anticommunism|anti-communist]]" drive, now against the (post-communist socialist) governments (led by Hungarian Socialist Party, MSzP).{{fact|date=January 2014}} Other members created independent art and to explore the "rubberized horror of global powers".{{fact|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60756">An '''international auxiliary language'''{{efn-ua| The term was used at least as early as 1908, by [[Otto Jespersen]]. }} (sometimes abbreviated as '''IAL''' or '''auxlang''') or '''interlanguage''' is a [[language]] meant for communication between people from different nations who do not share a common [[first language]]. An auxiliary language is primarily a [[foreign language]].

Languages of dominant societies over the centuries have served as [[lingua francas]] that sometimes approaches the international level. [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]] were used in the past, and [[Modern Standard Arabic|(Standard) Arabic]], [[Standard Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] have been used as such in recent times in many parts of the world.&lt;ref name="bodmer_pei"&gt;Bodmer, Frederick. ''The loom of language'' and Pei, Mario. ''One language for the world.''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as lingua francas are traditionally associated with the very dominanceâcultural, political, and economicâthat made them popular, they are often also met with resistance. For this and other reasons, some have turned to the idea of promoting an artificial or [[constructed language]] as a possible solution, by way of "auxiliary" language.&lt;ref name="bodmer_pei"/&gt; The term "auxiliary" implies that it is intended to be an additional language for the people of the world, rather than to replace their native languages. Often, the term is used to refer to planned or constructed languages proposed specifically to ease international communication, such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]] and [[Interlingua]]. However, it can also refer to the concept of such a language being determined by international consensus, including even a standardized natural language (e.g., [[International English]]), and has also been connected to the project of constructing a [[universal language]].

== History ==

The use of an intermediary auxiliary language (also called a "working language", "bridge language", "vehicular language" or "unifying language") to make communication possible between people not sharing a first language, in particular when it is a third language, distinct from both mother tongues,&lt;ref&gt;Viacheslav A. Chirikba, "The problem of the Caucasian Sprachbund" in Pieter Muysken, ed., ''From Linguistic Areas to Areal Linguistics'', 2008, p. 31. {{ISBN|90-272-3100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be almost as old as language itself. Certainly they have existed since antiquity. [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] (or [[KoinÃ© language|KoinÃ© Greek]]) were the intermediary language of all areas of the Mediterraneum; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and then [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], remained the common languages of a large part of [[Western Asia]] through several earlier empires.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, 2005 pp. 38â40&lt;/ref&gt; Such natural languages used for communication between people not sharing the same mother tongue are called ''lingua francas''.

===Natural international languages: Lingua francas===
''[[Lingua franca]]s'' have arisen around the globe throughout human history, sometimes for commercial reasons (so-called "trade languages") but also for diplomatic and administrative convenience, and as a means of exchanging information between scientists and other scholars of different nationalities. The term originates with one such language, [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], a [[pidgin]] language used as a trade language in the Mediterranean area from the 11th to the 19th century. Examples of lingua francas remain numerous, and exist on every continent. The most obvious example as of the early 21st century is [[English language|English]]. There are many other lingua francas centralized on particular regions, such as Arabic, Chinese, French, Greek, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/best-languages-influence-world/ | title=Languages that Influence the World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed languages===
{{main|Constructed language}}
Since all natural languages display a number of irregularities in grammar which makes them more difficult to learn, and they are also associated with the national and cultural dominance of the nation that speaks it as its mother tongue,{{citation needed|date=April 2015|reason=Both assertions in this sentence need to be sourced to a reliable source.}} attention began to focus on the idea of creating an artificial or constructed language as a possible solution. The concept of simplifying an existing language to make it an auxiliary language was already in the ''[[EncyclopÃ©die]]'' of the 18th century, where [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]], in the article on ''Langue'', wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of French.

Some of the [[philosophical language]]s of the 17thâ18th centuries could be regarded as proto-auxlangs, as they were intended by their creators to serve as bridges among people of different languages as well as to disambiguate and clarify thought. However, most or all of these languages were, as far as can be told from the surviving publications about them, too incomplete and unfinished to serve as auxlangs (or for any other practical purpose). The first fully developed constructed languages we know of, as well as the first constructed languages devised primarily as auxlangs, originated in the 19th century; [[Solresol]] by [[FranÃ§ois Sudre (1787â1862)]], a language based on musical notes, was the first to gain widespread attention although not, apparently, fluent speakers.

===VolapÃ¼k===
{{main|VolapÃ¼k}}
During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such constructed international auxiliary languages (IALs) were proposed, so [[Louis Couturat]] and [[LÃ©opold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

[[VolapÃ¼k]], first described in an article in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]] and in book form the following year, was the first to garner a widespread international speaker community. Three major VolapÃ¼k conventions were held, in 1884, 1887, and 1889; the last of them used VolapÃ¼k as its working language. AndrÃ© Cherpillod writes of the third VolapÃ¼k convention,{{quote|In August 1889 the third convention was held in Paris. About two hundred people from many countries attended. And, unlike in the first two conventions, people spoke only VolapÃ¼k. For the first time in the history of mankind, sixteen years before [[World Congress of Esperanto|the Boulogne convention]], an international convention spoke an international language.&lt;ref name="cherpillod1995"&gt;Foreword to ''Konciza Gramatiko de Volapuko'', AndrÃ© Cherpillod. Courgenard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, not long after, the VolapÃ¼k speaker community broke up due to various factors including controversies between Schleyer and other prominent VolapÃ¼k speakers, and the appearance of newer, [[second-language acquisition|easier-to-learn]] [[constructed language]]s, primarily [[History of Esperanto|Esperanto]].

===From ''Kadem bevÃ¼netik volapÃ¼ka'' to ''Academia pro Interlingua''===

Answering the needs of the first successful artificial language community, the VolapÃ¼kists established the regulatory body of their language, under the name [[International VolapÃ¼k Academy]] (''Kadem bevÃ¼netik volapÃ¼ka'') at the second VolapÃ¼k congress in [[Munich]] in August 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johann. 1964. ''Jenotem valemapÃ¼ka VolapÃ¼k''. Amsterdam: VolapÃ¼kagased.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johann. 1996. ''Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko''. Translator: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La BlanchetiÃ¨re. {{ISBN|2-906134-30-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language [[VolapÃ¼k]], but soon conflicts arose between conservative VolapÃ¼kists and those who wanted to reform VolapÃ¼k to make it a more naturalistic language based on the grammar and vocabulary of major [[world language]]s. In 1890 Schleyer himself left the original Academy and created a new VolapÃ¼k Academy with the same name, from people completely loyal to him, which continues to this day.

Under [[Waldemar Rosenberger]], who became the director in 1892, the original Academy began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of VolapÃ¼k. The vocabulary and the grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were completely discarded, so that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named "[[Idiom Neutral]]". The name of the Academy was changed to ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.

In 1903, the mathematician [[Giuseppe Peano]] published his completely new approach to language construction. Inspired by the idea of philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], instead of inventing schematic structures and ''a priori'' language, he chose to simplify an existing and once widely used international language, [[Latin]]. This simplified Latin, devoid of inflections and declensions, was named ''Interlingua'' by Peano but is usually referred to as "[[Latino sine flexione]]".

Impressed by Peano's Interlingua, the ''Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal'' effectively chose to abandon Idiom Neutral in favor of Peano's Interlingua in 1908, and it elected Peano as its director. The name of the group then was changed to ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]'' (where ''Interlingua'' stands for Peano's language). The ''Academia pro Interlingua'' survived until about 1939. It was partly Peano's Interlingua that inspired the better-known [[Interlingua]] presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).

===Esperanto===
{{main|History of Esperanto}}

After the emergence of VolapÃ¼k, a wide variety of other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880sâ1900s, but none except [[Esperanto]] gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873â1887 (a [[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|first version]] was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], as a primarily schematic language; the word stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of [[Esperanto vocabulary|derivational word formation]] which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one word root. Moreover, Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time.{{citation needed| date= September 2017}} From early on, Esperantists created their [[Esperanto culture|own culture]] which helped to form the [[Esperantujo|Esperanto language community]].

Within a few years this language had thousands of fluent speakers, primarily in eastern Europe. In 1905 its first world convention was held in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year, except during the two World Wars. Esperanto has become "the most outlandishly successful invented language ever" and the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1922 a proposal by Iran and several other countries in the League of Nations to have Esperanto taught in member nations' schools failed.&lt;ref name="piron1994"&gt;''Le DÃ©fi des Langues'' by Claude Piron, L'Harmattan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harlow1995_7"&gt;''The Esperanto Book'', [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html Chapter 7: History in Fine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201024512/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html |date=2010-12-01 }} by Don Harlow. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto speakers were subject to persecution under Stalin's regime.

Of the various constructed language projects, it is Esperanto that has so far come closest to becoming an officially recognized international auxiliary language; China publishes daily news in Esperanto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esperanto.china.org.cn/ china.org.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ido and the Esperantidos===
{{main|Ido (language)}}
The [[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]] was founded in 1900 by [[Louis Couturat]] and others; it tried to get the [[International Association of Academies]] to take up the question of an international auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself.&lt;ref name="jesperson1928"&gt;Otto Jesperson, ''An International Language''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091029033240/http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/AILido.html  "The Delegation. Ido."] 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido.&lt;ref name="harlow2000"&gt;Harlow, Don. ''The Esperanto Book'', chapter 3: [http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html "How to Build a Language"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204044938/http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap03.html |date=2012-02-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called [[Esperantido]]s, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.

===Occidental (Interlingue) and Novial===
{{main|Occidental language}}
[[Edgar von Wahl]]'s [[Occidental language|Occidental]] (also called "Interlingue") of 1922 was in reaction against the perceived artificiality of some earlier auxlangs, particularly Esperanto. Inspired by [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Latino sine flexione|Peano's Interlingua]], von Wahl created a language whose words, including compound words, would have a high degree of recognizability for those who already know a Romance language. However, this design criterion was in conflict with the ease of coining new compound or derived words on the fly while speaking. Occidental gained a small speaker community in the 1920s and 1930s, and supported several publications, but had almost entirely died out by the 1980s.&lt;ref name="harlow2000"/&gt; More recently Occidental has been revived on the Internet.

In 1928 Ido's major intellectual supporter, the Danish linguist [[Otto Jespersen]], abandoned Ido, and published his own planned language, [[Novial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mostly inspired by Idiom Neutral and Occidental, yet it attempted a derivational formalism and schematism sought by Esperanto and Ido. The notability of its creator helped the growth of this auxiliary language, but soon both Novial and Occidental were abandoned in favour of [[Interlingua]], the first auxiliary language based fully on scientific methodology.

===Interlingua===
{{main|History of Interlingua}}
The [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] (IALA) was founded in 1924 by [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]]; like the earlier ''Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language'', its mission was to study language problems and the existing auxlangs and proposals for auxlangs, and to negotiate some consensus between the supporters of various auxlangs. However, like the Delegation, it finally decided to create its own auxlang. [[History of Interlingua|Interlingua]], published in 1951, was primarily the work of [[Alexander Gode]], though he built on preliminary work by earlier IALA linguists including [[AndrÃ© Martinet]], and relied on elements from previous naturalistic auxlang projects, like Peano's Interlingua (Latino sine flexione), Jespersen's Novial, von Walh's Occidental (Interlingue), and the Academy's Idiom Neutral. Like Occidental, Interlingua was designed to have words recognizable at sight by those who already know a Romance language or a language like English with much vocabulary borrowed from Romance languages; to attain this end the IALA accepted a degree of grammatical and orthographic complexity considerably greater than in Esperanto or Occidental, though still less than in any natural language.

The theory underlying Interlingua posits an ''international vocabulary'', a large number of words and affixes that are present in a wide range of languages. This already existing international vocabulary was shaped by social forces, science and technology, to "all corners of the world". The goal of the International Auxiliary Language Association was to accept into Interlingua every widely international word in whatever languages it occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Words appearing in only a few, closely related languages were ignored. See Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted studies to identify "the most generally international vocabulary possible", while still maintaining the unity of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, [[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]] [Introduction], 1971 edition. New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company (p. xxii).&lt;/ref&gt; This scientific approach of generating a language from selected source languages (called ''control languages'') resulted in a vocabulary and grammar that can be called the highest common factor of each major European language.

Interlingua gained a significant speaker community, perhaps roughly the same size as that of Ido (considerably less than the size of Esperanto). Interlingua's success can be explained by the fact that it is the most widely ''understood'' international auxiliary language by virtue of its naturalistic (as opposed to schematic) grammar and vocabulary, allowing those familiar with a Romance language, and educated speakers of English, to read and understand it without prior study.&lt;ref name="blandino1989"&gt;Blandino, Giovanni, "Le problema del linguas international auxiliari", ''Philosophia del Cognoscentia e del Scientia'', Rome, Italy: Pontificia Universitas Lateranensis, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Interlingua has some active speakers currently on all continents, and the language is propagated by the [[Union Mundial pro Interlingua]] (UMI), and Interlingua is presented on CDs, radio, and television.&lt;ref&gt;"Radioemissiones in e re Interlingua," ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', Issue 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of Interlingua, there were no more successful attempts in international language engineering that would attract a significant number of supporters, thus the enthusiasm about constructed languages gradually decreased in the years between 1960â1990.

===Internet age===
All of the auxlangs with a surviving speaker community seem to have benefited from the advent of the Internet, Esperanto more than most. The [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html CONLANG mailing list] was founded in 1991; in its early years discussion focused on international auxiliary languages. As people interested in [[artistic language]]s and [[engineered language]]s grew to be the majority of the list members, and flame-wars between proponents of particular auxlangs irritated these members, a separate [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/auxlang.html AUXLANG mailing list] was created in 1997, which has been the primary venue for discussion of auxlangs since then.  Besides giving the existing auxlangs with speaker communities a chance to interact rapidly online as well as slowly through postal mail or more rarely in personal meetings, the Internet has also made it easier to publicize new auxlang projects, and a handful of these have gained a small speaker community, including [[Kotava]], [[Lingua Franca Nova]], [[Lingwa de planeta|Lingwa de Planeta]], Pandunia, [[Sambahsa]], and [[Toki Pona]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Toki Pona was not intended by its creator as an auxlang, it has been used for communication between people of different native languages far more often than most of the thousands of auxlang proposals throughout history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011|reason=inline cite needs to mention a source, or be converted to a sourced footnote}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libert|first=Alan Reed|date=2018-06-25|title=Artificial Languages|url=http://oxfordre.com/linguistics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199384655.001.0001/acrefore-9780199384655-e-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zonal constructed languages===
{{main|Zonal constructed language}}

Not every international auxiliary language is necessarily intended to be used on a global scale. A special subgroup are languages created to facilitate communication between speakers of a certain group of related languages. The oldest known example is a [[Pan-Slavic language]] written in 1665 by the Croatian priest [[Juraj KriÅ¾aniÄ]]. He named this language [[Interslavic language#Early projects|Ruski]] ("Russian"), but in reality it was a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], his own [[Southern Chakavian]] dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian]], and, to a lesser degree, [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=ÐÐ ÐÐ¡Ð¢ÐÐ ÐÐ ÐÐÐ¢ÐÐ ÐÐÐÐÐÐÐ¡Ð¢ÐÐ§ÐÐ¡ÐÐÐ ÐÐ«Ð¡ÐÐ Ð Ð ÐÐ¡Ð¡ÐÐ|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most zonal constructed languages were created during the period of [[romantic nationalism]] at the end of the 19th century; some were created later. Particularly numerous are the Pan-Slavic languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/constructed_slavic_languages.html|title=Constructed Slavic Languages|author=Jan van Steenbergen|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, similar efforts have been made at creating umbrella languages for other language families as well: [[Tutonish]] (1902) and [[Folkspraak]] (1995) for the [[Germanic languages]], [[Romanid]] (1956) for the [[Romance languages]], and [[Afrihili]] (1973) for the [[Africa]]n continent.

Nowadays, most older zonal constructed languages are known only to specialists. Most notable among modern examples is [[Interslavic language|Interslavic]], a project established in 2011 after the merger of several other projects. In 2012 it was reported to have several hundred users.&lt;ref&gt;G.

In the early 1900s auxlangs were already becoming a subject of academic study.  Louis Couturat et al.&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Couturat|L. Couturat]], [[Otto Jesperson|O. Jespersen]], R.

:The question of a so-called world-language, or better expressed, an international auxiliary language, was during the now past [[VolapÃ¼k]] period, and is still in the present [[Esperanto]] movement, so much in the hands of Utopians, fanatics and enthusiasts, that it is difficult to form an unbiased opinion concerning it, although a good idea lies at its basis. (1910, p. v). &lt;!-- this seems like an inept translation of the original text, but I don't have the original text available to do a better xltn --&gt;

[[Leopold Pfaundler]] wrote that an IAL was needed for more effective communication among scientists:

:All who are occupied with the reading or writing of scientific literature have assuredly very often felt the want of a common scientific language, and regretted the great loss of time and trouble caused by the multiplicity of languages employed in scientific literature.

For Couturat et al., Volapukists and Esperantists confounded the linguistic aspect of the question with many side issues, and they considered this a main reason why discussion about the idea of an international auxiliary language has appeared unpractical.

Some contemporaries of Couturat, notably [[Edward Sapir]]&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, Edward (1931). "The function of an international auxiliary language". Romanic Review (11): 4â15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, Edward (1925). "Memorandum on the problem of an international auxiliary language". The Romanic Review (16): 244â256&lt;/ref&gt; saw the challenge of an auxiliary language not as much as that of identifying a descriptive linguistic answer (of grammar and vocabulary) to global communicative concerns, but rather as one of promoting the notion of a linguistic platform for lasting international understanding. Though interest among scholars, and linguists in particular, waned greatly throughout the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 2015. The choice of an auxiliary language for the world. Perspectives within the context of contemporary linguistics. Germany, GRIN Verlag. {{ISBN|9783668013483}} and {{ISBN|978-3668013483}}&lt;/ref&gt; such differences of approach persist today. Some scholars and interested laymen&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Robert and Antony Alexander. Lango, a fully democratic approach towards an international auxiliary language based on reformed English.  Isle of Man: n.p. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; make concrete language proposals. By contrast, Pei &lt;ref&gt;e.g. Pei, Mario. 1961. One Language for the World. New York: Devin-Adair.&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Meyjes, Gregory Paul P. (2006). "Language and World Order in BahÃ¡'Ã­ Perspective: a New Paradigm Revealed". In Omoniyi, T.; Fishman, J. A. Explorations in the Sociology of Language And Religion. Volume 20 of Discourse Approaches to Politics, Society, and Culture. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. pp. 26â41. {{ISBN|9789027227102}}.&lt;/ref&gt; place the broader societal issue first. Yet others argue in favor of a particular language while seeking to establish its social integration.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Fettes, Mark (1997). Esperanto and language policy: Exploring the issues. Journal of Language Problems and Language Planning 21, 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- need to flesh this section out more with notes on other scholarly works on auxlangs, e.g. Sapir, Louis Couturat and Leopold Leau's Histoire de la langue universelle (1903), Jesperson 1928, Mario Pei 1958, Andrew Large... --&gt;

==Writing systems==
Several IAL use the [[Latin script]], some of them like LFN also offer an alternative in the [[Cyrillic script]].

===Latin script===
The vast majority of IALs use the [[Latin script]]. Several sounds, e.g. /n/, /m/, /t/, /f/ are written with the same letter as in IPA.

Some consonant sounds found in several Latin-script IAL alphabets are not represented by an [[ISO 646]] letter in IPA. Three have a single letter in IPA, one has a widespread alternative taken from ISO 646:
* /Ê/ (U+0283, IPA 134)
* /Ê/ (U+0292, IPA 135)
* /É¡/ (U+0261, IPA 110, single storey g) = g (U+0067, double storey g)
Four are affricates, each represented in IPA by two letters and a combining marker. They are often written decomposed:
* /tÍ¡s/ = /ts/
* /tÍ¡Ê/ = /tÊ/; Note: Polish distinguishes between them
* /dÍ¡z/ = /dz/
* /dÍ¡Ê/ = /dÊ/

That means that two sounds that are one character in IPA and are not ISO 646, also have no common alternative in ISO 646: Ê, Ê.

==Classification==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Interlingua]] --&gt;

The following classification of auxiliary languages was developed by Pierre Janton in 1993:&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Janton, ''Esperanto: Language, Literature, and Community.'' Translated by Humphrey Tonkin et al.  State University of New York Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-7914-1254-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[A priori (languages)|''A priori'' languages]] are characterized by largely artificial [[morpheme]]s (not borrowed from natural languages), schematic [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], simple [[phonology]], [[grammar]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Some ''a priori'' languages are called [[philosophical language]]s, referring to their basis in philosophical ideas about thought and language. These include some of the earliest efforts at auxiliary language in the 17th century. Some more specific subcategories:
** [[Oligosynthetic language|Oligosynthetic]] or oligoisolating languages have no more than a few hundred [[morpheme]]s. Most of their vocabulary is made of [[compound word]]s or set phrases formed from these morphemes. [[Sona language (artificial)|Sona]] and [[Toki Pona]] are well known examples, although Toki Pona's word stock is mostly based on other languages and therefore not ''a priori''.
** Taxonomic languages form their words using a taxonomic hierarchy, with each phoneme of a word helping specify its position in a semantic hierarchy of some kind; for example, [[Solresol]] and [[Ro (language)|Ro]].
** [[Pasigraphy|Pasigraphies]] are purely written languages without a spoken form, or with a spoken form left at the discretion of the reader; many of the 17thâ18th century philosophical languages and auxlangs were pasigraphies.  This set historically tends to overlap with taxonomic languages, though there is no inherent reason a pasigraphy needs to be taxonomic.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
** [[Logical language]]s such as [[Lojban]] and its predecessor, [[Loglan]], aim to eliminate ambiguity. Both these examples, it should be noted, derive their morphemes from a broad range of natural languages using statistical methods.
* ''A posteriori'' languages are based on existing natural languages. Nearly all the auxiliary languages with fluent speakers are in this category.&lt;ref name="harlow2006"&gt;{{cite web |last= Harlow |first= Don |date= 7 January 2006 |title= Essay (hopefully long) |url= http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;P=13620 |work=AUXLANG mailing list  |location= |access-date= {{ date }} | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130523160549/http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0601a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;P=13620 | archivedate= 23 May 2013 | deadurl= yes| quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages borrow their vocabulary primarily or solely from European languages, and base their grammar more or less on European models. (Sometimes these European-based languages are referred to as "euroclones", although this term has negative connotations and is not used in the academic literature.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}) [[Interlingua]] was drawn originally from [[international scientific vocabulary]], in turn based primarily on Greek and Latin roots.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Glosa]] did likewise, with a stronger dependence of Greek roots. Although ''a posteriori'' languages have been based on most of the families of European languages, the most successful of these (notably [[Esperanto]],&lt;ref&gt;http://failuremag.com/feature/article/discouraging_words/&lt;/ref&gt; Ido and [[Interlingua]]) have been based largely on Romance elements.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
** Schematic (or "mixed") languages have some ''a priori'' qualities.  Some have ethnic [[morpheme]]s but alter them significantly to fit a simplified [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] pattern (e.g., [[VolapÃ¼k]], [[Toki Pona]]) or both artificial and natural [[morpheme]]s (e.g., [[Perio]]). Partly schematic languages have partly schematic and partly naturalistic derivation (e.g. [[Esperanto]] and Ido). Natural [[morpheme]]s of languages in this group are rarely altered greatly from their source-language form, but compound and derived words are generally not recognizable at sight by people familiar with the source languages.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
** Naturalistic languages resemble existing natural languages.  For example, [[Occidental language|Occidental]], [[Interlingua]], and [[Lingua Franca Nova]] were developed so that not only the root words but their compounds and derivations will often be recognizable immediately by large numbers of people. Some naturalistic languages do have a limited number of artificial morphemes or invented grammatical devices (e.g. [[Novial]]). (Note that the term "naturalistic" as used in auxiliary language scholarship{{Which|date=January 2013}} does not mean the same thing as the homophonous term used in describing [[artistic language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0908E&amp;L=CONLANG&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=5208 "Re: "Naturalistic" for auxlangers vs artlangers?"]  AUXLANG mailing list post by JÃ¶rg Rhiemeier, 30 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2013}})
** Simplified natural languages reduce the full extent of vocabulary and partially regularize the grammar of a natural language (e.g. [[Basic English]], [[Special English]] and [[Globish (Nerriere)|Globish]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Methods of propagation==

As has been pointed out, the issue of an international language is not so much which, but how.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Pei, ''One language for the world'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Several approaches exist toward the eventual full expansion and consolidation of an international auxiliary language.
# Laissez-faire. This approach is taken in the belief that one language will eventually and inevitably "win out" as a world auxiliary language (e.g. International English) without any need for specific action.
# Institutional sponsorship and grass-roots promotion of language programs. This approach has taken various forms, depending on the language and language type, ranging from government promotion of a particular language to one-on-one encouragement to learn the language to instructional or marketing programs.
# National legislation. This approach seeks to have individual countries (or even localities) progressively endorse a given language as an official language (or to promote the concept of international legislation).
# International legislation. This approach involves promotion of the future holding of a binding international convention (perhaps to be under the auspices of such international organizations as the [[United Nations]] or [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]) to formally agree upon an official international auxiliary language which would then be taught in all schools around the world, beginning at the primary level. This approach, an official principle of the [[Baha'i Faith]], seeks to put a combination of international opinion, linguistic expertise, and law behind a to-be-selected language and thus expand or consolidate it as a full official [[world language]], to be used in addition to local languages.&lt;ref&gt;See an edited compilation of excerpts from the BahÃ¡'Ã­ writings regarding the principle of International or Universal Auxiliary Language: The Greatest Instrument for Promoting Harmony and Civilization: Excerpts from the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Writings and Related Sources on the Question of an International Auxiliary Language. Gregory Paul Meyjes, ed. Oxford: George Ronald. 2015. {{ISBN|978-085398-591-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach could either give more credibility to a natural language already serving this purpose to a certain degree (e.g. if English were chosen) or to give a greatly enhanced chance for a constructed language to take root. For constructed languages particularly, this approach has been seen by various individuals in the IAL movement as holding the most promise of ensuring that promotion of studies in the language would not be met with skepticism at its practicality by its would-be learners.

==Pictorial languages==

There have been a number of proposals for using pictures, [[ideograms]], diagrams, and other pictorial representations for international communications. Examples range from the original [[Characteristica Universalis]] proposed by the philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], to suggestions for the adoption of [[Chinese writing]], to recent inventions such as [[Blissymbol]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Keisel Bliss, ''Semantography (Blissymbolics)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the scientific community, there is already considerable agreement in the form of the [[schematics]] used to represent [[circuit diagram|electronic circuits]], [[chemical symbols]], [[mathematical symbols]], and the [[Energy Systems Language]] of [[systems ecology]]. We can also see the international efforts at regularizing symbols used to regulate traffic, to indicate resources for tourists, and in maps. Some symbols have become nearly universal through their consistent use in computers and on the internet.

==Sign languages==

An international auxiliary sign language has been developed by [[deaf]] people who meet regularly at international forums such as sporting events or in political organisations. Previously referred to as [[Gestuno]]&lt;ref&gt;Rubino, F., Hayhurst, A., and Guejlman, J., ''Gestuno: International sign language of the deaf.''&lt;/ref&gt; but now more commonly known simply as '[[International Sign|international sign]]', the language has continued to develop since the first signs were standardised in 1973, and it is now in widespread use. International sign is distinct in many ways from spoken IALs; many signs are [[Iconicity|iconic]] and signers tend to insert these signs into the grammar of their own sign language, with an emphasis on visually intuitive gestures and mime. A simple sign language called [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] was used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

Gestuno is not to be confused with the separate and unrelated sign language [[Signuno]], which is essentially a Signed Exact Esperanto. Signuno is not in any significant use, and is based on the Esperanto community rather than based on the international Deaf community.

==Criticism==

There has been considerable criticism of international auxiliary languages, both in terms of individual proposals, types of proposals, and in more general terms.

Criticisms directed against Esperanto and other early auxiliary languages in the late 19th century included the idea that different races have sufficiently different speech organs that an international language might work locally in Europe, but hardly worldwide, and the prediction that if adopted, such an auxlang would rapidly break up into local dialects.&lt;ref name="zamenhof1900"&gt;"Esenco kaj Estonteco de la Ideo de Lingvo Internacia", L. L. Zamenhof, 1900.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', 1992 [1903].&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in linguistics have done away with the first of these, and the limited but significant use of Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua on an international scale, without breakup into unintelligible dialects, has shown that either a rapid break-up into dialects shall not happen too soon in the future, or that there is enough constant 'standardisation' to reduce the diversity of the language. Subsequently, much criticism has been focused either on the artificiality of these auxlangs,&lt;ref name="piron1994"/&gt; or on the argumentativeness of auxlang proponents and their failure to agree on one auxlang, or even on objective criteria by which to judge auxlangs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html "Farewell to auxiliary languages"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716230133/http://www.rickharrison.com/language/farewell.html |date=2012-07-16 }}, by Richard K. Harrison. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, probably the most common criticism is that a constructed auxlang is unnecessary because natural languages such as English are already in wide use as auxlangs and work well enough for that purpose.

One criticism already prevalent in the late 19th century, and still sometimes heard today, is that an international language might hasten the [[Language death|extinction]] of minority languages. One response has been that, even if this happens, the benefits would outweigh the costs;.&lt;ref name="zamenhof1900"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oslak2005"&gt;"Äu Zamenhof Pravis?", Vinko OÅ¡lak, ''Fonto'', februaro 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Another response has been that proponents of auxlangs, particularly in the Esperanto movement, are often thought to also be proponents of measures to conserve and promote minority languages{{why|date=May 2013}} and cultures. Based on Baha'i writ, Meyjes (2006) sees an International Auxiliary Language intended to be implemented in ways that shield native tongues from undue pressures from any traditional lingua franca, while enabling inter-community communication worldwide &lt;ref&gt;Also see "universalization" in Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul. 1999. Language and Universalization: An Ecolinguistic Reading of BahÃ¡âÃ­ writ. The Journal of BahÃ¡âÃ­ Studies, 9 (1): 51- 63. Toronto: Association for BahÃ¡âÃ­ Studies (Canada); in German: 2003. Sprache und Universalisierung: "SprachÃ¶kologie" im BahÃ¡'Ã­ Schrifttum. Schriftenreihe des Gesellschaft fÃ¼r BahÃ¡'Ã­ Studien. Vol. 7. Hofheim (Ts.): BahÃ¡âÃ­ Verlag. 129-146&lt;/ref&gt;

Although referred to as ''international'' languages, most of these languages have historically been constructed on the basis of [[Western European]] languages.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was common for VolapÃ¼k and Esperanto, and to some extent Ido, to be criticized for not being Western European enough; Occidental and Interlingua were (among other things) responses to this kind of criticism. More recently all these major auxlangs have been criticized for being too European and not global enough.&lt;ref name="kupsala2005"&gt;[http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0512A&amp;L=AUXLANG&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=2560 "Types of neutrality, and central concerns for an IAL"].  AUXLANG mailing list post by Risto Kupsala, 2 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  One response to this criticism has been that doing otherwise in no way makes the language easier for anyone, while drawing away from the sources of much international vocabulary, technical and popular.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gode, quoted by Mario Pei in ''One language for the world'' (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another response, primarily from Esperanto speakers, is that the internationality of a language has more to do with the culture of its speakers than with its linguistic properties. Esperanto itself uses individual words from Indo-European languages, but its grammar is much more similar to Chinese and Greek, (while being flexible enough in grammar and sentence structure to be able to copy the word-order of Japanese, Indonesian and English all about as well as each other) so it's difficult to judge how much of an Indo-European language it even is.&lt;ref name="harlow2006"/&gt;  The term "Euroclone" was coined to refer to these languages in contrast to [[worldlang|"worldlangs"]] with global vocabulary sources; the term is sometimes applied only to self-proclaimed "naturalistic" auxlangs such as Occidental and Interlingua, sometimes to all auxlangs with primarily European vocabulary sources, regardless of their grammar, including Esperanto and Lingua Franca Nova.

The response to this argument was made by Alexander Gode&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, et al. ''Interlingua-English: a dictionary of the international language.'' Storm Publishers, New York, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; and reiterated by Mario Pei:&lt;ref&gt;Pei, Mario. ''One Language for the World.'' N.Y.: Devin-Adair, 1958:&lt;/ref&gt; A vocabulary selected from a broad variety of languages does not make the language any easier for speakers of any one language. Gode's example compares a paragraph in Interlingua with a paragraph with words from Chinese, Japanese, Malay, and other non-European languages. The first, he argues, should be understood by those familiar with the Romance languages, and not overly difficult for most English speakers:

:La sol dice: "io me appella sol. Io es multo brillante. Io me leva al est, e cuando io me leva, il es die. Io reguarda per tu fenestra con mi oculo brillante como le auro, e io te dice quando il es tempore a levar te. E io te dice: 'Pigro, leva te. Io non brilla a fin que tu resta al lecto a dormir, sed que tu lege e que tu te promena.'"

The second, in contrast, should not only be difficult for speakers of European languages, but Malay speakers likely will not understand the Chinese words, Chinese speakers will likely not understand the Japanese words, and Japanese speakers likely will not understand the Malay words:

:Mata-hari yu: "Wo-ti nama mata-hari. Wo taihen brillante. Wo leva wo a est, dan toki wo leva wo, ada hari. Wo miru per ni-ti fenestra sama wo-ti mata brillante como kin, dan wo yu ni toki ada tempo a levar ni. Dan wo yu ni: 'Sust, leva ni. Wo non brilla sam-rap ni tomaru a toko a nemuru, sed wo brilla sam-rap ni leva ni, dan que ni suru kam, ni yomu, dan ni aruku.'"

An ''a priori'' vocabulary such as that of [[Spokil]] or [[Kotava]], or a vocabulary constructed mathematically, such as that of [[Loglan]] or [[Lojban]], would likely be as comprehensible.

Gode argues, additionally, that the western languages are the unofficial languages of international science, medicine, and technology, and therefore an IAL based on them provides the best access to that literature. Nevertheless, it must be said that a more neutral vocabulary, perhaps even an ''a priori'' one, would be less offensive to some non-Europeans.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, many proposals for auxlangs based on global sources of vocabulary and grammar have been made, but most (like the majority of the European-based auxlangs of earlier decades) remain sketches too incomplete to be speakable, and of the more complete ones, few have gained any speakers.  More recently there has been a trend, on the AUXLANG mailing list and on the more recently founded [http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/worldlanglist/ worldlang mailing list], to greater collaboration between various proponents of a more globally based auxlang.

{{Fiqh |sexual}}

'''Islamic sexual jurisprudence''' concerns the Islamic laws of [[sexuality]] in [[Islam]], as largely predicated on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], the sayings of [[Muhammad]] (''[[hadith]]'') and the rulings of religious leaders' (''[[fatwa]]'') confining [[sexual activity]] to [[marriage|marital]] relationships [[Heterosexuality|between men and women]]. While most traditions discourage [[celibacy]], all encourage strict [[chastity]], [[modesty]] and [[privacy]] with regard to any relationships between [[gender]]s, holding forth that their [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] as perceived within Islam{{spaced ndash}}encompassing a swath of life broader than sexual activity{{spaced ndash}}is largely reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference and modesty outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects of Islam, such as interpretations of [[list of types of sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] and degrees of [[sex segregation and Islam|gender segregation]].

While prohibitions against [[extramarital sex]] are strong, sexual activity itself is not a taboo subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islam-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=301 | title=Sex education, teenage pregnancy, sex in Islam and marriage | publisher=/www.islam-usa.com | accessdate=13 June 2015 | author=Dr. Shahid Athar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|title=Sunnah of the Wedding Night|date=15 March 2008|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317145545/http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permissible sexual relationships are described in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] as great wells of love and closeness. Even after marriage, there are limitations: a man should not have intercourse during his wife's menstruation and afterbirth periods. He is also considered to be sinning when [[anal sex|penetrating anally]]. Islam itself is a [[natalist]] religion, therefore it encourages increasing procreation through marital sexual relationships. Actions and behaviours such as [[abortion]] (other than for medical risk to the pregnant woman) {{additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[homosexuality]] are also [[Haram|strictly forbidden]]; temporary [[contraceptive]] use is permitted for [[birth control]].

==Sex education==
===Adult===
Muslim men and women asked Muhammad about issues concerning sexual behavior, so as to know the teachings and rulings of their religion. Muslims could pose their questions either to Muhammad directly or to his wives.&lt;ref name=ii&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |website=www.islamicity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ii2&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Education in Islam |url=https://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/education.html |website=islamawareness.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] attributed to Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] states that the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] women in particular were not shy about asking questions regarding sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Book 3, Number 0649&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829)&lt;/ref&gt; and that responsibility includes protecting them from anything that may corrupt their morals. Early sex education for children is not recommended by Islamic scholars, as the knowledge contained in such curricula may be a negative influence on a young child's mind.&lt;ref name=iqa&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/138101 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He studies in a mixed school in a foreign country and is asking about attending "sex education" classes |website=islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/113970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]], young children should instead be taught Islamic rules involving covering the [[Intimate parts in Islam|âawrah]], controlling one's gaze, and asking permission before entering private spaces.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

Munajjid also suggested to separate the bed of children at the age of ten according to hadith:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;
{{quote|It was narrated from âAmr ibn Shuâayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: âInstruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds.â| Abu Dawood (495)}}

Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-âAzeemabaadi said:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

{{quote|Al-Mannaawi said in Fath al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaamiâ as-Sagheer: That is, separate your children in the beds in which they sleep when they reach the age of ten, as a precaution against provocation of desire, even in the case of sisters. At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Maâbood (2/115)}}

Munajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the âawrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

When puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on wudooâ and ghusl, paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age â around the age of three years â that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sisterâs clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brotherâs actions and characteristics.

# Teaching children that the âawrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;  
 
Finally he stated, âWith regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and âawrahs. It should be noted that what is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam."&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

==Circumcision==
{{See also|Khitan (circumcision)|Khafd}}
''Khitan'' or ''Khatna'' ({{lang-ar|Ø®ØªØ§Ù}}, {{lang-ar|Ø®ØªÙØ©}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]] carried out as a [[Islamic culture|cultural rite]] by Muslims and is considered a sign of belonging to the wider [[Islam]]ic community.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305204605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not it should be carried out after [[converting to Islam]] is debated among Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |title=Male circumcision - the Islamic View |publisher=www.convertingtoislam.com |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214054917/http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |archivedate=2013-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151507/http://islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archivedate=2010-12-27 |title=Is Circumcision obligatory after conversion? |publisher=Islamicinvitationcentre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |title=Considering Converting: Is it necessary to be circumcised? |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716152023/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |title=Circumcision for Converts |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180532/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, {{quote|"Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" |(reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]).}} 
So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith - Book of Dress - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916095339/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted, {{quote|"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (ØµÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙ Ø¹ÙÙÙ Ù Ø³ÙÙ)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018144335/http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather [[Abdul-Muttalib]] circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074142/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah. (n.d.): 54-5&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his early disciples were circumcised to symbolize their inclusion within the emerging Islamic community.&lt;ref name="source"&gt;source?&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst ''[[Ulema]]'' (Muslim legal scholars), there are differing opinions about the compulsion of circumcision in ''[[Sharia]]'' (Islamic law). [[Imam]]s [[AbÅ« á¸¤anÄ«fa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''ânot obligatory but highly recommended.

== Puberty ==
{{See also|Islamic theological jurisprudence|Islam and children}}

''BÄligh'' or ''bulÅ«gh'' ({{lang-ar|Ø¨Ø§ÙØº or Ø¨ÙÙÙØº}}) refers to a person who has reached [[adulthood|maturity]] or [[puberty]], and has full responsibility under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

For example, in issues pertaining to [[Marriage in Islam|marriage]], ''baligh'' is related to the [[Arabic]] legal expression, ''hatta tutiqa'l-rijal'', which means that a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. In comparison, ''baligh'' or ''balaghat'' concerns the reaching of [[sexual maturity]] which becomes manifest by the [[menses]]. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called ''rushd'', or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her [[bridewealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Masud, ''Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas'', [[Harvard University]] Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

A boy may reach maturity from the age of 10 lunar years (nine years, eight months and twenty days) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a boy include: wet dreams and ejaculation. A girl may reach maturity from the age of 9 lunar years (approximately eight years and eight months) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a girl: menstruation, wet dream or pregnancy.

==Conservatism==
{{see also|Awrah|Mahram|Islam and clothing}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of conservatism, decency and [[modesty]]; besides the lawful sexuality, priority is given to modesty and chastity both inside and outside the marital relationships. In the [[hadith|hadith literature]], modesty has been described as "a part of faith.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150729011802/http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | archivedate=29 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Once Allah's Messenger (ï·º) passed by an Ansari (man) who was admonishing to his brother regarding Haya'. On that Allah's Messenger (ï·º) said, "Leave him as Haya'(self-respect, modesty, bashfulness) is a part of faith."|Sahih Bukhari: 24}}

Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. [[Islam and clothing|Dress-code]] is part of that overall teaching.&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | title=Marital privacy in Islam | accessdate=1 December 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208211244/http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | accessdate=27 November 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044332/http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quran, the subjects deal with modesty and privacy of men and women has been mostly described in [[An-Nur]]. For example, it has been mentioned,

{{quotation|"Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. And say to the believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not display their adornment except what appears thereof. -- And let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. And they should not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their -- right hands possess, or guileless male servants, or the children who know not women's nakedness. And let them not strike their feet so that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste, until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace."|[[An-Nur]] 24:30-33}}

{{quotation|"O you who believe, let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it is no sin for you nor for them -- some of you go round about (waiting) upon others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And when the children among you attain to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And (as for) women past childbearing, who hope not for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the lame, nor blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses; or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or (houses) whereof you possess the keys, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed (and) goodly. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may understand."|[[An-Nur]] 24:58-61}}

Hadith also describes the laws of modesty. Along with Quran it has also emphasized marriage as a requirement for modesty and chastity. For example,

{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Masud, the prophet said, "O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, as it lower the eyesight and guard his modesty and whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for that will be a shield for him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|7|62|4}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|4778}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1400}}}}

It has been mentioned in [[Hadith]] ranging about men's and women's [[Intimate parts in Islam|private parts]] that,
Regarding women follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asmaâ, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." Abu Dawud&lt;ref&gt;http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to cover their faces." Sahih Bukhari (60:282)&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;https://www.sahih-bukhari.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding men follows:
{{quotation|Narrated by Muawiah ibn Haydah, " I said : Apostle of Allah, from whom should we conceal our private parts and to whom can we show? He replied : conceal your private parts except from your wife and from whom your right hand possesses (concubines). I then asked: Apostle of Allah, (what should we do), if the people are assembled together? He replied: If it is within your power then no one will look at it, then you should try that no one can look it. I then asked: Apostle of Allah, if one of us is alone? He replied: Allah is more entitled than people that bashfulness should be shown to him (feel shy more to Allah than to people)."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4006}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated Jarhad: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) sat with us and my thigh was uncovered. He said: Do you not know that thigh is a private part.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4003}}}}

{{quotation|The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not uncover you thigh, and do not look at the thigh of the living and the dead.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4004}}}}

It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. Quran says,&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;
{{quotation|So the good women are obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded.|[[An-Nisa]] 4:34}}

Would any woman tell others what she did with her husband?â The people kept quiet and did not answer. I [Asmaaâ] said: âYes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, they (women) do that, and they (men) do that.â He said, âDo not do that.

A man got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ï·º)! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife wants to perform Hajj."

{{quotation|Narrated by Abu Said Khudri: The prophet said, "A man should not look at the private part of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman.

{{quotation|The Messenger of Allah said: "Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds."|Narrated by Abu Dawood (495)}}

There is also prescription of modesty and privacy in case of unlawful sexual acts. It is mentioned in the hadith below from [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]:

{{quotation|Malik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed to fornication in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for a whip, and he was brought a broken whip. He said, "Above this," and he was brought a new whip whose knots had not been cut yet. He said, "Below this," and he was brought a whip which had been used and made flexible. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and he was flogged. Then he said, "People! The time has come for you to observe the limits of Allah. Whoever has had any of these ugly things befall him should cover them up with the veil of Allah. Whoever reveals to us his wrong action, we perform what is in the Book of Allah against him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muwatta|41|2|12}}}}

Some hadith warn against immodesty including as follows,
{{quotation|"The Messenger of Allah said: â ...

==Marriage==
{{main|Marriage in Islam}}

Marriage (Nikah) is a contract between Muslim men and his wife. Marriage has been described in tradition (hadith) as half of the religion with the regards of preserving chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage half of faith? |url=https://eshaykh.com/hadith/general-2/ |website=eshaykh.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is marriage half of religion? - islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/11586 |website=isamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex within marriage ==
{{further|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

In Islamic law, marriage legalizes sexual intercourse between the husband and wife. Marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship nor is it only for procreation. Marriage is greatly encouraged in Islam, partially because it provides a lawful institution in which to fulfill one's sexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | title=Etiquette of intimate relations | publisher=islamqa.info | work=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204418/http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | title=Sex &amp; Marriage in Islam | publisher=zawaj.com | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710223229/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | archivedate=10 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=Al-Islam.org | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205547/http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does provide extensive rules regarding sex; however, within the conditional institution of marriage, there are sources in both the Qur'an and hadith, which promote the well being of humans and their natural sexual instincts. In the Surah Baqarah, sex in married life is openly recommended: {{quote|"When they [i.e. wives] have cleansed themselves [after menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded."|(2:222)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |title=Importance of Marriage in Islam |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504205154/http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also said: {{quote|"Those who guard their chastity (ie. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame."|[al-Muâminoon 23:5-6]}} Additionally, sources of hadith illustrate similar promotion of fulfilling sexual urges in lawful ways within a marriage. The Wasaelush Shia quotes Muhammad as encouraging his followers to marry, saying: {{quote|"O, you young men! I recommend marriage to you."|The Wasaelush Shia (vol. 14, p.&amp;nbsp;25)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |last=S.H.

Prophet Muhammad also declared marital sex as charity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Having intercourse (with one's wife) is a charity. |url=https://salaficentre.com/2014/05/having-intercourse-with-ones-wife-is-a-charity/ |website=The Salafi Centre of Manchester |accessdate=19 June 2018|date=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"When one of you have sex with your wife, it is a rewarded act of charity." The Companions were surprised and said, "But we do it purely out of our desire. How can it be counted as charity?" The Prophet replied, "If you had done it with a forbidden woman, it would have been counted as a sin, but if you do it in legitimacy, it is counted as charity.â|Muslim. Number 1674}}

=== Sexual techniques ===

One of the areas of Islamic sexual jurisprudence in which there are not many restrictions is the discussion of sexual techniques. Almost all of what is practiced under Islamic law concerning sexual techniques and the act of sexual intercourse come from 'hadith'', which are not restrictive in nature, but followed by a mutual etiquette known as foreplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning Sex Into Sadaqa An excerpt from 'The Muslim Marriage Guide.' |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/04/turning-sex-into-sadaqa.aspx |website=beliefnet.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kissing and Foreplay |url=https://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm |website=central-mosque.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE RULES OF NIKAH: BEDROOM ETIQUETTES IN ISLAM |url=http://www.authentictauheed.com/2011/07/112-bedroom-etiquettes-in-islam.html |website=authentictauheed.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the hadith follows:

{{quote|Imam al-Daylami records a narration on the authority of Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) is reported to have said:  "Not one of you should fulfil oneâs (sexual) need from/fall upon his wife like an animal; but let there first be a messenger between you." "And what is that messenger?" they asked, and he replied: "Kisses and words".â|Musnad al-Firdaws Of al-Daylami, 2/55}}

{{quote|Imam Ibn al-Qayyim reports from Jabir ibn Abd Allah in his famous âTibb al-Nabawiâ that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) forbade from engaging in sexual intercourse before foreplay.|al-Tibb al-Nabawi, 183}}
The main tendency within these ''hadith'' are saying for Muslims to follow in the bedroom, saying which "clearly show that the husband and the wife should feel completely free when they are engaged in mutual stimulation which is known as foreplay. These sayings recommend [[foreplay]] and put no real restrictions on the type of techniques used during foreplay or during intercourse.&lt;ref name="foreplay 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic bedroom fiqh|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|work=Hanafi fiqh|publisher=themodernreligion.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080707/http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay in Islam|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|work=Sex in Islam|publisher=Zawaj.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624135953/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|archivedate=24 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/826 | title=Masturbation between husband and wife | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708043554/http://islamqa.info/en/826 | archivedate=8 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foregoing verse the word harth (tilth) indicates that any kind of vaginal sex is permissible in Islam, because it is from this place children are produced; and it is also regardless any of sexual positions, because although top to bottom position has been encouraged most, but none of the vaginal sexual positions has been mentioned as prohibited in scripture and tradition.&lt;ref name=alis&gt;{{cite web |title=1.What are the positions and ways of having sex are legal in islam? |url=http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/3692 |website=islamhelpline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Techniques |url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-handbook-syed-athar-husayn-sh-rizvi/sexual-techniques |website=www.al-islam.org |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen lodged in the womb from which offspring comes is likened to the seeds that are planted in the ground, bringing vegetation. Both of them are substances from which something else is produced. Hence, conversely, one area of sexual techniques that is generally prohibited is [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=alis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=There is nothing in Islam to say that anal intercourse is permissible |url=https://islamqa.info/en/91968 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Ruling on Anal Sex |url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=669 |website=islamonline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad: {{quote|Do not have anal sex with women.|Reported by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah}}

{{quote|Muhammad also said, "Cursed he. ..who has sex with a woman through her back passage."|Ahmad}}

{{quote|Khuzaymah Ibn Thabit also reported that the Messenger of Allah said: "Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: Do not have sex with your wives in the anus."|Reported by Ahmad, 5/213}}

{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated: "The Messenger of Allah said: "Allah will not look at a man who has anal sex with his wife."|Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; At-Tirmidhi classified it as an authentic hadith, 1165}}

Further, it is reported that Muhammad referred to such an act as "minor sodomy". (Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasa'i)

{{quote|It is reported that `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab came one day to Muhammad and said, "O Messenger of Allah, I am ruined!" "What has ruined you?" asked the Prophet. He replied, "Last night I turned my wife over," meaning that he had had vaginal intercourse with her from the back. The Prophet did not say anything to him until the verse cited above was revealed. Then he told him, "[Make love with your wife] from the front or the back, but avoid the anus and intercourse during menstruation." (Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | title=Sex Technique | publisher=islamawareness.net | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721002113/http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | archivedate=21 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sexual obligations ===
In Islam, the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living. The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forego intercourse at four months, but according to some scholars, the view is that there is no time limit.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qudaamah, Malik, [[Al-Mughni]], 7/30, Al-Jassaas, Ahkaam al-Qurâaan, 1/374, Shaykh al-Islam, Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the scholars have said that, It is obligatory on women alike not to refuse their husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.&lt;ref&gt;al-Fataawa al-Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146, Kashf al-Qinaaâ, 5/189, [[Al-Muhalla]], 10/40, Kashf al-Qinaaâ, 5/189&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: "If a man calls his wife to his bed, and she refuses to come, the angels curse her until morning comes."|al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436.}}

But it is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | title=Her husband has strong desire; what should she do? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811224131/http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | archivedate=11 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procreation===
In Islamic jurisprudence, the primary purpose of sex between marriage is [[procreation]].&lt;ref name=jawaz2/&gt; Islam recognizes the strong sexual urge and desire for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Shahid Athar |title=Sex Education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. M.A. Rauf from his book 'Marriage in Islam'. In this excerpt, he discusses in great detail the advantages and possible disadvantages of marriage. Among the advantages that he discusses are procreation, fulfilment of the natural urge, companionship, comfort and relief to the soul, and so on. He also discusses the disadvantages and the types of burdens and risks involved with marriage. All of the advantages or benefits are in effect meant to be regarded as the secondary purpose of marriage which supplement its major aim or purpose, namely procreation. To beget children. This is the main purpose for marriage. The aim is to engender and preserve the human race. Four objectives are accomplished through procreation: - (i) to increase mankind (ii) Islam is propagated by increasing the number of followers of the prophet Muhammad (iii)parents will hope to leave behind children who will pray for them (iv) and According to Islamic belief, if a child dies before the parents, the prayers of the child in paradise will be very beneficial for the parents.&lt;ref name=jawaz2&gt;{{cite web |author1=Syed Mumtaz Ali &amp; Rabia Mills |title=Sex in Islam: Its Role and Purpose |url=https://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_mumtaz.html |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children born of the matrimonial union become legitimate and mutual rights of inheritance are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |authorlink1=Marriage and Family in Islam" by Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |title=Purpose and obligation of marriage life |url=https://www.soundvision.com/article/purpose-and-obligation-of-marriage-life |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam also supposts a [[natalism|pro-natalist]] view of procreation through many hadith.

{{quote| Maâqil ibn Yasaar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, âI have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?â He said, âNo.â Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: âMarry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.|Abu Dawood (2050)}}

This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet Muhammad will feel proud of his [[Ummah|followers]] before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children.&lt;ref name="IQA2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Fiqh of the family. arur 13492: Encouragement to have a lot of children |url=https://islamqa.info/en/13492 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=5 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- 'O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87) Narrated Abu Huraira: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."|Bukhari, 4705}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah said: "Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me. Get married, for I will boast of your great numbers before the nations. Whoever has the means, let him get married, and whoever does not, then he should fast for it will diminish his desire."|Ibn Majah 1846}}

{{quote|"The Messenger of Allah disapproved of Uthman bin Mazun's desire to remain celibate; if he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated."|Ibn Majah, 1848}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah forbade celibacy. Zaid bin Akhzam added: "And Qatadah recited: 'And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad ), and made for them wives and offspring.|Ibn Majah 1849}}

== Fornication and adultery ==
{{main|Zina}}

Just as Islamic law fosters sexual actions within a marriage or lawful concubinage with wholly owned female slaves, there is also judicial opinion concerning sexual relations outside of these institutions. These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.
{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers. Fornicator does not marry except a fornicatoress or polytheist women; and fornicatoress no one marry her except fornicator or polytheist man;and it is prohibited to believers. And those who accuse chaste women and then never bring four witness flog them eighty lashes; and do not accept their testimony for ever; they themselves are disobedient. Except those who repent after this and become good then God is forgiving and merciful. And those who accuse their wives and do not have witness except themselves then witness of each of them are four witnesses by God that he is of truthfuls. And fifth that curse of God be on him if he is of lier. And it can save her from punishment that she witnesses by God four times that he is of liers. And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}

Verse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="Suad 2007 531"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, one practice outside marriage that does exist within Islamic law is legal sexual relations between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns. [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which "Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''umm walad'' (mother of a child, concubine)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal sex (fornication) ===

Similar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.

Additionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation. Muhammad specifically restricts the injunction "to segregate the women" and "not go near them" in 2:222 to a prohibition against sexual relations with menstruating women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Pornography is considered haram and a clear sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|title=10 Reasons The Muslim Should Quit Watching Pornography|date=28 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104315/http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/166123|title=Her husband watches porn with the excuse of stress at work|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830004408/https://islamqa.info/en/166123|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states: 
{{quote|âTell the faithful men to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts ...Tell the faithful women to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts, and not to display their charms except what is apparent thereof and put their scarves over their bosoms...|(Quran, 24:30-31)}}

==Prostitution==
[[Prostitution]] is banned in Islam.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/5707|title=The difference between slaves and prostitutes|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510161236/https://islamqa.info/en/5707|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quran states,

{{quote|And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful..|{{cite quran|24|33|s=ns}}}}

Prostitution (trading sex for money) is haraam. If any does this then he shall be stoned to death. It was practiced by some Arabs during the 6th century. In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden on all grounds.

{{quote|Jabir reported that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl:
Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution . It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful" (xxiv. 33).|{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7180}},{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7181}},{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2304}}}}

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
{{quote|The Prophet said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.|{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2257}}}}

In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with the saying: {{quote|"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer".|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}}}

Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
{{quote|'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. "Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him." Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, "You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|62|58}}}}

However, [[sexual slavery]] as concubinage was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archivedate=21 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mutâah|fixed-term marriage]] â muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]] â which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because [[Ali bin Abu Talib]] said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. 
As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: 
{{quote|"On the day of khaibar, Allah's Apostle forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat."|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|527}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|86|91}}}}

Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage.

==Gender non-conforming people==
{{main|LGBT in Islam|Mukhannathun}}
[[Mukhannathun]] (ÙØ®ÙØ«ÙÙ "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular mukhannath) were men who acted in ways interpreted as feminine. As time went on, the ''mukhannathun'' were forced to be castrated. There has been significant mention of "mukhannathun" in ahadith and by scholars of Islam. The word refers to a person who behaves like a woman in gentleness, speech, appearance, movements and so on. The mukhannath or effeminate man is one who is obviously male, unlike the khuntha (intersex). Effeminate people are of two types.
(i)Those who are created that way (intersex); there is no sin on them.
(ii)Those who were not created that way; rather they choose to imitate women in their movements and speech. This is the type which is cursed in the [[hadith]]s.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage/&gt;
The following tradition speaks to the their behavior:
{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet cursed effeminate men; those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, "Turn them out of your houses." The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|774}}}}
[[Sex change operation]] means that healthy males or females suffering from no deformity, who are able to marry and [[reproduce]], choose to undergo elective surgery to transform themselves into the appearance of the opposite sex. This kind of surgery is prohibited by [[Islamic Law]] because it is altering Allahâs creation needlessly and in vanity. Allah relates that [[Satan]] says:{{quotation| âAnd I shall order them and they will alter Allahâs creation.â |[SÃ»rah al-NisÃ¢â:119]}} 
Muhammad also said regarding people "imitating" (i.e. transgender) the opposite sex:&lt;ref name=islamtoday/&gt;
{{quote|âAllah curses men who imitate women and women who imitate men.â|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|773}}}}

==Intersex==
{{see|Intersex people and religion#Islam}}
An [[intersex]] person may have [[sex characteristics]] or [[sex organ|organs]] that are not typically male or female. This person is called a ''Khunthaa'' in the books of Fiqh.&lt;ref name=Khuntha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|title=View on Transgender - IslamQA|date=9 May 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507020847/http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|archivedate=7 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Khunthaa:

1. A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him.

2. The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females.

3. When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this personâs condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands.&lt;ref name=Khuntha/&gt;

With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/114670|title=Ruling on marrying a man who is intersex or impotent, and the difference between them|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203522/https://islamqa.info/en/114670|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex medical interventions]] are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a personâs exterior, [[chromosomal]] make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allahâs creation or imitation of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=islamtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107021853/http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-07|title=Sex change operation - IslamToday - English|website=en.islamtoday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concubinage ==
{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}
{{See also|Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse}}

Concubinage was a relationship between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns; the term refers to the status of the female. If she gives birth to a child by her master, the slave becomes ''umm walad'' ("mother of child", "concubine"). The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her. [[Ibn al-Humam]] adds that the slave-owner must acknowledge the kinship of the child.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

"Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jÄriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word "''surriyya''" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression "[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people  to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | title=Al-Adab Al-Mufrad / Book-9 / Hadith-48 | publisher=quranx.com | accessdate=7 June 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062833/http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | archivedate=17 February 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Islamic jurisprudence sets limits on the master's right to sexual intercourse with his female slave. A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' ("mother of the child"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Surah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (female slaves), saying " Ø£ÙØ²ÙÙÙØ§Ø¬ÙÙÙÙÙ Ø£ÙÙÙ ÙÙØ§ ÙÙÙÙÙÙØªÙ Ø£ÙÙÙÙÙØ§ÙÙÙÙÙÙ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name="Brunschvig"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sikainga, Ahmad A. | title=Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-292-77694-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bloom, Jonathan |author2=Blair, Sheila | title=Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2002| isbn=0-300-09422-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"/&gt;

The history of slavery in Islamic states and of sexual relations with slaves, was the "responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran", according to Parwez,{{who|date=January 2017}} as quoted by Clarence-Smith.&lt;ref name=csp198&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=198â200|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611073330/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran&amp;ots=CmLKAHzroo&amp;sig=qkVj_OulU-TNieKvSJk6ybw8NUc#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Ali blamed the history of Islamic slavery in racist terms, states Clarence-Smith, stating that slave servitude and sexual abuse of captive slaves may have been because of degeneration of the Arabs from their admixing over time with "lower races such as Ethiopians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=199â201|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429200313/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-04-29|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape ==
{{main|Zina#Rape and zina|Rape in Islamic law}}
Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: "Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent".&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=Azman Mohd|title=Rape: A Problem of Crime Classification in Islamic Law|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=1 January 2010|volume=24|issue=4|pages=417â438|doi=10.1163/157302510X526724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic law, it is classified as ''[[hirabah]]'', i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an as ''[[fasad]]'' (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Some other branches of Islamic law consider it to be part of ''[[zina]]'', as a crime called "forced fornication" (''zina-bil-jabr''). In Sharia, rape is punishable by [[stoning]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/ tirmidhi/17 17:37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020025409/http://www.sunnah.com/ |date=2015-10-20 }}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|

Under Islam, sexual intercourse is regarded as a loving act within marriage and should only be by mutual consent.{{additional citation| date=January 2017}} There is, however, no explicit concept of rape within marriage in Sharia; a wife is deemed to have accepted conjugal relations as part of the marriage contract. She can only refuse on grounds which are specified as prohibited for sexual intercourse such as when she is fasting, menstruating, undergoing [[Postpartum period|post-natal puerperal discharge]], or whilst on [[Hajj]] or [[Umrah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called "rape" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (''zinÄÊ¾'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |title= The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Law |last=Kassam |first=Zayn |date= |website= |publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113724/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |accessdate= 3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic definition of rape as "coercive ''zinÄÊ¾''" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to ''zinÄÊ¾''{{spaced ndash}}its definition, punishment and establishment through evidence{{spaced ndash}}were also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of ''zinÄÊ¾'' was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; Sane adult male and female convicted of ''zinÄÊ¾'' were to receive a fixed corporal punishment (''á¸¥add''):

* One hundred lashes and exile for one year for unmarried free persons;
* Stoning to death for married or previously married free persons;

''ZinÄÊ¾'' was established, according to classical law, through confession by one or both parties as well as proof. A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zinÄÊ¾ punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the á¸¥add punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

What distinguished a prototypical act of zinÄÊ¾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being "coercive" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of "coercion" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zinÄÊ¾'' should receive the ''á¸¥add'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the á¸¥add punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zinÄÊ¾'' due to their reduced capacity.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

According to the MÄlikÄ«, á¸¤anbalÄ«, and ShÄfiÊ¾Ä« schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a "right of God" (''á¸¥aqq AllÄh''), provoking the ''á¸¥add'' punishment; and a violation against a "human" (interpersonal) right (''á¸¥aqq ÄdamÄ«''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''buá¸Ê¾''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in question {{spaced ndash}}that is, the amount of her dower (''á¹£adÄq'' or ''mahr''){{additional citation needed|date=January 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; As far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt;

== Restrictions on sexual intercourse ==

Sexual intercourse is prohibited:
* during menstruation;
* for forty days after childbirth ([[puerperium]]);
* during the daylight hours of the month of [[Ramadan]] (i.e. while fasting);
* on pilgrimage; while in the sanctuary (in Ahram) at Mecca, pilgrims are not allowed to have intercourse.

== Sodomy ==
{{main|Islamic view of anal sex}}

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a contemporary [[Sunni]] [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], states that [[sodomy]] is [[Haraam|prohibited]].  As the act is forbidden in the [[Islamic marriage contract]], a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it and may seek divorce if her husband persists or tries to force it on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |title=When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - Ø§Ø±Ø´ÙÙ Ø§Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act in itself, however, does not [[:wikt:nullify|nullify]] the marriage and the wife must seek divorce if she is to leave her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |title=Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - Ø§Ø±Ø´ÙÙ Ø§Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙÙÙØ§ÙÙ |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim scholars justify the prohibition on the basis of the Qur'anic verse 2:223, saying that it commands intercourse only in the vagina (i.e. potentially procreational intercourse). The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.

There are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.

Islamic law establishes two categories of legal, sexual relationships: between husband and wife, and between a man and his concubine. All other sexual relationships are considered ''zinÄÊ¾'' (fornication), including adultery and homosexuality, according to Islamic law and exegesis of the Qur'an. From the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, "joining") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, "rubbing"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zinÄÊ¾'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zinÄÊ¾'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;
Religious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an "abomination" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.&lt;ref name="Rowson"/&gt;

Currently, sodomy is punishable by death in a number of Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as in Nigeria's Sharia courts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

==Oral sex==

In Islam, [[oral sex]] between a husband and wife is considered "Makruh Tahrimi"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask The Scholar: What is meant by makruh?|url=http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|work=Shaik Ahmad Kutty|publisher=Ahmad Kutty|accessdate=7 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120709204156/http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or highly undesirable by some Islamic jurists when the act is defined as mouth and tongue coming in contact with the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Sex in Islam|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|work=The Majlis|publisher=JamiatKZN, Central-Mosque.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=Vol. 6 No. 8|date=14 June 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614230937/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|archivedate=14 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moulana Ismail Desai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are partners allowed to lick each other's private parts?|url=http://www.askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|work=Mawlana Saeed Ahmed Golaub|publisher=Moulana Ismail  Desai|accessdate=9 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004191016/http://askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind considering this act as not recommended is manifold, the foremost being the issue of modesty, purification ([[Ritual purity in Islam|Taharat]]) and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions On Sexuality, Oral sex|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|work=Living Islam|publisher=GF Haddad|accessdate=7 July 2012|author=Hajj Gibril|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140054/http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purification and hygiene ==
{{main|Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence}}

After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] known as ''[[ghusl]]'' in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghusl'' requires clean, odorless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153249/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

== Fasting and Ramadan ==

{{quote|It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil).|{{cite quran|2|187|t=s|s=ns}}}}

According to Qura'nic verse 2:187, one may have sex during the month of Ramadan but not during the time of fasting. As such, sex during Ramadan is only permitted at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahmad |first=Anis |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236MIW/e0667 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113623/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236MIW/e0667 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this passage is explicitly addressed to men, the regulations on sex in regard to fasting are universally taken to apply equally to both male and female Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Menstruation ==

{{quote|And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is an illness; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.|{{cite quran|2|222|t=s|s=ns}}}}

Verse 2:222 in the Qur'an implies that sexual relations during menstruation are prohibited.

==Nocturnal emission==
{{main|Nocturnal emission#Islamic view}}
Nocturnal emission is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in [[Ramadan]] or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. They are still required to bathe prior to undergoing some rituals in the religion. Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as [[junub]]; meaning that a [[Muslim]] who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ''[[ghusl]]'', before they can read the [[Qur'an]] or perform the formal prayer known as [[salat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9208|title=Coping with wet dreams|publisher=www.islampqa.info|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104301/https://islamqa.info/en/9208|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous on the issue of masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Omar |first=Sara |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153420/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gender, and Social Change - Page 28, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, John L. Esposito - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four [[Sunni]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] (known as Madhaahib - the ''Hanafi'', ''Shafi'i'', ''Maliki'' and ''Hanbali'' schools of ''Fiqh'') have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the [[Hanafi]] and [[Hanbali]] Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is prohibited all the time according to the [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi`i]] Mazhabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp Marriage in Islam - Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127060711/http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp |date=2010-11-27 }} by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, Ph.D. Refer to: Section Al-`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships)&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[haram]] in [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name= "Shia"/&gt; There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Inhorn |first=Marcia |title=Masturbation, Semen Collection and Men's IVF Experiences: Anxieties in |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously agreed upon its complete prohibition. Jurists distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

== Contraception ==

The Qur'an does not contain explicit text regarding contraception. Muslims refer to the hadith on the question of contraception. According to Muslim scolars, birth control is permitted, when it is temporary and for a valid reason.&lt;ref name="amjaonline"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Hatem al-Haj |title=Fatwa-76792 -  Getting my tubes tied: female sterilization |url=http://www.amjaonline.org/fatwa-76792/info |website=www.amjaonline.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companions of Muhammad are cited when addressing this issue. For example, Jabir, one of Muhammad's companions, relates a hadith in which a man came to Muhammad and said {{Quote|"I have a slave girl, and we need her as a servant and around the palm groves. I have had sex with her, but I am afraid of her becoming pregnant." The Prophet responded, â³Practice [[coitus interruptus]] with her if you so wish, for she will receive what has been predestined for her.â³&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |jstor=2133308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As such, the withdrawal method of contraception is allowed according to the hadith. Muslim jurists concur with its permissibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use analogical deduction to approve other forms of contraception (e.g. [[condom]] usage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230901/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[Sunnah]] include:

{{Quote|A man said: "Apostle of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it. The Jews say that withdrawal method (Al-azl) is like burying the living girls on a small scale." He (the Prophet) said: "The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}}}

{{Quote|"O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?" The Prophet said, "Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}}}
===Sterilization===
It is not permitted to carry out operations on men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens ([[vasectomy]]) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb ([[hysterectomy]] or [[Tubal ligation|ligation]]) in women. Irreversible methods of contraception and birth control called [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] are not allowed for both male and female, except in the case of the wife who becomes terminally ill and perpetually incapable of having babies.&lt;ref name="Iqainfo-sterility"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on surgery that causes sterility |url=https://islamqa.info/en/2160 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=13 September 2018 |date=1998-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if the sterilization is irreversible and cannot be undone, it will not be permissible unless the woman is terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Yusuf Laher |title=Are Muslim women allowed to have sterilization? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/44911 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=IQS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal circumstances, sterilization is considered to be absolutely and decidedly prohibited in Shariâah. The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]] in his [[Ihyaâ Ulum al-Din]]. 
Furthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of oneâs body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shariâah. Allah Most High mentions in [[An-Nisa]] the words of [[Satan]], when he said:

{{Quote|âI will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.â|[[An-Nisa]]:119}}

However, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well-known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qurâan and Hadith states: {{Quote|âNecessities make prohibitions lawful.â| (Ibn Nujaym, Al-Ashbah wa al-Nazaâir 85)}}&lt;ref name="DI"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Muhammad ibn Adam |title=Permanent Contraception (Female Sterlisation) - Does Intention affect Permissibility? |url=http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |website=[[Darul Ifta]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=02-08-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: 
# â It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the motherâs life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. 
# â When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation. And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;It says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faaâiq (1/383).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Islamic Fiqh Council]] stated the following: 

{{Quote|It is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by shareeâah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate sharâi need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to shareeâah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy.|Islamic Fiqh Council, report no. 39 (1/5)}}

Based on this, if preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then there is nothing to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then sterilizing is prohibited.&lt;ref name="IQA3"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=She had injections to make her infertile â what is the ruling on that? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/47196 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2004-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iqs"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on having oneâs tubes tied or having a hysterectomy because pregnancy exhausts her and temporary methods of contraception do not work for h |url=https://islamqa.info/en/258382 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castration==
[[Castration]] is removal of the testicles. The Arabic word translated here as castration may also refer to removal of the testicles and penis. Some scholars differentiated between the two and said: If his testicles only are cut off, then he is a eunuch; if his penis is cut off, then he is emasculated. 
It is prohibited for a person to do that deliberately to himself or to someone else. Castration of the human is prohibited in Islam, whether he is a child or an adult, because of the prohibition on hadith on that.&lt;ref name="IQA.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Castration Permissible? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/mahmoodiyah/53845 |website=Islamqa.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said:
{{quote|it is prohibited, therefore it is haraam, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that in the case of the sons of Adam (i.e., humans).}} 
Among the reports that confirm this prohibition is the following prophet Muhammad's era, when some followers wanted to be castrated in abstance of their wives, but the prophet forbade it and permitted three days [[Nikah mut'ah|temporary marriage]] for them for a certain period, but after the period he declered it permanently forbidden: 

{{quote|Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported: We were on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had no women with us. We said: Should we not have ourselves castrated? He (the Holy Prophet) forbade us to do so He then granted us permission that we should contract temporary marriage for a stipulated period giving her a garment, and 'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87).|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 11, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1404}}}}

{{quote|Sabra al-Juhanni reported on the authority of his father that while he was with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hm) he said: 0 people, I had permitted you to contract temporary marriage with women, but Allah has forbidden it (now) until the Day of Resurrection. So he who has any (woman with this type of marriage contract) he should let her off, and do not take back anything you have given to then (as dower).|[[Sahih Muslim]]: Book 008, Number 3255}}

{{quote|According to the hadeeth of Saâd ibn Abi Waqqaas: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade âUthmaan ibn Mazâoon to be celibate. If he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated.|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 12, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1402}}}}

{{quote|It was narrated from Salamah bin Rawh bin Zinba', that : his grandfather came to the Prophet and he had castrated a slave of his. The Prophet manumitted the slave in compensation for having been mutilated.|[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/21 Ibn Majah, Vol. 3, Book 21, Hadith 2679]}}

{{quote|Narrated Qatadah: Samurah reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: Whoever kills his slave we shall kill him, and whoever cuts the nose of his slave we shall cut off his nose. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him.|[https://sunnah.com/abudawud/41 Sunan Abi Dawud 4516], [[Bulugh Al-Maram]]: [https://sunnah.com/bulugh/9Book 9, Hadith 120]}}

[[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said, commenting on these hadiths: 

The reason behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of struggle against the [[Kafir|disbelievers]]. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of non-muslims would have increased, and that is contrary to the religious purpose.&lt;ref name="IQAC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=126987: The ruling on castration |url=https://islamqa.info/en/126987 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vitro fertilization==
Regarding the response to [[In Vitro Fertilization]] (IVF) of [[Islam]], the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | last = Inhorn | first = MC | title = Making Muslim babies: IVF and gamete donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam | journal = Cult Med Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 427â50 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17051430 | pmc = 1705533 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624121701/http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | archivedate = 2009-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

== Abortion ==
{{main|Islam and abortion}}

Islamic schools of law have differing opinions on abortion, though it is prohibited or discouraged by most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abortion is allowed under certain circumstances, such as if the mother's health is [seriously] threatened. If the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life, Muslims universally agree that her life takes precedence over the life of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donna Lee |last=Bowen |chapter=Contemporary Muslim Ethics of Abortion |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists allow abortion in this context based on the principle that what is considered the greater evil{{spaced ndash}}the woman's death{{spaced ndash}}should be warded off by accepting the lesser evil of abortion. In these cases, the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar. Abortions of pregnancies that are merely unplanned or unwanted are generally ''haram'' (forbidden). The Qur'an forbids the abortion of a fetus for fear of poverty:

{{quote|...kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them|{{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}}}
{{quote|Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin.|{{cite quran|17|31|s=ns}}}}

Muslim views on abortion are also shaped by the [[Hadith]] as well as by the opinions of legal and religious scholars and commentators. In Islam, the fetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation,&lt;ref&gt;"''(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things...then the soul is breathed into him''"&lt;br&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion after that point is generally viewed as impermissible. Many Islamic thinkers recognize exceptions to this rule for certain circumstances; indeed, [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] notes that "the majority of Muslim scholars permit abortion, although they differ on the stage of fetal development beyond which it becomes prohibited."&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Where does God stand on abortion? |first=Tom |last=Ehrich |date=August 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627035106/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sherman Jackson]], "while abortion, even during the first trimester, is forbidden according to a minority of jurists, it is not held to be an offense for which there are criminal or even civil sanctions," so Muslims should not support legal restrictions on abortion rights unsupported by Islamic law, as opposed to solely moral activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherman A. |last=Jackson |chapter=Blackamerica, Immigrant Islam, and the Dominant Culture |title=Islam and the Blackamerican&lt;!-- Sic --&gt;: Looking Toward the Third Resurrection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |page=151 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426033404/https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= |isbn=9780195343571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslim scholars hold that the child of rape is a legitimate human being and therefore subject to the same laws of abortion (i.e. its abortion is permitted only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | title=Her foetus died after 66 days gestation and was miscarried after 100 days. Is her bleeding nifaas? | publisher=Islamqa.info | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724210816/http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some scholars disagree with this position. Some Muslim scholars{{who|date=October 2016}} also argue that abortion is permitted if the newborn might be sick in some way that would make its care exceptionally difficult for the parents (e.g. deformities, mental retardation, etc.).&lt;ref name="VRC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Vardit |last=Rispler-Chaim |chapter=The Right Not To Be Born: Abortion of the Disadvantaged Fetus in Contemporary Fatwas |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |pages=87â88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

'''Kabyle''' ({{lang-bg|ÐÐ°Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ðµ}}) is an ancient [[Thracian]] city near the modern city of [[Kabile]].  It is situated less than 10 km away from [[Yambol]], south-eastern [[Bulgaria]]. Kabyle used to be one of the most important centers of south-eastern [[Thrace]]. It was established around 2000 BC on the Zaychi Vrah Heights. It was proclaimed part of the [[100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria]]. The territory of the city and the surrounding area was proclaimed a territory of national importance in 1965 and converted to an archaeological reserve. The area of the reserve is around 65 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Many of the findings are housed in the onsite museum which also includes an exhibition tracking the excavation history of the site.

== History ==

In 341 BC Kabyle was conquered by the army of [[Philip II of Macedon]] and was later included in the Empire of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander of Macedon]]. In the 3rd century BC it was governed again by the [[Thracians]].

In 71 BC it became part of the [[Roman Empire]] after the city was conquered by the troops of Marcus Lucullus and after 45 BC it was included in the Roman province of [[Thracia (Roman province)|Thracia]]. The city was a major trade and military center between the 3rd and the 2nd century BC. Kabyle was one of the most important cities of Thrace following the reforms of Emperor [[Diocletian]] in 4th century.

In late 4th century Kabyle was seized by the [[Goths]]. It was finally destroyed by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and never settled again. During the Middle Ages there was a small settlement located in the territory of the [[Classical antiquity|ancient]] city.

'''Kidwelly Castle''' ({{lang-cy|Castell Cydweli}}) is a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] overlooking the [[River Gwendraeth]] and the town of [[Kidwelly]], [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Wales]]. 

==History and description==
[[File:Kidwelly Castle.jpeg|thumb|left|''Kidwelly Castle'', c. 1810.]]
The present remains of the castle include work from about 1114 to about 1476. Created as a defence against the Welsh, the castle fell to the Welsh several times in the twelfth century. Later in its history, it was unsuccessfully besieged by forces of [[Owain GlyndÅµr]] in 1403 with assistance from soldiers from [[France]] and [[Brittany]] who captured Kidwelly town. The castle was relieved by a Norman army after just three weeks. The gatehouse was extensively damaged and it was rebuilt on the instructions of [[King Henry V]]. It largely escaped involvement in the [[English Civil War]].

The plan of the castle consists of a square inner [[Ward (fortification)|bailey]] defended by four round towers, which overlook a semi-circular outer [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] on the landward side, with the massive [[gatehouse]] next to the river.  The river prevents this from being a truly [[concentric castle|concentric]] plan, however a jutting tower protects the riverside walls, and the final plan is very strong.

[[File:Kidwelly Castle plan.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Kidwelly Castle]]
The castle is relatively well-preserved, and is managed by [[Cadw]].

The surrounding countryside is reputedly haunted by the headless ghost of [[Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd]], wife of the Welsh prince [[Gruffydd ap Rhys]], who was beheaded in 1136.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ash |first=Russell |date=1973 |title=Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain |publisher=Reader's Digest Association Limited |page=387 |isbn=9780340165973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film==
Kidwelly was used as a location for the film ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', appearing in the very first scene after the titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail-1975|title=Monty Python and the Holy Grail Filming Locations|website=British Film Locations|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the first view of [[King Arthur]] and Patsy, a very misty establishing shot shows Kidwelly as their destination.  However, the following close up filming was done at [[Doune Castle]] in [[Scotland]].

'''Koliada''' or '''koleda''' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÑÐ´Ð°, ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°, ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð´Ð°, ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ðµ) is an [[Old World|ancient]] pre-Christian Slavic winter festival. It was later incorporated into [[Christmas]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages%5CK%5CO%5CKoliadaIT.htm Encyclopedia of Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word is still used in modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] ("ÐÐ¾Ð»ÑÐ´Ð°", KolyadÃ¡), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (''ÐÐ°Ð»ÑÐ´Ð°'', Kalada, Kalyada), [[Russian language|Russian]] (''ÐÐ¾Ð»ÑÐ´Ð°'', Kolyada), [[Polish language|Polish]] (Szczodre Gody ''kolÄda'' {{IPAc-pl|k|o|'|l|e|n|d|a}}), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (''ÐÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°, ÐÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ðµ'') [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] (''KalÄdos, KalÄda'') and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] (''koleda'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/a03.exe?name=sskj_testa&amp;expression=koleda&amp;hs=1 |title=Slovar slovenskega knjiÅ¾nega jezika |trans-title=Standard Slovene Dictionary |chapter=Koleda |year=2000 |publisher=Slovene Academy of Sciences and Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word used in [[Old Church Slavonic]] language (ÐÐ¾Ð»Ñ§Ð´Ð° - KolÄnda) sounds closest to the current Polish language pronunciation, as Polish is the only Slavic language which retains the nasal vowels of the Proto-Slavic language. One theory states that '''Koliada''' is the name of a cycle of winter rituals stemming from the ancient ''[[calends|calendae]]''.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Ukraine"/&gt;

Some claim it was named after Kolyada, the Slavic god of winter or Koliada, the goddess who brings up a new sun every day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellintime.fsnet.co.uk/Folklore_Section_Background.htm] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] (koliada), [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (koleda), [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] ''kÃ²lÃ£da'', [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ([[colindÄ]]) and [[Polish language|Polish]] (''kolÄda'' {{IPAc-pl|k|o|'|l|e|n|d|a}}, Old Polish ''kolenda''&lt;ref&gt;Biblioteka warszawska. 1858 s. 318, MateryaÅy antropologiczno-archeologiczne i etnograficzne 1826 s. 186&lt;/ref&gt;) the meaning has shifted from Christmas itself to denoting the tradition of strolling, singing, and having fun on [[Christmas Eve]], same in the Balkan Slavs. It specifically applies to children and teens who walk house to house greeting people, singing and sifting grain that denotes the best wishes and receiving candy and small money in return. The action is called '''kolyadovannya''' in Ukrainian and is now applied to similar Old [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic]] celebrations of other old significant holidays, such as ''[[Malanka|Generous Eve]]'' ({{lang-be|Ð¨ÑÐ¾Ð´ÑÑ Ð²ÐµÑÐ°Ñ}}, {{lang-ua|Ð©ÐµÐ´ÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð²ÐµÑiÑ}}) the evening before New Year's Day, as well as the celebration of the arrival of spring. Similarly in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], in the tradition of '''koleduvane''' (ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´ÑÐ²Ð°Ð½Ðµ) or '''koledarenje''' (ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÐµÐ´Ð°ÑÐµÑÐµ) around Christmas, groups of kids visiting houses, singing carols and receiving a gift at parting. The kids are called '[[koledari]]' or rarely 'kolezhdani' who sing [[kolyadka|kolyadki]] (songs).

Koleda is also celebrated across northern [[Greece]] by the [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia]], in areas from [[Florina]] to [[Thessaloniki]], where it is called '''Koleda''' (ÎÏÎ»Î¹Î½ÏÎ±, ÎÏÎ»Î¹Î±Î½ÏÎ±) or  '''Koleda Babo''' (ÎÏÎ»Î¹Î½ÏÎ± ÎÏÎ¬Î¼ÏÏ) which means "Koleda Grandmother" in Slavic. It is celebrated before Christmas by gathering in the village square and lighting a bonfire, followed by local [[Macedonian music]] and dancing.

Croatian composer [[Jakov Gotovac]] wrote in 1925 the composition "Koleda", which he called a "folk rite in five parts", for male choir and small orchestra (3 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[timpani]] and [[drum]]). There is also a [[Croatian kolo|dance]] from [[Dubrovnik]] called "The Dubrovnik Koleda."

{{Use American English|date=February 2018}}The '''Middle East Media Research Institute''' ('''MEMRI''') is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] press monitoring and analysis organization with headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] MEMRI publishes and distributes free English language translations of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Pashto, and Turkish media reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memri.org/ |title=MEMRI homepage |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117064933/http://www.memri.org/ |archivedate=2012-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MEMRI states that its goal is to "bridge the language gap between the Middle East and the West." It has been praised as an "invaluable" resource&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fathi|2010|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for helping to "shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears".&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt; Critics charge that despite portraying itself as neutral,&lt;ref name=Fathi1&gt;{{harvnb|Fathi|2010|p=202}}: "But what about using MEMRI what about the various accusations? There is no monolithic answer. As a translation service it is of great value. As a research tool the evaluation is more complex as it demands good background information in order to contextualize the information obtained due to the organization's lack of transparency and attempt to pose as something different than what they are. The problem is that many of the journalists, politicians and lay persons who use MEMRI cannot and will not do this. And this is where the main objection to MEMRI comes into play. It presents itself as an independent research institute but it acts as a tool geared toward shaping opinion by "producing an orient"âin the true sense of Edward Said's usageâand through this it has an increasing influence in shaping perceptions of the Middle East. MEMRI has understood that politics today is waged in the media and it fulfills its role as a public relations, lobbying and policy-making instrument with the highest professional standard."&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light through the production and dissemination of incomplete translations and by selectively translating views of extremists while deemphasizing or ignoring mainstream opinions.{{sfn|Fathi|2010|p=188-190}}

==History==
The institute was co-founded in 1998 by [[Yigal Carmon]], a former [[Israeli military intelligence]] officer and [[Meyrav Wurmser]], an [[Sabra (person)|Israeli-born]] [[Citizenship in the United States|American]] [[political scientist]].

==Objectives and projects==
The organization indirectly gained public prominence as a source of news and analysis about the Muslim world, following the September 11 attacks and the subsequent [[war on terrorism]] by the Bush administration. According to MEMRI, its translations and reports are distributed to "congresspersons, congressional staff, policy makers, journalists, academics, and interested parties". According to PRA, MEMRI's translated articles and its commentary are routinely cited in national media outlets in the United States, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', while analyses by MEMRI staff and officers are frequently published by right-wing and [[neoconservative]] media outlets such as ''[[National Review]]'', ''[[Fox News]]'', ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', and the ''[[Weekly Standard]]''. PRA writes that both critics and supporters of MEMRI note its increasing influence in shaping perceptions of the Middle East.&lt;ref name=PRAonMEMRI/&gt; It has maintained longstanding relations with law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;John Baron: [http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/israeli_web_site_debkacom_at_center_of_new_york_dirty_bomb_tip_20070817/ Israeli Web site Debka.com at center of New York âdirty bombâ tip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918012812/http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/israeli_web_site_debkacom_at_center_of_new_york_dirty_bomb_tip_20070817/ |date=2008-09-18 }} ''The Jewish Journal,'' August 16, 2007. Accessed March 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning this change in their 'mission statement,' [[Political Research Associates]] (PRA), which studies the US [[right-wing politics|political right]], notes that it occurred three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], and considers MEMRI "was previously more forthcoming about its political orientation in its self-description and in staff profiles on its website". PRA considers that "MEMRI's slogan, 'Bridging the Language Gap Between the Middle East and the West,' does not convey the institute's stridently pro-Israel and [[anti-Arab]] political bias." It further notes, that MEMRI's founders, Wurmser and Carmon, "are both hardline pro-Israel ideologues aligned with Israel's [[Likud]] party".&lt;ref name=PRAonMEMRI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute|title=Middle East Media Research Institute|author=|date=9 November 2011|work=Right Web - Institute for Policy Studies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805012017/http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Middle_East_Media_Research_Institute|archivedate=5 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmon, in a public letter to Juan Cole that included a threat with a lawsuit over his comments on MEMRI, stated that he has never been affiliated with Likud. Cole answered that he hadn't alleged that, but that MEMRI would campaign for Likud goals such as the rejection of the Oslo peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juancole.com/2004/11/intimidation-by-israeli-linked.html|title=Intimidation By Israeli Linked|author=|date=|work=Informed Comment|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502104324/http://www.juancole.com/2004/11/intimidation-by-israeli-linked.html|archivedate=2015-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Haaretz]]'' reported that Israeli intelligence agencies have reduced their monitoring the Palestinian media with MEMRI and [[Palestinian Media Watch]] now providing the Israeli government with coverage of "anti-Israel incitement" in social media, blogs and other online sources. The Prime Minister's Bureau has stated that before the government cites information provided by the two sources, the source of the material and its credibility is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/officials-israel-outsources-monitoring-of-palestinian-media-after-idf-lapse-1.410082 "Officials: Israel outsources monitoring of Palestinian media after IDF lapse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111173411/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/officials-israel-outsources-monitoring-of-palestinian-media-after-idf-lapse-1.410082 |date=2015-01-11 }} ''Haaretz'' February 02, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Projects ===
MEMRI's work is organized into projects, each with a specific focus. The main subjects the organization addresses are [[jihad]] and [[terrorism]]; relations between the U.S. and Middle East; pro-democracy and pro-civil rights views; inter-Arab relations; and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Impacting the collective global MEMRI |author=Greer Fay Cashman |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 April 2009 |quote="The main topics MEMRI deals with are: Jihad and Terrorism Studies; The US and the Middle East; Reforms in the Arab and Muslim World; Inter-Arab relations; Economic Studies; The Anti-Semitism Documentation Project and the Islamist Web sites Monitoring Project."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reform Project, according to MEMRI, focuses on monitoring, translating, and amplifying media from Muslim figures and movements with progressive viewpoints in the Arab and Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group exposing the drumbeat of Islamic State's propaganda machine |author=Rowan Scarborough |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/12/islamic-state-propaganda-machine-exposed-by-memri/ |work=The Washington Times |date=12 September 2016 |accessdate=26 October 2016 |quote="created its own self-titled "Reform Project" that features videos of Muslims preaching a moderate form of Islam."

==Reception==
The organization's translations are regularly quoted by major international newspapers, and its work has generated strong criticism and praise. Critics have accused MEMRI of producing inaccurate, unreliable translations with undue emphasis and selectivity in translating and disseminating the most extreme views from [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] media, which portray the Arab and [[Muslim world]] in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Other critics charge that while MEMRI does sometimes translate pro-US or pro-democracy voices in the regional media, it systematically leaves out intelligent criticism of Western-style democracy, US and Israeli policy and secularism.&lt;ref name=SelectiveMemri&gt;{{cite news |last=Whitaker |first=Brian |date=12 August 2002 |title=Selective Memri |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/12/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150601160259/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/12/worlddispatch.brianwhitaker |archivedate=1 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lalami&gt;{{Citation | first = Laila | last = Lalami | url = http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=20060619&amp;s=lalami | title = Missionary Position | newspaper = The Nation | date = 19 June 2006 | page = 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Leila Hudson 2005 p. 130"&gt;{{Citation | first = Leila | last = Hudson | title = The New Ivory Towers: Think Tanks, Strategic Studies and 'Counterrealism | journal = Middle East Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 4 |date=Winter 2005 | page = 130}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debate on CNN"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/29/i_qaa.01.html | title = Debate | publisher = CNN | format = transcript | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040801005125/http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/29/i_qaa.01.html | archivedate = 2004-08-01 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

MEMRI's work has been criticized on three grounds: that their work is biased; that they choose articles to translate selectively so as to give an unrepresentative view of the media they are reporting on; and that some of their translations are inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Debate&gt;{{cite news |date=January 28, 2003 |title=Email debate: Yigal Carmon and Brian Whitaker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/28/israel2 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=19 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721232016/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/28/israel2 |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEMRI has responded to the criticism, stating that their work is not biased; that they in fact choose representative articles from the Arab media that accurately reflect the opinions expressed, and that their translations are highly accurate.&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;

===Accusations of bias===
[[Brian Whitaker]], the Middle East editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper at the time, wrote in a public email debate with Carmon in 2003, that his problem with MEMRI was that it "poses as a research institute when it's basically a propaganda operation".&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt; Earlier, Whitaker had charged that MEMRI's role was to "further the political agenda of Israel." and that MEMRI's website does not mention Carmon's employment for Israeli intelligence, or Meyrav Wurmser's political stance, which he described as an "extreme brand of Zionism".&lt;ref name=SelectiveMemri/&gt; Carmon responded to this by stating that his employment history is not a secret and was not political, as he served under opposing administrations of the Israeli government and that perhaps the issue was that he was Israeli: "If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so." Carmon also questioned Whitaker's own biases, wondering if Whitaker's is biased in favor of Arabs â as his website on the Middle East is named "Al-Bab" ("The Gateway" in Arabic) â stating: "I wonder how you would judge an editor whose website was called "Ha-Sha-ar" ("The Gateway" in Hebrew)?&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] has described MEMRI as "a main arm of Israeli propaganda". In 2006, Finkelstein accused MEMRI of editing a television interview he gave in Lebanon in order to falsely impute that he was a Holocaust denier. In an interview with the newspaper ''[[Southern California InFocus|In Focus]]'' in 2007, he said MEMRI uses "the same sort of propaganda techniques as the Nazis" and "take[s] things out of context in order to do personal and political harm to people they don't like".&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;Lawrence Swaim, {{cite web|url=http://www.infocusnews.net/content/view/15069/135/ |title="MEMRI is 'propaganda machine' expert says" |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620163049/http://www.infocusnews.net/content/view/15069/135/ |archivedate=June 20, 2007 |df= }}, ''[[Southern California InFocus|InFocus]]'', June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selectivity====
Several critics have accused MEMRI of selectivity. They state that MEMRI consistently picks the most extreme views for translation and dissemination, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets.&lt;ref name= SelectiveMemri/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lalami"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Leila Hudson 2005 p. 130"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Debate on CNN"/&gt; [[Juan Cole]], a professor of Modern Middle East History at the University of Michigan, argues MEMRI has a tendency to "cleverly cherry-pick the vast Arabic press, which serves 300 million people, for the most extreme and objectionable articles and editorials â¦ On more than one occasion I have seen, say, a bigoted Arabic article translated by MEMRI and when I went to the source on the web, found that it was on the same op-ed page with other, moderate articles arguing for tolerance.

A report by [[Center for American Progress]], titled "Fear, Inc.: The Roots of the [[Islamophobia]] Network in America" lists MEMRI as promoting Islamophobic propaganda in the USA through supplying selective translations that are relied upon by several organisations "to make the case that Islam is inherently violent and promotes extremism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/08/pdf/islamophobia.pdf |title=Fear, Inc.

MEMRI argues that they are quoting the government-controlled press and not obscure or extremist publications, a fact their critics acknowledge, according to Marc Perelman: "When we quote ''[[Al-Ahram]]'' in Egypt, it is as if we were quoting ''[[The New York Times]]''. We know there are people questioning our work, probably those who have difficulties seeing the truth. But no one can show anything wrong about our translations."&lt;ref name=Perelman20011207/&gt;

In August 2013, the Islamic Da'wah Centre of South Australia questioned the "reliability, independence and veracity" of the Middle East Media Research Institute after it posted what the centre called a "sensational de-contextualised cut-and-paste video clip â¦ put together in a suggestive manner" of a sermon by the Sheikh Sharif Hussein on an American website. According to the two-minute video, which was a heavily condensed version of the Sheikh's 36-minute speech delivered in [[Adelaide]] on 22 March, Hussein called Australian and American soldiers "crusader pigs" and stated "O Allah, count the Buddhists and the Hindus one by one. O Allah, count them and kill them to the very last one." According to MEMRI's translation, he also described US President [[Barack Obama]] as an "enemy of Allah, you who kiss the shoes and feet of the Jews" and predicted that "The day will come when you are trampled upon by the pure feet of the Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3951.htm | title = Australian Sheik Sharif Hussein to Obama: Oh Enemy of Allah, You Will Be Trampled upon by Pure Muslim Feet | publisher = MEMRI TV | type = clip | number = 3951 | format = transcript | date = July 3, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004230052/http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/3951.htm | archivedate = October 4, 2013 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; MEMRI's rendition moved leading Liberal senator [[Cory Bernardi]] to write to the Police Commissioner charging that under Australia's [[Anti-terrorism legislation#Australia|anti-terrorism laws]], the video clip was "hate speech", and requesting that action be taken against Hussein. The South Australian Islamic Society and the Australian Buddhist Councils Federation also condemned Hussein's speech. Widespread calls from the public for the deportation of Hussein and his family followed news reports of the video. A police spokeswoman stated "Police will examine the entire content of the sermon to gain the full context and determine whether any crime has been committed." Hussein himself declined any comment on the contents of the video. However, the Da'wah Centre charged that by omitting the context of Hussein's statements, MEMRI had distorted the actual intent of the speech. While admitting that the Sheikh was emotional and used strong words, the Centre stated that the speech was delivered in relation to rape cases in Iraq, the birth defects due to use of [[depleted uranium]] and the [[2002 Gujarat violence#Attacks on Muslims|Burmese Buddhist massacre]]. This, the Centre claimed, was omitted from the edited MEMRI video.&lt;ref name=Penberthy&gt;{{cite news|last=Penberthy|first=David|title=Adelaide sheikh's words of hate are straight out of al-Qaida central|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/david-penberthy-adelaide-sheikh8217s-words-of-hate-are-straight-out-of-alqaida-central/story-fni6unxq-1226702151347|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=August 22, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824005907/http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/opinion/david-penberthy-adelaide-sheikh8217s-words-of-hate-are-straight-out-of-alqaida-central/story-fni6unxq-1226702151347|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=police&gt;{{cite news|title=SA Police investigating Islamic preacher's call for violence in online video|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-22/islamic-society-condemns-comments-of-adelaide-preacher/4904552|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=August 23, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831013554/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-22/islamic-society-condemns-comments-of-adelaide-preacher/4904552|archivedate=31 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schliebs&gt;{{cite news|last=Schliebs|first=Mark|title=Police examine 'hate speech'|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/police-examine-hate-speech/story-e6frg6nf-1226702443114|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=August 23, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826193518/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/police-examine-hate-speech/story-e6frg6nf-1226702443114|archivedate=26 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Craig|title=Islamic preacher Sheikh Sharif Hussein's call to kill all Hindus and Buddhists taken 'out of context'|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/islamic-preacher-sheikh-sharif-hussein8217s-call-to-kill-all-hindus-and-buddhists-taken-8216out-of-context8217/story-fni6uo1m-1226703754802|accessdate=29 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]|date=August 25, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828202911/http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/islamic-preacher-sheikh-sharif-hussein8217s-call-to-kill-all-hindus-and-buddhists-taken-8216out-of-context8217/story-fni6uo1m-1226703754802|archivedate=28 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDCSA&gt;{{cite news| title= Official Media Response| url= http://idcsa.com.au/| accessdate= 29 August 2013| newspaper= Islamic Da'wah Centre of South Australia| date= August 24, 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130831083249/http://idcsa.com.au/| archivedate= 31 August 2013| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alleged translation inaccuracy====
{{See also|Tomorrow's Pioneers#Translation controversy}}
MEMRI's translations are considered "usually accurate" though occasionally disputed and highly selective in what it chooses to translate and in which context it puts things,&lt;ref name="UnderFire"&gt;{{cite news|last= Whitaker|first= Brian|authorlink= Brian Whitaker|title= Arabic under fire|work= The Guardian|date= 15 May 2007|url= http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/brian_whitaker/2007/05/arabic_under_fire.html|accessdate= 2007-05-16|location= London|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517124655/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/brian_whitaker/2007/05/arabic_under_fire.html|archivedate= 17 May 2007|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the case of MEMRI's translation of a 2004 [[Osama bin Laden]] video, which MEMRI defended, which it said indicated that any individual US state that did not vote for President [[George W.

Following the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], [[Al Jazeera]] invited [[Hani al-Sibai|Hani al-Sebai]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] living in [[Great Britain|Britain]], to take part in a discussion on the event. Al-Sibai is listed as a Specially Designated National by the US Treasury Department because of alleged support for al-Qaida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/sdnlist.txt|title=Treasury.gov Page Moved|author=|date=|work=treasury.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018122656/http://www.treasury.gov/ofac/sdnlist.txt|archivedate=2015-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For one segment of the discussion in regard to the victims, MEMRI provided the following translation of al-Sebai's words:

{{Quote |The term "civilians" does not exist in Islamic religious law. Dr Karmi is sitting here, and I am sitting here, and I'm familiar with religious law. There is no such term as "civilians" in the modern Western sense. People are either at war or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1411.htm | title = Director of London's Al-Maqreze Centre for Historical Studies Hani Sibai: There are No 'Civilians' in Islamic Law; The Bombing is a Great Victory for Al-Qa'ida, Which 'Rubbed the Noses of the World's 8 Most Powerful Countries in the Mud' | publisher = MEMRI | newspaper = Special Dispatch | number = 932 | date = July 12, 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008105046/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1411.htm | archivedate = October 8, 2012 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Al-Sebai subsequently claimed that MEMRI had mistranslated his interview, and that among other errors, he had actually said:

{{Quote |1=There is no term in Islamic jurisprudence called "civilians". Dr Karmi is here sitting with us, and he's very familiar with the jurisprudence. There are fighters and non-fighters. Islam is against the killing of innocents. The innocent man cannot be killed according to Islam.&lt;ref name= MondeDiplomatique/&gt;}}

By leaving out the condemnation of the "killing of innocents" entirely, Mohammed El Oifi, writing in ''Le Monde diplomatique'', argued that this translation left the implication that civilians (the innocent) are considered a legitimate target.&lt;ref name= MondeDiplomatique/&gt; Several British newspapers subsequently used MEMRI's translation to run headlines such as "Islamic radical has praised the suicide bomb attacks on the capital"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article544974.ece | title = London-based radical salutes bombs 'victory' | first1 = Nick | last1 = Fielding | first2 = Dipesh | last2 = Gadher | newspaper = The Sunday Times | date = July 17, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; prompting al-Sebai to demand an apology and take legal action. In his view, MEMRI's translation was also "an incitement to have me arrested by the British authorities".&lt;ref name=Sebai&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.almaqreze.net/bayanat/artcl028.html | trans-title = Rebuttal of the lies and injustices that the Memri website and some of the British media spread about me | title = ÙØ±ÙØ² Ø§ÙÙÙØ±ÙØ²Ù ÙÙØ¯Ø±Ø§Ø³Ø§Øª Ø§ÙØªØ§Ø±ÙØ®ÙØ© | first = Hani | last = al-Sebai | publisher = Almaqreze | date = July 17, 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002041036/http://www.almaqreze.net/bayanat/artcl028.html | archivedate = October 2, 2011 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Halim Barakat]] described MEMRI as "a propaganda organization dedicated to representing Arabs and Muslims as anti-Semites".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Barakat claims an essay he wrote for the [[Al-Hayat]] Daily of [[London]] titled "The Wild Beast that Zionism Created: Self-Destruction", was mistranslated by MEMRI and retitled as "Jews Have Lost Their Humanity". Barakat further stated "Every time I wrote '[[Zionism]]', MEMRI replaced the word by '[[Jews|Jew]]' or '[[Judaism]]'.

In 2007, CNN correspondent Atika Shubert and Arabic translators accused MEMRI of mistranslating portions of a Palestinian children's television program:

{{Quote |1=Media watchdog MEMRI translates one caller as saying â quote â 'We will annihilate the Jews'," said Shubert. "But, according to several Arabic speakers used by CNN, the caller actually says 'The Jews are killing us.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48946 |title=PoliticsâUS: Pro-Israel Group's Money Trail Veers Hard Right |newspaper=IPS |date=2009-10-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024212617/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48946 |archivedate=2009-10-24 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Rosemary | last1 = Church | first2 = Jim | last2 = Clancy | first3 = Atika | last3 = Shubert | first4 = Ben | last4 = Wedeman | first5 = Neil | last5 = Connery | first6 = John | last6 = Vause | first7 = Eunice | last7 = Yoon | first8 = Becky | last8 = Anderson | first9 = Jill | last9 = Dougherty | title = Recruiting Next Generation of Militants: Mickey Mouse-Like Character Reaches Out to Palestinian Children | newspaper = Your World Today | publisher = CNN | format = transcript | date = 9 May 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

CNN's [[Glenn Beck]] later invited Yigal Carmon onto his program to comment on the alleged mistranslation. Carmon criticized the CNNs translators' understanding of Arabic, stating: "Even someone who doesn't know Arabic would listen to the tape and would hear the word 'Jews' is at the end, and also it means it is something to be done to the Jews, not by the Jews. And she [Octavia] insisted, no the word is in the beginning. I said: 'Octavia, you just don't get it. It is at the end.'" Carmon was referring to Arabic native speaker [[Octavia Nasr]], a Greek-orthodox Christian from Lebanon, who was later fired by CNN for a tweet praising late Ayatollah [[Hussein Fadlallah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/08/octavia-nasr-cnn-tweet-fired|title=Octavia Nasr fired by CNN over tweet praising late ayatollah|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=8 July 2010|website=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321190946/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/08/octavia-nasr-cnn-tweet-fired|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Whitaker]], a [[Middle East]] editor for the British ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper later pointed out that the word order in Arabic is not the same as in English: "the verb comes first and so a sentence in Arabic which literally says 'Are shooting at us the Jews' means 'The Jews are shooting at us.'"&lt;ref name="UnderFire" /&gt;

[[Naomi Sakr]], a professor of Media Policy at the [[University of Westminster]] has charged that specific MEMRI mistranslations, occurring during times of international tension, have generated hostility towards Arab journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first =Naomi | last = Sadr|title=Arab Television Today|publisher=[[I.B.

Brian Whitaker wrote in a blog for ''The Guardian'' newspaper that in the translation of the video, showing Farfour eliciting political comments from a young girl named Sanabel, the MEMRI transcript misrepresents the segment. Farfour asks Sanabel what she will do and, after a pause says "I'll shoot". MEMRI attributed the phrase said by Farfour, "I'll shoot", as the girl's reply while ignoring her actual reply of "I'm going to draw a picture".&lt;ref name="Guardian1"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/brian_whitaker/2007/05/arabic_under_fire.html | title = Arabic under fire | first = Brian | last = Whitaker | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2007-05-15 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017034224/http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/brian_whitaker/2007/05/arabic_under_fire.html | archivedate = 2007-10-17 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitaker and others commented that a statement uttered by the same child, "We're going to [or want to] resist", had been given an unduly aggressive interpretation by MEMRI as "We want to fight". Also, where MEMRI translated the girl as saying the highly controversial remark "We will annihilate the Jews", Whitaker and others, including [[Arabic]] speakers used by CNN, insist that, based on careful listening to the low quality [[video clip]], the girl is saying "Bitokhoona al-yahood", variously interpreted as "The Jews [will] shoot us"&lt;ref name="Guardian1"/&gt; or "The Jews are killing us."&lt;ref name="CNNtranscript"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/08/pzn.01.html | title = Paula Zahn Now | type = TV show transcript | newspaper = [[CNN]] | date = 2007-05-08 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070527051345/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/08/pzn.01.html | archivedate = 2007-05-27 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

MEMRI stands by their translation of the show, saying: "Yes, we stand by the translation by the very words, by the context, by the syntax, and every measure of the translation."&lt;ref name="CNNtranscript" /&gt;

In response to accusations of inaccuracies and distortion, Yigal Carmon, said:

{{Quote|As an institute of research, we want MEMRI to present translations to people who wish to be informed on the ideas circulating in the Middle East. We aim to reflect reality. If knowledge of this reality should benefit one side or another, then so be it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}}}

In an email debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI's November 2000 translation of an interview given by the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] to [[Al-Ahram]] al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: "How do you deal with the Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" which was translated as: "How do you feel about the Jews?" MEMRI cut out the first part of the reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made "Arabs look more anti-Semitic than they are".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies, as both questions referred to the same subject. Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake â¦ You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." Carmon also accused Whitaker of "using insults rather than evidence" in his criticism of MEMRI.&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;

Whitaker claims that although Memri's translations are usually accurate, they are selective and often out of context. He stated: "When errors do occur, it's difficult to attribute them to incompetence or accidental lapses â¦ there appears to be a political motive."&lt;ref name="UnderFire" /&gt;

====Response by MEMRI====
MEMRI responds to criticism by saying that the media had a tendency to whitewash statements of Arab leaders, and regularly defends its translations as being representative of actual ME viewpoints, even when the translations themselves are disputed: "MEMRI has never claimed to 'represent the view of the Arabic media', but rather to reflect, through our translations, general trends which are widespread and topical."&lt;ref name=Debate/&gt;

===Praise for MEMRI===
[[John Lloyd (journalist)|John Lloyd]] has defended MEMRI in the ''[[New Statesman]]'':

{{blockquote| One beneficial side effect of the focus on the Middle East is that we now have available much more information on the discourse of the Arab world. The most powerful medium for this is (naturally) a Washington-based think-tank, the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), started in 1998 by the former Israeli intelligence officer and Arabist Yigal Carmon. MEMRI aimed to bring the previously largely enclosed and unknown Arab talk about the west to western eyes and ears: it is a sobering experience to read on the internet MEMRI's vast store of translations from many media, and to note how much of what is written is conspiratorial, vicious and unyieldingly hateful. MEMRI and Carmon have been accused of selecting the worst of a diverse media: however, the sheer range of what is available weakens that criticism, as does support for the initiative by Arab liberals. The [[Iraq]]i exile [[Kanan Makiya]], for example, wrote in the spring 2002 issue of ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' that Arab intellectuals have allowed a mixture of victimhood and revenge to take hold of popular culture, with few if any dissenting voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Lloyd | url = http://www.newstatesman.com/200302030016 | title = Pay any price, bear any burden? | newspaper = New Statesman | date = 3 February 2003 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233249/http://www.newstatesman.com/200302030016 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Thomas L.

One of MEMRI's strongest supporters is [[Jay Nordlinger]], the managing editor of ''[[National Review]]'', who wrote in 2002:

{{blockquote|Wading or clicking through MEMRI's materials can be a depressing act, but it is also illusion-dispelling, and therefore constructive. This one institute is worth a hundred reality-twisting Middle Eastern Studies departments in the U.S. Furthermore, listening to Arabsâreading what they say in their newspapers, hearing what they say on televisionâis a way of taking them seriously: a way of not condescending to them, of admitting that they have useful things to tell us, one way or the other. Years ago, Solzhenitsyn exhorted, "Live not by lies." We might say, in these new circumstances, "Live not by ignorance about lies, either." Anyone still has the right to avert his eyes, of course. But no one can say that that is not a choice.&lt;ref name=nordlinger&gt;[[Jay Nordlinger]], [http://www.nationalreview.com/nordlinger/nordlinger200409132124.asp "Thanks for the MEMRI (.org)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219153519/http://www.nationalreview.com/nordlinger/nordlinger200409132124.asp |date=2005-12-19 }} ''[[National Review]]'' May 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nordlinger also wrote:

{{Quote |It seemed imperative to learn more about the Arabsâto learn, for example, what they were saying to one another, in their media, in their schools, and in their mosques, The Arab world had always been dark this way; it needed to come into the light.

In fact "invaluable" was written so often before MEMRI's name that one could have been forgiven for thinking the word was part of the name. MEMRI served as an antidote to darkness, as a way not to be ignorant.&lt;ref name=nordlinger /&gt;}}

According to Nordlinger, one of MEMRI's early notable successes was its exposure of Muhammad al-Gamei'a. Al-Gamei'a had served as head of the [[Islamic Cultural Center of New York]] and as [[Al-Azhar University]]'s representative to the United States and frequently participated in interreligious services. However, upon returning to Egypt in October 2001, Al-Gamei'a gave an interview to an Islamic website in which he stated, among other things, that Israel was responsible for 9/11 and that "If it became known to the American people, they would have done to the Jews what Hitler did!" and that "[the Jews] are riding on the back of the world powers."&lt;ref name= nordlinger /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.adl.org/911/ArabMedia_911.pdf | title = September 11 and Arab Media: The Anti-Jewish and Anti-American Blame Game | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | pages = 3â4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629031107/http://www.adl.org/911/ArabMedia_911.pdf | archivedate = 2011-06-29 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/5/17/the-nazi-slander-upon-being-released/ | title = The Nazi Slander | first = Duncan M | last = Currie | newspaper = The Harvard Crimson | date = May 17, 2002 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007213121/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/5/17/the-nazi-slander-upon-being-released/ | archivedate = October 7, 2012 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp465.htm | title = What can Israel do in the Global Disorder? | first = Manfred | last = Gerstenfeld | publisher = Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs | number = 465 | date = 1 November 2001 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806101452/http://www.jcpa.org/jl/vp465.htm | archivedate = 6 August 2011 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/533.htm | title = Terror in America (18): Al-Azhar University Representative in the US and Imam of New York's Islamic Center: The American Attack Against Afghanistan is Terrorism...

'''Penmanship''' is the technique of [[writing]] with the hand using a [[writing instrument]].  Today, this is most commonly done with a [[pen]], or [[pencil]], but throughout history has included many different [[writing implement|implements]].  The various generic and formal historical styles of writing are called "[[Hand (handwriting)|hands]]" while an individual's style of penmanship is referred to as "[[handwriting]]".

==History==

===Origins===
{{Details|History of writing}}

The earliest example of systematic writing is the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] pictographic system found on clay tablets, which eventually developed around 3200 BC into a modified version called [[cuneiform]]&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe. (2003) ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; which was impressed on wet clay with a sharpened reed.&lt;ref&gt;Tschichold, Jan. (1948) ''An Illustrated History of Writing and Lettering''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of writing eventually evolved into an ideographic system (where a sign represents an idea) and then to a syllabic system (where a sign represents a syllable).&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, Alfred J. (1977). ''A Book of Scripts''. London: Faber. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing around the same time, the Egyptian system of [[hieroglyphics]] also began as a pictographic script and evolved into a system of syllabic writing.  Two cursive scripts were eventually created, [[hieratic]], shortly after hieroglyphs were invented, and [[demotic (Egyptian)]] in the seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, Joe (2003). ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Scribes wrote these scripts usually on [[papyrus]], with ink on a reed pen.

The first known alphabetical system came from the [[Phoenicians]], who developed a vowel-less system of 22 letters around the eleventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew (2007). ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks eventually adapted the Phoenician alphabet around the eighth century BC.  Adding vowels to the alphabet, dropping some consonants and altering the order, the [[Ancient Greeks]] developed a script which included only what we know of as capital Greek letters.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L. (1977). ''Ancient Writing and Its Influence''. Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowercase letters of [[Classical Greek]] were a later invention of the [[Middle Ages]].  The Phoenician alphabet also influenced the [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] scripts, which follow a vowel-less system.  One Hebrew script was only used for religious literature and by a small community of Samaritans up until the sixth century BC.  Aramaic was the official script of the Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian empires and âSquare Hebrewâ (the script now used in Israel) developed from Aramaic around the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew (2007). ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handwriting based on Latin script ===
{{Details|Palaeography}}

The Romans in Southern Italy eventually adopted the Greek alphabet as modified by the [[Etruscans]] to develop Latin writing.&lt;ref name="Fairbank, Alfred J. 1977 pg 10"&gt;Fairbank, Alfred J. (1977). ''A Book of Scripts''. London: Faber. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the Greeks, the Romans employed stone, metal, clay, and papyrus as writing surfaces.  Handwriting styles which were used to produce manuscripts included square capitals, [[rustic capitals]], uncials, and half-uncials.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 118"&gt;Nickell, Joe (2003). ''Pen, Ink &amp; Evidence: A Study of Writing and Writing Materials for the Penman, Collector, and Document Detective''. New Castle: Oak Knoll Press. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Square capitals were employed for more-formal texts based on stone inscriptional letters, while rustic capitals freer, compressed, and efficient.&lt;ref name="Fairbank, Alfred J. 1977 pg 10"/&gt;   [[Uncials]] were rounded capitals ([[majuscules]]) that originally were developed by the Greeks in the third century BC, but became popular in Latin manuscripts by the fourth century AD.  Roman cursive or informal handwriting started out as a derivative of the capital letters, though the tendency to write quickly and efficiently made the letters less precise.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Half-uncials (minuscules) were lowercase letters, which eventually became the national hand of Ireland.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 118"/&gt; Other combinations of half-uncial and cursive handwriting developed throughout Europe, including Visigothic, and Merovingian.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the eighth century, [[Charlemagne]] decreed that all writings in his empire were to be written in a standard handwriting, which came to be known as [[Carolingian minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Handwriting |url= http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1592&amp;HistoryID=ab33&amp;gtrack=pthc |agency=Historyworld.net |date=2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alcuin of York]] was commissioned by Charlemagne to create this new handwriting, which he did in collaboration with other scribes and based on the tradition of other Roman handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carolingian minuscule was used to produce many of the manuscripts from monasteries until the eleventh century and most lower-case letters of today's European scripts derive from it.&lt;ref&gt;Fairbank, 1977, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic or black-letter script, evolved from Carolingian, became the dominant handwriting from the twelfth century until the Italian Renaissance (1400â1600 AD).  This script was not as clear as the Carolingian, but instead was narrower, darker, and denser.  Because of this, the dot above the ''i'' was added in order to differentiate it from the similar pen strokes of the ''n'', ''m'', and ''u''.  Also, the letter ''u'' was created as separate from the ''v'', which had previously been used for both sounds.&lt;ref name="vletter.com"&gt;http://www.vletter.com/handwriting.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of the reason for such compact handwriting was to save space, since [[parchment]] was expensive.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"&gt;{{cite book |author= Mary B. Woods, Michael Woods |title=Ancient Machine Technology: From Wheels to Forges |url=
https://books.google.com/books?id=a3hLQ6Ypo-AC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78 |pages=78 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gothic script, being the writing style of scribes in Germany when [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]] invented movable type, became the model for the first type face.  Another variation of Carolingian minuscule was created by the Italian humanists in the fifteenth century, called by them ''littera antiqua'' and now called [[humanist minuscule]].&lt;ref&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a combination of Roman capitals and the rounded version of Carolingian minuscule.  A cursive form eventually developed, and it became increasingly slanted due to the quickness with which it could be written.  This manuscript handwriting, called [[cursive humanistic]], became known as the typeface [[Italic type|Italic]] used throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L. (1977). ''Ancient Writing and Its Influence''. Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[intaglio printing|Copperplate engraving]] influenced handwriting as it allowed penmanship copybooks to be more widely printed.  Copybooks first appeared in Italy around the sixteenth century; the earliest writing manuals were published by [[Sigismondo Fanti]] and Ludovico degli Arrighi.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 131"&gt;Nickell, 2003, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other manuals were produced by Dutch and French writing masters later in the century, including Pierre Hamon.&lt;ref name="Nickell, Joe 2003 pg 131"/&gt;  However, copybooks only became commonplace in England with the invention of copperplate engraving.  Engraving could better produce the flourishes in handwritten script, which helped penmanship masters to produce beautiful examples for students.&lt;ref name="vletter.com"/&gt;  Some of these early penmanship manuals included those of [[Edward Cocker]], [[John Seddon (calligrapher)|John Seddon]], and John Ayer.  By the eighteenth century, schools were established to teach penmanship techniques from master penmen, especially in England and the United States.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"/&gt;  Penmanship became part of the curriculum in American schools by the early 1900s, rather than just reserved for specialty schools teaching adults penmanship as a professional skill.  Several different penmanship methods have been developed and published, including Spencerian,  Getty-Dubay, Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting, Icelandic (Italic), Zaner-Bloser, and DâNealian methods among others used in American education.&lt;ref name="handwrite.net"/&gt;

[[File:Semi-cursive style Calligraphy of Chinese poem by Mo Ruzhong.jpg|thumbnail|Example of semi-cursive style Chinese calligraphy]]

=== Handwriting based on Chinese script ===

Writing systems developed in East Asia include [[Chinese character|Chinese]] and [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] writing systems. Chinese characters represent whole morphemes rather than individual sounds, and consequently are visually far more complex than European scripts; in some cases their pictographic origins are still visible. The earliest form of Chinese was written on bones and shells (called [[Jiaguwen]]) in the fourteenth century BC.  Other writing surfaces used during this time included bronze, stone, jade, pottery, and clay, which became more popular after the twelfth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]. (1969). ''Written on Bamboo and Silk''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  Greater Seal script ([[Dazhuan]]) flourished during 1100 BC and 700 BC and appeared mainly in bronze vessels.&lt;ref name="ancientscripts.com"&gt;http://www.ancientscripts.com/chinese.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lesser Seal script ([[Xiaozhuan]]) is the precursor of modern complex Chinese script, which is more stylized than the Greater Seal.&lt;ref name="ancientscripts.com"/&gt;

Chinese handwriting is considered an art, more so than illuminated manuscripts in Western culture.  [[Calligraphy]] is widely practiced in China, which employs scripts such as [[Kaishu]] (standard), [[Xingshu]] (semi-cursive), and [[Caoshu]] (cursive).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) ''The Story of Writing''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese calligraphy is meant to represent the artistic personality in a way western calligraphy cannot, and therefore penmanship is valued higher than in any other nation.&lt;ref&gt;Tschichold, Jan. (1948) ''An Illustrated History of Writing and Lettering''. New York: Columbia University Press. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standard Script ([[Kaishu]]) is main traditional script used today.

Japanese writing evolved from Chinese script and Chinese characters, called [[kanji]], or ideograms, were adopted to represent Japanese words and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew.

[[File:Handwriting.png|thumbnail|'[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]', written by two different hands]]

[[Platt Rogers Spencer]] is known as the "Father of American Penmanship". His writing system was first published in 1848, in his book ''Spencer and Rice's System of Business and Ladies' Penmanship''. The most popular Spencerian manual was ''The Spencerian Key to Practical Penmanship'', published by his sons in 1866. This "[[Spencerian Script|Spencerian Method]]" Ornamental Style was taught in American schools until the mid-1920s, and has seen a resurgence in recent years through [[charter schools]] and [[home schooling]] using revised Spencerian books and methods produced by former [[IAMPETH]] president [[Michael Sull]] (born 1946).

George A. Gaskell (1845â1886), a student of Spencer, authored two popular books on penmanship, ''Gaskell's Complete Compendium of Elegant Writing'' and ''The Penman's Hand-Book'' (1883).  [[L. H. Hausam|Louis Henry Hausam]] published the "New Education in Penmanship" in 1908, called "the greatest work of the kind ever published."&lt;ref name="Hausam"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/h3/hausam_l_h.html|volume=Volume III|issue=Part 2|title=Kansas: a cyclopedia of state history, embracing events, institutions, industries, counties, cities, towns, prominent persons, etc.|publisher=Standard Pub.

Many copybooks were produced in North America at the start of the 20th century, mostly for Business Style penmanship (a simplified form of Ornamental Style).  These included those produced by [[Austin Norman Palmer|A. N. Palmer]], a student of Gaskell, who developed the [[Palmer Method]], as reflected in his ''Palmer's Guide to Business Writing'', published in 1894.  Also popular was Zaner-Bloser Script, introduced by [[Charles Paxton Zaner]] (15 February 1864&amp;nbsp;â 1 December 1918) and Elmer Ward Bloser (6 November 1865&amp;nbsp;â 1929) of the Zanerian [[Business College]]. The A. N. Palmer Company folded in the early 1980s.

Modern Styles include more than 200 published textbook curricula including: [[D'Nealian|D'Nealian Script]] (a derivative of the Palmer Method which uses a slanted, serifed manuscript form followed by an entirely joined and looped cursive), Modern Zaner-Bloser which accounts for the majority of handwriting textbook sales in the USA, A Beka, Schaffer, Peterson, Loops and Groups, McDougal, Steck Vaughn, and many others.

Italic Styles include Getty-Dubay (slightly slanted), Eager, Portland, Barchowsky, Queensland, etc.

Other copybook styles that are unique and do not fall into any previous categories are Smithhand, Handwriting without Tears, Ausgangsschrift, Bob Jones, etc. these may differ greatly from each other in a variety of ways.
The first made video for correcting messy handwriting especially for people with ADHD and or dysgraphia was " Anyone Can Improve Their Own Handwriting" by learning specialist Jason Mark Alster MS.c.

=== Schools in East Asia ===
[[File:KanjiPractice.jpg|thumbnail|A typical Kanji practice notebook of a 3rd grader]]

By the nineteenth century, attention was increasingly given to developing quality penmanship in Eastern schools.  Countries which had a writing system based on logographs and syllabaries placed particular emphasis on form and quality when learning.&lt;ref name="Gray, William S. 1961 pg 189"&gt;Gray, William S. (1961) âThe Teaching of Reading and Writingâ. Chicago: Scott, Foresman, and Company. p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  These countries, such as China and Japan, have pictophonetic characters which are difficult to learn.  Chinese children start by learning the most fundamental characters first and building to the more esoteric ones.  Often, children trace the different strokes in the air along with the teacher and eventually start to write them on paper.&lt;ref name="Gray, William S. 1961 pg 189"/&gt;

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, there have been more efforts to simplify these systems and standardize handwriting.  For example, in China in 1955, in order to respond to illiteracy among people, the government introduced a Romanized version of Chinese script, called Pinyin.&lt;ref name="Robinson, Andrew 2007 pg 196"&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) The Story of Writing. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;   However, by the 1960s, people rebelled against the infringement upon traditional Chinese by foreign influences.&lt;ref name="Robinson, Andrew 2007 pg 196"/&gt;   This writing reform did not help illiteracy among peasants.  Japanese also has simplified the Chinese characters it uses into scripts called kana.  However kanji are still used in preference over kana in many contexts, and a large part of children's schooling is learning kanji.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Andrew. (2007) The Story of Writing. London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, Japan has tried to hold on to handwriting as an art form while not compromising the more modern emphasis on speed and efficiency.  In the early 1940s, handwriting was taught twice, once as calligraphy in the art section of school curricula, and then again as a functional skill in the language section.&lt;ref name="Adal, Raja 2009 pg 244"&gt;Adal, Raja. (2009). "Japan's Bifurcated Modernity: Writing and Calligraphy in Japanese Public Schools 1872-1943." ''Theory Culture Society.'' 26:233-248. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  The practical function of penmanship in Japan did not start to be questioned until the end of the twentieth century; while typewriters proved more efficient than penmanship in the modern West, these technologies had a hard time transferring to Japan, since the thousands of characters involved in the language made typing unfeasible.&lt;ref name="Adal, Raja 2009 pg 244"/&gt;

== Motor control ==

Handwriting requires the [[motor coordination]] of multiple joints in the [[hand]], [[wrist]], [[elbow]], and [[shoulder]] to form letters and to arrange them on the page. Holding the pen and guiding  it across paper depends mostly upon sensory information from skin, joints and muscles of the hand and this adjusts  movement to changes in the friction between pen and paper.&lt;ref&gt;Lacquaniti F. (1989). Central representations of human limb movement as revealed by studies of drawing and handwriting. Trends Neurosci. 12(8):287-91. {{DOI|10.1016/0166-2236(89)90008-8}} {{PMID|2475946}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With practice and familiarity, handwriting becomes highly automated using motor programs stored in [[motor memory]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Plaats RE, van Galen GP. (1990).Effects of spatial and motor demands in handwriting. J Mot Behav. 22(3):361-85. {{PMID|15117665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other complex motor skills handwriting is far less dependent on a moment-to-moment visual guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt C, Gentz W, Mai N. (1999). Visual control of automated handwriting movements. Exp Brain Res. 128(1-2):224-8. {{PMID|10473764}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hepp-Reymond"&gt;Hepp-Reymond MC, Chakarov V, Schulte-MÃ¶nting J, Huethe F, Kristeva R. (2009).  Role of proprioception and vision in handwriting. Brain Res Bull. 79(6):365-70. {{PMID|19463909}} {{doi|10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.05.013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in individuals with complete [[Neuropathy|peripheral deafferentation]] with and without vision of their writing hand finds increase of number of pen touches, increase in number of inversions in velocity, decrease of mean stroke frequency and longer writing movement duration. The changes show that [[cutaneous]] and [[proprioceptive]] feedback play a critical role in updating the motor memories and [[internal model (motor control)|internal models]] that underlie handwriting. In contrast, sight provides only a secondary role in adjusting  motor commands.&lt;ref name="Hepp-Reymond"/&gt;

The '''Real Irish Republican Army''' or '''Real IRA''' ('''RIRA'''), also called the '''New IRA''' ('''NIRA''') since 2012,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/14/police-severe-terror-threat-ira-northern-ireland-bomb-attacks&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Dissident republican|dissident]] [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] [[paramilitary group]] and internationally-designated [[terrorist organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm|title=Foreign Terrorist Organizations|work=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to bring about a [[united Ireland]]. It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the RIRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919â1922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as "the Real Irish Republican Army" in English or ''[[Ãglaigh na hÃireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].

Since its formation, RIRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)âformerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)âand the [[British Army]]. The RIRA is the largest and most active of the "[[dissident republican]]" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]] since the Provisional IRA signed the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and/or disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the RIRA went on ceasefire, but began operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in [[Northern Ireland]] since 1997.

The Real IRA has also been involved in [[vigilante|vigilantism]], mainly against drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it has been accused of extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs. In July 2012 it was reported that [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA. This new entity was named the '''New IRA''' by the media, but members continue to identify themselves as simply "the Irish Republican Army".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thejournal.ie/republican-groups-form-new-ira-535041-Jul2012/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
In July 1997 the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] called a ceasefire. On 10 October 1997 a Provisional IRA General Army Convention was held in [[Falcarragh]], [[County Donegal]]. At the convention, [[IRA Quartermaster General|Provisional IRA Quartermaster General]] [[Michael McKevitt]]âalso a member of the 12-person Provisional IRA Executiveâdenounced the leadership and called for an end to the group's ceasefire and to its participation in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt]]. The two dissidents were outmanoeuvred by the leadership and were left isolated.&lt;ref name="Harnden"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harnden |first=Toby |authorlink=Toby Harnden |title=Bandit Country |publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] |year=1999 |pages=429â431 |isbn = 0-340-71736-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English"&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard English |title=Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA |publisher=[[Pan Books]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-330-49388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|296}} The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with other members.&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mooney |first1=John |last2=O'Toole |first2=Michael |title=Black Operations: The Secret War Against the Real IRA |publisher=Maverick House |year=2004 |isbn=0-9542945-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}}

In November 1997 McKevitt and other dissidents held a meeting in a farmhouse in [[Oldcastle, County Meath]], and a new organisation, styling itself ''Ãglaigh na hÃireann'', was formed.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|38â39}} The organisation attracted disaffected Provisional IRA members from [[Derry]] and the republican stronghold of South [[County Armagh|Armagh]], as well as [[Dublin]] and [[Belfast]] cities and Counties [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] and [[County Kerry|Kerry]].&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref name="Janes1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boyne |first=Sean |date=24 August 1998 |title=The Real IRA: after Omagh, what now? |url=http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir980824_1_n.shtml |dead-url=yes |journal=[[Jane's Intelligence Review]] |location=London |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025035213/http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jir/jir980824_1_n.shtml |archivedate=25 October 2007 |access-date=16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Real IRA" entered common usage when in early 1998 members set up a roadblock in [[Jonesborough, County Armagh]] and told motorists "We're from the IRA. The ''real'' IRA".&lt;ref name="Harnden"/&gt;

==Objectives==
The RIRA's objective is a [[united Ireland]] by forcing the end of British sovereignty over [[Northern Ireland]] through the [[Physical force Irish republicanism|use of physical force]]. The organisation rejects the [[Mitchell Principles]] and the [[Good Friday Agreement]], comparing the latter to the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] which resulted in the [[partition of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="RIRA"&gt;{{cite web |title='Real' Irish Republican Army (rIRA) Statement |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/rira280103.htm |publisher=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet|CAIN]] |date=28 January 2003 |accessdate=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of [[Irish republicanism]] and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.&lt;ref name="English" /&gt;{{rp|316â317}}

Bernadette Sands McKevitt, sister of hunger striker [[Bobby Sands]] and a founder of the RIRA's political wing, the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], said in an interview that her brother "did not die for cross-border bodies with executive powers. He did not die for nationalists to be equal British citizens within the Northern Ireland state".&lt;ref name="English" /&gt;{{rp|316â317}} The RIRA adopted a tactic of bombing town centres to damage the economic infrastructure of Northern Ireland. The organisation also attacks members of the security forces using [[land mine]]s, home-made [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[car bomb]]s, and has also targeted England using [[incendiary device]]s and car bombs to "spread terror and disruption".&lt;ref name="Janes1" /&gt;

==Campaign==
{{see also|Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions}}

===Early campaign===
The organization's first action was an attempted bombing in [[Banbridge]], [[County Down]] on 7 January 1998. The intention was to explode a {{convert|300|lb|adj=on}} [[car bomb]], but this was thwarted when the bomb was defused by security forces.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|68â71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police detonate car bomb in Ulster |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/45270.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=7 January 1998 |accessdate=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIRA continued its campaign in late February with bombings in [[Moira, County Down]] and [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]].&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eleven injured by Northern Ireland bomb |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/58729.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=21 February 1998 |accessdate=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Car bomb explodes in Portadown |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/59314.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 1998 |accessdate=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May the organisation announced its existence, in a coded telephone call to Belfast media claiming responsibility for a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] attack on a police station in [[Belleek, County Fermanagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='True' IRA claims responsibility for blast |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/90405.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 1998 |accessdate=8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RIRA member Ronan Mac Lochlainn, a native of County Dublin, was shot dead by GardaÃ­ during an attempted robbery of a security van in County Wicklow, Republic of Ireland.

The RIRA also carried out attacks in [[Newtownhamilton]] and [[Newry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Abstracts on Organisations â 'R' | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/rorgan.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second attack in Banbridge on 1 August injured 35 people and caused Â£3.5 million of damage when a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} car bomb exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Car Bomb Wounds 35 in Ulster Town |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E3D71E38F931A3575BC0A96E958260 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 August 1998 |accessdate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bomb warning in Banbridge |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/0213/banbridge.html |publisher=[[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann|RTÃ]] |date=13 February 1999 |accessdate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attacks the organisation lacked a significant base and was heavily infiltrated by informers. This led to a series of high-profile arrests and seizures by the [[Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na]] in the first half of 1998; these involved the death of RIRA member RÃ³nÃ¡n Mac Lochlainn who was shot dead trying to escape from police, following an attempted robbery of a [[Armored car (valuables)|security van]] in [[County Wicklow]].&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|70â71, 101â102, 124â129}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shot robber 'was republican paramilitary' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/87549.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=4 May 1998 |accessdate= 8 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omagh bombing===
{{main|Omagh bombing}}
On 15 August 1998 the RIRA left a car containing 500&amp;nbsp;lb of home-made explosives in the centre of [[Omagh]], [[County Tyrone]].

===Return to activity===
On 20 January 2000 the RIRA issued a call-to-arms in a statement to the ''[[Irish News]]''. The statement condemned the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and stated: "Once again, Ãglaigh na hÃireann declares the right of the Irish people to the ownership of Ireland.

On 16 May 2016 a 'terrorist hide' was found by civilians in Capanagh Forest near Larne, Antrim, possibly belonging to the dissident republicans.

In June 2016 it was revealed that a five-man IRA hit team were in Dublin's north inner city looking to murder two leading gangsters after one of their associates was shot dead in a gangland feud.

In Cork City at 5pm on 7 December 2016, former Chief of Staff of the RIRA southern command, Aidan "The Beast" O'Driscoll, was shot and killed in the street by two masked gunmen. O'Driscoll had been shot in the leg in June 2013 in what the RIRA claimed was a punishment-style shooting for "unrepublican conduct" before he had stepped-down from command in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/cork-dissident-murdered-beast-gunned-down-on-street-434235.html|title=Cork dissident murdered: 'Beast' gunned down on street|date=8 December 2016|access-date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2017, GardaÃ­ foiled a serious IRA bomb plot after discovering six kilos of [[Semtex]], "enough to blow up a street".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/06/07/police-foil-new-ira-bomb-plot-as-they-seize-enough-semtex-to-blow-up-a-street-6691973/|title=Police foil 'New IRA' bomb plot as they seize enough Semtex to blow up a street|date=7 June 2017|work=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2017, the Police Service of Northern Ireland warned that the group had developed a new type of bomb.

In December 2017, MI5 said that Northern Ireland has the highest level of terrorist activity of anywhere in Europe with attacks being disrupted weekly. Over 250 seizures, thwarted attacks, and counter-terrorist operations are reported to have been undertaken by British security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/m15-terror-threat-ireland-greatest-11734711|title=MI5: Terror threat in Ireland is greatest in Europe|first=Niall|last=O'Connor|date=21 December 2017|work=Irish Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group remain active in 2018, with it and the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]] claiming they have no plans to announce a ceasefire along the lines of that of the [[Ãglaigh na hÃireann (Real IRA splinter group)|ONH]].&lt;ref&gt;Ãglaigh na hÃireann (Real IRA splinter group)&lt;/ref&gt; However, both groups have suffered major setbacks and inactivity due to feuding and heavy police intervention, and have likewise often failed to commit successful attacks due to antiquated equipment and member inexperience.

In July 2018 the New IRA claimed responsibility for a spate of gun and bomb attacks at police officers during the [[2018 Derry riots|riots in Derry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/07/20/news/-ira-claim-responsibility-for-derry-attacks-1386916/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and status==
The RIRA has a command structure similar to the Provisional IRA, with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|40â45}} The rank-and-file members operate in [[active service unit]]s of [[Clandestine cell system#Provisional Irish Republican Army|covert cell]]s to prevent the organisation from being compromised by informers. As of June 2005, the organisation is believed to have a maximum of about 150 members, according to a statement by the [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform]], [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Debates (Official Report â Unrevised) DÃ¡il Ãireann Thursday, 23 June 2005 â Page 1 |url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1487#N1487 |publisher=Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=3 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227022226/http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20050623.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1487 |archivedate=27 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RIRA also has a political wing, the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] (formerly the 32 County Sovereignty Committee), led by Francis Mackey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=16 April 2001 |title=Bombers widen the republican divide |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/16/northernireland.devolution |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=4 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIRA is distinct from the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], another Provisional IRA splinter group founded in 1986, although the two groups have been known to co-operate at a local level.&lt;ref name="IMC8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Independent Monitoring Commission |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Eighth report of the Independent Monitoring Commission |journal= |volume= |issue= |page=13 |date=1 February 2006 |publisher=The Stationery Office |url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/eighth_report_of_the_independent_monitoring_commission.pdf |format=PDF |id= |accessdate=13 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214083850/http://www.nio.gov.uk/eighth_report_of_the_independent_monitoring_commission.pdf |archivedate=14 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Provisional IRA has been hostile to the RIRA and issued threats to RIRA members, and in October 2000 was alleged to be responsible for the fatal shooting of Belfast RIRA member Joe O'Connor according to O'Connor's family and 32 County Sovereignty Movement member [[Marian Price]].&lt;ref name="English" /&gt;{{rp|320â321}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mullin |first=John |authorlink=John Mullin (journalist) |date=19 October 2000 |title=Shots fired at funeral of Real IRA man |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/oct/19/northernireland.johnmullin |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In 2014, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated the group's annual turnover at US$50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/ghki45efh/9-real-ira-annual-turnover-50-million/ |title=The World's 10 Richest Terrorist Organizations |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the police in Northern Ireland, the main sources of the Real IRA's funding are illegal fuel operations and various smuggling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/real-ira-is-ninth-richest-terror-group-in-the-world-30748913.html |title=Real IRA 'is ninth richest terror group in the world' |publisher=Belfast Telegraph |date=17 November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illicit cigarettes were also said to be a significant source of income for the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecre.com/ccsf/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Illicit-Cigarette-Trafficking-and-the-Funding-of-Terrorism.pdf|title=Illicit cigarette trafficking and the funding of terrorism|last=Billingslea|first=William|date=2004|work=The Police Chief Magazine|access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other significant sources of funding from the group, including funding from sympathisers based in the US and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/04/the-boston-bombings-should-make-us-real-ira-supporters-stop-and-think/|title=The Boston bombings should make 'Real IRA' supporters in the US stop and think {{!}} Coffee House|last=Oborne|first=Peter|date=25 April 2013|work=Coffee House|access-date=26 June 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaponry==
The RIRA initially took small amounts of [[materiel]] from Provisional IRA arms dumps under the control of McKevitt and other former Provisional IRA members, including the [[plastic explosive]] [[Semtex]], [[Uzi]] [[submachine gun]]s, [[AK-47]] and [[AK-74]] [[assault rifle]]s, handguns, shotguns, detonators and timing devices.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|321}}&lt;ref name="Janes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyne" /&gt;{{rp|382â383}} The defection of senior Provisional IRA members also gave the RIRA the ability to manufacture home-made explosives and improvised mortars, including the [[Barrack buster|Mark 15 mortar]] capable of firing a {{convert|200|lb|adj=on}} shell.&lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt;{{rp|183}}&lt;ref name="Janes1" /&gt;

In 1999 the organisation supplemented its equipment by importing arms from Croatia, including military explosive [[TM500]], [[Sa vz. 23|CZ Model 25]] submachine guns, modified AK-47 assault rifles with a folding stock, and RPG-18 and [[RPG-22]] rocket launchers&lt;ref name="Boyne" /&gt;{{rp|382,440}} but a July 2000 attempt to smuggle a second consignment of arms was foiled by Croatian police, who seized seven RPG-18s, AK-47 assault rifles, detonators, ammunition, and twenty packs of TM500.&lt;ref name="Boyne" /&gt;{{rp|384}}&lt;ref name="Janes2" /&gt;

In 2001 [[Slovak Three|RIRA members]] travelled to [[Slovakia]] to procure arms, and were caught in a [[sting operation]] by the British security agency [[MI5]]. The men attempted to purchase five tonnes of plastic explosives, 2,000 detonators, 500 handguns, 200 rocket-propelled-grenades, and also [[wire-guided missile]]s and sniper rifles. Three men from County Louth were arrested and extradited to the UK and subsequently imprisoned for 30 years each after pleading guilty to conspiring to cause explosions and other charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Norton-Taylor |date=8 May 2002 |title=30 years in jail for Real IRA trio |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/08/northernireland.richardnortontaylor |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, the PSNI made arrests following an [[MI5]] sting operation targeting a dissident republican gun smuggling plot. The RIRA had attempted to procure arms from France including Semtex and [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] plastic explosives, [[SA-7]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s, AK-47s, rocket launchers, heavy machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols with silencers, anti-tank weapons and detonators.&lt;ref name="Boyne" /&gt;{{rp|390}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man in court on 'Real IRA' charge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5112572.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=24 June 2006 |accessdate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 June 2010, two of those arrested were found guilty following a trial by judge in Belfast. On 1 October 2010 one man was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for attempting to import weapons and explosives, while the other was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment for making a Portuguese property available for the purpose of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10464897 | title= Two guilty of Real IRA gun plot | date=30 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-11453874 | title= Pair jailed for Real IRA gun plot | date=1 October 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roman-Dutch law''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Rooms-Hollands recht'', [[Afrikaans]]: ''Romeins-Hollandse reg'') is an [[Common law|uncodified]], [[Legal doctrine|scholarship]]-driven, [[Precedent|judge-made]] [[legal system]] based on [[Roman law]] as applied in the [[Netherlands]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. As such, it is a variety of the European continental [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or ''[[ius commune]]''. While Roman-Dutch law was superseded by [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic codal law]] in the [[Netherlands]] proper as early as the beginning of the 19th century, Roman-Dutch law is still applied by the courts of [[South Africa]] (and its neighbours [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Guyana]], [[Indonesia]], [[East Timor]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. It was largely drawn upon by [[Scots law]].&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cairns, âImporting our Lawyers from Holland: Netherlands Influences on Scots Law and Lawyers in the Eighteenth Centuryâ, in ''Scotland and the Low Countries, 1124â1994'', ed. G. G. Simpson (East Linton: Tuckwell, 1996), 136; reprinted in ''Law, Lawyers, and Humanism: Selected Essays on the History of Scots Law'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; It also had some minor impact on the laws of the American state of [[New York (state)|New York]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Schout In Rensselaerswijck: Conflict Of Interests | journal = Colonial Albany Social History Project | date = April 1979 | first = Stefan | last = Bielinski| id = | url = http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/download_file/view/285/741/ | accessdate = 2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in introducing the office of Prosecutor (''[[schout]]-fiscaal'').

==History ==
[[Roman law]] was progressively abandoned during the early [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and excerpts of latter-day imperial enactments (''constitutiones'') were well known in the successor Germanic states and vital to maintaining the commonplace principle of folk-right which applied pre-existing Roman law to Roman provincials and Germanic law to Germans. The ''[[Breviary of Alaric]]'' and the ''[[Lex Burgundionum|Lex Gundobada Romana]]'' are two of the several hybrid Romano-Germanic law codes that incorporated much Roman legal material. However, because the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Western Roman Empire]] preceded the drafting of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinianic Code]], early Byzantine law was never influential in Western Europe. Also, much of this early law was superseded by later feudal law. Only [[canon law]] successfully retained any substantial amount of Roman law to be influential.

Interest in the doctrines of Byzantine lawyers came whenâaround the year {{smallcaps|a.d.}} 1070âa copy of the ''[[Pandects|Digest]]'' of [[Byzantine Empire|Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] found its way into northern Italy. Scholars in the emerging [[University of Bologna]], who previously had access to only a limited portion of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinianic code]], sparked an intellectual rediscovery of Roman law through the teaching of law based on Byzantine law texts. Courts gradually applied Byzantine lawâas taught in Bologna (and soon elsewhere)âfirst as law ''in subsidium'' to be applied when there was no local statute or custom in point, and later because judicial officers (judges, magistrates, assessors) felt that its refined legal concepts were more apt to solve complex cases than the [[customary law]]s of western and central Europe. This process, referred to as [[doctrine of reception|reception]], took place in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the Mediterranean in the 13th-14th centuries, but was much slower to come to northern Europe (e.g., [[Saxony]], [[Northern France]], the [[Low Countries]], [[Scandinavia]]).

In the 15th century, reception ''in complexu'' reached the Netherlands while it was associated with the Holy Roman Empire. While Italian lawyers (''mos italicus'') were the first to contribute to the new Byzantine-based jurisprudence, in the 16th century, French humanistic doctrinal scholars (''mos gallicus'') were most influential. In the 17th and 18th century, it was the Dutch who had the greatest influence. Members of the ''Hollandse Elegante School'' (âschool of elegant jurisprudenceâ; 1500â1800) included [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Johannes Voet]], [[Ulrich Huber]], Gerard Noodt, J. and F. van de Sande, and many others. These scholars managed to merge Roman law with legal concepts taken from traditional Dutch feudal [[Custom (law)|customary]] law, especially from the province of [[Holland]]. The resulting mixture was predominantly Roman, but it contained some features which were characteristically Dutch: this hybrid is known as Roman-Dutch law. The Dutch applied their legal system in their colonial empire. In so doing, the distinctly Dutch branch of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] (or ''ius commune'') came to be applied in far-flung places, e.g., the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Dutch West Indies]], [[Cape Colony]], and [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch Ceylon]].&lt;ref name=Smits&gt;{{cite book|last=Smits|first=J.M.|title=The Making of European Private Law: Towards a Ius Commune Europaeum As a Mixed Legal System|year=2002|publisher=Intersentia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156â157}}

In the Netherlands, Roman-Dutch law abruptly ended when, in 1809, the Dutch puppet stateâthe [[Kingdom of Holland]]âadopted the French [[Napoleonic Code]], a different system but nonetheless a branch of civil law. Yet, in the then-Dutch colonies, French law was never introduced during or after the Napoleonic era. As a result, Roman-Dutch law has managed to survive, usually in a hybrid form mixed with English law, otherwise known as âAnglo-Dutch lawâ.

==Law reform in former Dutch colonies==

The Netherlands participated in international seminars and training programmes organized by international partner organisations, ranging from a two-day seminar to a two-week programme for different legal professionals around the world. Programmes have been developed for Surinam, Aruba, Sint Maarten and Indonesia.

The '''Rural Housing Service''' ('''RHS''') is an agency of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Located within the Department's [[USDA Rural Development|Rural Development]] mission area. RHS operates a broad range of programs to provide moderate- low- and very-low-income Americans in rural communities with:
*homeownership options to individuals, including direct home loans and mortgage guarantees;
*housing rehabilitation and preservation funding; 
*grants to non-profits who organize self-help housing services in rural communities;
*rental assistance to tenants of RHS-funded multi-family housing complexes; 
*[[farm]] labor housing; 
*help to developers of multi-family housing projects, like assisted housing for the elderly and disabled, or apartment buildings; and 
*community facilities, such as [[libraries]], [[child care]] centers, [[school]]s, municipal buildings, veterans shelters and firefighting equipment to [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] groups, nonprofit organizations, communities and local governments. 

RHS administers direct [[loan]]s, loan guarantees and [[Grant (money)|grants]]. Direct loans are made and serviced by USDA staff; loan guarantees are made to [[bank]]s or other private lenders, and grants are made directly to a person or organization.

RHS works with other federal agencies, and a number of both nonprofit and private organizations nationally, in order to pool resources to help America's rural residents most effectively.

The RHS National Office is located in [[Washington, D.C.]], and is responsible for setting policy, developing regulations, and performing oversight. In the field, RHS operations are carried out through the USDA's state and local Rural Development offices and service centers, several of which are located in each state and [[Puerto Rico]]. (Four multistate offices exist in addition to local offices within the states -- [[Vermont]]/[[New Hampshire]]; [[Massachusetts]]/[[Connecticut]]/[[Rhode Island]]; [[Maryland]]/[[Delaware]]; and [[Florida]]/[[Virgin Islands]].) The Customer Service Center, located in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], provides loan origination and servicing directly to RHS Single-Family Housing borrowers.

For all Rural Development programs, the rural area definition was revised by the 2014 Farm Bill. Specifically, the Farm Bill allows some areas with populations up to 35,000 to remain eligible until receipt of the 2020 decennial census. Effective February 2, 2015, areas with populations greater than 35,000 no longer qualify for Rural Housing Program assistance.  Please see below for detailed definition:
 
To RHS, a rural area is either an open country or any town, village, city, or place, including the immediate adjacent densely settled area, which is not part of or associated with an urban area and which:
    (1)Has a population not in excess of 2,500 inhabitants; or
    (2)Has a population in excess of 2,500 but not in excess of 10,000 if it is rural in character; or
    (3)Has a population in excess of 10,000 but not in excess of 20,000, and-
          (i)Is not contained within a Metropolitan Statistical Area; and
          (ii)Has a serious lack of mortgage credit for lower and moderate-income families as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

Any area classified as ââruralââ or a âârural areaââ prior to October 1, 1990, and determined not to be ââruralââ or a âârural areaââ as a result of data received from or after the 1990, 2000, or 2010 decennial census, and any area deemed to be a âârural areaââ at any time during the period beginning January 1, 2000, and ending December 31, 2010, shall continue to be so classified until the receipt of data from the decennial census in the year 2020, if such area has a population in excess of 10,000 but not in excess of 35,000, is rural in character, and has a serious lack of mortgage credit for lower and moderate-income families.

An exception to the rural eligibility requirements is the [[Farm Labor Housing Program]] (Section 514/516), which is the only federal program available for development of housing for farm workers. This program is available in both rural and urban areas.

The '''Seroglazov culture''' (sometimes erroneously translated as ''Seroglazovka'', or ''Seroglasovo'' culture) is a [[mesolithic]] culture. Pernitzka dated it according to 14C-dating to the beginning of the 7th millennium BC, others (who?) to the [[11th millennium BC|11th]]-[[9th millennium BC]] of the [[Caspian Lowland]] (by [[Caspian Sea]]), from [[Ural River]] to [[Kuma-Manych Depression]]. It was discovered during the archaeological excavations near the Seroglazovka (Ð¡ÐµÑÐ¾Ð³Ð»Ð°Ð·Ð¾Ð²ÐºÐ°) ''[[stanitsa]]'' ([[Cossack]] settlement).

'''Statuette of a Woman''' from the 6th to 5th centuries BC, is a bronze statue discovered in [[Ayrum]], [[Armenia]]. It is included in the [[History Museum of Armenia]]'s collection under the number 2225-1.

== Description ==
The figure is a miniature cast figure of a nude woman standing on the platform corner, with long legs, high hair, a flat face, and a large, straight nose. The eyes and ears are pronounced by round dimples. On her neck, she has on a thick necklace. Extended in her left hand, there is a pear-shaped jug, her right elbow is bent holding a [[drinking horn]]. Figures with forms of female deities, make use of [[temple]]s for various ritual ceremonies. The nude female statuettes were linked with the ritual belief of fertility and incorporated with the goddess [[Anahit]], who as a mother-goddess was also included in the [[Battle]], fertility, and functions of the goddess of love, being the [[gardening]], wheat, and patron goddess of [[animal]]s.

In [[linguistics]], '''switch-reference''' (SR) describes any clause-level [[morpheme]] that signals whether certain prominent arguments in 'adjacent' [[clauses]] [[reference|corefer]].  In most cases, it marks whether the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the verb in one clause is coreferent with that of the previous clause, or of a subordinate clause to the matrix (main) clause that is dominating it.

==Meanings of switch-reference==
The basic distinction made by a switch-reference system is whether the following clause has the same subject (SS) or a different subject (DS). That is known as '''canonical switch-reference'''. For purposes of switch-reference, subject is defined as it is for languages with a nominativeâaccusative alignment: a subject is the sole argument of an intransitive clause or the agent of a transitive one. It holds even in languages with a high degree of [[Ergativeâabsolutive language|ergativity]]. 

The [[Washo language]] of California and Nevada exhibits a switch-reference system. When the subject of one verb is the same as the subject of the following verb, the verb takes no switch-reference marker. However, if the subject of one verb differs from the subject of the following verb, the verb takes the "different subject" marker, -Å¡ (examples from Mithun 1999:269):

:{{interlinear| lang = was
|yÃ¡Â·saÊ¼ dulÃ©Ê¼Å¡ugi yÃ¡Â·saÊ¼ gedumbÃ©cÌedÃ¡Å¡aÊ¼i
|again '''he'''.is.reaching.toward.him again '''he'''.is.going.to.poke.him
|"Again '''he''' is reaching toward him, again '''he''' will poke him" (same subject)}}

:{{interlinear| lang = was
|mÃ©mluyi -'''Å¡''' lÃ©mehi
|'''you'''.eat -'''DS''' '''I'''.will.drink
|"If '''you''' eat, '''I''' will drink" (different subjects)}}

The [[Seri language]] of northwestern Mexico also has a switch-reference system which is similar in most ways to those of other languages except for one very salient fact: the relevant argument in a passive clause is not the superficial subject of the passive verb but rather the always unexpressed underlying subject. In clauses with [[Raising (linguistics)|subject raising]], it is the raised subject that is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Marlett (1984), Farrell, Marlett &amp; Perlmutter (1991). The facts are almost opposite of what is predicted by the proposals made in Finer (1984, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-subject switch-reference ===

The nominative subject is not always marked by switch-reference. For instance, many clauses, including those with [[impersonal verb|impersonal]] or weather verbs, have no subject at all but can both bear and trigger switch-reference.

==Non-canonical switch-reference==
In addition, many languages exhibit '''non-canonical switch-reference''', the co-referents of arguments other than the subject being marked by switch-reference. Here is an example from [[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] (Watkins 1993):

{{interlinear| lang = kio
|Kathryn gÊ²Ã  kwÃºt '''gÉ''' Esther-Ã l gÊ²Ã  kwÃºt 
|Kathryn 'she-it' write.PFV '''and.SS''' Esther-too 'she-it' write.PFV
|Kathryn wrote a letter and Esther wrote one, too.}}

==Form of switch-reference markers ==

Switch-reference markers often carry additional meanings or are at least fused with connectives that carry them. For instance, an switch-reference marker might mark a different subject and sequential events.  

Switch-reference-markers often appear attached to verbs, but they are not a verbal category. They often appear attached to sentence-initial particles, sentence-initial recapitulative verbs, adverbial conjunctions ('when', 'because', etc.), or coordinators ('and' or 'but' though it seems never 'or'), relativizers ('which,'that'), or sentence [[complementizer]]s ('that'). They can also appear as free morphemes or as differing agreement paradigms. However, most switch-reference languages are [[subjectâobjectâverb]] languages, with verbs as well as complementizers and conjunctions coming at the end of clauses. Therefore, switch-reference often appears attached to verbs, a fact that has led to the common but erroneous claim that switch-reference is a verbal category.

One certain typological fact about switch-reference is that switch-reference markers appear at the 'edges' of clauses. It is found at the edge of either a subordinate clause (referring to the matrix clause) or at the edge of a coordinate clause (referring to the previous clause). It is also very common in clause-chaining languages of [[New Guinea]], where it is found at the edge of medial clauses.

Switch-reference is also sensitive to syntactic structure. It can skip a clause that is string-adjacent (spoken one right after another) and refer to a matrix clause. For instance, in the configuration [A[B][C]], for which B and C are subordinate clauses to A, any switch-reference-marking on C refers to A, not B.

==Distribution of switch-reference==

It is found in hundreds of languages in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Australia]], New Guinea, and the South Pacific. Typologies exist for North America (Jacobsen 1983), Australia (Austin 1981), and New Guinea (Roberts 1997).   

It spreads generally by [[areal feature|areal diffusion]], which accounts for the fact that the morphological marking varies from one language to the next.

[[File:Taima Mandala, 14th century, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 57.156.6.jpg|thumbnail|Taima Mandala, Kamakura period, 14th century, Japan]]
The '''Taima Mandala''' (ç¶éº»æ¼è¼ç¾,ç¶´ç¹å½éº»æ¼è¼ç¾å³) is a [[mandala]] in Japanese [[Pure Land]] Buddhism. The original copy of the mandala is still housed in the [[Taima-dera]] temple in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], Japan, and was woven c. 763. The mandala is appointed as a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] on April 27, 1961. Many copies have been made since, and the original work has degraded considerably.  According to popular legend, [[ChÅ«jÅ-hime]] witnessed the creation of the mandala, crafted from fibers of lotus stems by two nuns who were thought to be [[AmitÄbha|Amida]] Buddha (Buddha of Infinite Light) and [[Guan Yin|Kannon]] Bodhisattva.  The imagery of the Mandala is based mostly on the ''[[Contemplation Sutra|Sutra of the Contemplation of Amitayus]]'' è¦³ç¡éå¯¿çµ, and has been the subject of several doctrinal commentaries in Japanese Buddhism.

==Description==
The central image is the [[Pure Land]] itself, while the left, right, and lower borders are lined with images from the Contemplation Sutra. The central image, called the Court of Essential Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0810910853|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the Amida Buddha surrounded by his worshippers that have reached enlightenment, buildings, and the land that exists in his Paradise. At the top of the central image there are many figures floating in the sky on clouds. Each of these figures have the distinctive characteristic of a halo behind their heads. This detail is a signifier that each of them have achieved enlightenment. Alongside of them are various birds flying about, scarves floating in the air, and some lotus flowers. All the figures, scarves, and birds all float towards the center of the image.

Below the floating figures, in the center, near the top of the image, there are images of buildings that appear to look like temples or palaces floating in the sky, as well. These floating buildings lead down to what appears to be an indoor garden surrounded by more buildings, this time located to the ground. These buildings are designed after eighth-century Chinese Palaces. Each of these buildings, as well as the trees in the garden, are made of the seven precious substancesâgold, silver, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, coral, agate, and mother-of-pearl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotenhius|first1=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Mandalas Representations of Sacred Geography|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, HI|page=18|chapter=The Taima Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt;Throughout the palaces are more enlightened figures meditating.

Most Chinese palaces are raised on a platform as their foundation. The structural beams are primarily used to support the roof of the building. They are connected to directly to each other due to the brackets. The walls are either curtained or door panels to define the rooms or to enclose the building. In the Taima, the buildings display a sweeping roof. This type of roof holds a sweeping curve that raises the corners of the roofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhao|first1=Ruiyong|last2=Caiwang|first2=Yang|title=Chinese Ancient Architecture|date=2004|publisher=[Jinan Shi]: Qi Lu yin xiang chu ban she chu ban fa xing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the very center of this image is what appears to be a dock in the middle of a lotus pond. On this dock, there are three figures seated on lotus blossom thrones surrounded by many meditating enlightened figures. All three of these figures are bigger than the rest throughout the image, but the centered one is the largest of them all. The centered figure is known as Amida, the deity of the Western Paradise. The figure to each of his sides are known as bodhisattvas, people who have reached enlightenment, but stayed on earth to teach the ways of the Buddha to help others reach their enlightenment. These two figures are the bodhisattva Kannon and bodhisattva Seishi.

Surrounding the middle dock holding Amida are several smaller docks, all connected to the centered dock, each holding more meditating figures.  In the pond itself are boats and lotus flowers. Upon close examination, one can see many figures being born from the lotus flowers. These are people who have reached enlightenment and are being welcomed into the Western Paradise. The boats are there to bring the enlightened figures to land so they can continue their worship.

The left border (the Court of Prefatory Legend) shows, first, the discovery of the Sutra on Vulture Peak at the top, and then illustrates the introduction of the Sutra, from the bottom upward: Prince Ajasatru's temptation, the imprisonment of his father and then his mother, and Queen Vaidehi's prayers answered by Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni transmits the knowledge of the Pure Land to his disciple in the last panel, second from the top.

Queen Vaidehi was given the task to meditate and visualize the elements that represented of the western paradise, illustrated in the right border. This is called Thirteen Meditational Contemplations (The Jozengzi). The elements are as shown:

'''1.''' The Sun 
'''2.''' The Moon
'''3.''' The Lapis Lazuli (Jeweled Realm of the Western Paradise)
'''4.''' The Trees of Paradise
'''5.''' The Lakes of Paradise
'''6.''' The Multi-storied Jeweled Towers of Paradise
'''7.''' Amida's Jeweled Lotus Throne
'''8.''' The Amida Triad
'''9.''' The Great Body of Amida
'''10.''' Amida in Half-lotus Position
'''11.''' The Bodhisattva Shishi
'''12.''' Imagining oneself reborn in Paradise
'''13.''' The Small Body of Amida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope E.|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=169|chapter=Samurai Culture and the coming of Pure Land and Zen Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bottom border illustrate the nine levels of birth. This is described as the Court of General Meditations (Sanzengi). This is an extension of the Thirteen Meditational Concentrations. The General Mediations are three levels of rebirth that are subdivided into three degrees (six births total). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Penelope|title=History of Japanese Art|date=1993|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=170|chapter=Samurai Culture and the Coming of Pure Land and Zen Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These births include from middle birth to upper degree to the upper birth of the lower degree (higher ranks closer to center of pond), and middle birth to lower degree and the lower birth of the lower degree (enclosed in the calyxes of lotus flowers further away from Amida).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grotenhuis|first1=Elizabeth|title=Japanese Mandalas Representations of Sacred Geography|date=1999|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, HI|page=21-2|chapter=The Taima Mandala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding the borders to the ends of the hanging scroll are designs of lotus flowers. Each lotus is painted with small and careful details to help make the images stand out.

'''''The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal''''' is a 2009 book by [[Ben Mezrich]] about the founding of [[Facebook]],&lt;ref name=moneycnn&gt;{{cite web|last=Hempel |first=Jessi |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/25/technology/founding_of_facebook.fortune/index.htm |title=The Book that Facebook Doesn't Want You to Read|publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted by [[Columbia Pictures]] for the 2010 film ''[[The Social Network]]''. Co-founder [[Eduardo Saverin]] served as Mezrich's main consultant,&lt;ref name=moneycnn /&gt; although [[Mark Zuckerberg]] declined to speak with him while the book was being researched. After Zuckerberg and Saverin settled their lawsuit, Saverin broke off contact with the author.

== Sources ==
Ben Mezrich maintains that the book is not a work of fiction despite his narrative style of writing. Some of his sources are his conversations with Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin and the court documents made available to him because of "all these college kids suing each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conspiracyworldwide.podomatic.com/entry/2010-10-23T08_05_51-07_00 |title=Podomatic interview with Ben Mezrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]. (2009-07-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/books/20maslin.html "Harvard Pals Grow Rich: Chronicling Facebook Without Face Time"] at ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
The story begins in the weeks that precede the launch of "thefacebook.com" at Harvard.  Eduardo Saverin, cast as the protagonist, has befriended Mark Zuckerberg, and both struggle for social acceptanceâSaverin by joining a [[final club]], Zuckerberg by creating a website where girls can be ranked according to their looks.  Zuckerberg's stunt, though successful, puts him at odds with the Harvard Administrative Board, and has angered numerous campus women's groups as well as individual female students.  An article on the incident in the [[Harvard Crimson]] is noticed by three Harvard seniors: [[Winklevoss twins|twin brothers]] [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and [[Divya Narendra]], all of whom who are trying to launch a Harvard dating site.  The trio approaches Zuckerberg, convincing him to join in the venture.  Zuckerberg, however, feels their site does not have what he thinks is the right approach and begins developing thefacebook with financial help from Saverin and programming from Zuckerberg's roommates.

Once thefacebook.com is launched it becomes an immediate hit on campus.  After discovering what Zuckerberg has done, the Winklevoss' and Narendra are infuriated and seek legal advice from their father's lawyer.  The story then chronicles the changing relationship between Saverin and Zuckerberg, who have different visions for thefacebook.

While the first half of the book centers on the Harvard University campus and focuses on college life, the second half centers on the business end of thefacebook and Zuckerberg's move to [[Silicon Valley]].  [[Napster]] creator [[Sean Parker]] inserts himself into Zuckerberg's life, soon becoming a mentor to Zuckerberg who guides him to Silicon Valley venture capitalists and other players in the industry.  Saverin, having graduated from Harvard, continues to feel sidelined by Parker, who he feels is not the best influence on Zuckerberg and is replacing him in importance to the advancement of thefacebook.

The end of the book does not provide a conclusion since, according to the author's admission, matters of dispute are ongoing in the court of law.

== Film adaptation ==
[[Columbia Pictures]] released a film adaptation of the book in 2010 titled ''[[The Social Network]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Leah McLaren|McLaren, Leah]] |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/style/zuckerpunched-maybe-those-tech-nerds-arent-so-harmless/article1577360 |title=Zuckerpunched!

'''''The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story''''' is a [[best-selling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DA1E39F937A35755C0A963958260 | title = Best Sellers|date= June 4, 1995 | accessdate = 2008-09-29|work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1995 [[nonfiction]] thriller by [[Richard Preston]] about the origins and incidents involving [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, particularly [[ebolavirus]]es and [[marburgvirus]]es. The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "Crisis in the Hot Zone".&lt;ref name="PrestonCrisis"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Preston |date=October 26, 1992 |title=Crisis in the Hot Zone |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/10/26/crisis-in-the-hot-zone |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Filoviridae|filoviruses]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Sudan virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Ravn virus]] are [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety Level 4]] agents. Biosafety Level 4 agents are extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high case-fatality rate, and have no known [[prophylactics]], treatments, or cures.

Along with describing the history of the diseases caused by these two [[Central Africa]]n diseases, [[Ebola virus disease]] and [[Marburg virus disease]], Preston described a 1989 incident in which a relative of Ebola virus, named [[Reston virus]], was discovered at a primate quarantine facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], less than 15 miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from [[Washington, D.C.]] The virus found at the facility was a mutated form of the original Ebola virus and was initially mistaken for [[Simian hemorrhagic fever virus|Simian hemorrhagic fever]]. The original Reston facility involved in the incident, located at 1946 Isaac Newton Square, was subsequently demolished on 30 May 1995, and a new building was constructed in its place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindercare.com/our-centers/center-details/303031/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/eeegi/image/24157826 E.G. Bradshaw, Monkey House in Reston, Va]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book is in four sections:

* "The Shadow of Mount Elgon" delves into the history of filoviruses, as well as speculation about the origins of [[AIDS]]. Preston recounts the story of "Charles Monet" (a [[pseudonym]]), who might have caught Marburg virus from visiting [[Kitum Cave]] on [[Mount Elgon]] in [[Kenya]]. The author describes in great detail the progression of the disease, from the initial headache and backache, to the final stage in which Monet's internal organs fail and he "bleeds out" (i.e., hemorrhages extensively) in a waiting room in a Nairobi hospital. This part also introduces a young promising physician who became infected with Marburg virus while treating Monet. Nancy Jaax's story is told. Viruses, [[biosafety level]]s and procedures were described. The Ebola virus disease outbreaks caused by Ebola virus and its cousin, [[Sudan virus]], are mentioned. Preston talks to the man who named the Ebola virus.
* "The Monkey House" chronicles the discovery of [[Reston virus]] among imported monkeys in [[Reston, Virginia]], and the following actions taken by the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]]. It starts with the monkey house receiving a shipment of 100 wild monkeys. After four weeks, 29 of these monkeys have died. This is followed by the veterinarian for the facility, Dan Dalgard, examining the dead monkeys and sending the samples to [[Peter Jahrling]], a virologist at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. After seeing a rope-like virus under the microscope, it is suspected that the monkeys were infected with a hot agent similar to the [[Marburg virus disease|Marburg]] virus. Jahrling then conducts a blood test to find out that the hot agent is the Ebola Zaire virus. This conclusion leads to the Army Medical Research Institute deciding to euthanize all the monkeys in the same room as the infected monkeys.
* "Smashdown" is more on the Reston epizootic, which involved a strain of the virus that does not affect humans but which easily spreads by air, and is very similar to its cousin the [[Ebola virus]].
* "Kitum Cave" tells of the author's visit of the cave that is the suspected home of the natural [[host (biology)|host]] animal that Ebola lives inside of.

The book starts with "Charles Monet" visiting [[Kitum Cave]] during a camping trip to Mount Elgon in Central Africa. Not long after, he begins to suffer from a number of symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and red eye. He is soon taken to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, but his condition deteriorates further and he goes into a coma while in the waiting room. This particular filovirus is called [[Marburg virus]].

Dr. Nancy Jaax had been promoted to work in the Level 4 Biosafety containment area at the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]], and is assigned to research [[Ebola virus]]. While preparing food for her family at home, she cuts her right hand. Later, while working on a dead monkey infected with Ebola virus, one of the gloves on the hand with the open wound tears, and she is almost exposed to contaminated blood, but does not get infected. Nurse Mayinga is also infected by a nun and elects to visit Nairobi Hospital for treatment, where she succumbs to the disease.

In Reston, Virginia, less than fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from Washington, D.C., a company called Hazelton Research once operated a [[quarantine]] center for monkeys that were destined for laboratories. In October 1989, when an unusually high number of their monkeys began to die, their veterinarian decided to send some samples to Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for study.  Early during the testing process in [[Biosafety level#Levels|biosafety level 3]], when one of the flasks appeared to be contaminated with harmless [[pseudomonas]] [[bacterium]], two USAMRIID scientists exposed themselves to the virus by [[waft]]ing the flask. They later determine that, while the virus is terrifyingly lethal to monkeys, humans can be infected with it without any health effects at all. This virus is now known as [[Reston virus]].

Finally, the author himself goes into Africa to explore Kitum Cave. On the way, he discusses the role of [[AIDS]] in the present, as the highway they were on, sometimes called the "[[Kinshasa Highway|AIDS Highway]]", or the "Kinshasa Highway", was where it first appeared. Equipped with a [[hazmat suit]], he enters the cave and finds a large number of animals, one of which might be the virus carrier. At the conclusion of the book, he travels to the quarantine facility in Reston.  He finds the building abandoned and deteriorating. He concludes the book by claiming that Ebola will be back.

== Reston Virus Outbreak ==
The discovery of the [[Reston virus]] was made in November 1989 by Thomas W. Geisbert, an intern at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. Dr. Peter B. Jahrling isolated the filovirus further. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted blood tests of the 178 animal handlers. While 6 tested positive, they did not exhibit any symptoms. The Reston virus was found to have low [[pathogenicity]] in humans. This was further supported later when a handler infected himself during a necroscopy of an infected monkey. However, the handler did not show symptoms of the virus after the incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC|last=McCormick|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7607-1208-5|location=|pages=298â299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' was listed as one of around 100 books that shaped a century of science by ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, P. 100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science. Retrieved February 17, 2016, from http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science&lt;/ref&gt; Listed as an âExploration,â the criteria dictate that the book typically âseeks to engage with the contextâ elucidating the general topic rather than a specific nuance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Many reviews of ''The Hot Zone'' exemplify the impact the book had on the publicâs view of [[Emergent virus|emerging viruses.]] A review in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' captures the paranoia and public panic described in this book.

''The Hot Zone'' has been criticized for exaggerating the threat of [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and causing viral panic. In an interview about his book about Ebola, [[David Quammen]] claimed that ''The Hot Zone'' had âvivid, gruesome detailsâ that gave an âexaggerated idea of Ebola over the yearsâ causing âpeople to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon.â&lt;ref&gt;Doucleff, M.

''The Hot Zone'' is described as a âromantic account of environmental transgression.â Reactions to this book could be seen not only in the publicâs view of emerging viruses, but in the changes in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. In addition to the funding of public health infrastructure during the early 1970s, there were many public discussions of biodefense. This book continued to fuel the emerging diseases campaign. By connecting international health to [[Bioterrorism|national security]], this campaign used ''The Hot Zone'' as a method of justifying increased intervention in the global phenomena of disease.&lt;ref&gt;King, N. B.. (2004). The Scale Politics of Emerging Diseases. Osiris, 19, 62â76. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655232&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' elicited a major response by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by shedding light on the [[Ebola Zaire|Ebola Zaire outbreak]]. The release of teams of experts was immediate and massive. Many countries tightened their borders, issued warnings to custom officials, quarantined travelers, and issued travel advisories.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar, S.. (1998).

In his [[blurb]], horror writer [[Stephen King]] called the first chapter, "one of the most horrifying things I've read in my whole life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/richardpreston/bookshelf/hz.html | title=About The Hot Zone | publisher=Random House | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether any book "scared the pants off you" writer [[Suzanne Collins]] answered, "''The Hot Zone'', by Richard Preston. I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/08/12/suzanne-collins-on-the-books-she-loves/ | title=Suzanne Collins on the books she loves | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=Aug 12, 2010 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Jordan, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has received criticism for sensationalizing the effects of Ebola virus.  In their memoir ''Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC |isbn=978-0760712085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; former CDC scientists [[Joseph B. McCormick]] and [[Susan Fisher-Hoch]] lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact.  McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Adaptations==

===Failed film adaptation===
In January 1993, [[20th Century Fox]] and producer [[Lynda Obst]] won a bidding war for the film rights to Preston's 1992 ''New Yorker'' article, which was being transitioned into the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/fox-obst-contract-virus-pic-103313/ | title=Fox, Obst contract virus pic | publisher=Variety | date=January 24, 1993 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Eller, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to being outbid, [[Warner Bros.]] producer [[Arnold Kopelson]] immediately began working on the similarly themed ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'', a competing film which would ultimately be a factor leading to the collapse of ''Crisis in The Hot Zone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/virus-pic-fever-infects-fox-wb-118266/ | title=Virus pic fever infects Fox, WB | publisher=Variety | date=February 13, 1994 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=O'Steen, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors considered for the film adaptation included [[Wolfgang Petersen]] (who would later direct ''Outbreak''), [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], and [[Ridley Scott]].  Scott eventually signed on to direct the film in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 14, 1994 |title=Ridley Scott has signed on to direct "Crisis in the Hot Zone" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=February 14, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screenwriter James V. Hart was also signed to adapt the book.  In late-April 1994, Fox announced they had signed [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2, 1994 |title=Fox set the deals on "Crisis in the Hot Zone" for Robert Redford and Jodie Foster |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=May 2, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this version would ultimately not be made.  Foster dropped out of the film just before filming was to begin and production was delayed with [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sharon Stone]], and [[Robin Wright]] touted as possible replacements. In August 1994, Redford also dropped out of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 15, 1994 |title=Robert Redford has departed 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone." |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-15-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 15, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days following Redford's departure, it was announced that pre-production had been shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 19, 1994 |title="Crisis" in the Not Zone |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 19, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
On October 16, 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Ridley Scott again plans to adapt the book, this time as a [[television miniseries]] for [[NatGeo]]. [[Kelly Souders]], [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]], and [[Jeff Vintar]] wrote the pilot.  [[Julianna Margulies]] is starring as Nancy Jaax.  Filming begins in September 2018.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ebola-tv-series-works-lynda-741457 | title=Ebola TV Series in the Works From Lynda Obst, Ridley Scott (Exclusive) | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynda Obst will again produce the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/thank-the-ebola-outbreak-ridley-scott-will-finally-mak-1648330513 | title=20 Years Too Late, Ridley Scott's Finally Adapting The Hot Zone | publisher=IO 9 | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Trendacosta, Katharine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Passion of the Jew'''" is the third episode of the [[South Park (season 8)|eighth season]] and the 114th overall episode of the American animated series ''[[South Park]]'',  originally broadcast on [[Comedy Central]] on March 31, 2004. It was written and directed by [[Trey Parker]], who, along with fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]], voiced most of the characters in the episode. "The Passion of the Jew" is a satirical critique of the media discourse and controversy surrounding [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

In the episode, Kyle finally sees the blockbuster movie ''The Passion of the Christ'' and admits that Cartman has been right about the Jewish people all along. After Stan and Kenny see and hate the film, they angrily pursue [[Mel Gibson]] to get their money back.

==Plot==
The boys are playing ''[[Star Trek]]'' in Cartman's mother's new minivan and, as usual, the [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] Cartman gives [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] a hard time about his Jewish heritage. Cartman dares Kyle to watch ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', the box-office success of which Cartman cites as proof that everybody hates the Jews. Kyle sees the film and is horrified by its violent depiction of how Jesus was tortured and crucified. Kyle feels intense guilt and has nightmares in which he and other Jews laugh while killing Jesus. He tells Cartman that he was "right all along" about the Jews; overjoyed, Cartman prays to a poster of ''The Passion'''s director [[Mel Gibson]] and vows to dedicate his life to promoting the film and "organiz[ing] the masses&amp;nbsp;... to do thy bidding". Meanwhile, Stan and Kenny watch ''The Passion'' and hate it. Declaring it a "[[snuff film]]", they demand their eighteen dollars back from the theater, but are told that they can only get their money back from Gibson.

Attempting to contact Gibson, Stan and Kenny telephone the head of the Mel Gibson Fan ClubâCartman, who yells at them for disliking the film, but lets slip that Gibson lives in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. Stan and Kenny make their way there. Meanwhile Cartman dresses in a brown [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]-esque uniform and hosts a fan club meeting in his backyard. The attendees have gathered to celebrate ''The Passion'', which they say helped them rediscover Christianity. Cartman suggests that each attendee take one more person to see the film before they begin what he refers to as "[[The Holocaust|the cleansing]]"âthe fan club members obliviously agree.

When Stan and Kenny reach Gibson's house, the director rambles, straps himself to a [[Rack (torture)|rack]] wearing only underwear and says that no matter how much they torture him he will never refund their money. When the boys insist that they just want their money back, Gibson chases them around the house with a gun, Ã  la ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', appearing behind doors as various versions of [[Daffy Duck]]'s disguises.  Stan and Kenny take eighteen dollars from Gibson's wallet (actually twenty dollars, but Kenny offers up two dollars for change) and flee on a bus home.  Gibson, wearing face paint from ''[[Braveheart]]'', chases their bus in the tanker truck from ''[[Mad Max 2]]'', screaming "[[Klingon language|Qapla'!]]" and "[[Ransom (1996 film)|Gimme back my money]]!" Back in South Park, Kyle talks to Father Maxi about his issues regarding Jesus and the guilt he has been feeling since seeing Gibson's film. Father Maxi points out that [[Passion play|the Passion]] was originally a play used to stir up anti-Semitism, but says that its subject matter can still help people. Kyle seizes on Father Maxi's statement that "Christianity is about [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]" and says he now understands what he should do.

At another fan club rally outside the South Park theater, Cartman shouts hateful slogans in German and gives the attendees lines to shout back; mistaking the German for the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] spoken in ''The Passion'', they happily do so and join Cartman in [[goose-step]]ping through South Park shouting anti-Semitic slogans. Meanwhile, Kyle suggests at his [[synagogue]] that the Jewish community should apologize for Jesus' crucifixion, prompting uproar in the congregation. The rabbi tries to calm the situation, saying "we live in a rational community, and everybody knows this is just a movie", but just then, Cartman and his parade pass the synagogue.

Horrified, the rabbi and congregation go to the theater and demand that they stop showing ''The Passion''. Their argument with Cartman and his followers is interrupted by the arrival of the truck chaseâGibson crashes into the theater, destroying it. When he emerges unscathed, Cartman rushes to worship him, but Gibson ignores him and, rambling, first attempts one final time to force Stan and Kenny to give him his money back (which fails, as they refuse), and then smears his own excrement on a building, much to the astonishment of Kyle and the fan club members. Stan says that Christians should follow Jesus's teachings and not focus on how he died.  The fans agree and disperse, much to Cartman's dismay. Kyle says he feels better about his Jewishness after hearing Stan's speech and seeing Gibson, who defecates on Cartman's face and runs off whooping.

==Reception==
''The New York Times''' Virginia Heffernan praised the episode, writing "Depending on whom you asked, that episode, 'The Passion of the Jew,' proved that the show's still got it or that it's made a comeback or that it's better than ever. In any case, it was good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/28/arts/critic-s-notebook-what-morals-in-south-park.html|title=Critic's Notebook; What? Morals in 'South Park'?|author=Virginia Heffernan|work=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also praised by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the Jewish newspaper ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', which called it "perhaps the most biting critique of 'The Passion' to date."&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/5445/|title=âThe Passion of the Christâ Fuels Antisemitism â on âSouth Parkâ|author=Max Gross|work=The Jewish Daily Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DVD releases ==
Besides appearing on the ''[[South Park]]'' complete eighth season DVD set, "Passion of the Jew" is also available as a standalone DVD release (which was released on DVD the same day that the DVD of the ''[[Passion of the Christ]]'' was released) with two bonus episodes: season six's "[[Red Hot Catholic Love]]" and season seven's "[[Christian Rock Hard]]".

'''''Trompe-l'Åil''''' ([[French language|French]] for "deceive the eye", pronounced {{IPA-fr|tÊÉÌp lÅj|}}) is an art technique that uses realistic imagery to create the [[optical illusion]] that the depicted objects exist in three dimensions. [[Forced perspective]] is a comparable illusion in architecture.

Though the phrase, which can also be spelled without the [[hyphen]] and [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] in English as '''trompe l'oeil''',&lt;ref&gt;For example by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041108051506/http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2002/slideshow/slide-176-1.shtm National Gallery of Art, Washington]&lt;/ref&gt; originates in the [[Baroque]] period, when it refers to perspectival illusionism, trompe-l'Åil dates much further back. It was (and is) often employed in [[mural]]s. Instances from Greek and Roman times are known, for instance in [[Pompeii]]. A typical trompe-l'Åil mural might depict a window, door, or hallway, intended to suggest a larger room.

A version of an oft-told [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story concerns a contest between two renowned painters. [[Zeuxis]] (born around 464 BC) produced a still life painting so convincing that birds flew down to peck at the painted grapes. A rival, [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]], asked Zeuxis to judge one of his paintings that was behind a pair of tattered curtains in his study. Parrhasius asked Zeuxis to pull back the curtains, but when Zeuxis tried, he could not, as the curtains were included in Parrhasius's paintingâmaking Parrhasius the winner.

==Perspective==
With widespread fascination with [[perspective (graphical)|perspective drawing]] in the [[Renaissance]], Italian painters of the late [[Quattrocento]] such as [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1431â1506) and [[Melozzo da ForlÃ¬]] (1438â1494), began painting [[illusionistic ceiling painting]]s, generally in [[fresco]], that employed perspective and techniques such as [[Perspective (graphical)#Foreshortening|foreshortening]] to create the impression of greater space for the viewer below. This type of trompe l'Åil illusionism as specifically applied to ceiling paintings is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Di sotto in sÃ¹|di sotto in sÃ¹]]'', meaning "from below, upward" in Italian. The elements above the viewer are rendered as if viewed from true vanishing point perspective. Well-known examples are the [[Camera degli Sposi]] in [[Mantua]] and [[Antonio da Correggio]]'s (1489â1534) ''Assumption of the Virgin'' in the Duomo of [[Parma]]. Similarly, [[Vittorio Carpaccio]] (1460â1525) and [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] (c. 1440 â before 1516) added small trompe-l'Åil features to their paintings, playfully exploring the boundary between image and reality. For example, a [[fly]] might appear to be sitting on the painting's frame, or a curtain might appear to partly conceal the painting, a piece of paper might appear to be attached to a board, or a person might appear to be climbing out of the painting altogetherâall in reference to [[Zeuxis|the contest of Zeuxis and Parrhasius]]. In a 1964 seminar, the psychoanalyst and theorist [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901â1981) observed that the myth of the two painters reveals an interesting aspect of human cognition. While animals are attracted to superficial appearances, humans are enticed by the idea of things that are hidden.

==Quadratura==
Perspective theories in the 17th century allowed a more fully integrated approach to architectural illusion, which when used by painters to "open up" the space of a wall or ceiling is known as ''[[illusionistic ceiling painting#Quadratura|quadratura]]''. Examples include [[Pietro da Cortona]]'s ''Allegory of Divine Providence'' in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' [4] on the ceiling of the Roman church of [http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html Sant'Ignazio].
[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|Fresco with ''trompe l'Åil'' dome painted on low vaulting, [[Jesuitenkirche, Vienna|Jesuit Church]], [[Vienna]], by [[Andrea Pozzo]], 1703]]
{{Italic title}}
The [[Mannerist]] and [[Baroque]] style interiors of [[Jesuit]] churches in the 16th and 17th century often included such trompe-l'Åil ceiling paintings, which optically "open" the ceiling or dome to the heavens with a depiction of Jesus', [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s, or a saint's ascension or assumption. An example of a perfect architectural trompe-l'Åil is the illusionistic dome in the Jesuit church, Vienna, by [[Andrea Pozzo]], which is only slightly curved but gives the impression of true architecture.

Trompe-l'Åil paintings became very popular in Flemish and later in Dutch painting in the 17th century arising from the development of still life painting.  The Flemish painter [[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts|Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts]] created a chantournÃ© painting showing an easel holding a painting.  ChantournÃ© literally means 'cutout' and refers to a trompe l'Åil representation designed to stand away from a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webexhibits.org/arrowintheeye/illusion3.html 'Illusion, Delusion, Collusion, and Perceptual Paradox', in: Michael Kubovy and Christopher Tyler, Psychology of Perspective and Renaissance Art]&lt;/ref&gt;   The Dutch painter [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] was a master of the trompe-l'Åil and theorized on the role of art as the lifelike imitation of nature in his 1678 book, the ''Introduction to the Academy of Painting, or the Visible World'' (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst: anders de zichtbaere werelt'', Rotterdam, 1678).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Merriam, 'Seventeenth-century Flemish Garland Paintings: Still Life, Vision, and the Devotional Image', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A fanciful form of architectural trompe-l'Åil, '''quodlibet''', features realistically rendered paintings of such items as paper knives, playing cards, ribbons, and scissors, apparently accidentally left lying around.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |pages=880 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe-l'Åil can also be found painted on tables and other items of furniture, on which, for example, a deck of playing cards might appear to be sitting on the table. A particularly impressive example can be seen at [[Chatsworth House]] in [[Derbyshire]], where one of the internal doors appears to have a violin and bow suspended from it, in a trompe l'Åil painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaardt]].&lt;ref name=JvanderVaardtViolin&gt;{{cite web |last=van der Vaardt |first=Jan |title=Violin and bow hanging from door |url=http://art.chatsworth.org/image/455206/jan-van-der-vaart-violin-and-bow-hanging-on-a-door |work=Devonshire Collection |publisher=Bridgeman Art Library |accessdate=15 April 2012 |location=Chatsworth House UK |format=Painting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example can be found in the Painted Hall at the [[Old Royal Naval College]], Greenwich, London. This Wren building was painted by [[James Thornhill|Sir James Thornhill]], the first British born painter to be knighted and is a classic example of the baroque style popular in the early 18th century.  The American 19th-century still-life painter [[William Harnett]] specialized in trompe-l'Åil. In the 20th century, from the 1960s on, the American [[Richard Haas]] and many others painted large trompe-l'Åil murals on the sides of city buildings, and from beginning of the 1980s when German Artist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]] began to combine classical fresco art with contemporary content trompe-l'Åil became increasingly popular for interior murals. The Spanish painter [[Salvador DalÃ­]] utilized the technique for a number of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|af-jY2dC5XYC|Dali and Postmodernism|page=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other art forms==
Trompe-l'Åil, in the form of "[[forced perspective]]", has long been used in stage-theater [[set design]], so as to create the illusion of a much deeper space than the actual stage. A famous early example is the [[Teatro Olimpico]] in [[Vicenza]], with [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]]'s seven forced-perspective "streets" (1585), which appear to recede into the distance.

Trompe-l'Åil is employed in [[Donald O'Connor]]'s famous "Running up the wall" scene in the film ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1954). During the finale of his "Make 'em Laugh" number he first runs up a real wall. Then he runs towards what appears to be a hallway, but when he runs up this as well we realize that it is a large trompe-l'Åil mural. More recently, [[Roy Andersson]] has made use of similar techniques in his feature films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fourthreefilm.com/2015/06/a-pigeon-sat-on-a-branch-reflecting-on-existence-an-interview-with-cinematographer-istvan-borbas/|title=A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence â An Interview with Cinematographer IstvÃ¡n BorbÃ¡s|author=Bateman, Conor|publisher=4:3|date=11 June 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Matte painting]] is a variant of trompe-l'Åil, and is used in film production with elements of a scene are painted on glass panels mounted in front of the camera. 

Fictional trompe-l'Åil appears in many [[Looney Tunes]], such as the [[Road Runner cartoon]]s, where, for example, Wile E. Coyote paints a tunnel on a rock wall, and the Road Runner then races through the fake tunnel. This is usually followed by the coyote's foolishly trying to run through the tunnel after the road runner, only to smash into the hard rock-face. This [[Visual gag|sight gag]] was employed in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]], [[Richard Haas]] used a 16-story 1929 apartment hotel converted into a 1981 apartment building for trompe-l'Åil murals in homage to [[Chicago school architecture]]. One of the building's sides features the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], intended as a reflection of the actual building two miles south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/288.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=The City as Artifact |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/3766.html |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |title=Mural, ''Homage to the Chicago School'', by Richard Haas, 1980 |date= |accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of France's most illusive trompe-l'Åil artists is [[Jean Claude Adenin]], who has created installations for various wealthy clients.

Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'Åil works, a technique called [[street painting]] or "pavement art." These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include [[Julian Beever]], [[Edgar Mueller]], [[Leon Keer]] and [[Kurt Wenner]].

The Palazzo Salis of [[Tirano]], [[Italy]] has over centuries and throughout the palace used trompe l'Åil in place of more expensive real masonry, doors, staircases, balconies and draperies to create an illusion of sumptuousness and opulence.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, J. (2015) [http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil Tirano's Palace of Trompe L'Oeil: A Photographic Exhibition by John Paull] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208185147/http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/johnpaull/tiranos-palace-of-trompe-loeil |date=2015-12-08 }} SlideShare.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trompe l'Åil, in the form of "illusion painting", is also used in contemporary interior design, where illusionary wall paintings experienced a Renaissance since around 1980. Significant artists in this field are the German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], who invented, in the 1990s, a new method of producing illusion paintings, [[frescography]], and the English artist [[Graham Rust]].

The '''Valle dei Templi''' ({{IPA-it|Ëvalle dei ËtÉmpli}}; English: '''''Valley of the Temples'''''; {{lang-scn|'''Vaddi di li Tempri'''}}) is an archaeological site in [[Agrigento]] (ancient Greek ''Akragas''), [[Sicily]]. It is one of the most outstanding examples of [[Greater Greece]] art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a [[Monuments of Italy|national monument of Italy]]. The area was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list in 1997. Much of the excavation and restoration of the temples was due to the efforts of archaeologist [[Domenico Lo Faso Pietrasanta|Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta]] (1783â1863), who was the Duke of [[Serradifalco]] from 1809 through 1812. The Archaeological and Landscape Park of the Valley of the Temples is the largest archaeological site in the world with 1,300 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parcodeitempli.net/|title=Parco Valle dei Templi|date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "valley" is a misnomer, the site being located on a ridge outside the town of Agrigento.

==Overview==
[[File:Akragas-sitemap-bjs.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|none|Parco Archaeologico e Paesaggistico della Valle dei Templi]]
The Valley includes remains of seven temples, all in [[Doric style]]. The ascription of the names, apart from that of the ''Olympeion'', are a mere tradition established in Renaissance times. The temples are:

*Temple of [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]], whose name comes from a Latin inscription found nearby, and which was built in the 5th century BC. Turned into a church in the 6th century AD, it is now one of the best preserved in the Valley.
*Temple of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], also built in the 5th century BC. It was burnt in 406 BC by the [[Carthaginians]].
*Temple of [[Heracles]], who was one of the most venerated deities in the ancient ''Akragas''. It is the most ancient in the Valley: destroyed by an earthquake, it consists today of only eight columns.
*Temple of [[Mount Olympus|Olympian]] [[Zeus]], built in 480 BC to celebrate the city-state's victory over Carthage. It is characterized by the use of large scale [[Atlas (architecture)|atlases]].
*Temple of [[Castor and Pollux]]. Despite its remains including only four columns, it is now the symbol of modern Agrigento.
*Temple of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], also dating from the 5th century BC. It is thought to have been one of the most imposing constructions in the valley; it is now however one of the most eroded.
*Temple of [[Asclepius]], located far from the ancient town's walls; it was the goal of pilgrims seeking cures for illness.

The Valley is also home to the so-called Tomb of [[Theron of Akragas|Theron]], a large [[tuff]] monument of pyramidal shape; scholars suppose it was built to commemorate the Romans killed in the [[Second Punic War]].

==Temple of Concordia==

[[image:Agrigento-TempleF-Plan-bjs.png|thumb|Plan of the temple of Concordia.]]

Due to its good state of preservation, the Temple of Concordia is ranked amongst the most notable edifices of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] existing today. Notably the UNESCO symbol alludes to this temple's 6 column facade. It has a [[peristasis (architecture)|peristatis]] of 6 x 13 columns built over a basement of 39.44 x 16.91&amp;nbsp;m; each Doric column has twenty grooves and a slight [[entasis]], and is surmounted by an architrave with [[triglyph]]s and [[Metope (architecture)|metope]]s; also perfectly preserved are the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympani]]. The cella, preceded by a pronaos, is accessed by a single step; also existing are the pylons with the stairs which allowed to reach the roof and, over the cella's walls and in the blocks of the peristasis [[entablature]], the holes for the wooden [[beam (structure)|beam]] of the ceiling. The exterior and the interior of the temple were covered by polychrome [[stucco]]. The upper frame had gutters with lion-like [[protome]]s, while the roof was covered by marble tiles.

When the temple was turned into a church the entrance was moved to the rear, and the rear wall of the cella was destroyed. The spaces between the columns were closed, while 12 arched openings were created in the cella, in order to obtain a structure with one nave and two aisles. The pagan altar was destroyed and sacristies were carved out in the eastern corners. The sepultures visible inside and outside the temple date to the High Middle Age.

==Temple of Juno Lacinia==
[[image:Agrigent BW 2012-10-07 12-24-45.JPG|thumb|Temple of Juno.]]
{{main|Temple of Juno, Agrigento}}
This temple was constructed on a mostly artificial spur. It dates to c. 450 BC, measuring 38.15 x 16.90&amp;nbsp;m: it is in [[Doric style]], [[peripteros]] 6 columns wide by 13 long, preceded by a [[pronaos]] and [[opisthodomos]]. The basement has four steps.

Current remains (including [[anastylosis]] from the 18th Century onwards) consist of the front colonnade with parts of the [[architrave]] and of the [[frieze]]. Only fragments of the other three sides survive, with few elements of the [[cella]]. The building was damaged in the fire of 406 BC and restored in Roman times, with the substitution of marble tiles with ones of clay, and the addition of a steep rise in the area where today can be seen the remains of the altar.

Nearby are [[arcosolia]] and other sepultures from Byzantine times, belonging to the late 6th century AD renovation of the Temple of Concordia into a Christian church.

==Temple of Asclepius==
The temple of Asclepius is located in the middle of the San Gregorio plain. Its identification is based on a mention by [[Polybius]] (I, 18, 2), who states that the temple was "in front of the city", one mile away. However, as the actual distance does not correspond and the size of the building is relatively small, scholars remains dubious about this attribution.

The small temple, probably dating to the late 5th century BC and measuring 21.7 x 10.7&amp;nbsp;m, rises over a basement with three steps. Its peculiarity is the fake opysthodomus with two semi-columns in the external side of the rear cella. Also extant are parts of the entablature, with lion-like protomes, a frieze and a ''[[geison]]'' [[pediment]].

The sanctuary housed a bronze statue of [[Apollo]] by [[Myron]], a gift to the city by [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]], which was stolen by [[Verres]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''Verrinae'', II 4, 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple of Heracles==
{{main|Temple of Heracles, Agrigento}}
[[File:AgrigentoTemples-pjt2.jpg|thumb|Remains of the Temple of Heracles.]]
The traditional name of this temple comes from another mention by Cicero&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verrinae'', II 4,94&lt;/ref&gt; about a temple dedicated to the classical hero "not far from the forum"; however, it has never been proven the latter (the ''[[agora]]'' of the Greek city) was located in this point.

Stylistically, the temple belongs to the last years of the 6th century BC. It has been also suggested that this temple was one of the first built under [[Theron of Acragas|Theron]]. Also the [[entablature]], of which parts have been found, would date it to the 470-460s or the middle 5th century BC (though the more recent remains could be a replacement of the older ones). One hypothesis is that the temple was begun before the [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]], to be completed only in the following decades. [[Polyaenus]] mentions a temple of Athena being built under Theron outside the city, which could be identified with that of "Hercules", though also with a new one in the inner [[acropolis]].

The building, with 20th-century anastylosis, measures 67 x 25.34&amp;nbsp;m, with a peristais of 6 x 15&amp;nbsp; Doric columns and a cella with pronaos and opysthodomus, is located over a three-step basement. It is the first example (later become common in the Agrigento temples) of pylons inserted between the pronaos and cella, housing the stair which allowed inspections of the roof. The columns are rather high and have wide [[capital (architecture)|capitals]]. On the eastern side are remains of the large altar.

==''Olympeion'' field==
{{main|Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento}}
[[image:Agrigento Telamon.jpg|thumb|Remains of one [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] in the Olympeion field.]]
On the other side of the road running through the Golden Gate of the ancient city, is a plain commanded by the huge ''Olympeion'' field. This includes a ''platea'' with a large temple to Olympian Zeus, plus other areas still under investigation. These include a sanctuary, with remains of a paved square, a complex ''[[sacellum]]'' ("holy enclosure") and a ''[[Tholos (Ancient Rome)|tholos]]''. This, after another gate, is followed by a sanctuary of [[chthonic]] deities, an archaic sanctuary, the so-called ''colimbetra'' (where was a still unknown gate) and the tip of the spur where the sanctuary is located, with the temple of Vulcan.

The Olympeion complex's main attraction is the huge temple of Olympian Zeus, which was described with enthusiastic words by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and mentioned by Polybius.&lt;ref&gt;IX 27,9.&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is reduced to ruins due to destruction begun in antiquity and continued through the 18th century, when the temple was used as a quarry for the port of [[Porto Empedocle]].

Near the south-western corner of the temples is a small edifice (12,45 x 5,90&amp;nbsp;m) with two naves and a deep ''pronaos'', a double entrance and what has been identified as an altar. Its dating is controversial, though scholars have assigned it to the archaic era, due to the discovery of numerous 6th century BC vases. Also archaic is another ''sacellum'', which later was replaced by a classical edifice. These are followed by the scant remains of a temple (called "Tempio L") dating to the mid-5th century BC, measuring 41.8 x 20.20 meters, to which, in the 3rd century BC, a Hellenistic entablature was added.

{{wide image|Panorama Remains of one reconsructed atlas in the Olympeion field.jpg|750px|Panorama Remains of one reconstructed [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] in the Olympeion field}}

==Temple of the Dioscuri==
[[image:Temple of the Dioscuri - Valle dei Templi - Agrigento - Italy 2015 (6).JPG|thumb|The re-assembled remains of the Temples of "Castor and Pollux".]]
North of Temple L is the "Temple of the Dioscuri," [[Castor and Pollux]], the northwest corner of which is in a misleading modern reconstruction from the early 19th century, created using pieces from various other temples. It includes four columns and an entablature. The temple itself measures {{convert|31 x 13.39|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and would likely have been a Doric peripteral with 6 x 13 columns, dating to about the mid-5th c. BC.

==Temple of Hephaestus==
On the other side of the valley is the last spur of the hill, commanded by the remains of the Temple of [[Hephaestus]] (also called the Temple of Vulcan), although the exact deity to whom it is dedicated is unknown. It is a Doric-style peripteral building measuring {{convert|43 x 20.85|m|ft|abbr=on}}, mounted on a four-step ''[[crepidoma]]'' and having 6 x 13 columns; it dates to around 430 BC. It was build over an archaic ''sacellumm'' which measures {{convert|13.25 x 6.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its decoration, dating to ca. 560-550 BC, has been recently reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parco Valle dei Templi|url=https://www.parcovalledeitempli.it/?cat=4&amp;lang=en|publisher=Parco Archeologico Valle dei Templi di Agrigento|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other remains==
On the western side of the city are the remains of Gates VI and VII, the first probably lying on the road to Heracles, the second having two towers and two external bastions (one having 15-metre thick walls); northwards are the remains of Gates VIII and IX, now surrounded by illegal buildings.

At the western tip of the area in which the Temple of Concordia lies, are parts of a late-ancient or early-medieval necropolis, constructed on existing cisterns. Other tombs and [[catacombs]] are visible in the so-called ''Grotte Fragapane'', dating to the 4th century AD.

These late-Roman and Byzantine necropolises lie in an area used for tombs since ancient times. One of these, the so-called Tomb of [[Theron of Acragas|Theron]], is a ''naiskos'' sepulchre with square plan. Gate IV is located near the tomb of Theron: probably one of the most important in the city, as it led to the sea.

West of the ''Olympeion'', are remains of two insulae (residences) 38&amp;nbsp;m wide, connected by a square to the ancient Gate V. It is likely that they were built re-using structures belonging to the sacred area of the ''Olympeion''. Nearby is a sanctuary with an L-shaped [[portico]] from the early 5th century BC, which is annexed to Gate V. In the area are also two archaic (mid-6th century BC) temples.

On the northern side of Gate V is a large stone square leading to the "Sanctuary of the Chthonic Gods".

The so-called "Oratory of [[Phalaris]]" is in fact a Roman temple, measuring 12.40 x 8.85&amp;nbsp;m.

The '''Victorian restoration''' was the widespread and extensive [[wikt:refurbish|refurbishment]] and rebuilding of [[Church of England]] [[church (building)|churches]] and cathedrals that took place in England and Wales during the 19th-century [[Victorian era|reign of Queen Victoria]]. It was not the same process as is understood today by the term [[building restoration]].

Against a background of poorly maintained church buildings; a reaction against the [[Puritan]] ethic manifested in the [[Gothic Revival]]; and a shortage of churches where they were needed in cities, the [[Cambridge Camden Society]] and the [[Oxford Movement]] advocated a return to a more medieval attitude to churchgoing. The change was embraced by the Church of England which saw it as a means of reversing the decline in [[church attendance]].

The principle was to "restore" a church to how it might have looked during the "[[English Gothic architecture|Decorated]]" style of architecture which existed between 1260 and 1360, and many famous architects such as [[George Gilbert Scott]] and [[Ewan Christian]] enthusiastically accepted commissions for restorations. It is estimated that around 80% of all Church of England churches were affected in some way by the movement, varying from minor changes to complete demolition and rebuilding.

Influential people like [[John Ruskin]] and [[William Morris]] were opposed to such large-scale restoration, and their activities eventually led to the formation of societies dedicated to building preservation, such as the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. In retrospect, the period of Victorian restoration has been viewed in a generally unfavourable light.

==Background==
[[File:Lich Cath Face.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The west front of [[Lichfield Cathedral]] as restored by [[George Gilbert Scott]]]]
A number of factors working together led to the spate of Victorian restoration.

From the time of the [[English Reformation]] onwards, apart from necessary repairs so that buildings might remain in use, and the addition of occasional internal commemorative adornments, English churches and cathedrals were subjected to little building work and only piecemeal restoration. This situation lasted for about 250 years with the fabric of many churches and cathedrals suffering from neglect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bramhope Puritan Chapel - geograph.org.uk - 1603796.jpg|thumb|right|The unrestored interior of the Puritan Chapel, [[Bramhope]], West Yorkshire]]
In addition, ever since the mid-17th century [[Puritan]] reforms which were typified by a minimum of ritual and decoration and by an unambiguous emphasis on preaching there had been an ongoing removal of any emotion or colour from English religious services as a means of distancing itself from what was seen as the excesses of Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Mari 2010, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; But towards the end of the 18th century the burgeoning [[Gothic Revival]] and interest in [[medievalism]] encouraged people to seek more interest in their religious services. The popularity of the Gothic Revival was seen by Church officials as a way to reverse the decline in church attendance, and thereby start to reassert the Church's power, prosperity and influence. They therefore pushed for massive restoration programs.&lt;ref&gt;Mari 2010, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a third factor, the industrial revolution had resulted in many people living in cities that had few churches to cater for their religious needsâfor instance [[Stockport]] had a population of nearly 34,000 but church seating for only 2,500.&lt;ref&gt;Port 2006, p.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in [[dissenter]] [[Religious denomination|denominations]], such as [[Methodism]] and the [[Religious Society of Friends]], was seen as further evidence of this shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;Port 2006, pp.17â18, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; To fulfil this need, between 1818 and 1824 the Government had granted Â£1.5 million for building new churches.&lt;ref&gt;Mari 2010, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Known as [[Commissioners' church]]es, most of them cost only Â£4,000 to Â£5,000 each to build, and dissatisfaction with their indifferent design and cheap construction provoked a strong reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, pp.98, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equivalent movements existed in most of Europe, especially northern Europe, with the French architect and architectural historian [[EugÃ¨ne Viollet-le-Duc]] especially associated with the French manifestation.

==Driving forces==

===The Cambridge Camden Society===
{{Quote box

}}
One of the main driving forces for the restoration of churches was the [[Cambridge Camden Society]] (CCS), which was founded in 1839 by two [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] undergraduates, [[John Mason Neale]] and [[Benjamin Webb (clergyman)|Benjamin Webb]], as a club for those who shared a common interest in Gothic church design.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, pp.155, 160â1.&lt;/ref&gt; It rapidly became popular: its membership increased from 8 to 180 in its first 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake 1872, pp.&amp;nbsp;196â7.&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially a society for recording and discussing medieval church features, the members of the CCS soon began to expostulate in their journal ''The Ecclesiologist'' and particularly in their ''Few Words to Church-builders'' of 1844 that the only "correct" form for a church building was the "middle pointed" or "[[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated]]" style,&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, p.170â1.&lt;/ref&gt; in which churches had been built during the hundred years centred on 1300. Ecclesiology obviously struck a chord in society: it was closely linked with the ongoing interest in [[medievalism]] and the [[Gothic Revival]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake 1872, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CCS's firm insistence on one style being correct proved to be a beacon for those who were no longer able to judge for themselves what was "good" in architectureâthe certainties of the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] rules having lost their power during the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] that had been in vogue since the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; The CCS stated that there were two possible ways in which a church could be restored. As [[Kenneth Clark]] put it, they said that one could "either restore each of the various alterations and additions in its own style, or restore the whole church to the best and purest style of which traces remain".&lt;ref name=Clark173&gt;Clark 1962, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society wholeheartedly recommended the second option and since virtually every medieval church had at least some small remnant of decorated style, maybe a porch or even just a window, the whole church would be "restored" to match it. And if the earliest portions were too late, then it was a candidate for a complete rebuild in the "correct" style.&lt;ref name=Clark173 /&gt;

"To restore," ''The Ecclesiologist'' declared, "is to revive the original appearance&amp;nbsp;... lost by decay, accident or ill-judged alteration". They did later admit, though, that such "restoration" might create an ideal state that the building had never been in.&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt;

===Oxford Movement===
Church restorations were also strongly influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from preaching to the [[sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]]: from the [[pulpit]] to the [[altar]]. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position to the side of the church, replacing [[box pew]]s with open pews, creating a central [[aisle]] to give a better view of the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger [[chancel]] was required for the associated ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Activities==
Persuaded by the Cambridge Camden Society that [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] was the only correct style, and by the Oxford Movement's theories concerning the nature of worship, a spate of "restoration" was soon under way. Some figures give an idea of the scale. A total of 3,765 new and rebuilt churches were [[Consecration|consecrated]] in the forty years up to 1875, with the most active decade being the 1860s in which there were more than 1,000 such consecrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|page=9|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 7,000 parish churches in England and Wales â which is nearly 80% of all of them â were restored in some way between 1840 and 1875.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mari 2010, p.34 quoting Miele 1995, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt; There were 150% more people identified as professional architects in the 1871 census than in 1851 â it is known that established architects passed small restoration jobs on to their newly qualified colleagues, since such work provided good practice.&lt;ref&gt;Miele 1995, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The retention of original material (carving, woodwork, etc.) tended to be of little importance to the early restorers: appearance was all, and much good old work was discarded to be replaced by modern replacement in the chosen style.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, pp.172â3, p.211; Mari 2010, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Different architects had different degrees of sympathy with original material, and as the century progressed greater care was generally taken;&lt;ref name=VW /&gt; this was at least partly as a result of the increasingly louder voices that were raised in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Mari 2010, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of the type of work undertaken in one church, in 1870â71 the [[Church of St Peter, Great Berkhamsted]] was the subject of a restoration programme by [[William Butterfield]], whose other works included churches such as [[All Saints, Margaret Street]] in London. Butterfield's restoration involved the removal of some original features, including the obliteration of paintings on the pillars. The most substantial structural changes involved raising both the roof and the floor of the chancel, raising the roof of the south transept to its original pitch, removing the vestry, incorporating the south porch into the south aisle and removing the door, re-flooring the nave, installing new oak benches and replacing an earlier gallery. Butterfield also installed clear windows in the clerestory, allowing more light to enter the nave. He extended the aisles by knocking down the dividing walls of two chambers at the west end. On the exterior of the church, Butterfield removed the crumbling [[stucco]] that had been added in 1820 and re-faced the church walls with [[flint]] [[flushwork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

At [[Lichfield Cathedral]], the 18th century had been a period of decay: the 15th-century library was pulled down, most of the statues on the west front were removed, and the stonework covered with [[Roman cement]]. After some structural work early in the 19th century by [[James Wyatt]], the ornate west front (pictured above) was restored by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. It includes many ornate carved figures of kings, queens and saints, created from original materials where possible and new imitations and additions when the originals were not available. Wyatt's [[choir-screen]] had utilised medieval stone-work which Scott in turn used to create the clergy's seats in the sanctuary. A new metal screen by [[Francis Skidmore]] and [[John Birnie Philip]] to designs by Scott was installed, as was a [[Mintons|Minton tile]] pavement stretching from choir screen to altar, inspired by medieval tiles found in the Choir foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Famous architects like [[George Gilbert Scott]], [[Ewan Christian]]&lt;!-- add details of his restoration of [[St Peter's Wolverhampton]] (ref name=VW) --&gt;, [[William Butterfield]] and [[George Edmund Street]] became enthusiastic "restorers" and the wave of restoration spread across the country so that by 1875 something like 80% of all churches in England had been affected in some way.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1850 Scott wrote a book ''A plea for the faithful restoration of our Ancient Churches'', in which he stated that "as a general rule it is highly desirable to preserve those vestiges of the growth and history of buildings which are indicated by the various styles and irregularities of its parts". However he did not follow this principle in practice, generally sweeping away all later changes and reconstructing the church in a uniform early style, sometimes on the evidence of just one remaining early feature.&lt;ref name=ACR&gt;{{cite web

==Opposition==
There were opponents. The Reverend John Louis Petit was a staunch and well respected opponent from his first book, Remarks on Church Architecture (1841) until his death in 1868. The Archaeological Society was founded in 1845 by Antiquarians anxious to bring the love of old buildings to a wider audience. Although [[John Ruskin]] was generally in favour of new buildings in an early Gothic style,&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake 1872, p.273.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1849 he wrote in ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' that it was not possible "to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture". The Society of Antiquaries of London urged in 1855 that "no restoration should ever be attempted, otherwise than&amp;nbsp;... in the sense of preservation from further injuries".&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt;

A later vociferous opponent was [[William Morris]] who campaigned against the proposed restoration of [[St John the Baptist Church, Inglesham]] in the 1880s and started the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] (SPAB) in 1877 when he heard of the proposed restoration of [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] by Scott.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=18 September 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles espoused by SPAB took some time to attract support, but the policy of putting "Protection in place of Restoration" eventually took hold, and are adhered to today.&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt; Morris also wrote in 1877:
[[File:Wmmorris3248.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[William Morris]], who strongly opposed restoration]]
{{quote|"But of late years a great uprising of ecclesiastical zeal, coinciding with a great increase of study, and consequently of knowledge of medieval architecture has driven people into spending their money on these buildings, not merely with the purpose of repairing them, of keeping them safe, clean, and wind and water-tight, but also of "restoring" them to some ideal state of perfection; sweeping away if possible all signs of what has befallen them at least since the Reformation, and often since dates much earlier."&lt;ref&gt;[[William Morris]], ''The Lesser Arts'' (1877), quoted in Mari 2010, pp.19â20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite his opposition, though, it is known that Morris profited greatly by his firm's provision of stained glass to many restoration projects,&lt;ref&gt;Mari 2010, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been noted that his criticism only started after his firm was securely established as a supplier to these projects.&lt;ref&gt;Miele 1995, p.153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further opposition came from evangelical Protestants, who believed that "ornamental carved work, decorative painting, encaustic tiles, and stained glass were foolish vanities which lead the heart astray",&lt;ref name=E190&gt;Eastlake 1872, p.&amp;nbsp;190â1.&lt;/ref&gt; and from others who were concerned about the cost: "For the cost of one stone church with a groined roof, or even an open timbered roof, two might be built in brick with plaster ceilings; and who could dare to say that worship in the plainer building would be less devout or sincere than that which was offered in the other?"&lt;ref name=E190 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Not all Catholics were in favour either: late in his life [[Cardinal Wiseman]] made it clear that his preference was for Renaissance art, as might be expected of a religious order of Italian origin.&lt;ref&gt;Eastlake 1872, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a 20th-century perspective the process of Victorian restoration has often been viewed unfavourably, with terms such as "ruthless", "insensitive" and "heavy-handed" being commonly used to describe the work done.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, Reed 1997, p.338: "Much of his [George Gilbert Scott's] restoration work was undoubtedly insensitive, heavy-handed, and ruthless"; and {{cite book

|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|page=78}} "...&amp;nbsp;prior to a ruthless Victorian restoration&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to his book ''The Gothic Revival'' (first published in 1928), [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote "The real reason the Gothic Revival had been neglected is that it produced so little on which our eyes can rest without pain".&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Clark also reckoned that Decorated Gothic was the worst of the [[English Gothic architecture|three possible styles]] that could have been adoptedâthe others being Early English which had "very little detail which an ordinary craftsman could not manage"&lt;!--(not enough detail, said Camden Soc)--&gt;, and Perpendicular which was "infinitely the most adaptable of medieval styles"&lt;!--(Camden Soc said it couldn't be considered because the architects were corrupt by then)--&gt;. Clark pointed out that Decorated was the most difficult to execute,&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1962, pp.171â2.&lt;/ref&gt; not least because of the complicated window [[tracery]] that set it apart from the other two Gothic styles.

However, not all restoration work was purely negative: a side effect of a number of restorations was the rediscovery of long-lost features, for instance Anglo-Saxon carving that had been incorporated into Norman foundations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Warren County PCB Landfill''' was a [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] [[landfill]] located in [[Warren County, North Carolina|Warren County]], [[North Carolina]], near the community of [[Afton, North Carolina|Afton]] south of [[Warrenton, NC|Warrenton]]. The landfill was created in 1982 by the State of North Carolina as a place to dump [[soil contamination|contaminated soil]] as result of an illegal [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] dumping incident. The site, which is about {{convert|150|acre|km2}}, was extremely controversial and led to years of [[lawsuits]]. 
Warren County was one of the first cases of [[environmental justice]] in the [[United States]] and set a [[legal precedent]] for other environmental justice cases.  The site was approximately three miles south of [[Warrenton, North Carolina|Warrenton]].  The State of North Carolina owned about {{convert|19|acre|m2}} of the tract where the landfill was located, and Warren County owned the surrounding acreage around the borders.&lt;ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the Warren County [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] [[landfill]], as the public knew it, was to bury 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil that had been contaminated with toxic PCBs between June and August, 1978, by Robert J. Burns, a business associate with Robert "Buck" Ward of the Ward PCB Transformer Company of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. Burns and his sons deliberately dripped 31,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil along some 240 miles of highway shoulders in 14 counties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leagle.com/decision/1982770676F2d94_1753/UNITED%20STATES%20v.%20WARD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncpcbarchives.com/?page_id=144&lt;/ref&gt; Burns of Jamestown, New York, was supposed to take the oil to a facility to be recycled. Allegedly, the rationale for Burns' crime was that he wanted to save money by circumventing new [[EPA]] regulations that would make waste disposal more transparent and costly. But he could have easily, discreetly, and illegally disposed of the PCB-contaminated oil in a matter of hours. Burns and Ward were sent to prison for a short time for their involvement in the crime. The Ward Transformer site would later go onto the EPA [[Superfund]] cleanup list and be the primary polluter of [[Lake Crabtree]] and the [[Neuse River]] [[drainage basin|basin]] in the vicinity of Raleigh, North Carolina. Contaminants from the Ward site have been detoxified, but the area around the site and surrounding creeks, lakes, and rivers have been permanently polluted.

Soon after the "midnight PCB dumpings," the state erected large warning signs along the roadsides, making the public feel as if the roadside PCBs posed an imminent public health threat. However, the Hunt administration let the PCBs remain for four years as they spread into the environment, while Warren County citizens fiercely opposed the PCB landfill. The Governor, the North Carolina General Assembly, and the EPA found they would have to make the political, legal, and regulatory preparations to forcibly bury the PCBs in Warren County. 

The Warren County PCB landfill was permitted as a "dry-tomb" toxic waste landfill by the EPA under the Toxic Substances Control Act. The EPA approved the "dry-tomb" PCB landfill which failed from the beginning because it was capped with nearly a million gallons of water in it.  The site never operated as a commercial facility because residents forced the Governor to include in the deed that it was a one-time only toxic waste facility.  The landfill was built with plastic liners, a clay cap, and PVC pipes which allowed for methane and toxic gas to be released from the landfill. Although state officials told citizens they planned to build the landfill with a perforated pipe [[leachate]] collection system under the landfill, a system critical to a functioning "dry-tomb" landfill, no such leachate collection system was ever installed. The nearly 1 million gallons of water that was capped in the "dry-tomb" landfill could not be pumped out, and citizens later learned from state rainfall and landfill monitoring data that tens of thousands of gallons of water had been entering and exiting the landfill for years. Within a few months of burying the PCBs, EPA found significant PCB air emissions at the landfill and 1/2 mile away, but citizens did not learn about this report for another 15 years. The 60,000 tons of PCB-contaminated soil were buried within about 7 feet of [[groundwater]]. Warren County's first independent scientist, Dr. Charles Mulchi, had predicted that the landfill would inevitably fail because of unsuitable soils and close proximity to groundwater.  He had pointed out at a January 4, 1979, EPA public hearing that state scientists had misrepresented the depths of soil sample testing they had conducted at the site.  At Dr. Mulchi's insistence, the state added a plastic top liner to the landfill.

According to detoxification expert, Dr. Joel Hirshhorn, who represented Warren County citizens as they pressed Governor Hunt and the NC General Assembly for funding for a cleanup, the Warren county PCB landfill was an utter failure that should never have been approved by the [[EPA]].

&lt;ref&gt;Ferruccio, Deborah, ncpcbarchives.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Beginning with [[North Carolina Governor|Governor]] [[Jim Hunt|Hunt]]'s administration's December 20, 1978, announcement that "public sentiment would not deter the state from burying the PCBs in Warren County," the [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] [[landfill]] was surrounded by controversy. The landfill was located in rural Warren County, which was primarily [[African American]]. Warren County has about 18,000 people living in the county. Sixty-nine percent of the residents are non-[[white people|white]], and twenty percent of the residents live below the federal poverty level. The county has been determined as a Tier I county for economic development. The state claimed that the Warren County site was the best available site; however, the site selection process was not based on scientific criteria â soil permeability properties or the distance to [[groundwater]] â but on other, less tangible criteria, including the demographics of the county.  EPA and state officials claimed they could compensate for improper soil qualities and the close proximity to groundwater with the engineering design of their "state-of-the-art", "dry-tomb", zero-percent discharge landfill. 

After four years of arduous due process in an effort to stop the PCB landfill, including litigation, Warren County citizens officially launched the [[environmental justice]] movement as they lay in front of 10,000 truckloads of contaminated PCB soil. During the six-week trucking opposition, with collective nonviolent direct action, which included over 550 arrests, Warren County citizens mounted what the [[Duke Chronicle]] described as "the largest [[civil disobedience]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] since Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], marched through [[Alabama]]." It was the first time in American history that citizens were jailed for trying to stop a [[landfill]], from attempting to prevent pollution. In an editorial titled "Dumping on the Poor," the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described Warren County's PCB protest movement as "the marriage of environmentalism with civil rights," and in its ''1994 Environmental Equity Draft'', the EPA described the PCB protest movement as "the watershed event that led to the environmental equity movement of the 1980's."  With public pressure mounting, Governor Hunt then pledged to Warren citizens that when technology became available, the state would detoxify the PCB landfill. It was a pledge that would haunt him in his 3rd and 4th terms in office.

Durham, NC: The Regulator Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting controversy led to the coining of the phrase "environmental racism" and galvanized the [[environmental justice]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pezzullo, Phaedra C. (2001, Winter).  Performing Critical Interruptions: Rhetorical Invention and Narratives of the Environmental Justice Movement.  Western Journal of Communication, 64:1, pp. 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decontamination ==

In May, 1993, more than 10 years after the Governor promised to detoxify the [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] [[landfill]] when it became feasible, and soon after stopping a huge trash landfill to be located near the PCB landfill, citizens learned that there was "an emergency" at the PCB landfill because of nearly a million gallons of water in that landfill that threatened to  breach the liner. Speaking and negotiating for Warren County citizens as he had done a decade before, Ken Ferruccio laid out a ''5-Point Framework'' for resolving the PCB landfill crisis and demanded from the Hunt administration (Governor [[Jim Hunt]]'s 3rd of 4 terms in office):
* The state continue to monitor and maintain the PCB landfill
* A joint citizen/state committee be formed to mutually address the failures of the PCB landfill
* The solution to the failed PCB landfill remain on site
* Citizens be given independent scientific representation
* Permanent detoxification of the PCB landfill be the ultimate goal

Governor [[Jim Hunt|Hunt]] agreed to the ''Framework'' and the Joint Warren County/State PCB Landfill Working Group was formed.

For the next decade, as citizens tenaciously attempted to hold the Governor to his public pledge and pressed the legislature to fund an on-site, permanent cleanup that would not require dumping on another community, citizens set environmental justice precedents based on universal principles, and they continued to influence public policies and waste disposal decision-making. Ultimately, however, the state and the EPA protected their own interests and never admitted that the landfill had been leaking or that they were cleaning it up because it failed. The rationale for the cleanup became that Governor [[Jim Hunt|Hunt]] wanted to live up to his detoxification promise.  Consequently, the state and the EPA evaded long-term liability for the PCB landfill and hid the truth about EPA's failed, "dry-tomb" landfills. Citizens got a cleanup, but it was without qualified independent detoxification oversight and the cleanup standards and protection they deserved. 

In 1999, the North Carolina General Assembly promised about eight million dollars to go towards cleanup with another group would be willing to match it.  The EPA was deemed a "match" and the cleanup project was able to move forward.  In November 2000 an environmental engineering firm, Earth Tech, was hired to serve as the oversight contractor.

In December 2000, public bids were taken for the site-detoxifying contract.  The [[IT group]] was awarded the [[contract]], with their bid of 13.5 million dollars.  Phase I of the cleanup process began, and the contract was signed in March 2001.  The IT group was bought by the [[Shaw Group]], in May 2002, and changed their name to Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure.  The equipment was sent to the landfill in May 2002, and an open house was held so community members could view the site before the start-up.

The follow-up tests on the site were performed in 2002. The EPA demonstrated test onto the PCB Landfill in January 2003. Based on the test results, an interim operations permit was granted in March. The soil treatment was then completed in October 2003, and in total 81,600 tons of soil was treated for the landfill site. The soil which was treated was the soil that was on the roadside and the soil adjacent to it that had been in the landfill and had been cross-contaminated.  The equipment at the site was decontaminated and removed from the site at the end of 2003.  The final cost of the cleanup project of the landfill was 17.1 million dollars. (Much of this money paid for various costly studies and administrative costs. It was not the price of the actual detoxification.) The Based Catalyzed Decomposition detoxification was completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;

"'''When You Wish Upon a Weinstein'''" is the twenty-second episode of ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]], and the original [[series finale]]. It originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] on November 9, 2003, and on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 10, 2004. In the episode, Peter prays for a [[Jew]] to help him with his financial woes. After befriending a Jewish accountant, Max Weinstein, and discovering the wonders of their religion, Peter gets the idea of converting Chris to [[Judaism]] so he will be successful in life. Lois attempts to stop him, believing that success is not based on religion.

"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" was written by [[Ricky Blitt]] and directed by [[Dan Povenmire]]. A holdover from the second season's production run, the episode was intended to air in 2000 towards the beginning of the third season, but [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] executives were concerned about its content, believing it could be interpreted as [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], and did not allow it to air on television. Due to popular demand, it was instead first aired on Adult Swim in 2003. This episode features guest performances from Andrea Beutener, [[Mark Hamill]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Peter Riegert]], [[Mary Scheer]], [[Ben Stein]], and [[Nicole Sullivan]].

==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] gives [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]'s "rainy-day fund" to Jim Kaplan the [[confidence trick|scam artist]] selling [[volcano]] [[insurance]]. That night, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] breaks [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]'s glasses because he hates being watched while he sleeps. Lois tells Peter that he needs to recover the money to buy their daughter a new pair of glasses. After hearing [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] talk about how men with Jewish-sounding names have helped them achieve financial success, Peter decides that he needs a [[Jew]] to handle his money in an elaborate musical number.

When a Jewish man named Max Weinstein has car trouble outside the Griffin house, Peter takes it as a sign. After a foot chase, Peter pressures Max into helping him get the emergency money back, and he recovers the money from Kaplan. After inviting Max to dinner and accompanying him to a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[synagogue]], Peter comes to the conclusion that [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] would become smart and successful if he converted to [[Judaism]]. The two sneakily drive to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] for a quickie [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].

Lois learns of the Bar Mitzvah from [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] (by means of torturing him with a dog whistle), and borrows Quagmire's car. She arrives just in time to stop the ceremony, but the congregants, angry that Lois is apparently insulting their religion, attack the Griffins. The family escapes just in time, locking the synagogue's door using a large [[star of David]] and getting back home on a [[bus]]. Lois points out that one's success is not based upon religion, and Peter realizes the error of his ways and makes up to the family. However, as it turns out, the bus is full of [[nun]]s who, displeased that Peter strayed from [[Catholicism]], attack the family with rulers.

==Cultural references==
Peter's song, "I Need a Jew", is a parody of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]". The scene where Lois tried to stop the Bar Mitzvah is a parody of the ending of ''[[The Graduate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Family Guy Creators' Fair Use Wish Comes True | first=Cydney A. | last=Tune | first2=Jenna F. | last2=Leavitt | journal=[[Entertainment and Sports Lawyer]] | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | volume=27 | number=2 | date=Summer 2009 | via=Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP | url=http://www.pillsburylaw.com/siteFiles/Publications/E1528D31DFE1827EFBED489AB8BC6F13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Peter says "Uh-oh" as he soils himself in the Synagogue, it sounds like "Eh-oh" from the ''[[Teletubbies]]''.

==Production==
[[File:Dan Povenmire Comic-Con 2009.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Dan Povenmire directed the episode.]]
"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein" was written by [[Ricky Blitt]] and directed by [[Dan Povenmire]].

In addition to the regular cast, voice actress Andrea Beutener, actor [[Mark Hamill]], voice actor [[Phil LaMarr]], actor [[Ed McMahon]], actor [[Peter Riegert]], actress [[Mary Scheer]], actor [[Ben Stein]], and voice actress [[Nicole Sullivan]] guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voices in the episode include [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]], [[Ricky Blitt]], [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], and [[Wally Wingert]].

Though the episode was aired during the third season, it was a holdover from the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second production season]]. Fox network executives were concerned that the episode could be construed as anti Semitic, and decided not to air the episode after it had completed post production.&lt;ref name="aired"&gt;[[Chicago Sun-Times]] (November 27, 2004) ''[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20041127/ai_n12570196 Fox to air 'Family Guy' episode once considered anti-Semitic.]''&lt;/ref&gt; It aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s programming block [[Adult Swim]] in 2003, and then it aired on Fox in 2004.&lt;ref name="aired"/&gt;

On the DVD commentary for the episode, Seth MacFarlane mentions that he showed the script of the episode to two rabbis, both of whom approved the episode "because Peter learns the right lesson at the end". MacFarlane also points out that 70% of the show's writers are Jewish, including Ricky Blitt, who wrote the episode,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The gospel according to the Simpsons: bigger and possibly even better! edition with a new afterword exploring South park, Family guy, and other animated TV shows|author=Mark I.

==Reception and lawsuit==
Lisa Keys of ''[[The Forward]]'' wrote that the episode is "not necessarily demeaning to Jews" but "too vapid to be funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/3973/|title=Bar Mitzvah-gate, Courtesy of Fox|work=[[The Forward]]|author=Keys, Lisa|date=December 10, 2004|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2007, the [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers|Bourne Company]] publishing house, sole owner of the song "[[When You Wish upon a Star]]", filed a lawsuit against several Fox divisions, [[Cartoon Network]], [[Fuzzy Door Productions]], ''Family Guy'' producer [[Seth MacFarlane]] and composer [[Walter Murphy]], claiming [[copyright infringement]] over "I Need a Jew", seeking unspecified [[damages]] and to halt the program's distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/04/wishuponastar.lawsuit.ap/index.html |title=It's 'Wish Upon a Star' vs. 'Family Guy' |accessdate=2007-10-04 |publisher=CNN.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011004945/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/04/wishuponastar.lawsuit.ap/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071004/ap_on_en_mu/wish_upon_a_star_lawsuit|title = Classic song's owner sues over spoof|accessdate = 2007-10-06|last = Neumeister|first = Larry|authorlink = The Associated Press|date=2007-10-04|work = Yahoo!
