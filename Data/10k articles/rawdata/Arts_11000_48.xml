      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8645">{{Other uses|Act (disambiguation)}}

An '''act''' is a division or unit of a [[theatre]] work, including a [[play (theatre)|play]], [[film]], [[opera]], and [[musical theatre]]. The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Secret Life of Plays|last=Waters|first=Steve|publisher=Nick Hern Books|year=2010|isbn=978 1 84842 000 7|location=London|pages=32|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. The former use of the term may or may not align with the latter. The word ''act'' can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as [[variety show]]s, [[television]] programs, [[music hall]] performances, and [[cabaret]].

==Acts and scenes==
An '''act''' is a part of a play defined by elements such as rising action, climax and resolution.:&gt;&gt; A [[scene (drama)|scene]] is a part of an act defined with the changing of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130409233719/http://www.grossmont.edu/karl.sherlock/English160/Resources/DramaActsAndScenes.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-09 |title=Plays, Acts and Scenes in Structure |last=Sherlock |first=Karl |publisher=Grossmont College |date=2005 |work=English 160: Drama Writing |accessdate=26 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be more specific, the elements that create the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] of a play or any story, and divide a play into acts include the exposition, which give information, setting up the rest of the story. Another is the inciting incident, which starts all of the action that will follow. Going along with the inciting incident, the major dramatic question is formed; this holds the rest of the play. The majority of the play is made up of complications. These are the things that change the action. These complications lead up to the crisis, this is the turning point. Most of the time, at this point, the major dramatic question has been answered. Finally, there is the resolution. This is the end of the play where everything comes together and the situation has been resolved. This leaves the audience satisfied with the play as a whole. These more specific elements of plot in a play are the main things used to divide a play up into acts and sometimes scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Novic, J. (2012). Drama. In World book advanced. Retrieved from http://www.worldbookonline.com/advanced.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman theatre]] was the first to divide [[Play (theatre)|plays]] into a number of acts separated by intervals. Acts may be further divided into [[scene (drama)|scenes]]; in classical theater each regrouping between entrances and exits of actors is a scene, while later use describes a change of setting.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Though there are no limits to the number of acts which might exist within a dramatic work, the most common formats are the three-act and five-act structures.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Both of these are derived from different interpretations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' in which he stresses the primacy of plot over character and "an orderly arrangement of parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/poetics.1.1.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive {{!}} Poetics by Aristotle|website=classics.mit.edu|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern plays often have only one level of structure, which can be referred to as either scenes or acts at the whim of the writer; and some writers dispense with firm divisions entirely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Successive scenes are normally separated from each other in either time or place; but the division between acts is more to do with the overall dramatic structure of the piece. The end of an act often coincides with one or more characters making an important decision, else having an important decision to make. A decision which has a profound impact on the story being told.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Contemporary theatre, in line with screenwriting and novel forms, tends towards a [[three-act structure]]. Many [[operettas]] and most [[musical theatre|musicals]] are divided into just two acts, so in practice the [[intermission]] is seen as dividing them, and the word "act" comes to be used for the two halves of a show whether or not the script divides it into acts.

==Varieties==

=== One-act plays ===

A [[one-act play]] is a short drama that consists of only one act; the phrase is not used to describe a full-length play that does not utilize act-divisions. Unlike other plays which usually are published one play per book, one-act plays are often published in anthologies or collections.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

=== Three-act plays ===
{{See also|Three-act structure}}

In a three-act play, each act usually has a different tone to it. The most commonly used structure is the first act having a lot of introductory elements, the second act can usually be the darkest with the antagonists having a greater encompass, while the third act is the resolution and the protagonists prevailing. There is an age-old saying that "the second act is the best" because it was in between a starting and ending act and thus being able to delve deeper into more of the meat of the story since it does not need to have as prominent introductory or resolutive portions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} This is not always so, since a third act or even a first act can have the common second act characteristics, but that type of structure is the most used.
* Act one: In Act I the conflict of the story is discovered. In this act, the [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], the introduction of the [[protagonist]], and other characters that the protagonist meets take place,&lt;ref name="Cannell"&gt;Cannell, S. J. (n.d.). What is the three act structure? [Lecture transcript].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Premise (film)|dramatic premise]] and inciting incident (the incident that sets the events of the story in motion) occurs approximately halfway through the first act.
* Act two: The main character encounters an obstacle that prevents the character from achieving his or her dramatic need. This is known as the complication. The main character reaches his or her lowest point and seems farthest from fulfilling the dramatic need or objective and it seems like there is no longer any way that the protagonist can succeed.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;
* Act three: The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] occurs as well as the [[dénouement]], a brief period of calm at the end of a play where a state of equilibrium returns. It is simply the resolution.&lt;ref name="Cannell" /&gt;

=== Five-act plays ===
Until the 18th century, most plays were divided into five acts. The work of [[William Shakespeare]], for example, generally adheres to a five act structure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakespeare and Five Acts: studies in a dramatic convention|last=Snuggs|first=Henry L.|publisher=Vantage Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; . This format is known as the [[Dramatic structure|five-act play]], and was famously analyzed by [[Gustav Freytag]] in ''Die Technik des Dramas'' (Dramatic techniques). The five acts played specific functions in the overall structure of the play; but in performance there was not necessarily any clear separation between them.

A similar five-part structure is also used in traditional Japanese [[Noh]] drama, particularly by [[Zeami Motokiyo]]. Zeami, in his work "''[[Sandō]]''" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five ''dan'') Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (''jo''), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (''ha''), with the greatest climax in the third ''dan'', and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth ''dan'' (''kyū'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Shelley Fenno|date=Spring 1993|title=How to write a Noh play - Zeami's ''Sandō''|journal=[[Monumenta Nipponica]]|volume=48|issue=1|pages=58–62|jstor=2385466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
As part of a [[television program]], each individual act can be separated by commercials.
In [[film]], a number of scenes grouped together bring to an audiovisual work to life. The three act structure is commonly referred to in [[film adaptation]] of theatrical plays.

In the context of fiction, '''apocrypha''' includes stories and works set in a fictional universe that do not belong in its [[canon (fiction)|canon]] but may still have some authority within it. The boundaries between canon and apocrypha can often be blurry.

Apocrypha may include tie-in merchandise, such as video games, novels and comics, which is often referred to as the fictional universe's '[[Expanded Universe|expanded universe]]'.

At times, apocryphal material may contradict the continuity that has already been established by canon. Even when no such contradictions occur, such material may sometimes be deemed apocrypha if it has been produced independently of the universe's creator. For example, [[Buffyverse]] creator [[Joss Whedon]] has little involvement with Buffyverse [[Buffyverse novels|novels]], has never closely overseen or edited one, and has never read an entire novel through.

[[Star Trek canon]] consists of the Star Trek television series and movies. All other Star Trek novels and comics, whether licensed by Paramount or not, are not part of canon, but are classified as apocrypha. 

Fan fiction is referred to as [[Fanon (fiction)|fanon]].

==Etymology==
The word derives the Greek word '{{lang|el|απόκρυφα}}, which means ''opened, revealed,'' or ''uncovered''. [[Jerome]] coined the term to refer to those books of the [[Old Testament]] that were not found in the Hebrew Tanakh, and it has since been used to describe religious texts that may not belong to the [[Biblical canon|canon]].

The term is used in nonreligious contexts. An account or anecdote is said to be apocryphal if its authenticity or veracity is questionable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8132">'''Association MAV (Mujeres en las Artes Visuales)''' is a group of more than 500 visual arts professionals women in Spain that promotes the visibility and improvement of opportunities for women in the arts. The association was founded on May 9, 2009 at [[La Casa Encendida (Madrid)|La Casa Encendida]] in Madrid by a group of contemporary female artists led by professor and art critic [[Rocio de la Villa]].

==Objectives==
The '''Association MAV (Mujeres en las Artes Visuales)''' promotes initiatives to foster the participation of women in culture and to combat discrimination in accordance with the Organic Act 1/2004 on Integral Protection Measures against Gender Violence.

Through its Observatorio, MAV analyzes and provides objective, numeric data to inform the situation of visual arts professionals in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iac.org.es/mav-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales-foro-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales|title=MAV, Mujeres en las Artes Visuales. Foro mujeres en las artes visuales. : Instituto de Arte Contemporáneo|access-date=2016-04-22|website=Iac.org.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the low number of women in top positions in arts and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://masdearte.com/miradas-de-mujeres-2016/|title=Miradas de Mujeres 2016, "un año de arte feminista"|website=Masdearte.com|access-date=2016-07-04|date=2016-04-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAV seeks to balance the presence of Spanish women in all sectors of contemporary art (e.g., artists, gallerists, researchers, curators, professors, art managers, museum directors) and advocate with Spanish institutions for the implementation of gender equality policies in all types of arts.

The MAV Association has established collaborations with other organizations of women in culture and [[contemporary art]] to develop initiatives towards tackling the lack of participation of women in the art system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.inmujer.gob.es/publicacioneselectronicas/documentacion/Revistas/ANALITICAS/DEA0230.pdf|title="MAV te observa", "entraremos en acción": "Las mujeres en el sistema del arte español". "Sobre piedras y vientos de igualdad"|author=López Fernandez-Cao|date=2013|journal=Universidad Complutense de Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its Centre of Documentation, the MAV Association provides resources for the investigation and documentation of best labour practices, and for the creation of new projects in the field of art, gender and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laboralcentrodearte.org/es/actividades/presentacion-en-asturias-de-la-asociacion-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales-contamporaneas-mav/view|title=Presentación en Asturias de la Asociación Mujeres en las Artes Visuales Contemporáneas (MAV) — LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial|access-date=2016-04-22|language=es|website=Laboralcentrodearte.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre of Documentation also preserves the historical memory of women's participation in the arts. It has created a chronological chart about art, woman and [[feminism]] in Spain and internationally.

==Projects==
Mujeres en las Artes Visuales improves the visibility of women in the arts and inform of their professional activities and productions on its [http://www.mav.org.es website];

Since 2012, it produce an online magazine call "M-Arte Y cultura visual".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/4489/v-edicion-premios-mav.html|title=V EDICIÓN PREMIOS MAV|access-date=2016-04-22|website=MataderoMadrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exit-express.com/fallados-premios-mav/|title=Fallados premios MAV {{!}} Exit Express|access-date=2016-04-22|website=Exit-express.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this magazine discusses issues about arts and the visual culture from a gender perspective".[http://www.m-arteyculturavisual.com]

One of the most important projects that MAV has generated is the "Women's gaze festival" (Festival Miradas de Mujeres). Initiated in 2012, to generate exhibitions in Madrid the first year and the next year was taken place all over Spain. The Festival, among exhibitions, has brought together initiatives that make women and gender issues a source for reflection, debate and creation.

Born out of the "Women's gaze festival" (Festival Miradas de Mujeres), the MAV organized from March to December 2016 the Women's Views Biennial, in which multiple activities were organized in several museums, galleries and arts centres all over the [[world]] to give visibility and enhance women's presence and works in contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.m-arteyculturavisual.com/2015/12/02/convocatoria-bienal-miradas-de-mujeres-2016/|title=Convocatoria Bienal Miradas de Mujeres 2016|access-date=2016-04-22|last=Varela|first=Ana Márcia|website=M-arteycultuiravisual.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=[http://Bienal%20Miradas%20de%20Mujeres%202016|url=http://masdearte.com/convocatorias/bienal-miradas-de-mujeres-2016/| access-date=2016-04-22|language=es|website=Masdearte.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/fundacion-cajasol-00621/noticia-presentada-bienal-miradas-mujeres-2016-desarrolla-cerca-200-propuestas-20160623191547.html|title=Presentada la [http://Bienal%20Miradas%20de%20Mujeres%202016, http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/5815/bienal-miradas-de-mujeres:-un-jardin-propio.html] que desarrolla cerca de 200 propuestas|access-date=2016-07-04|website=Europapress.es|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBC Radio nan Gàidheal''' is a Scottish radio station, broadcasting in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. It is operated by the [[BBC]] as part of its portfolio of television and radio services in [[Scotland]].

The station is available from FM transmitters throughout Scotland: its service licence states that "BBC Radio nan Gàidheal should be available every day for general reception across Scotland on FM";&lt;ref name="licence11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/radio/2011/radio_nan_gaidheal_apr11.pdf |title=BBC Radio nan Gaidheal Service Licence |publisher=BBC Trust |date=April 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also be heard on digital television platforms, [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB Digital Radio]], and online.

BBC Radio nan Gàidheal programmes are also broadcast (with an in-vision graphical overlay) on the Scottish Gaelic digital television channel [[BBC Alba]] during periods when the channel is not carrying television programmes.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radionangaidheal/about/ About Radio Nan Gaidhea] - BBC Online&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{main|BBC Home Service}}

Scottish Gaelic-language programming has been transmitted in Scotland since 1923, and the BBC's Gaelic-language department was established in 1935. BBC Radio Highland produced a range of Gaelic programming – {{lang|gd|BBC Radio na Gaidhealtachd}} – and on 5 October 1979 the Scottish Gaelic service {{lang|gd|BBC Radio nan Eilean}} was established in [[Stornoway, Outer Hebrides|Stornoway]]. On 1 October 1985, these two separate services united to form {{lang|gd|Radio nan Gàidheal}}.&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;Koch, John T. "Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia". ABC-CLIO Ltd, 2006. pp. 1265 - retrieved 22 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The main base for Radio nan Gaidheal is on Seaforth Road in Stornoway, having moved in June 2014 from the Church Street studios.

== Coverage ==
Radio nan Gàidheal broadcasts for over 90 hours every week,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; and joins [[BBC Radio Scotland]]'s medium-wave feed when they close transmission.&lt;ref name="gdprogram"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radionangaidheal/programmes/schedules BBC Radio nan Gaidheal Programming]&lt;/ref&gt;  {{lang|gd|Radio nan Gàidheal}} now frequently broadcasts important Scottish football matches providing Gaelic commentary.

Radio nan Gàidheal shows are available for 30 days after most recent broadcast on BBC iPlayer and on the BBC's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radionangaidheal Radio nan Gàidheal Dachaigh] (Homepage)&lt;/ref&gt;

Podcasts of some shows are available from the BBC website and on iTunes for some time after transmission. These include two programmes aimed at learners of the language, entitled ''Letter to Gaelic Learners'' and ''The Little Letter'', the latter being a more basic version of the former.&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radionangaidheal BBC Podcasts - Radio nan Gàidheal]&lt;/ref&gt; Both letters are also available at learngaelic.net, with transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;http://learngaelic.scot/usegaelic/index.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The service budget for 2009 was £3.9m with a change of any more than 10% requiring approval of the BBC Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/regulatory_framework/service_licences/radio/2009/radio_nan_gaidheal_mar09.pdf |title=BBC Radio nan Gàidheal Service Licence |publisher=BBC Trust - Radio Nan Gaidheal |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service budget in 2011 was almost the same as 2009 at £3.8m and requires the same controls as previous licences.&lt;ref name="licence11" /&gt; This funding comes from the [[BBC Trust]], the governing body of the BBC which is operationally independent of management and external bodies.&lt;ref name="Charter"&gt;{{cite web

'''Banco del Libro''' is a [[non-profit organization]] for the promotion of [[children's literature]], with headquarters in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. It was established in 1960 as a centre for the exchange of textbooks – hence the name Banco del Libro (Book Bank). As it has grown it has diversified to promote reading in Venezuela, in every conceivable arena and genre of children’s literature.

In 2007 Banco del Libro won the biggest prize in children's literature, the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] from the Swedish Arts Council, recognising its "long-term sustainable work" as a promoter of reading. It is one of two institutions to win the award (2003 to 2012).&lt;ref name=alma2007&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4280">In [[English law]], '''baron and feme''' is a phrase used for [[husband]] and [[wife]], in relation to each other, who were accounted as one person by [[coverture]]. Hence, by the old law of evidence, the one party was excluded from giving evidence for or against the other in [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] questions, and a relic of this is still preserved in [[criminal law]].

==Heraldry==
In [[heraldry]], '''baron''' and '''femme''' are  terms denoting the two halves of an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|heraldic escutcheon]] used when the [[coat of arms]] of a man and the paternal arms of his wife are [[impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] (or anciently dimidiated), that is borne ''per pale'' within the same [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]].&lt;ref name="Boutell1"&gt;{{ Citation | last=Boutell | first=Charles | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Heraldry, historical and popular | publisher=R. Bentley | place= | volume= | edition= 3 | year=1864 | quote=Escutcheon: an Heraldic Shield See Chap III ... Femme: the Wife as distinguished from the Baron her Husband. | page=106 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qlEBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Heraldry%20Historical%20%26%20Popular&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the husband's arms, on the [[dexter and sinister|dexter]] side (to viewer's ''left''), the position of honour, is referred to as '''baron''' whilst the paternal arms of the wife are shown in [[dexter and sinister|sinister]], referred to as '''femme'''. The resultant shield is used by the husband, as in general females are not entitled to display heraldry, unless ''[[suo jure]]'' peeresses. This is the normal way of displaying the arms of a married man. Impalement is not used  when the wife is an [[heraldic heiress]], in which case her paternal arms are displayed on an [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|inescutcheon of pretence]] within her husbands' arms, denoting that the husband is a [[pretender]] to the paternal arms of his wife, and that they will be [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] by the couple's issue and later descendants. Where arms are impaled for reasons other than ''conjugal'' marriage, for example the ''spiritual'' marriage of a bishop to his see or the ''mystical'' marriage of King Richard II to Saint [[Edward the Confessor]], the halves of the shield are referred to as simply [[dexter and sinister]].

==Etymology==
In late [[Latin]]  ''baro, baronis'', meant [[man]] (cf modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] "varón" which means a [[male]]). Later, in Western Europe, the word was used to refer to a ruler's leading henchmen (e.g. a baron was the King's Man). Later, it came to have a specific, legal definition as the [[tenant-in-chief]] of the early Norman kings, which class developed into [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]] who held their lands from the king by the [[Feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]] ''per baroniam'' and were entitled to attend [[Parliament of England|parliament]].&lt;ref name="Sanders1"&gt;{{ Citation | last1=Sanders | first1=Ivor John | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Feudal Military Service in England: A Study of the Constitutional and Military Powers of the ''Barones'' in Medieval England | publisher=Greenwood Press | place= | volume= | edition= | year=1980 | quote=Part I, The ''Baro'' and the ''Baronia'' | page=100 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6ugPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Feudal+Military+Service+in+England:+A+Study+of+the+Constitutional+and+Military+Powers+of+the+Barones+in+Medieval+England&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MSfmT_uICcKC2AXLlqXaCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norman-French word ''feme/femme'' simply denotes "woman" or "wife".

[[File:Arms of Castile and Leon.svg|thumb|A common simple example of canting arms: the ''[[Heraldry of Castile|castle]]'' representing the Kingdom of ''[[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]]'' and the ''[[Heraldry of León|lion]]'' representing the Kingdom of ''[[Kingdom of León|León]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/canting.htm|title=Tinctures|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Canting arms''' are [[heraldry|heraldic]] bearings that represent the bearer's name (or, less often, some attribute or function) in a [[visual pun]] or [[rebus]]. The term was derived from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''cant'', meaning song or singing. 

French heralds used the term ''armes parlantes'' ({{Lang-en|"talking arms"}}), as they would sound out the name of the armiger. Many armorial allusions require research for elucidation because of changes in language and dialect that have occurred over the past millennium.

Canting arms – some in the form of rebuses – are quite common in German civic heraldry. They have also been increasingly used in the 20th century among the British royal family.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} When the visual representation is not straightforward but as complex as a [[rebus]], this is sometimes called a ''rebus coat of arms''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
An [[in-joke]] among [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] heralds is the [[pun]], "Heralds don't pun; they cant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neznanich, Modar|title=Heraldry for Those Who Cant|url=http://www.modaruniversity.org/Heraldry-for-Those-Who-Cant.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2012}} Cites 72 historical examples of canting arms, as well as SCA usage.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of canting arms ==

=== Personal coat of arms ===
A famous example of canting arms are those of [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] (consort of King [[George VI]] of the United Kingdom). Her arms (pictured below) contain in sinister (i.e. on the bearer's left, viewer's right) the bows and blue lions that make up the arms of the Bowes and Lyon families.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Municipal coat of arms ===
Municipal coats of arms which interpret the town's name in rebus form are also called canting. Here are a few examples.

==September 11, 2001 experience==
At 08:46 on [[9/11]], Dries and her roommate Megan were sleeping in at their [[New York University]] dormitory. They were awakened when [[American Airlines Flight 11]] hit the North Tower. Dries began videotaping the crash scene with a camcorder she got about a week prior, while other dorm members came into the room. About fifteen minutes later, while zooming in on people jumping out of the building (which she thought was debris, specifically mentioning chairs in the tape), the South Tower was hit; Megan began screaming while Dries said "Oh my God!" repeatedly and questioning what to do when they realized it was a deliberate attack. Due to the camera initially being on the North Tower, the actual collision was not captured by her. Horrified, Megan began packing a few belongings in an attempt to flee the scene, with Dries following. When they got out of the building, they noticed that everyone else was equally confused. With no leads and not feeling safe, they went back to their dorm and watched the scene with their friends. As they were about to drink either [[apple juice]] or [[vodka]], Megan (while the camera was on her) looked back at the tower and screamed again; Dries turned the camera back to show the South Tower collapsing. Everyone continued to remain in the room until after the North Tower collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qiVBOqNiOs

Dries' footage was used in the 2008 HBO documentary ''[[102 Minutes that Changed America]]''.

[[File:Casting Cats.jpg|thumb|Casting call for [[black cat]]s, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the [[Roger Corman]] movie ''[[Tales of Terror]].'']]

In the [[performing arts]] industry such as [[theatre]], [[film]], or [[television]], a '''casting''' (or '''casting call''') is a [[pre-production]] process for selecting a certain type of [[actor]], [[dancer]], [[singer]], or [[extra (acting)|extra]] for a particular role or part in a script, [[screenplay]], or [[teleplay]]. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Pictures|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006161746/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television program]], [[documentary]], [[music video]], [[play (theatre)|play]], or [[television advertisement]], etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, [[advertisement]], and or [[industrial video]] is intended for an [[audience]], or [[studio audience]].

==Casting process==
The casting process involves a series of [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a [[theatrical production]] such as [[theatrical producer]], and [[theater director]]. However, within a given [[Television program#Production|television production]] a casting panel can consist of a [[television producer]], or within [[filmmaking|film production]] a casting panel could contain a [[film producer]], [[film director]], and/or [[choreographer]]. Usually, in nearly all areas of [[show business]], a casting director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does a Casting Director Do?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|date=Apr 29, 2017|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526020009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|archivedate=May 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process [[performers]] often may present, or are presented with prepared ''audition pieces'' such as [[monologue]]s, [[song]]s, choreography, scripts and or sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sides|url=http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|date=Feb 25, 2015|publisher=''[[Theatre Development Fund ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517122705/http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of [[screen test]]s and then attached with resumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I add my resume and more information about myself?|url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?proaddresume|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[head shot]]s and or viewed online via websites such as [[IMDb]], then shared with film producers, film directors and or [[studio executive]]s. Later stages may involve groups of [[actors]] both union, ([[SAG-AFTRA]]) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall [[motivational]] choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the ''chemistry'' created from either one of the combinations set forth within the [[read-through]], such as boy meets girl, etc.

Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the [[biopics|biopic]] films Notorious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notorious|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512175935/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|archivedate=May 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight Outta Compton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Straight Outta Compton - Number One Movie of the Summer|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307235934/https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|archivedate=March 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and All Eyez on Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Eyez on Me|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|date=June 16, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114240/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Call|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081649/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typical for [[community theater]]), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in [[theater]] and [[film]]) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).

A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Services|url=https://www.breakdownservices.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517203341/http://www.breakdownservices.com/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headshot Cafe interview with Gary Marsh (founder of Breakdown Services)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|date=Jul 8, 2013|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510155907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|archivedate=May 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Breakdown Services|url=https://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522044320/http://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from [[major film studio]]s and casting directors.

This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, [[print modeling|modeling]], commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can we contact casting directors or film directors in Hollywood as an aspiring actor?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-contact-casting-directors-or-film-directors-in-Hollywood-as-an-aspiring-actor/answer/Shaunti-Griffin?srid=hDjAD|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Express|url=https://www.breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Express ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515155826/http://breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actors Access|url=http://www.actorsaccess.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Actors Access]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075705/http://www.actorsaccess.com/|archivedate=May 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like [[under-five]], or a [[bit part]], a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.

An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s and or directors /producers [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.

Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. 

===What Casting Directors Actually Do===

For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a '''casting director'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twinkie Byrd - Casting in the 21st Century|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074029/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|archivedate=December 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "CD" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during [[pre-production]]. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the [[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]], answering to the director as part of his or her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Descriptions for Film, Video &amp; Cgi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Job_Descriptions_for_Film_Video_Cgi.html?id=gv8MAAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[Google Books]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "CD" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the [[character (arts)|character]]s in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous [[Hollywood]] productions such as [[Marion Dougherty]], [[Mary Jo Slater]], [[Mary Selway]], [[Lynn Stalmaster]], [[April Webster]], [[Tammara Billik]], [[Marci Liroff]], [[Avy Kaufman]], [[Mindy Marin]], and [[Robi Reed]].

At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency [[Central Casting]], the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an [[international co-production]]. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the "attachment phase" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182731144|title=Self-management for actors : getting down to (show) business|last=Bonnie.|first=Gillespie,|date=2009|publisher=Cricket Feet Pub|isbn=9780972301992|edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=182731144}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea lists and can "check avails" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is "approved" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an "Offer." The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a "pass." If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or "LOI" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is "green lit" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. 

After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called "pre-screens" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a "director session", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a "callback" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a "screen test" and Network Executives would also be in attendance.  Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] for a production, is called a [[cast list]], which is incorporated into a [[production company]]'s [[daily call sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Call Sheet on a film production?|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AdHVgcm6ShVa0O6QBzSKUyej3F9s9hbwxymib5y-vI4CPDpfvYfevQI/|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=''[[Pinterest]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected in the projects [[title sequence]] especially with film and television.

=== Casting Office Personnel ===
'''Readers:''' This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

'''Interns:''' Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto "cue cards" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Casting Assistants:''' This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka "session") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Casting Associates:''' Associates is the second [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in [[Casting Society of America]]. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Casting Director:''' Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors "discover" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47813908|title=Audition : everything an actor needs to know to get the part|last=Michael.|first=Shurtleff,|date=1980|orig-year=1978|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0553272950|edition=Bantam |location=New York|oclc=47813908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Casting Society of America]] (CSA)===
The significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA), but membership is optional.  Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the [https://www.ht399.org/ Hollywood Teamsters Local 399] and [https://teamster.org/locals/local-817 New York Teamsters Local 817].

=== [[Artios Awards]] ===
The highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the [[Casting Society of America]]. ''Artios'', comes from the Greek word meaning, "perfectly fitted." The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|title=Artios Awards|website=www.castingsociety.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102213058/http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Emmy Awards ===
The [[Emmy Awards]] has a category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual, all in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series|drama category]]. She has six awards for her work on ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[True Blood]]'' and ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]''.

[[File:Kirk-TroilusCressidaAct1.jpg|thumb|Cressida depicted by Thomas Kirk]]
'''Cressida''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɛ|s|ᵻ|d|ə}}; also '''Criseida''', '''Cresseid''' or '''Criseyde''') is a character who appears in many [[Medieval literature|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance literature|Renaissance]] retellings of the story of the [[Trojan War]]. She is a Trojan woman, the daughter of [[Calchas]], a Greek seer. She falls in love with [[Troilus]], the youngest son of King [[Priam]], and pledges everlasting love, but when she is sent to the Greeks as part of a hostage exchange, she forms a liaison with the Greek warrior [[Diomedes]]. In later culture she becomes an archetype of a faithless lover.

==Character history==
{{refimprove|date=June 2018}}
The character's name is derived from that of [[Chryseis]], a character who appears in the ''[[Iliad]]'' but has no connection with Troilus, Diomedes or Calchas. Indeed, the story of Troilus and Cressida does not appear in any Greek legends but was invented by the twelfth century French poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] in the ''[[Roman de Troie]]''. The woman in the [[love triangle]] is here called not Cressida but [[Briseida]], a name derived from that of [[Briseis]], a different character in the ''Iliad'', who again is neither related to Calchas nor involved in any love affairs with Troilus or Diomedes. Initially, after the ''Roman'' appeared, other authors who refer to the story, for example, [[Azalais d'Altier]] in her poem ''Tanz salutz e tantas amors'' and [[Guido delle Colonne]] in his ''[[Historia destructionis Troiae]]'', continue to use names derived from that of Briseis.

It is the Italian author and poet [[Boccaccio]] who makes the decisive shift in the character's name in ''[[Il Filostrato]]''. This poem is the first work dedicated to telling the story of the love triangle rather than to the larger tale of the Trojan War. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is an expanded version of the story based on Boccaccio. Several other authors then took up the tale, including the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] poet [[Robert Henryson]] in his ''[[The Testament of Cresseid]]'', which 'completes' Cressida's story (left unfinished by Chaucer), and [[William Shakespeare]] in his play of the Trojan War, ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.

Cressida has most often been depicted by writers as "false Cressida", a paragon of female inconstancy. As soon as she has betrayed Troilus, she has fulfilled her purpose and the men who have written about her do not mention her again. Such is the case in Benoît, Guido, Boccaccio, Chaucer and Shakespeare. Chaucer's poem, however, at least portrays a more sympathetic Criseyde showing a self-conscious awareness of her literary status: "Alas, of me until the world's end shall be wrote no good song". Henryson's treatment is unusual in that he looks at events after the end of the traditional tale. His poem takes up the repentant Cresseid's story after she has developed leprosy and been abandoned by Diomedes. 

Some authors have attempted to exonerate the character by having her choose Troilus over Diomedes. Such is the case in [[John Dryden]]'s rewriting of Shakespeare in an attempt at {{nowrap|"remov[ing]}} that heap of Rubbish, under which many excellent thoughts lay bury'd".&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, John ''Preface to Troilus and Cressida'' in: Novak, M. E (ed.) (1984). ''The Works of John Dryden: Volume XIII Plays: All for Love; Oedipus; Troilus and Cressida''. Berkeley, Cal.: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-05124-6}}. p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Walton]] and [[Christopher Hassall]]'s 1954 opera ''[[Troilus and Cressida (opera)|Troilus and Cressida]]'' did likewise. In both of these cases, Cressida's being true to Troilus is associated with her death as part of the concluding tragic events.

Other modern fiction has introduced further departures from the traditional narrative. [[Christa Wolf]] in ''[[Cassandra (novel)|Cassandra]]'' provides another degraded future for the character (once more named Briseis), by including her eventual enslavement to [[Achilles]] and then [[Agamemnon]]. [[Jack Lindsay]]'s novel ''Cressida's First Lover: A Tale of Ancient Greece'' explores another area untouched in standard narratives, some of her earlier life.

==Shakespeare==
In Shakespeare's ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', we first hear of Cressida in Act 1 Scene 1. [[Pandarus]] and Troilus are discussing how the latter's unspoken love for the former's niece, Cressida, is preventing him from performing on the battlefield. She first appears in person in the following scene, speaking to her manservant before Pandarus enters. They commence into witty banter while a parade of Trojan soldiers heads past. When Troilus walks by Pandarus tries to convince Cressida of his merit, but she teases him, saying she has heard [[Achilles]], a Grecian warrior, is far more impressive. Once Pandarus exits Cressida admits in a [[soliloquy]] that she does in fact love Troilus, but is worried about publicising it. In her own words:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Yet I hold off. Women are angels, wooing:
Things won are done, joy's soul lies in the doing.
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
Men prize the thing ungained more than it is:
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
"Achievement is command; ungained, beseech."
That though my heart's contents firm love doth bear,
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 1 Scene 2, lines 225–234
}}

She next appears in Act 3 Scene 2, when Pandarus leads her on stage wearing a veil to meet with Troilus. Pandarus then heads back "inside" and the two are left alone. Cressida struggles to practise her [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] as planned while Troilus professes his love for her. When Pandarus re-enters she eventually admits her own reciprocal love of Troilus. In a confused speech she battles with her own fate as a woman, even speaking in a collective woman's voice, revealing a greater intelligence than the male characters give her credit for:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;I love you now; but till now not so much
But I might master it; in faith, I lie:
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
Why have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us,
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
But, though I loved you well, I wooed you not,
And yet, good faith, I wished myself a man,
Or that we women had men's privilege
Of speaking first.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 3 Scene 2, lines 92–101
}}

Cressida becomes increasingly affected by her own qualities, saying 'I show more craft than love' (line 124). She begs to be allowed to leave, but Troilus and Pandarus want her to stay, so that they can marry to immediate effect. She seems to prophesise her own failings, repeating the word 'false' seven times before Pandarus 'seals' the match. In Act 4 Scene 2 we see the couple on the morning after their first night together. They are euphoric, but Cressida does not want Troilus to leave her, showing an awareness of her own vulnerability in that moment. On line 20, she says 'you men will never tarry' as he begins to contemplate leaving. Pandarus enters and cracks some jokes about how she had now lost her innocence, and Cressida is flustered. Once Troilus and Cressida are dressed, Aeneas visits in a panic to say that for the return of one of Troy's men from the Greeks, Antenor, they must trade Cressida over to Diomedes, a Greek general. Cressida becomes an object to trade, and Troilus does nothing to prevent the sad event, though he is miserable for it. In Act 4 Scene 4 Cressida is informed of the plans to trade her to the Greeks. Troilus gives her his sleeve as a love token and she gives him a glove. Their relationship becomes an inversion of Paris and Helen's. Diomedes enters and Cressida is handed over.

In the following scene we again see Cressida in a less vulnerable state. Although she is now being led through the Greek encampment by Diomedes, surrounded by men, she engages with the men, Ulysses in particular, with defensive banter. Ulysses predicts her behaviour using coarse phrases such as "sluttish spoils". Act 5 Scene 2 is the most poignant scene containing Cressida, and the most memorable. Troilus has crept into the camp and is accompanied by Ulysses, and they are watch the scene unfolding between Diomedes and Cressida unnoticed. Thersites is also present and unseen, the clown of dark humour making distasteful comments exaggerating the sexual inference of what he sees. Cressida flirts with Diomedes, yet is occasionally struck by guilt. She appears to lust after him, even giving him Troilus's sleeve as a love token, though quickly tries to retrieve it from him in a struggle, offering her own body in trade. Diomedes insists he will have both. He exits, having planned a return visit. Troilus is mad with jealousy and anger throughout the scene, but she never realises he is close by. Her final lines of the play are:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee,
But with my heart the other eye doth see.
Ah, poor our sex! This fault in us I find,
The error of our eye doth direct our mind:
What error leads must err. O, then conclude
Minds swayed by eyes are full of turpitude.&lt;/poem&gt;|''Troilus and Cressida'', Act 5 Scene 2, lines 122–127
}}

Later, we are told of things that concern her: for example, the letter Troilus receives which he tears up, and Troilus' horse which Diomedes sends to her as a prize after knocking him out of the saddle in battle.

===Contemporary criticism===
''Troilus and Cressida'' has little performance history prior to the 20th century.  Cressida's character is as isolated from framing as the rest of the story—we never know how her life ends, there is no "ever after" for her, and even her beginning is mysterious to us. She appears a witty young girl, only to become a serious, thoughtful, and thought-provoking woman in moments of reflection. Carol Rutter explores the reasons why Cressida is so fascinating. She writes "[...] the challenge Shakespeare constructs for this play is to put before us a Cressida, who, like the fair (but dark) lady of the sonnets is, in Eve Sedgwick's memorable term, 'oxymoron militant', a genuine contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;Chillington Rutter, Carol. ''Enter the Body''. Routledge. Great Britain, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutter has much to say on Cressida's self-awareness. Firstly, that Cressida is unique, that she "is something entirely, radically new, the woman who behaves like a man, who betrays the man," secondly, that, "two voices seem to be speaking [...] Where has Cressida learnt this 'instruction'? [...] the speech is neurotic, pragmatic, anti-romantic – yet its form is a sonnet [...] it discloses strategic schizophrenia [...] by this agenda, to win at love, a woman must play false, act double. She must separate instinct from sexual performance [...]".&lt;ref&gt;Chillington Rutter, Carol. ''Enter the Body''. Routledge. Great Britain, 2001. pp. 124–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juliet Stevenson]] commented in Rutter's book ''Clamorous Voices'' that such roles inspire an actor to "react against the way tradition and prejudice have stigmatised them – Cressida the whore [...] every time they're judged you feel protective. Perhaps too protective. So you might end up playing a Cressida who is above reproach."&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, Carol. ''Clamorous Voices Shakespeare's Women Today''. The Women's Press Limited. London, 1988. p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main question as regards Shakespeare's Cressida is centralised around whether she is simply a "whore", or if she is more complex, and worth further attention due to her obvious intelligence and duality.

== In popular culture ==

In "[[The Myth Makers]]", a 1965 storyline by  [[Donald Cotton]] in the [[Time travel|time-travel]]–based British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the character [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] (played by [[Maureen O'Brien]]), a teenaged travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], meets [[Priam]], King of [[Troy]] who, disliking her name, dubs her Cressida. During the course of the story, Vicki/Cressida falls in love with Priam's son Troilus, and after the fall of Troy elects to stay with Troilus and rebuild the city. The story inverts the traditional fates of Troilus and Cressida, a change made to facilitate the departure of the Vicki character (and actress O'Brien) from the series.

The named ''Cressida'' is sometimes given, as a literary [[allusion]], as a first name to faithless characters.  For example, in ''[[Mockingjay]]'', the final novel in [[Suzanne Collins]]'s ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' series, the character Cressida betrays the Capitol to support the rebellion, then later double-crosses the rebellion.  In the movie ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', a flashback scene shows the character of Cressida Baylor (played by Robinne Lee) betray the fidelity of the main character Hitch (played by [[Will Smith]]), thus negatively affecting his judgement and attitude toward love and women.

The progressive rock band [[Cressida (band)|Cressida]] is named after the character.

The main offices are in [[Spitalfields]] in [[London]].

== History ==

D&amp;AD was founded in 1962 by a group of London-based designers and art directors including [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]], [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]] and [[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]] and [[Colin Forbes (graphic designer)|Colin Forbes]] (who designed the original D&amp;AD logo).

A panel of 25 judged the 2500 entries to the first awards in 1963.  They awarded one Black Pencil (to [[Geoffrey Jones Films]]) and 16 Yellow Pencils.  In the early years, winners received an ebony pencil box designed by [[Marcello Minale]], one of the founding partners of Minale Tattersfield, which contained a pencil with silver lettering.  It was a thing of beauty but very delicate, so in 1966 Lou Klein designed the more durable Yellow Pencil.  Its education programmes in their infancy, D&amp;AD launched Graphic Workshops in association with the [[Royal College of Art]] in the mid-60s – they ran until the mid-1970s.

Designer Michael Wolff became D&amp;AD’s first elected president in 1970. Six years later, then-President [[Alan Parker]] gave the first [[D&amp;AD President’s Award]] for outstanding contribution to creativity to Colin Millward of [[Collett Dickenson Pearce]].

Initiated by Sir John Hegarty of [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]], the Student Awards were launched in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D&amp;AD|title=50 years|date=2012|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783836539364|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridging the gap between college and work, the awards present students with real world briefs to tackle.  D&amp;AD’s education programmes continued to grow in 1978 when [[Dave Trott]] set up the D&amp;AD Advertising Workshops.  They aim to inspire and broaden understanding of advertising and help prepare participants for their first jobs. Alex Maranzano, Howard Milton and Brian Webb initiated the first student Design Workshops.

D&amp;AD ushered in the eighties with the first video showreel of moving image work to accompany [[The D&amp;AD Annual]] – it would take until 1987 for the book to be produced in full colour. The Awards had already started to recognise a wider range of categories through the 60s and 70s and Photography, Retail Design (now Environmental Design), Music Videos and Product Design became part of the Awards in the 80s. The Awards also opened up to international entries for the first time in 1988.

Controversy surrounded a decision to hold separate advertising and design awards in 1986 and 1987; the separation, made for practical reasons based on the chosen venue, was seen by members as a split between industries.  The ceremony did come back under one roof, where it has remained.

D&amp;AD moved to Graphite Square, in Vauxhall in the 1990s.  These were busy times for education; the first Student Expo (now New Blood) and the University Network – D&amp;AD's membership programme for university and college courses – launched in 1993. The first session of Xchange took place in 1996 – described as a ‘summer school’ for college lecturers; creative practitioners update participants on the latest industry trends.

D&amp;AD entered the digital age with the launch of www.dandad.org in 1996 and introduced its first digital categories to the Awards in 1997.  Not only was the media landscape changing, by the end of the decade, 50% of entries to the Awards came from outside the UK.

D&amp;AD celebrated its 40th birthday in 2002 with ''Rewind'', a retrospective exhibition and book of some of the most iconic work since the 1960s at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].

A new benchmark was set at the turn of the century when a double Black Pencil was awarded to [[AMV.BBDO]]’s ‘Surfer’ for [[Guinness]] for its visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4491388/Copy-makes-headlines.html|title=Copy makes headlines|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was matched 5 years later by ‘Grrr’, [[Wieden + Kennedy]] London's work for [[Honda]] UK.  In 2006 another milestone was set as [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|leoburnett.com]] won the first digital Black Pencil.  Developments in the industry meant that two new categories were added in 2008 – Broadcast Innovations and Mobile Marketing, that year [[Apple Inc.]] won a [[Black Pencil]] for the [[iMac]] and the first-generation [[IPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/business/media/02adnewsletter3.html|title=People and Accounts of Note|last=The New York Times|date=2008-06-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Workshops were relaunched in 2006 and [[D&amp;AD North]], its first regional network, in Manchester the same year.  The Student Awards have become an increasingly international event – entries in 2007 came from colleges in over 40 countries.  Italian design group [[Fabrica]] designed The Annual outside the UK for the first time in 2007 and the showreel moved online that same year.

In 2012 D&amp;AD moved to its current location on [[Hanbury Street]], celebrated its 50th anniversary by honouring the most successful award-winners in its history, and launched the D&amp;AD Foundation to nurture creative talent.  Design book publisher [[Taschen]] released a limited-run book featuring 50 years of D&amp;AD annual covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9706753/DandAD-50th-Annual-original-cover-artwork-by-50-design-legends-up-for-sale.html|title=D&amp;AD 50th Annual: original cover artwork by 50 design legends up for sale|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Directions in Design and Craft
Introduction
Design began as a craft, with a central focus on creating beautiful objects to powerfully impacting the industry. Today, both design and craft have developed beyond their simple origin to the development of powerful channels through which interaction of people can occur, experiences can be emphasized, and not technology itself (Johnny, 2011). Its evolution has also made it a channel for new ways of thinking, discovering problems, and enabling the enhancement of lives of the individuals (Gero, 1996). What are the new directions for design aside from the old craft traditions?
Design as an evidence-based discipline
As a skilled process, designing is involved in the creation of useful and beautiful items. In various educational facilities across the world, a wide range of time has been used to master any skill in crafts involved in making drawings, constructions of materials, manufacture, and finishings. Moreover, in these educational facilities, very little time is spent outside these crafts and in subjects including any social, major world event or overall literature. A very small effort is spent on core STEM aspects of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. This is strange as designs act as the connection between technology and individuals yet very little research or study of either exists (Cross, 1999). Individuals no longer display an essential understanding of the backbones of technology. With the 21st century's enhancements in how sophisticated technology used for businesses, home, and educational purposes are, designers who insist on remaining craftspeople will only have the ability to add an amount of value, but won't be able to take the lead. Design as a craft is an essential profession but contains limitations in capabilities that artists can possess. The world of technology has undergone fast-paced change supported by advancements in science and technology along with the increasing comprehension of the ways in which modern technology socially and environmentally impacts individuals. There has been a depletion in natural resources, and the environment suffers pollutions, and social unrest affects populations in every country. Educational activities involved in craft are not enough to tackle any of these challenges. 
Tradition designs and crafts did not need formal designs, as the viewable outcomes acted to prove the efforts of the artist. The intuitions of the designer act as guidance for the designer and appreciations can be made through the discernment of the viewer. This is an approach that was effective concerning simple objects such as watches and furniture. However, enhancements in technology made even the simples objects more complicated. This was followed by confusion and frustration which demanded new forms of designs to deal with an increase in complexity. Hence, the design had to be based on the technical knowledge of technology while also appreciating how limited ordinary individuals were and their capability to master the devices. As individuals cannot observe the underlying operations, designers to increase the level to which a design can be understood or used.
Hence design was further developed through outer-designs which included outcomes such as ‘interaction designs,' ‘experience-based designs,' or ‘human-computer interactions.’ All of this development underwent incorporation into current design processes. As shifts in design occurred, there were also changes in its fundamental aspects. The outcome was the structuring on new types of design, with some originating from entities that were external to the design communities. Human-centered design acts as one of the most essential types of enhanced designs. It is a practice which needs an increased comprehension of people and starts with observations and a well-defined procedure to find out the genuine underlying issues and needs. These issues can then be evaluated through an evidence-based process of ideation, prototypes, and carrying out tests and till a solution is found (Yap et al., 2014). The result is increasing innovation with optimal solutions in an increasingly complex environment. 
The human-centered design has some primary principles. One of these principles is that result is structured for increase the level of efficiency within the lives of the individuals that will utilize the design. Human-centered design also never rushes to solutions and is evidence-based. Lastly, human-centered design is action-oriented as learning is enabled by going through continual processes of creations, tests, and observations. It moves people away from the designer as the only expert and into an essential professional field where systems and methods exist for the discovery of the true needs of individuals in society. Designs used to be entirely based on opinion but are now fully based on evidence. The design society is human-centered. 
Design-Thinking for added value
Designers have been talking about design-thinking, and the concept was revived as a part of the marketing slogan by the company IDEO. It is involved in the designation of the utilization of human-centered principles in the application of design to an entirely undiscovered domain. An essential contribution of the concept of design thinking to individuals who are not considered as designers is the capability to take a step back and carry out a reconceptualization of issues for the formation of new perspectives on existing issues. Designers who can be referred to as design-thinkers place their focus not on developing pretty things but on increasing the value of activities and creating effective frameworks through which major issues can be viewed (Carroll, 2015). In business, this means the replacement of the time-honored focus on issues such as profitability for the maximization of experience the individuals involved. In healthcare, the perspective has had a revolutionary effect. As the application of design thinking is on a varied range of activities starting with city structures to designing healthcare and transport systems, the contribution of traditional craft training is minimal. 
Design education
The existing procedures within education are no longer profitable for future design outcomes. Making a consideration of the complicated issues of healthcare while engaging in optimization of the experiences of all the individuals that plays a part in it, the traditional design courses no longer help. The courses that would be expected to help are those in service design, but traditional service design addresses issues that are simple and not complicated system like healthcare. Around the world, crises in systems such as transportation and education are being addressed. The environment is also an essential aspect, through design for an impact of global change despite the resistance of relevant authorities and entities to make an acknowledgment of how big the issue is. Designs educators can continue with their conformance to traditionally-inclined capabilities and display pride in the results they provide as well as the fine crafts-people they have released into the world. There will always be a need for this skill set in the world, but it will act as a representation of the past.  
For the transformation of education as a leader for future designers, educators must invest themselves in encouraging students to go on with the exploration and learning more of technology, social sciences, political and environmental issues. For the next couple of years, there will be transformations in design to a field that aims to promote new modes of thinking, human-centered approaches to the solutions of complicated challenges, and approaches to shift from the tyranny of technology to empower individuals (Weimer, 1993). Human-centered design is based off the needs of individuals first when addressing main issues in the society. Modern design is different from a large number of discipline lines in academia by being a field of creators instead of analysts. Each designer is a practitioner. This makes design special within educational facilities, as it constructs upon the data of all the specialization units in the university to result in constructing, developing, building and shaping the world. It enables the combination of technology with human activities. It is the way in which knowledge can be practically applied. 
Conclusion
In the current period, design can be presented as more than a craft with individuals who have technical training investing themselves in the production of aesthetic items. This type of design has an important role in people's lives, through the production of wonderful items that provide emotional satisfaction in the everyday activities of individuals. However, a design is much more than constructing pleasurable items, it is the base for entire educational facilities, teaching systems thinking, bridging across specialization systems, technology, and people. The future of the craft still has a large number of areas for exploration and development. All manners of increased developments will occur, some types of interactions, some completely new dimensions of experiences, and rethinking existent activities and services.

'''''Destination Mecca''''' is an early book by the writer [[Idries Shah]], who went on to produce an extensive corpus of material on [[Sufism]] that is both accessible and relevant to contemporary western readers. It was first published by Rider in 1957 (with photographs by the author), and subsequently by Octagon Press in 1969 (minus the photos).&lt;ref&gt;Destination Mecca page on Octagonpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; Shah had already made a name for himself as the author of two well-researched and in many ways ground-breaking books about magic. However, these scholarly works, and the vastly more influential work, ''[[The Sufis]]'', which was to follow in 1964, by their nature entailed keeping his own personality in the background. His intention in this present book appears to be to counterbalance this tendency through his skilful use of the familiar travel book format, and he steps out of the shadows as an approachable young man with a lively mind and a fine sense of humour and adventure – someone who is comfortable in his mid-twentieth century skin and equally at home in Eastern and Western contexts.

==Content==

[[Image:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]

''Destination Mecca'' contains descriptions and photographs of some of Shah's travels in North Africa and the Near and Middle East, including time spent in [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Jordan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], where he describes pilgrimages to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] and being a guest of the [[Saudi Royal Family]] a few years before the death of [[Ibn Saud]] in 1953. Among the book's twenty-three pieces of reportage is also the description of a visit to a [[Bektashi]] Sufi community in [[Syria]] composed mainly of dervishes who had migrated there from [[Turkey]] when [[Kemal Ataturk]] had outlawed the practice of Sufism. Shah says that he had "been present often enough at the gatherings of Sufis in various places, taken part in their recitations and listened to their discourses" but that he wanted to get a clearer view of Sufi life and activities in the monasteries. He had a letter of introduction to the Sheikh of the community, and was invited to attend and participate in their activities and practices.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Idries (1971). ''Destination Mecca''. London: The Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0900860138}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' review commented that "Sayed Idries Shah has done much to explain the world of Islam to Westerners and in particular, to promote the study of Sufi philosophy among English-speaking people... Much of what he writes illuminates factors of permanent importance in the Middle East; and no one can read this book without carrying away a lasting impression of the vigour and vitality of Islamic culture, and of the many surprising manifestations of that culture in the Asian world of today."&lt;ref&gt;The Times Literary Supplement, 5 December 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House''''' (New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2007) is a [[memoir]] by [[Valerie Plame|Valerie Plame Wilson]]. Mrs. Wilson is the former [[Non-official cover|covert]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer whose then-classified [[non-official cover]] (NOC) identity as "[[Valerie Plame]]" was leaked to the press in July 2003, after her husband, former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson, IV]], had criticized the [[Presidency of the United States|George W. Bush administration]]'s rationale for the [[Iraq War]].  The outing made her the center of the [[List of federal political scandals in the United States|American political scandal]] known as the [[Plame affair]].  Her public outing led to her decision to resign from the CIA in December 2005, when she attempted to retire early at the age of 42. Being told that she could not collect her pension until the age of 56, she determined to write this book both as a means of telling her own story in her own words and as a means of earning income to replace her deferred retirement annuity.  She encountered resistance from the CIA in the course of chronicling her work with the organization.&lt;ref name=LiptakAug&gt;Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/washington/03plame.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=login&amp;adxnnlx=1206245413-gmc8PySloz5lTGt0nKkH1Q "Judge Backs C.I.A. in Suit On Memoir"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 3, 2007, accessed March 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;John Solomon, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-07-15-rove-testimony_x.htm "Rove Learned CIA Agent's Name from Novak"], ''[[USA Today]]'', July 15, 2005, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Seidman&gt;Joel Seidman (Producer, [[NBC News]]), [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18924679/ "Plame Was 'covert' Agent at Time of Name Leak: Newly Released Unclassified Document Details CIA Employment"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', May 29, 2007, accessed August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;Bonnie Goldstein, [http://www.slate.com/id/2168490/entry/0/ "Free Valerie Plame's Memoirs!"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 15, 2007, accessed October 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Janet Maslin]] writes in her ''New York Times'' review on the day of publication, "the story of how her career was derailed and her C.I.A. cover blown ... has its combative side.  But the real proof of Ms. Wilson’s fighting spirit is the form in which her version of events has been brought into the light of day."

{{Main article|Plame affair}}
The phrase "fair game" in the title of Mrs. Wilson's [[memoir]] refers to a comment that [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Deputy White House Chief of Staff]] for Strategic Planning and Senior Advisor [[Karl Rove]] reportedly told [[Chris Matthews]], the host of [[MSNBC]]'s television show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'': "I just got off the phone with Karl Rove. He says, and I quote, '[[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]]'s wife is fair game.'"&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics&gt;Russ Hoyle, "The [[Niger uranium forgeries|Niger Affair]]: The Investigation That Won't Go Away," "Foreword" (xiii-xlix) in Joseph C. Wilson, IV, ''[[The Politics of Truth|The Politics of Truth: Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]'', rev. ed. (2004; New York: [[Carroll &amp; Graf]] Publishers, 2005) xl: "[[Karl Rove|Rove]] reportedly told [[MSNBC]]'s [[Chris Matthews]], the host of the political talk show ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'', that the White House considered Wilson and his wife fair game for political payback."  Cf. Joseph C. Wilson, "The Sixteen Words", chap. 1 in ''The Politics of Truth'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"'WILSON'S WIFE IS FAIR GAME.'" Those are fighting words for any man, and I'd just had them quoted to me by MSNBC's [[Chris Matthews]].  It was July 21, 2003, barely a week since a column by [[Robert Novak]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' had named my wife, Valerie, as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, and now the host of ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' was calling to tell me that as far as the [[The White House|White House]] was concerned, they had declared open season on my family. ... In his signature staccato, Matthews was blunt: "I just got off the phone with [[Karl Rove]].  He says, and I quote, 'Wilson's wife is fair game.'"

After the title of Valerie Plame Wilson's book had already been widely disseminated, on August 19, 2007, on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], Gregory asked Rove, who identified himself as an "avid [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]",&lt;ref name=MTP1&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007.  (Page 1 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt; among other statements pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] attributed to him, whether he "considered her fair game in this debate" between her husband and [[The White House]] over the President's so-called "[[September Dossier|sixteen words]]".  Rove responded that the phrase "fair game" attributed to him by [[Chris Matthews]] was Matthews' phrase not his own and that he himself did not consider Mrs. Wilson (in Gregory's phrase) "an appropropriate target in this debate."&lt;ref name=MTP3&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20302351/page/3/ "'Meet the Press' Transcript for Aug. 19, 2007"], ''[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]]'', August 19, 2007, accessed August 21, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Do you think you owe Valerie Plame an apology?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You do not?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  You considered her fair game in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  And you know what?  Fair game, that wasn’t my phrase.  That’s a phrase of a journalist.  In fact, a colleague of yours [Matthews].&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  Was she an appropriate target in this debate?&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.&lt;br&gt;
MR. GREGORY:  She was not.&lt;br&gt;
MR. ROVE:  No.  (Page 3 of 6 pages.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003 Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]] reported in ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "The White House spokesman dismissed as 'ridiculous' the charge that Rove outed Plame."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3a&gt;Evan Thomas and [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3129941/site/newsweek/ "Secrets and Leaks:] Pssst ...

But Here's Why This One May Be Different", ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 6, 2003,  online version, October 13, 2003 ("Updated: 1:20 p.m. ET July 12, 2005"): 3 (of 4 pages), accessed August 22, 2007: &lt;blockquote&gt;A source familiar with Rove's conversation acknowledged that Rove spoke to Matthews a few days after [[Robert Novak|Novak's]] column appeared, but said that Rove never told Matthews that Wilson’s wife was "fair game"—rather, that it "was reasonable to discuss who sent Wilson to Niger." Novak wrote last week that the leaker was "no partisan gunslinger."  That suggests that the original leak came from someone in [[the White House]] [[national security|national-security]] apparatus, which holds itself above politics. Many White House staffers are potential suspects, but various press reports have suggested that the Feds will want to interview [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney|Cheney's]] [[Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States|chief of staff]], an aggressive consumer of intelligence regarded by some CIA analysts as an intimidating figure.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Thomas and Isikoff note, "It may be significant that both Rove and Libby deny leaking classified information. They may say that in talking to reporters they used her name without knowing that she was undercover."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;

[[Chris Matthews]] reportedly declined to discuss the telephone conversation that he had had with Rove, according to Thomas and Iskikoff in ''[[Newsweek]]'', who quote the conversation that Wilson reported having with Matthews and then add parenthetically: "(Matthews told ''Newsweek'': 'I’m not going to talk about off-the-record conversations.')"&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt; [[David Corn]] of ''[[The Nation]]'' notes Matthews' statement to ''Newsweek'' "that he would not discuss off-the record conversations," adding, also parenthetically, that, earlier, "he [Matthews] told me the same...."&lt;ref name=ThomasIsikoff3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Corn&gt;As cited in [[David Corn]], [http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&amp;pid=991 "The Spin Is Not Holding"], ''Capital Games'' (blog),  ''[[The Nation]]'', October 4, 2003, accessed August 22, 2007:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The newsmagazine [Newsweek] also notes that, according to a source close to Wilson, shortly after the leak occurred Bush's senior aide Karl Rove told Hardball host Chris Matthews that Wilson's wife was "fair game." Matthews told Newsweek that he would not discuss off-the-record conversations. (He told me the same weeks ago when I made a similar inquiry about this chat with Rove.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Isikoff&gt;[[Cf.]] [[Michael Isikoff]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek/ "The Rove Factor: Time Magazine Talked to Bush's Guru for Plame Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050706043356/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8445696/site/newsweek |date=2005-07-06 }}, ''[[Newsweek]]'', July 11, 2006, accessed August 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7102243 "Legal Affairs: Reporter Says Libby, Rove Told Him of Plame's Work"], ''[[All Things Considered]]'', ''[[National Public Radio]]'', January 31, 2007, accessed August 23, 2007; includes audio link (NPR Player).&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthews was one of over twenty-five journalists subpoenaed by [[U.S. Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel|Special Counsel]] [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] regarding their conversations with high-level [[Presidency of the United States|Bush administration]] officials pertaining to the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] (2003–2005), leading to the indictment and prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'' (2007).{{Further information|Valerie Plame#Judicial and legislative actions pertaining to "Plamegate"}}

Ultimately, whereas Fitzgerald's grand jury did not indict Rove for committing any alleged crimes, and, in October 2005, it did indict Libby not for allegedly having leaked Mrs. Wilson's identity but for allegedly having lied in his sworn testimony pertaining to the leak investigation, federal [[felony|felonies]] for which a jury convicted and a judge sentenced him, a sentence which was commuted by Presidential proclamation.  On July 19, 2007, a district court judge dismissed the Wilsons' [[civil lawsuit]] ([[Plame v. Cheney]]) which charged related offenses by the various government officials. The dismissal was on jurisdictional grounds, that the case belonged in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-07-19-plame-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Plame's lawsuit against Cheney dismissed - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/19/cia.leak/index.html|title=Judge tosses out ex-spy's lawsuit against Cheney in CIA leak case - CNN.com|website=us.cnn.com|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/19/AR2007071901395.html?hpid=topnews|title=Plame's Suit Against  Top Officials Dismissed|last=Leonnig|first=Carol D.|date=2007-07-20|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2006cv1258-52|title=Memorandum Opinion|last=in "Valerie Wilson, et al., Plaintiffs, v.

On April 6, 2006, Matthews stated his own point of view on the CIA leak publicly in some detail in his conversation with Senator [[John Kerry]] on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', describing as "high drama" [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]]'s testimony that the [[President of the United States]] via the [[Vice President of the United States]] had "ordered" Libby to leak classified information pertaining to [[national security]] in order to bolster the case for the [[Iraq War]] after it began in March 2003.&lt;ref name="Matthews2006"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12193430/ "Kerry: 'Immoral to allow our kids to be killed':] Sen. John Kerry talks to Chris Matthews about Iraq, CIA leak: ''Following the CIA leak disclosure, Chris Matthews sat down with Senator John Kerry in his Capitol office to discuss the big developments in the CIA leak case and vision for Iraq policy''", ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', April 6, 2006, accessed August 22, 2007 (Transcript):&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's talk about the timing of this and we all remember this.  It was July 6th that Joseph Wilson, the former ambassador who had been sent down there by the CIA to the government of [[Niger]] to check out the story which appeared mysteriously in an Italian newspaper, that there had been a deal by Saddam Hussein to purchase nuclear materials, [[yellowcake|uranium yellow cake]], from the government of Niger.
Within two days, the [[vice president of the United States]] said the [[president of the United States]] wanted [[Lewis Libby|Scooter Libby]] to leak to [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judy Miller]], someone he had been working with on stories, had written stories that were supportive of the war, in effect, if not in intent, to tell her, this is a specific determination by the president.
You tell Scooter to go tell Judy that there was a real case for these aluminum tubes being material for use in developing a nuclear weapon.  You tell her this.  This is the conversation we're getting recounted under oath from Scooter Libby.  Pretty high drama here, isn't it?
I mean, it tells you that the president himself was in charge of this operation. He wasn't some, faded backroom guy getting orders from the vice president.  He was in fact, calling the shots particularly, and making the case for the war after the fact.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2007, the day after [[Lewis Libby]]'s sentencing, in a conversation with actor and political activist [[Ben Affleck]] about other matters, [[Chris Matthews]] used the phrase "fair game" several times, initially citing its use in a question submitted for Affleck by a viewer, whose own use of the phrase could reflect Matthews' already well-publicized reported use of it by Wilson, ''[[Newsweek]]'', and many other [[mass media|media]] sources.&lt;ref name=MatthewsJune2007&gt;[[Chris Matthews]], [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19110556/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for June 7"], ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated June 8, 2007, 12:09 p.m. ET, accessed August 23, 2007: "Here's a question from [...].  'Are the personal or religious beliefs of candidates ''fair game'' for scrutiny when deciding for whom to vote?'  What do you make of that, Ben?  It's been happening in these debates, lots of questions about, you know, evolution, Genesis, the whole thing, creationism.  Are they ''fair game'', or is that a religious test?" (Italics added.) (Transcript; "Guests: [[Ben Affleck]], [[Loretta Sanchez]], [[Brian Bilbray]], [[Ezra Klein]], Karen Hanretty.")&lt;/ref&gt;  His later usage of the phrase "fair game" in talking with Affleck about other matters raises a possibility that the phrase "fair use" that he reportedly used in talking with Wilson about Rove's comments about "Wilson's wife" (as quoted in ''[[The Politics of Truth]]'' [2004, 2005] and as previously quoted in ''[[Newsweek]]'' [2003]) was his own phrase and not Rove's, as Rove later disavowed it.

Nevertheless, whether or not Rove originated it, the phrase still conveys metaphorically what Matthews and the Wilsons appear to think that Rove literally may have intended: to "target" (in Gregory's later terminology) Wilson and, collaterally, to leak the information about his wife's CIA identity in the process.  The [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]] did not result in charging that anyone leaked her name intentionally while knowing that it was a classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] identity, in part, Special Counsel Fitzgerald later argued in ''[[United States v. Libby]]'', because of Libby's [[obstruction of justice]].  The jury [[Conviction|convicted]] Libby on four of the five counts in the indictment: one count of [[obstruction of justice]]; two counts of [[perjury]]; and one count of [[making false statements]] to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]], he was sentenced on June 5, 2007, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his 30-month prison sentence on July 2, 2007.&lt;ref name=TheCounts&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/i_lewis_libby_jr/index.html "I.

Libby}}

On July 3, 2007, the day after President Bush commuted Libby's sentence, [[Chris Matthews]] talked again with former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Wilson]], who reiterated his belief that the Bush administration had inappropriately leaked his wife's then-classified [[Non-official cover|covert]] CIA identity to retaliate against him politically, in effect targeting her. Matthews asked Wilson: "When did you sense that the White House was trying to destroy your reputation?" and he replied: "Well, it was pretty clear to me shortly after I wrote my article [[Joseph C. Wilson#"What I Didn't Find in Africa"|"What I Didn't Find in Africa"]], when Mr. Novak spoke to a friend of mine on the street and said that, Wilson's a 'blank,' and his wife works for the CIA, that the nature of the smear campaign they were going to run against me was going to include the betrayal of her identity as a covert CIA officer.  And that would have been around July 8 or July 9 [2003]."&lt;ref name=MatthewsJuly2007&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19618592/ "'Hardball with Chris Matthews' for July 3, 5 p.m. ET"], ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', ''[[MSNBC]]'', updated: July 5, 2007, 2:54 p.m. ET, accessed August 22, 2007.

Bennett|Bob Bennett]], [[Kate O'Beirne]], Ryan Lizza, [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Norman Pearlstine]], [[April Ryan]].")&lt;/ref&gt;{{Main article|Joseph C. Wilson#Wilson's reactions to the Libby trial and commutation}}

====Subtitle====
The subtitle "My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House" corresponds to parts of the subtitle of the 2005 paperback edition of former Ambassador Wilson's memoir ''[[The Politics of Truth|Inside the Lies that Put the White House on Trial and Betrayed My Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir]]''.  Since her identity was leaked by Richard Armitage, then Deputy Secretary of State, the subtitles are not entirely accurate.

==Review excerpts==
[[Janet Maslin]]:
{{cquote|'Anyone not living in a cave for the last few years [since the outing in 2003] knew I had a career at the C.I.A.,' writes Ms. Wilson .... Once that career was destroyed, she wrote this account of her experiences as a means of both supporting herself and settling scores. She was contractually obligated to submit a draft of the book to the Central Intelligence Agency’s Publications Review Board. That draft came back heavily expurgated. She was then expected to rewrite her book so that it made sense despite many deletions.

But Ms. Wilson and her publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, contend that much of the censored information is in the public domain—and that the suppression of information is itself part of Ms. Wilson's story. So ''Fair Game'' has been published with the censor's marks visible as blacked-out words, lines, paragraphs or pages. The publisher amplifies the book with an 80-page afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter, who uses matters of public record to fill in some of the gaps.

'My days of spelling "P-L-A-M as in Mary-E" over the phone would be over,' she writes in what is this book's biggest understatement. But however widely known she has become, Ms. Wilson has not previously revealed what it was like for her to follow the trial of [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis Libby Jr.]], known as Scooter; to be infuriated that [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], then of ''[[The New York Times]]'', and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' tried to protect secret sources at Ms. Wilson's expense ('These reporters were allowing themselves to be exploited by the administration and were obstructing the investigation'); and to learn that Ms. Miller, in her notebook, had gotten her name wrong, calling her "Valerie Flame" ('my exotic-dancer stage name,' Ms. Wilson joked to friends). She was outraged by the extent to which she had become fodder for the gossip mill.

Citing the dismay voiced by [[Ari Fleischer]], the [[White House]] press secretary, that such loose talk about an undercover agent might actually be criminal, she writes angrily: 'If he was so surprised that his actions might have adverse national security implications, then he's not smart enough to work in the White House. That goes for all the officials who thought that using my name as catnip was just playing the Washington game as usual.'

That idea of gamesmanship gives 'Fair Game,' the book's already stinging title, an even harsher meaning.}}

Alan Cooperman:
{{cquote|There is no reason to doubt that Wilson wrote ''Fair Game'' herself. To put it kindly, the memoir lacks the sheen of a ghostwriter's work and has the voice of an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary events. It doesn't help that the CIA redacted the manuscript heavily before approving it for publication. Each time she is about to launch into a juicy anecdote, it seems, lines are blacked out, sometimes for pages on end.

The book is, however, greatly assisted by an afterword by Laura Rozen, a reporter for the ''American Prospect''. Rozen faithfully echoes Wilson's point of view but fills in many of the censored dates, places and other details from published sources. Readers would be smart to turn to the afterword first, before tackling Wilson's disjointed narrative.}}

==Film adaptation==
In 2010, the book was adapted into [[Fair Game (2010 film)|a film]] starring [[Sean Penn]] and [[Naomi Watts]] as Plame.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3439">'''''Gangster Stories''''' was a controversial [[pulp magazine]] of the early 1930s. It featured [[hardboiled]] crime fiction that glorified the gun-toting [[gangsters]] of the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. It was published by [[Harold Hersey]], as part of his [[Good Story Magazine Company]] pulp chain. The inaugural issue was dated November 1929;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gang Pulp|url=http://offtrailpublications.com/gangster.html|accessdate=21 February 2016|work=Off Trail Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final issue was dated November 1932.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/mags/gangster_stories.html Galactic Central]&lt;/ref&gt; When Hersey sold his assets to another company, ''Gangster Stories'' was continued under the title ''[[Greater Gangster Stories]]'', under which it lasted through the May 1934 issue.

''Gangster Stories'' (and its companion, ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') quickly came under censorship pressure in [[New York (state)|New York]] state, instigated by [[John S. Sumner]] of the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], a state entity empowered to recommend obscenity cases to prosecutorial authorities. Hersey was forced to agree to abide by certain rules, e.g. not letting gangsters triumph over lawmen.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, Harold. ''Pulpwood Editor''. [[Frederick A. Stokes]], 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John; editor. ''Gang Pulp''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fiction in ''Gangster Stories'' (and ''[[Racketeer Stories]]'') constitutes a unique genre. Though properly categorized as [[crime fiction]], the emphasis was on action and gunplay. The stories only tangentially resemble the traditional [[detective fiction|detective story]] or [[mystery fiction|mystery]]. A typical ''Gangster Stories'' epic featured rival mobs shooting it out in the streets with [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy guns]].

Perhaps the most popular author in the magazine was [[Anatole Feldman]], with his stories of the [[Chicago]] mobster [[Big Nose Serrano]]. Playwright Feldman initially based Serrano on the character of [[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]. The first Big Nose story, "Serrano of the Stockyards" (''Gangster Stories'', May 1930), roughly followed the plot and characters of the famous play. Thereafter, Serrano evolved into an unlikely crusader against the social ills of the [[Great Depression|Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Anatole &amp; [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] (introductions). ''The Gangland Sagas of Big Nose Serrano: Volumes 1-3''. Off-Trail Publications, 2008-09. {{ISBN|978-1-935031-01-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-04-8}}, {{ISBN|978-1-935031-07-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular author was former newspaper reporter [[Margie Harris]], a clever writer with an ear for the distinctive vernacular of the mobs. Other authors include [[Arthur J. Burks]], former [[Sing Sing]] convict [[Henry Leverage]], [[C. B. Yorke]], [[Walt S. Dinghall]], [[George Bruce (screenwriter)|George Bruce]], [[Richard Credicott]],&lt;ref&gt;Credicott, Richard.

[[File:HermanKlein1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Herman Klein]]
'''Herman Klein''' (born '''Hermann Klein'''; 23 July 1856 – 10 March 1934) was an English music critic, author and teacher of singing.  Klein's famous brothers included [[Charles Klein|Charles]] and [[Manuel Klein]].  His second wife was the writer [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], and one of their children was the writer [[Denise Robins]].

For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London, becoming a lifelong proponent of the methods of [[Manuel García (baritone)|Manuel Garcia]] and helping to edit Garcia's book on the subject.  In 1876 he took up musical journalism, writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from 1881–1901, among other publications.  He also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.  From 1901 to 1909, Klein lived and taught singing in New York City, where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]''.  He was one of the first critics to take notice of the gramophone and was appointed "musical adviser" to Columbia Records in 1906 in New York.  He returned to England in 1909.

Klein wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs.  He was a noted authority on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]].  In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Klein was born in [[Norwich]], Norfolk, [[East Anglia]], England the son of Hermann Klein senior and his wife Adelaide (née Soman). Apparently, the elder Klein emigrated from [[Riga|Riga, Latvia]],&lt;ref name=Stoneobit&gt;Stone, Christopher. "Herman Klein, July 23, 1856 – March 10, 1934", reprinted in Moran, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; then part of the [[Russian Empire]], and home to a large community of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Jews such as the Kleins.  Once in Norwich, his father became a professor of foreign languages at the King Edward VI Grammar School, and his mother taught dance.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in New York (City and State)''. Lewis Historical Publ. Co., 1909, p. 787.  A petition from the Jews of Norwich, ''Norwich Petition For the Removal of the [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Disabilities]] of the Jews'', 24 January 1848, includes the signature of a David Soman, boot and shoemaker, who may have been the father of Adelaide.  Transcription in the archives of [http://www.Jewishgen.org JewishGen].&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Klein's five brothers were Max, a violinist, [[Charles Klein|Charles]], a dramatist; [[Manuel Klein|Manuel]], a composer; [[Alfred Klein|Alfred]], an actor; and Philip.  They had a sister, Adelaide.&lt;ref&gt;1871 and 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the uncle of producer Philip Klein (1888–1935).

Although his forename was frequently spelled as "Hermann" until [[World War I]], he "deprecated any foreign pronunciation of it and was proud of his British citizenship and upbringing".&lt;ref name=timesobit&gt;"Mr. Herman Klein: Music critic, teacher, and writer", ''[[The Times]]'', 12 March 1934, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The musical activities of Norwich, particularly its Festival and the Cathedral services, impressed him as a boy.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He was educated in Norwich and later in London.&lt;ref name=whoswho&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U212414 "Klein, Herman",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Klein was married three times.  His first wife was Emily May Brown, a ballerina, with whom he had a daughter, Sibyl Klein, who became an actress;&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/01/12/101965798.pdf "News of the Playhouses",] ''The New York Times'', 12 January 1903, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; they divorced.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt; On 19 February 1890, he married a 17-year-old Australian-born heiress [[Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell]], later a popular writer, at the [[West London Synagogue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.JewishGen.org ''United Kingdom Marriages, 1838–1972''] at JewishGen.org&lt;/ref&gt; Their children included two writers:  Adrian Bernard L. Klein (1892–1969), who changed his name to [[Adrian Cornwell-Clyne]] and wrote books on photography and [[cinematography]], and Denise Naomi Klein (1897–1985), who under her first married name, [[Denise Robins]], became a best-selling romantic novelist&lt;ref name=bear/&gt; and was the first president of the [[Romantic Novelists' Association]] (1960–1966).  Her daughter, Patricia Robins, is also a popular romance writer under the name [[Claire Lorrimer]].  Klein and Kathleen Clarice had another son, Daryl Kleyn (b. 1894).&lt;ref name=ykn&gt;Lorrimer, Claire. ''You Never Know'', autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; During their marriage, Kathleen Clarice began an affair with a young man, Herbert Arthur Berkeley Dealtry (b. 1878), who was a [[Worcestershire Regiment]] officer. When Klein became aware of it, he filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in December 1901. He was still affiliated with the West London Synagogue in 1901, the year of his divorce and his departure for New York.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://bearalley.blogspot.com/2007/09/kathleen-clarisa-cornwell.html Kathleen Clarisa Cronwell], bearalley online at bearalley.blogspot.com (accessed 13 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in British Jewry'', p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's third wife was Helene Fox, a [[Christian Science]] practitioner of Boston, Massachusetts, whom he married in 1905.&lt;ref name=gramophone73/&gt;

Klein died in London, aged 77.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt;

===Career===
For thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama|Guildhall School of Music]] in London and also trained many professional singers privately.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 12 March 1934, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote songs and short works for piano. In 1874, Klein returned to Norwich temporarily to help his ailing mother. That year [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García|Manuel Garcia]] also moved into the same house as Klein at [[1 Bentinck Street]] in London. Klein became his student for four years and was closely associated with him for another six years.&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 15 March 1905, p. 18. Klein called Garcia "the greatest singing teacher who ever lived." For their address, see 1881 England Census, available on Ancestry.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship became a transformative experience for Klein, who would recall Garcia and his singing principles in many of his writings throughout his life.  He helped edit Garcia's book on his singing method, published in English in 1872 (later revised by Klein and published as ''Hints on Singing'' in 1894).&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

In 1876 Klein took up musical journalism.  He began writing for ''The Examiner'' in 1879, and then for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (1881–1901), ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', ''The Citizen'', and the ''Lady's Pictorial''.  He was for many years a musical correspondent of ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and also contributed prolifically to ''The Musical Times''.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;

From 1901 to 1909, He lived in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;His brothers Charles and Manuel lived and worked in New York. Klein lived at 154 West 77th St. NYC.  See ''Musical Courier'', 5 November 1902, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The New York Herald]]'', taught singing,&lt;ref&gt;Klein's teacher Manuel Garcia wrote: "It is gratifying to me to know that the great American people appreciate the sound theories of the old school, and they will assuredly find in you one among its few capable exponents." See ''Musical Courier'', 11 December 1901, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a founder and first chairman of the [[New York Singing Teachers' Association|National Association of Teachers of Singing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Courier'', 13 November 1907, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7gqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=Klein+%22National+Association+of+Teachers+of+Singing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LPyI1aB5Zj&amp;sig=mikKU5nz8wGy0X8M6m0V7Jx4WAA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=p-IfSrCjC8Sktgfg9IHMBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2 ''Papers and Proceedings of the Music Teachers' National Association''], pp. 172–76, Music Teachers National Association (1927)&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first critics to take notice of the [[phonograph|gramophone]].  He was appointed "musical adviser" to [[Columbia Records]] in 1906 in New York and was responsible for introducing [[David Bispham]], [[Anton van Rooy]], [[Lillian Blauvelt]] and [[Ruth Vincent]] and others to the recording studio.&lt;ref name=Stoneobit/&gt; Klein eventually came to hold an unfavourable view of American musical life and returned to Britain in May 1909, continuing to teach and write.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; He wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs. In 1924 he began writing for ''[[The Gramophone]]'' and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.&lt;ref name=gramophone73&gt;Wimbush, Roger.

Among his other activities, Klein listed "Inventor of the Phono-Vocal Method of learning singing with the aid of a gramophone" and "Past Grand Organist of Grand Lodge of Freemasons".&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He was a member of the Critics' Circle, of which he was President and also Chairman of its musical committee.&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt;

==Publications==
In addition to publishing several books containing his criticism or music commentary, in which he left "vivid pictures of the great singers whose art he studied in the opera house",&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Klein translated several operas, including ''[[Carmen]]'', and poems of over seventy songs by [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Brahms]].&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; He was an authority on [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], having, as a young man, known [[Arthur Sullivan]] well and worked with him on musical committees.  Klein arranged for Sullivan to provide incidental music for [[Henry Irving]]'s 1889 production of ''[[Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; He later contributed articles on Gilbert and Sullivan to ''[[The Gramophone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Herman.

==Description==
This document is both dedicated to Hrvoje Vukčić, and is of great significance to Croatian and Bosnian history.&lt;ref name="Ethnicity-Did-Not-Matter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tradition-Betrayed"/&gt; Hrvoje's Missal is kept at the [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı Palace Museum Manuscript Library]] in [[Istanbul]]). Once bound in precious covers, from 19th century Hrvoje's Missal is in [[leather]] binding. Hrvoje's Missal is considered as one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. It contains 247 folios, which includes 96 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and 380 [[initial]]s and many more small initials. Some details are made of golden leaves. It is written in two columns on 488 pp (22.5x31 cm), and contains also some [[music notation]]. Some [[initials]] contain architectural elements of the [[Dalmatia]]n city of Split. The particular value of the Hrvoje's Missal lies in its combination of eastern and [[Western world|western]] principles in terms of composition and contents, thus making it a truly deluxe work and securing it a place in the regional and transregional history of art.

The ''' International Academy of Aquatic Art ''' (or '''IAAA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] for the development of [[Human swimming|swimming]] as a [[Performing arts|performing art]]. It is based in the United States.

==History==
The IAAA was founded in 1955 by former [[Synchronized swimming|synchronized swimmers]] from the USA in order to develop swimming as artistic, creative and non-competitive activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquatic-art.org/history.htm  History ] on the official website of the IAAA&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporators were:
*'''Mary Derosier:''' former national chairman of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], which was one of the first organizations who invented synchronized swimming competitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usasynchro.org/About_Synchro/history.htm History] on the official website of USA Synchronized Swimming. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Richard J. Dodson:''' in 1951 publisher of the first magazine for synchronized swimming, the ''Synchronized Swimmer''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fina.org/content/development Development.] of different forms of artistic swimming on the official website of ''Federation Internationale de natation'' (FINA).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Henry Gundling:''' synchronized swimming coach, manager and husband of synchronized swimmer [[Beulah Gundling]]

The IAAA regularly organizes festivals throughout the United States and Canada presenting different swimming performances with [[Choreography|choreographies]] for soloists, duets and groups. The IAAA swimmers are called '''''aquatic artists'''''. The style of the performances, which are shown by women and men as well, is a mixture of synchronized swimming, water ballet, ornamental, rhythmic and scientific swimming. In most cases the swimmers use different forms of [[art music]] for the programs presented at the IAAA festivals. [[Bert Hubbard]], one of the first male synchronized swimmers from the USA, is a board member of the IAAA and documents its history and artistic activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48410">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[James Cameron]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, Canadian film director [[James Cameron]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] or are officially cancelled.

[[File: James Cameron (28513845952).jpg|thumb|Cameron at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic Con International]], for "Aliens: 30th Anniversary".]]

== 1980s ==

=== ''Piranha II: The Spawning'' ===
In 1981, Cameron was originally hired as the [[special effects]] director for ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' and took over the [[Film director|direction]] when the original director, Miller Drake, was fired (Cameron also re-wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym H. A. Milton). Due to budget limitations the crew was composed essentially of [[Italian people|Italians]], none of whom spoke [[English language|English]]. Some however did have prior [[experience]] on horror/fantasy movies so they were, to some extent, able to satisfy Cameron's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/08/18/cameron-piranha-3d-dante/|title=Fishy Business: The behind-the-scenes story of the 'Piranha' movies (Part II)|date=2010-08-18|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first week of shooting, the set harmony was disturbed by some discussions about the work between the director and the producers (the executive producer, [[Ovidio G. Assonitis]], asked to verify the day-to-day activities, arguing with most of Cameron's choices), so while Cameron was only responsible for the shooting, most of the decisions were under Assonitis' authority. According to ''Dreaming Aloud'', a [[biography]] of Cameron by Christopher Heard, Cameron was not allowed to see his [[footage]] and was not involved in editing. He broke into the editing room in [[Rome]] and cut his own version while the film's producers were at [[Cannes]], but was caught and Assonitis recut it again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQpDD6w6KOs|title=James Cameron on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|date=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the film was reshot by Assonitis after Cameron was fired. In an interview, Cameron stated: "I was replaced after two-and-a-half weeks by the Italian producer. He just fired me and took over, which is what he wanted to do when he hired me. It wasn't until much later that I even figured out what had happened. It was like, "Oh, man, I thought I was doing a good job." But when I saw what they were cutting together, it was horrible. And then the producer wouldn't take my name off the picture because [contractually] they couldn't deliver it with an Italian name. So they left me on, no matter what I did. I had no legal power to influence him from [[Pomona, California]], where I was sleeping on a friend's couch. I didn't even know an attorney. In actual fact, I did some directing on the film, but I don't feel it was my first movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terminatorfiles.com/media/articles/cameron_005.htm James Cameron Interview at Terminator Files]. ''terminatorfiles.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' ===
In 1984, James Cameron wrote a first draft under the title ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II|First Blood II]]''. (Cameron had been recommended by [[David Giler]] who did some uncredited script work on the first film.&lt;ref&gt;BROESKE, P. H. (1985, Oct 27). THE CURIOUS EVOLUTION OF JOHN RAMBO. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/154252710&lt;/ref&gt;) Cameron's script had the same basic structure of the first film but had the character of Rambo's partner before later drafts were written by star [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Stallone's final draft differed radically from Cameron's initial vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Amazingcameron.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725030036/http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |archivedate=July 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers considered that Rambo would have a partner in the rescue mission of POWs. The producers allegedly wanted [[John Travolta]] to play Rambo's partner, but Stallone [[veto]]ed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;''We Get to Win This Time'', 2002, Artisan Entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Marvin]] (who was considered to play Colonel Trautman in the first film) was offered the role of Marshall Murdock, but declined, leading to the role being played by [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]. Stallone later recalled: "I think that James Cameron is a brilliant talent, but I thought the politics were important, such as a right-wing stance coming from Trautman and his nemesis, Murdock, contrasted by Rambo’s obvious neutrality, which I believe is explained in Rambo’s final speech. I realize his 
speech at the end may have caused millions of viewers to burst veins in their eyeballs by rolling them excessively, but the sentiment stated was conveyed to me by many veterans.... [Also] in his original draft it took nearly 30-40 pages to have any action initiated and Rambo was partnered with a tech-y sidekick. So it was more than just politics that were put into the script. There was also a simpler story line. If James Cameron says anything more than that, then he realizes he’s now doing the backstroke badly in a pool of lies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932|title=Stallone answers December 9th &amp; 10th Questions in a double round - plus Harry's Seen ROCKY BALBOA...|author=headgeek|date=December 16, 2006|work=Aint It Cool News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Alien Nation'' ===
An earlier draft of the 1988 film ''[[Alien Nation (film)|Alien Nation]]'' was actually written by Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film.&lt;ref name="movies.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800340643/cast Alien Nation (1988) Cast and Credits]. [[Yahoo! Movies]]. Retrieved March 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rockne S. O'Bannon]] received solo credit of writing the script, which deviated much from earlier drafts.

=== ''Wolverine and the X-Men'' ===
Around 1989, [[Stan Lee]] and [[Chris Claremont]] entered in talks with [[Carolco Pictures]] and [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] to make a film adaptation of the ''[[X-Men]]'' comic book series, with Cameron as producer, [[Kathryn Bigelow]] as director and [[Gary Goldman]] as writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/x-men/235939/the-x-men-movies-you-never-saw|title=The X-Men Movies You Never Saw|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late actor [[Bob Hoskins]] was slated to star as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/bob-hoskins-x-men-writers-first-choice-wolverine/|title=Bob Hoskins Was 'X-Men' Writer's First Choice for Wolverine|date=30 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actress [[Angela Bassett]] was attached to star as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/james-cameron-xmen-bob-hoskins-wolverine-angela-bassett-storm/|title=Chris Claremont On James Cameron's Abandoned 'X-Men' Film &amp; Bob Hoskins as Wolverine|date=26 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claremont also contacted [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Jim Shooter]] to revive the character of [[Jean Grey]] due the character's demise in ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]'' comic book storyline.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/chris-claremonts-dream-x-men-movie-james-cameron-kathryn-bigelow-and-bob-hoskins-wolverine-3/|title=Chris Claremont's Dream X-Men Movie: James Cameron, Kathryn Bigelow, and Bob Hoskins as Wolverine|date=25 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project entered into [[development hell]] when Lee piqued Cameron's interest on the long planned ''[[#Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' film and after the defunction of [[Carolco Pictures]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film was finally released in 2000 with [[Bryan Singer]] as director.

== 1990s ==

=== ''Jurassic Park'' ===
In May 1990, Cameron tried to buy the rights to make a film adaptation of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/07/titanic-director-james-cameron-jurassic-park-steven-spielberg_n_1864996.html|title=James Cameron: The One That Got Away...

On the 1991 American [[buddy cop]] [[action film|action]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Point Break]]'', only W.

=== ''The Crowded Room'' ===
In 1991, after finishing the filming of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', Cameron tried to get the rights of [[Daniel Keyes]]' [[non-fiction novel]] ''[[The Minds of Billy Milligan]]''. In 1994, Keyes published a sequel novel entitled ''The Milligan Wars'', stating that he published the novel for being a tie-in with the film adaptation, entitled ''The Crowded Room'', which would be developed by [[Warner Bros.]] and with Cameron attached to direct, after buying the rights of the novel to Sandy Arcara. [[John Cusack]] was attached to play Billy Milligan and Cameron and [[Todd Graff]] wrote the screenplay.&lt;ref name="danielkeyesauthor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danielkeyesauthor.com/faq.html#bfaq|title=Daniel Keyes FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/A-Crowded-Room.txt|title=A Crowded Room Script|work=dailyscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cameron finally left the project for unknown reasons. As of December 2006, veteran film director [[Joel Schumacher]] was attached to direct the film. The projected release date was supposed to be in 2008, but any film based in the book wasn't released and Keyes passed away in 2014.&lt;ref name="danielkeyesauthor.com"/&gt;

=== ''Terminator 3'' (James Cameron's version) ===
During the 1990s, Cameron said many times that he was interested in directing a [[Terminator (franchise)|third ''Terminator'' film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theterminatorfans.com/james-cameron-talks-terminator-3/|title=James Cameron Talks Terminator 3 - TheTerminatorFans.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the defunct of [[Carolco Pictures]] in 1997, the developer of ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', Cameron and [[20th Century Fox]] were in talks about the production of a possible third ''Terminator'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-James-Cameron-direct-Terminator-3-and-4|title=Why didn't James Cameron direct Terminator 3 and 4? - Quora|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Cameron left the production of the third film to direct ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] originally intended to not reprise his role as [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]] after learning that Cameron was not going to direct the film and tried to convince him to work at least as producer, but Cameron declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/56890/why-didnt-james-cameron-direct-further-movies-of-terminator-franchise-after|title=Why didn't James Cameron direct further movies of 'Terminator' franchise after 'Terminator 2'?|website=movies.stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was finally released as ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' in 2003 and directed by [[Jonathan Mostow]].

=== ''Spider-Man'' ===
After finishing the filming of ''[[True Lies]]'', on September 1, 1993, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Cameron had sent a screenplay (apparently written in 1991)&lt;ref name="webcitation.org"&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/619qthyXd?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/24/magazine/tm-34460&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Carolco Pictures]] for the long-planned ''[[Spider-Man in film#James Cameron's "scriptment"|Spider-Man]]'' film, a theatrical project that had been in development since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR110100.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=cameron+spider-man |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=28 February 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228064746/http://www.variety.com/article/VR110100.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=cameron+spider-man |archivedate=28 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] was attached to play [[Spider-Man]], Cameron's frequent collaborator [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was attached to play [[Dr. Octopus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/general/who-is-spider-man-57159110/|title=Who Is Spider-Man?|first=Steve|last=Ryfle|date=19 March 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sai.calu.edu/caltimes/index.php/2010/01/26/web-of-questions-arises-as-marvel-announces-spiderman-reboot/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002040007/http://sai.calu.edu/caltimes/index.php/2010/01/26/web-of-questions-arises-as-marvel-announces-spiderman-reboot/ |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However after problems that producer [[Menahem Golan]] had with Carolco (which ended in the bankruptcy of the latter), Cameron left the project and signed a contract with [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="webcitation.org"/&gt; The [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|film]] was finally released in 2002 directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and written by [[David Koepp]].

=== ''Project 880'' ===
In 1994, Cameron finished the screenplay of ''Project 880'', his next planned film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/avatars-james-cameron-borrow-soviet-sci-fi-novels/story?id=9561339|title=Did Avatar Rip Off Soviet Sci-Fi Novels|first=A.

However, Cameron felt that the technology of that time it wasn't enough and realistic for the project, putting it on hold. Finally, in October 2005, [[20th Century Fox]] greenlighted the production of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-01-21/king-of-the-world-again|title=Bloomberg|publisher=bloomberg|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Landau]] was to produce the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/jon-landau-talks-project-880-the-movie-that-became-avatar-3ab4909b1fb#.1aedbiebg|title=Jon Landau Talks Project 880, The Movie That Became Avatar|date=21 April 2010|publisher=filmschoolrejects}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cameron made many changes to the ''Project 880'' script, and it was finally released in 2009 as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.

=== ''Strange Days'' ===
The filming of the 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' SQUID scenes, which offer a [[point-of-view shot]] (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema of Kathryn Bigelow: Hollywood Transgressor|first1=Deborah|last1=Jermyn|first2=Sean|last2=Redmond|date=January 2003|publisher=[[Wallflower Press]]|isbn=978-1903364420|chapter=Strange Days: A Case History of Production and Distribution in Hollywood|pages=144–158|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cinema_of_Kathryn_Bigelow.html?id=PtShseOVCe4C|accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce the effect of looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially "a stripped-down [[Arri]] that weighed much less than the smallest [[Eyemo|EYMO]] and yet it would take all the prime lenses." Cameron and cinematographer [[Matthew F. Leonetti]] helped Bigelow direct the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance, but remained uncredited for their directoral work. According to Cameron, "It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, we built special cameras, special rigs. We designed transitions that would work seamlessly. It was a very technical scene that doesn't look technical."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=James Cameron: Interviews|first=Brent|last=Dunham|date=November 2011|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|pages=102–103|isbn=978-1617031311|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/James_Cameron.html?id=W1-D-Zv3V4oC|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron was only credited as a cowriter and coproducer on the final product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=strangedays.htm |title=Strange Days|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 11, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306155953/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=strangedays.htm|archivedate=March 6, 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Planet of the Apes'' ===
In 1996, Cameron intended to direct a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'', after the poor reception of ''[[Battle for the Planet of the Apes]]'' in 1973. In 1998, Cameron was to write and produce the movie, while [[Peter Hyams]] was to direct the film and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was to star in the role of George Taylor.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5932803/100-wonderful-and-terrible-movies-that-never-existed|title=100 Wonderful and Terrible Movies That Never Existed|first=Charlie Jane|last=Anders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cameron, he had great ideas for the movie, including [[Caesar (Planet of the Apes)|Caesar]] traveling in time and discovering an ape society more technologically advanced.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, Cameron left the project after the successful reception of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.{{sfn|Hughes|2004|pp=41–43}} The [[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|reboot]] was finally released in 2001 and directed by [[Tim Burton]].

=== ''Fantastic Voyage'' ===

=== ''Solaris'' ===
In 1998, Cameron was looking to remake [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]''. His production company [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] spent close to five years securing the rights with both [[Solaris (novel)|the novel's]] author [[Stanisław Lem]] and the film's production studio [[Mosfilm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=7116&amp;s=features|title=''Solaris'': Sci-fi with a Soderbergh Difference|date=February 27, 2003|publisher=Urban Cinefile|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of his many commitments in the 90s, Cameron was unable to take on directing duties. After seeing the film, Cameron stated: "What I would've done would’ve been more like ''[[The Abyss]]'', where visual set pieces might have gotten in the way of what is a clean line as a relationship film. [Soderbergh]'s not interested in the hardware or the visual effects very much, which is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/interview-j-cameron|title=Interview: J.

=== ''True Lies: The Series'' ===
On May 8, 2009, seven years after the cancellation of ''[[#True Lies 2|True Lies 2]]'', Cameron stated that although he didn't have plans to revive the ''[[True Lies]]'' sequel project, he had intentions of collaborating with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] again.&lt;ref name="thearnoldfans.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1519.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413093325/http://www.thearnoldfans.com/news/1519.htm |archivedate=2010-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 2010, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' reported that Cameron was considering making a TV series based on ''[[True Lies]]'', with ''[[Dark Angel (2000 TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' producer [[René Echevarria]] as showrunner and producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2010/09/true-lies-series-in-the-works-with-james-cameron-producing-66467/|title=James Cameron Adapting 'True Lies' For TV|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=13 September 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger was apparently set to reprise his role as Harry Tasker after his departure from the position of [[Governor of California]].&lt;ref name="thearnoldfans.com"/&gt; However, the project finally ended in [[development hell]].

=== ''Doomsday Protocol'' ===
In December 2009, Cameron was developing a script called ''Doomsday Protocol'' for Fox.

=== ''Heavy Metal'' ===
In March 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Paramount Pictures]] was set to make another animated film with [[David Fincher]] "spearheading the project". [[Kevin Eastman]], who is the current owner and publisher of ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'', will direct a segment, as will [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]], "whose [[Blur Studio]] will handle the animation for what is being conceived as an R-rated, adult-themed feature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Par, Fincher put pedal to 'Metal' Eastman, Miller to direct animated segments|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117982413.html?categoryid=1050&amp;cs=1|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertainment website [[IGN]] announced, on July 14, 2008, "David Fincher's edgy new project has suffered a serious setback after it was dropped by Paramount, according to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fincher's Heavy Metal on Hold Paramount drops sci-fi/fantasy project.|last=Parfitt|first=Orlando|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/888/888803p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2008-07-14|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Entertainment Weekly'' quoted Tim Miller as saying "David really believes in the project. It's just a matter of time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=18775|title=David Fincher Can't Get Funding for|website=www.worstpreviews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ewinsidetv.wordpress.com/2008/07/david-fincher.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2008, Eastman was quoted as saying "Fincher is directing one, [[Guillermo del Toro]] wants to direct one, [[Zack Snyder]] wants to direct one, [[Gore Verbinski]] wants to direct one". It was reported that the film had been moved to [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] division [[Columbia Pictures]] (which had released the original) and had a budget of $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zack Snyder, Gore Verbinski, Guillermo del Toro Directing Heavy Metal Segments|last=Billington|first=Alex|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/09/04/zack-snyder-gore-verbinski-guillermo-del-toro-directing-heavy-metal-segments/|publisher=firstshowing.net|date=2008-09-04|accessdate=2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Eastman said "I've got breaking news that Fincher and Cameron are going to be co-executive producers on the film, Cameron will direct one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=Fincher Brings Mettle To Passion Project|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/03/fincher-brings-mettle-to-passion-project/|publisher=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]] and [[Jack Black]] from [[Tenacious D]] were going to do a comedy segment for the film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Cameron Forging a Piece of Heavy Metal|author=ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=56098|publisher=comingsoon.net|date=2009-06-06|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, production is [[Development hell|stalled indefinitely]], as no film distributor or production company has shown interest in distributing or producing the remake since Paramount Pictures decided to forgo being the film's distributor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Fincher Can't Get Funding for "Heavy Metal"|author=MTV News|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=18775|publisher=worstpreviews.com|date=2010-08-25|accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; who purportedly thought such a film was "too risqué for mainstream audiences".&lt;ref name="Nicole Sperling"/&gt; In July 2011, filmmaker [[Robert Rodriguez]] announced at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] that he had purchased the film rights to ''Heavy Metal'' and planned to develop a new animated film at the new Quick Draw Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDCC: Robert Rodriguez Takes Heavy Metal|author=ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=80106|publisher=comingsoon.net|date=2011-07-21|accessdate=2011-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 11, 2014, with the formation of his very own television network, [[El Rey Network|El Rey]], Rodriguez considered switching gears and bringing it to TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Rodriguez May Bring ‘Heavy Metal’ to TV; Prepared to Make ‘Sin City 3’|author=ScreenRant.com|url=http://screenrant.com/heavy-metal-tv-show-robert-rodriguez/|publisher=screenrant.com|date=2014-03-11|accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Terminator 3000'' ===
In August 2010, [[Hannover House]] announced plans to develop a 3D animated film titled ''Terminator 3000'', with Cameron in a producing role.&lt;ref name="Terminator3000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/08/terminator-rights-holder-sends-cease-and-desist-letter-to-kill-proposed-3d-animated-feature/ |title='Terminator' Rights Holder Sends Cease And Desist Letter To Kill Proposed 3D Animated Feature |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=August 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificor responded with a [[cease and desist]] letter, declining a $20–30&amp;nbsp;million offer from Hannover for the rights to produce the film, killing the project.&lt;ref name="Terminator3000" /&gt;

=== ''The Last Train from Hiroshima: The Survivors Look Back'' ===
On August 12, 2010, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that Cameron was working on a biographical film about [[Tsutomu Yamaguchi]], a Japanese man that survived the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in 1945. The film's title was announced as ''Last Train to Hiroshima''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/08/12/james-cameron-avatar-hiroshima/|title=James Cameron on his 'Hiroshima' movie -- due 'sometime before the next nuclear war'|date=12 August 2010|publisher=ew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron met Yamaguchi just days before he died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film will be based on the book of the same by [[Charles R.

=== ''At the Mountains of Madness'' ===
On July 28, 2010, it was announced that Cameron would produce a film adaptation of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]], with Mexican film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] as director. The movie was originally set up as a project at [[DreamWorks]] in 2004, but it was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671|title=Cameron to Produce Del Toro's 'Madness' for Universal|work=TheWrap}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron suggested casting [[Tom Cruise]] in the lead role and releasing the film in [[3D film|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/unproduced-and-unfinished-films-a-ongoing-film-comment-project/|title=Unproduced and Unfinished Films: An Ongoing Film Comment project - Film Comment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In June 2010, del Toro said that the adaptation probably would not happen at all. He stated, "It doesn't look like I can do it. It's very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it's tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/next-guillermo-del-toro/|title=What Next For Guillermo Del Toro?|last=Williams|first=Owen|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron and Del Toro put forward the idea to Universal, who greenlit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=James Cameron Talks 9 Minutes of AVATAR Re-Release Footage, Shooting the Sequels Back to Back, 3D Conversions, and AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS |work=Collider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814124924/http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro |archivedate=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Earlier that same year, del Toro had also asked [[S. T. Joshi]] if he wanted to be a consultant once the movie got into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stjoshi.org/news.html |title=S. T. Joshi - Blog |work=stjoshi.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312123740/http://stjoshi.org/news.html |archivedate=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, due to many delays, Cameron and del Toro left the project after del Toro realized that the film would have been very similar to [[Ridley Scott]]'s 2012 film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''.

=== Untitled ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' prequel ===
On May 5, 2012, Cameron expressed his desire to direct a prequel to his acclaimed and successful ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/05/james-cameron-on-chinese-filmmakers-censorship-and-potential-co-productions/?_r=0|title=James Cameron on Chinese Filmmakers, Censorship and Potential Co-Productions|first=Edward|last=Wong|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sigourney Weaver]] slated to reprise her role as Dr. Grace Augustine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2012/06/26/james-cameron-will-film-three-avatar-sequels-at-the-same-time|title=James Cameron Will Film Three "Avatar" Sequels At the Same Time|date=26 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was originally supposed to be shot [[back to back film production|back-to-back]] with the second and third installment, as the prequel was supposed to be the fourth installment in the franchise. However, on September 8, 2012, Cameron revealed that the prequel will not be shot back-to-back with the second and the third films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1693478/james-cameron-avatar-4/|title=James Cameron Reveals 'Avatar 4' Plans As A Prequel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in April 2016, it was stated by Cameron that the fourth and fifth installments are planned to be sequels like the first two,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cinemacon-james-cameron-announces-four-884060|title=CinemaCon: James Cameron Announces Four 'Avatar' Sequels|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the fate of the prequel project unknown.

=== ''The Informationist'' ===
On October 23, 2012, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Cameron had acquired the rights to direct a film adaptation of Taylor Stevens's novel ''[[The Informationist]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Cameron's [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] was attached to develop the film. He announced that he would direct the film after finishing his work on the first two ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/23/entertainment/la-et-mn-james-cameron-to-direct-novel-the-informationist-20121023|title=James Cameron to direct 'The Informationist'|first=Rebecca|last=Keegan|date=23 October 2012|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's release was planned to be in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-informationist/23163/james-cameron-signs-up-to-direct-the-informationist|title=James Cameron signs up to direct The Informationist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no film was made, implying that the project was likely abandoned after the announcement of two more ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/james-cameron-gives-update-on-avatar-sequels-expanding-to-four-sequels-slams-screening-room-gets-cheers-from-exhibs-cinemacon-1201737814/|title=James Cameron Expands ‘Avatar’ Sequels To Four, Slams Screening Room &amp; Gets Cheers From Exhibs- CinemaCon|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=14 April 2016|publisher=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Dive'' ===
After [[Audrey Mestre]]{{’s}} accident, [[Francisco Ferreras]] wrote ''The Dive'', which became an international bestseller. In 2015, James Cameron acquired the movie rights and was producing the film. Oscar-winning actress [[Jennifer Lawrence]], star of ''[[The Hunger Games (film series)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'' and ''[[Joy (film)|Joy]]'', had been cast to play Audrey Mestre. [[Francis Lawrence]], director of ''The Hunger Games'', was directing. The film was being compared to Cameron’s earlier blockbuster movie, ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', and was scheduled to be released in 2017. Since then, there has been no further anouncements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Justin Kroll |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/jennifer-lawrence-dives-into-james-cameron-produced-biopic-1201407586/ |title=Jennifer Lawrence Dives Into James Cameron-Produced Biopic|journal=Variety |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kippinge Church''' ({{lang-da|Kippinge Kirke}}) stands alone, midway between Vester Kippinge and [[Øster Kippinge]] in northwestern [[Falster]], [[Denmark]]. It is west of Redslev wood.&lt;ref name="GreatBritain1895"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Hydrographic Dept|title=The Baltic Pilot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaSjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA343|edition=Public domain|year=1895|publisher=Darling &amp; Son Ltd|pages=343–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to three reputed miracles, the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]] church attracted many [[pilgrim]]s until the end of the 19th century. It is known for its rich [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] furnishings and its [[fresco]]s from the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker_K-K%C3%A5/Kippinge_Kirke "Kippinge Church"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 8 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By 1338, the villages of Vester- and Østerkippinge had grown up on either side of the [[parish church]], which remained on an isolated site in the countryside.&lt;ref name="HybelPoulsen2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hybel|first1=Nils|last2=Poulsen|first2=Bjørn|title=The Danish Resources C. 1000&amp;ndash;1550: Growth and Recession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPvmhL-wuEcC&amp;pg=PA154|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16192-4|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages]], the church was dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]]. At the beginning of the 16th century, the Crown had calling rights for the appointment of clergy similar to the English ''[[advowson]]''. In 1767, it&lt;!--the church building?  or the appointment right?--&gt; was sold into private ownership but was soon reacquired by the State until 1868, when it was sold to the citizens of the parish. It gained full independence in 1938.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

The church is famous for the pilgrims it attracted over the centuries thanks to three reputed miracles. The first miracle was the [[Bleeding host|bleeding]] [[Holy Eucharist|Sacrament]] in 1492. The second was a miraculous altarpiece depicting the [[Virgin Mary]]. The church subsisted as a result of the healing properties of its [[Holy well|holy spring]].&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_1216-1243.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Kippinge Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 1216–1243. {{da icon}} Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aabne-samlinger.dk/lasa/temaer/helligkilder/temasider/tema-7.asp "Sct.

==Architecture==
The [[nave]], culminating in a [[chancel]] with a three-sided end, was built of red brick on a sloping [[plinth]] in the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]] style c. 1300. The north door, with its pointed arch, and the priest's door are bricked in while the somewhat modified south door is still in use. The porch and tower were added in the Late Gothic period. The west chapel, adjoining the tower, which is no doubt connected with the pilgrimages, was built slightly before the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The chancel initially had five small pointed windows which have been replaced with more recent round-arched windows. The [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] [[spire]] was renovated in 1911. Its base takes the form of a sturdy dome with an octagonal lantern.

The church provides excellent examples of work intricately carved by [[Jørgen Ringnis]] in the [[Auricular style]]. The [[altarpiece]] (1633), with a central painting probably by [[Anthonius Clement]], is flanked by the figures of [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]]. It also presents female figures symbolizing [[Theological virtues|Faith, Hope and Charity]] and is decorated with angels. The pedestal has two figures of Christ, one at his christening, the other at the [[Last Supper]]. The figures of [[Saint Luke|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]] stand on either side of the [[cornice]].

The elaborately carved octagonal [[Baptismal font|font]] and [[canopy (building)|canopy]] are also by Ringnis (1635), the base bearing the figures of the four Evangelists.&lt;ref name="Trap1954"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trap|first=Jens Peter|title=Danmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NBBAAAAYAAJ|year=1954|publisher=G. E. C. Gad.|page=944|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The double-arched panels present the [[Annunciation]], Christ's birth, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[Circumcision of Jesus|Circumcision]]. The canopy, shaped as an octagonal lantern with arched panels as in the base, bears male and female [[Herma|herms]]. In the centre, there is a baptismal scene with naked figures. The highly coloured and gilded finish has been restored. The lattice choir screen (1650) consists of nine panels decorated with flowers, herms and symbols of the virtues. The pedestal bears the naked figures of [[Adam and Eve]] while the upper cartouche presents Christ bearing the globe. The screen was decorated by Hans Lauridsen in 1680, who also added the six small paintings of a woman in various positions. Ringnis' [[pulpit]] (1631) is similar to that in [[Nakskov Church]] with figures of the Evangelists and of [[John the Baptist]], Christ and [[Moses]]. The coloured decorations and paintings are probably the work of Anthonius Clement.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

The church has two old crucifixes, one from the 14th century, the other from the 15th century. The old font in the west chapel is of [[Gotland]] limestone. Its base is decorated with four heads.&lt;ref name=nordensk/&gt;

==Frescos==
The frescos in the chancel vault are from c. 1300. They were rediscovered under the [[limewash]] in 1904 and restored in 1909. The well executed paintings present images principally from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Chapters 3 and 4, by artists from the Kippinge workshop. In the east panel, Christ flanked by Mary and John the Baptist and two angels can be seen. To the west are frescos of Adam and Eve and the sacrifice of [[Cain and Abel]]. The north panel shows the [[Fratricide]] and St Michael combating the dragon. The eastern side of the north vault presents the Annunciation adjacent to the Fall.&lt;ref name=nordensk/&gt;

The '''Kossuth Prize''' ({{lang-hu|Kossuth-díj}}) is a state-sponsored award in [[Hungary]], named after the Hungarian politician and revolutionary [[Lajos Kossuth]]. The Prize was established in 1948 (on occasion of the centenary of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|March 15th revolution]], the day on which it is still handed over every year) by the [[Hungarian National Assembly]], to acknowledge outstanding personal and group achievements in the fields of science, culture and the arts, as well as in the building of [[Socialism]] in general.

In 1950s the award was given to Gabor Bela Fodor for his contributions in the field of Chemistry as the prize was given to selected scientists. Since 1963, the domain was restricted to culture and the arts. Today, it is regarded as the most prestigious cultural award in Hungary, and is awarded by the [[President of Hungary|President]].

The '''Lansdowne portrait''' is an [[cultural icon|icon]]ic life-size portrait of [[George Washington]] painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]] in 1796. It depicts a 64-year-old Washington in his last year as [[President of the United States]]. Stuart painted the Lansdowne portrait, three copies of it, and five portraits that were closely related to it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|175}} The most famous copy is the one in the [[East Room]] of the [[White House]].

To preclude its possible sale at auction, the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, D.C. purchased the original painting in 2001, for (the amount is rumored to be,)
$2,000,000
==History==
The Lansdowne portrait likely (and fancifully) depicts President Washington's December 7, 1795 annual address to the [[4th United States Congress|Fourth U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} The highly-unpopular [[Jay Treaty]], settling claims between the United States and Great Britain left over from the Revolutionary War, had been presented for approval to the U.S. Senate earlier in the year. The Senate held a special session to debate the treaty in June, at which opposition to it had been fierce. Exactly two-thirds of the 30 senators (the minimum required under the U.S. Constitution) approved the treaty in mid-August, and Washington, who strongly supported the treaty, signed it in late August.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} The President's annual address was on the first day of the next session of Congress. Washington acknowledged the struggle over the treaty and called for unity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29437 George Washington - Seventh Annual Address to Congress], from The American Presidency Project.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait's paper, pen and inkwell may allude to his signing of the treaty.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}} There was lingering resentment in the House of Representatives, which expressed its displeasure by declining to appropriate funding for the treaty's implementation until April 1796.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"&gt;Ellen G. Miles, ""Gilbert Stuart's 'Lansdowne' Portrait of George Washington: From Private Diplomatic Gift to State Portrait," lecture given at the National Portrait Gallery, September 25, 2014.[https://vimeo.com/133491164]&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the Lansdowne portrait was celebrated as Washington's endorsement of the Jay Treaty:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The portrait presented by the President {{sic}} to the Marquis of Lansdowne is one of the finest pictures we have seen since the death of Reynolds. The dress he wears is plain black velvet; he has his sword on, upon the hilt of which one hand rests while the other is extended, as the figure is standing and addressing the Hall of Assembly. The point of time is that when he recommended inviolable union between America and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oracle and Public Advertiser'' (London), May 15, 1797.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The December 7, 1795 address was the last that President Washington delivered to Congress ''in person''. The following year he published his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] in the newspapers, rather than delivering it to Congress.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|172}}

===Stuart===
[[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]] &amp;ndash; who as [[British Prime Minister]] had secured a peaceful end to the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]]&lt;ref name=www.number10.gov.uk&gt;{{cite web|last=www.number10.gov.uk|first=U.K.Government|title=Past Prime Ministers|publisher=U.K.Government|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; commissioned Stuart to paint a portrait of George Washington. Stuart lived in England and Ireland for eighteen years, and Lansdowne may have placed the order for a portrait prior to the artist's return to the United States in early 1793.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} Stuart lived and worked in New York City for a year and a half before moving to Philadelphia in November 1794.&lt;ref name="Zygmont"&gt;
Bryan Zygmont, [https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-americas/british-colonies/early-republic/a/gilbert-stuarts-lansdowne-portrait "Gilbert Stuart's Lansdowne Portrait,"] from Khan Academy.&lt;/ref&gt; He informed his uncle in Philadelphia of his upcoming arrival: "The object of my journey is only to secure a picture of the President, &amp; finish yours."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart to Joseph Anthony, 2 November 1794, Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston. Quoted in Miles, pp. 129-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philadelphia]] served as the temporary national capital from 1790 to 1800 &amp;ndash; while Washington, D.C. was under construction. Stuart was introduced to the President in December 1794, at one of Mrs. Washington's [[President's House (Philadelphia)|Friday evening "drawingrooms."]]&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|133}} But it was not until the following fall that Washington granted him a sitting. Meanwhile, Stuart gathered orders for portraits&amp;mdash;among his papers is a document titled: "A list of gentlemen who are to have copies of the portrait of the President of the United States." and dated: "Philadelphia. April 20th, 1795."&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|87–88}} Lord Lansdowne's name was third on the list of thirty-two subscribers.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|87}}{{efn|In a September 25, 2014 lecture, Ellen G. Miles, Curator Emerita of the National Portrait Gallery, noted that others on Stuart's list of subscribers received copies of Washington head-and-bust portraits, but Lord Lansdowne received an original full-length portrait. She theorized that Lansdowne had ordered a standard portrait, but it was upgraded at Senator Bingham's suggestion (and expense) to an original and full-length portrait, a much more impressive gift.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"/&gt;}}

According to [[Rembrandt Peale]], President Washington granted a joint sitting to Stuart and him "in the Autumn of 1795."&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|88}} Stuart was not wholly satisfied with the resulting "Vaughan-style" portrait, but still painted between twelve and sixteen copies of it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|135}} He later claimed to have destroyed his original.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|88}} While visiting London a decade earlier, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[William Bingham]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and his wife, Anne Willing Bingham, had sat for a family portrait by Stuart (abandoned).&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|198}} The artist may have approached Mrs. Bingham for assistance in getting the President to grant him another sitting:&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|91}}

According to Rembrandt Peale, this was the only sitting that Washington granted for the Lansdowne portrait.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"&gt;Ellen Gross Miles, "George Washington (The Lansdowne Portrait)," in ''Gilbert Stuart'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004), pp. 166-90.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}} It took place in Stuart's studio (and lodgings) in William Moore Smith's house, at 5th &amp; Chestnut Streets.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|168}} With severely limited time, Stuart was forced to concentrate on the President's head and face.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|168}} There are multiple claims as to who posed for the body of the figure, including his landlord, Smith.{{efn|In [[George Washington Parke Custis|"Wash" Custis]]'s description of Washington's annual address to Congress (either 1794 or 1795, by Thomas Jefferson's presence), he wrote: "Washington was dressed precisely as Stuart has painted him in Lord Lansdowne's full-length portrait&amp;mdash;" and then proceeded to give a detailed description. On the portrait: "The defect in the full-length is in the limbs. For the figure, a man named Smith, with whom Stuart boarded, stood&amp;mdash;a smaller man than Washington; and the hands were painted from a wax cast of Stuart's own hand, which was much smaller than Washington's." On the mouth: "Washington, at the time Stuart painted his portrait, had a set of sea-horse ivory teeth. These, just made, were too large and clumsy, and gave that peculiar appearance of the mouth seen in Stuart's picture."&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Parke Custis, ''Recollections and Private Memoirs of Washington'' (New York: Derby &amp; Jackson, 1860), pp. 491, 520-23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The portrait was begun by Stuart in his Philadelphia studio and completed in his [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] studio, the second floor of a stable some 8 miles north of the city.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|130–31}} The artist moved to Germantown in Summer 1796 to avoid distractions.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|165–66}} The Binghams had enjoyed Lord Lansdowne's hospitality in London, and persuaded Stuart to allow them to pay for the portrait.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|166, 168}} Stuart completed the Lansdowne portrait by the fall of 1796, and Senator Bingham paid his fee of $1,000.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|170}} Bingham had an ornate frame made for it, and arranged for it to shipped to England in late November. Lord Lansdowne had received the portrait by March 5, 1797, when he mentioned it in a letter.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Lansdowne's letter of thanks to Mrs. Bingham survives, but is undated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A very fine portrait of the greatest man living in a magnificent frame found its way into my hall, with no one thing left for me to do regarding it, except to thank the amiable donor of it. It is universally approv'd and admir'd, and I see with satisfaction, that there is no one who does not turn away from every thing else, to pay their homage to General Washington. Among many circumstances which contribute to enhance the value of it, I shall always consider the quarter from whence it comes as most flattering, &amp; I look forward with the greatest pleasure to the time of shewing you and Mr. Bingham where I have plac'd it.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|170}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stuart's first copy of the portrait was for the Binghams (now at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]), and would have been completed before the original left his studio.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt; The President and First Lady visited Germantown on January 7, 1797: "Road [rode] to German Town with Mrs. Washington to see Mr. Stuarts paintings."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig, eds., ''The Diaries of George Washington, Volume 6'' (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1976&amp;ndash;79), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bingham copy was still in the studio on July 27, 1797, when Robert Gilmor Jr. viewed it.&lt;ref name="Gilmor"&gt;Robert Gilmor Jr., ''Memorandums Made in a Tour to the Eastern States in the Year 1797'' (Boston: Trustees of the Boston Public Library, 1892), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The William Kerin Constable copy (now at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]) was completed that same month.&lt;ref name="Lansdowne"/&gt;{{rp|178}} The Gardiner Baker copy (now at the White House) is presumed to have been the copy commissioned by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] in September 1796, likely as a diplomatic gift to France;{{efn|Ellen G. Miles has a theory as to why Charles Cotesworth Pinckney commissioned and paid for, but never retrieved his copy of the Lansdowne portrait from Gilbert Stuart's studio.&lt;br&gt;[[James Monroe]] was Minister to France in 1795, when the Jay Treaty was signed. France was then at war with Great Britain, and despite his best efforts, Monroe could not convince the French government that this was a benign treaty that would not affect Franco-American relations. President Washington recalled Monroe, and nominated Pinckney as his successor. Pinckney was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in September 1796, and arrived in Paris in November.&lt;br&gt;The [[French Directory]] refused to accept Pinckney's credentials, and negotiations between the countries broke down when French officials demanded a substantial bribe, in what became known as the [[XYZ Affair]].&lt;br&gt;Miles's theory is that Pinckney's copy of the Lansdowne portrait was intended as a diplomatic gift from the U.S. to France. Pinckney's deliberate humiliation and the suspension of diplomatic relations between the countries (for nearly 5 years) caused those plans (and the portrait) to be abandoned. Supporting evidence for this theory is that Pinckney later sought reimbursement from Secretary of State Timothy Pickering for the $500 that he paid to Stuart for the portrait.&lt;ref name="Miles lecture"/&gt;}} and resold by Stuart to Baker by December 1797.&lt;ref name="Stretch"&gt;Bonnie Barrett Stretch, "The White House Washington, If Stuart Didn't Paint It, Who Did?"

==Provenance==
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the death of Lord Lansdowne, his pictures were sold by auction. The ''Washington'' was purchased by Samuel Williams, an English {{sic}} merchant, for $2,000. Williams subsequently became insolvent, and his creditors disposed of the ''Washington'' by a lottery. Forty tickets were sold, at fifty guineas each. The picture fell to Mr. J. Delaware Lewis, a nephew of Mr. William D. Lewis, of Philadelphia. But few Americans had ever seen the picture, and Mr. William D. Lewis, who was Chairman of the Committee on Art, obtained the loan of it from his nephew for the [[1876 Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]]. It was sent out with the loan collection from England, unpacked at [[Memorial Hall (Philadelphia)|Memorial Hall]], and hung up in the British section before its arrival was known to the Fine Arts Committee. An effort was subsequently made to have it transferred to the American section, but it was unsuccessful. At the close of the Exhibition, it was returned to its owner in England.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;George Champlin Mason, ''The Life and Works of Gilbert Stuart'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1894).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description and Analysis==
[[File:Lansdowne portrait table leg.png|140px|thumb|left|The table leg may have been inspired by a wooden [[ceremonial mace]] used by the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (the U.S. House symbol was itself inspired by the Roman ''[[fasces]]''). The House mace was a bundle of tied reeds topped with a [[bald eagle]], an American symbol.]]
[[File:Gilbert Stuart - George Washington (detail of book labels) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Detail of the book bindings in the White House's copy of the Lansdowne portrait. "UNITED STATES" is spelled as "UNITED SATES" to distinguish the copy.]]
The painting is full of symbolism, drawn from American and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] symbols of the [[Roman Republic]]. Stuart painted Washington from life, showing him standing up, dressed in a black [[velvet]] suit with an outstretched hand held up in an [[Eloquence|oratorical]] manner. Behind Washington is a row of two [[Doric column]]s, with another row to the left. Wrapped around and between the columns are red tasseled drapes.

Washington's suit is plain and simple, and the [[sword]] he holds on his left side is a dress sword and not a battle sword (symbolizing a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[form of government]], rather than a [[monarchy]] or [[military dictatorship]]). In the sky, storm clouds appear on the left while a [[rainbow]] appears on the right, signifying the [[American Revolutionary War]] giving way to the peace and prosperity of the new [[United States]] after the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]]. The medallion at the top of the chair shows the red, white, and blue colors of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].

On and under the tablecloth-draped table to the left are two [[book]]s: ''Federalist''&amp;mdash;probably a reference to the ''[[Federalist Papers]]''&amp;mdash;and ''Journal of Congress''&amp;mdash;the ''[[Congressional Record]]''. Another five books are under the table: the three to the right are ''General Orders'', ''American Revolution'', and ''Constitutional Bylaws''&amp;mdash;symbolizing Washington's leadership as [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] and [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]].

The [[pen]] and [[paper]] on the table signify the [[rule of law]]. The table's leg is shaped like a [[fasces]], an ancient Roman symbol of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[authority]] (''[[imperium]]''). On the far left of the table is a [[silver]] [[inkwell]], emblazed with [[Coat of Arms of George Washington|George Washington's coat of arms]] (see [[Syng inkstand]]). A white [[quill]] rests upon silver [[dog]]s, ancient symbols of [[loyalty]]. Behind these on the table is a large black [[hat]].

Washington's unusually clenched [[facial expression]] comes from his famous [[Dentures|false teeth]]. [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]]'s [[marble]] [[sculpture]] of Washington shows a more natural expression. Stuart wrote: "When I painted him [Washington], he had just had a set of false teeth inserted, which accounts for the constrained expression so noticeable about the mouth and lower part of the face ... Houdon's [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] does not suffer from this defect."

==Alternate versions==
===Constable-Hamilton portrait===
Stuart painted a 1797 seated portrait of Washington, based on the Lansdowne. William Kerin Constable, who commissioned the Lansdowne copy now at the Brooklyn Museum, also commissioned the seated version.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|98}} Constable presented it to [[Alexander Hamilton]] in 1797.&lt;ref name="Mason"/&gt;{{rp|98}} The portrait remained in the Hamilton family until 1896, when it was bequeathed to the [[Lenox Library (New York City)|Lenox Library]].&lt;ref name="CBMAA"/&gt; The Lenox Library later merged with the [[New York Public Library]]. The portrait was auctioned at Sotheby's NY, 30 November 2005, lot 3, and sold for $8,136,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2005/american-paintings-drawings-sculpture-including-property-from-the-new-york-public-library-astor-lenox-and-tilden-foundations-n08134/lot.3.html George Washington (Constable-Hamilton Portrait)], from Sotheby's NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constable-Hamilton Portrait is now in the collection of the [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]], in [[Bentonville, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="CBMAA"&gt;[http://collection.crystalbridges.org/objects/193/george-washington-the-constablehamilton-portrait?ctx=cf2d7cdf-4879-41e8-9884-d94fb9947503&amp;idx=2 George Washington - The Constable-Hamilton Portrait], from Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munro-Lenox portrait===
Stuart made several changes for the Munro-Lenox portrait ({{circa}}1800):&lt;ref&gt;[https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=D52X1907708G8.5587&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!47905~!2&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Lenox&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;oper=&amp;term=Stuart,+Gilbert&amp;index=.AW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 George Washington - The Munro-Lenox Portrait], from SIRIS.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington's head is slightly turned, and his hand is on the table, rather than gesturing into the air. The President looks directly at the viewer, rather than off to the side, which makes it a more compelling image than the Lansdowne.&lt;ref name="Miles"/&gt; The head appears to be based on Stuart's Athenaeum portrait (the image on the one-dollar bill).&lt;ref name="Miles"/&gt; The wall behind the President is lowered, allowing for a more dramatic scene of the sun breaking through the storm clouds. After 135 years of ownership by the [[New York Public Library]], the Munro-Lenox portrait was deassessioned and offered for auction in 2005.&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.5.html/2005/american-paintings-drawings-sculpture-including-property-from-the-new-york-public-library-astor-lenox-and-tilden-foundations-n08134 George Washington - The Munro-Lenox Portrait], from Sotheby's New York.&lt;/ref&gt; It failed to sell at auction, and was sold in a private sale for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/arts/design/05voge.html "A Pair of New Owners for an Old President,"] ''The New York Times'', January 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart painted three full-size copies of the Munro-Lenox Portrait, one for the Connecticut State House in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]; and two for Rhode Island&amp;mdash;one for the State House in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and the other for [[Old Colony House]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]].&lt;ref name="Miles"&gt;Ellen Gross Miles, "George Washington (The Munro-Lenox Portrait)," in ''Gilbert Stuart'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2004), pp. 186-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''[[Printmaking]] art techniques such as [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[woodcut]] and [[lithography]] are covered more fully in their respective articles.''
'''Line art''' or '''line drawing''' is any image that consists of distinct straight or curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in [[shading|shade]] (darkness) or [[hue]] ([[color]]) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art can use lines of different colors, although line art is usually monochromatic.
Line art emphasizes [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[Outline drawing|outline]], over color, shading, and [[wikt:texture|texture]]. However, areas of solid [[pigment]] and dots can also be used in addition to lines. The lines in a piece of line art may be all of a constant width (as in some [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil drawings]]), of several (few) constant widths (as in [[technical illustration]]s), or of freely varying widths (as in brush work or [[engraving]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Line art may tend towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (as in much of [[Gustave Doré]]'s work), or it may be a [[caricature]], [[cartoon]], [[ideograph]], or [[glyph]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Before the development of [[photography]] and of [[halftone]]s, line art was the standard format for [[illustrations]] to be used in [[Printing|print]] publications, using black ink on white paper.  Using either [[stippling]] or [[hatching]], shades of gray could also be simulated.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

One of the most fundamental elements of art is the line. An important feature of a line is that it indicates the edge of a two-dimensional (flat) shape or a three-dimensional form.  A shape can be indicated by means of an outline and a three-dimensional form can be indicated by [[contour lines]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Henry M. ''A World of Art''. Prentice Hall. Upper Saddle River, NJ: 2010. {{ISBN|978-0205887576}}  pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léon Joseph Florentin Bonnat''' (20 June 1833 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1922) was a French painter, Grand Officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and professor at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]].

==Early life==
Bonnat was born in [[Bayonne]], but from 1846 to 1853 he lived in [[Madrid]], where his father owned a bookshop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/features/viewArtist.cfm?1=1&amp;searchType=artist&amp;artistRef=O2WDUSDC7W Artfact.com]. Retrieved November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; While tending his father's shop, he copied engravings of works by the Old Masters, developing a passion for drawing. In Madrid he received his artistic training under [[Raimundo de Madrazo y Garreta|Madrazo]].
He later worked in [[Paris]], where he became known as a leading portraitist, never without a commission. His many portraits show the influence of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and other Spanish masters, as well as [[Titian]] and [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], whose works he studied in the Prado. Following the period in Spain Bonnat worked the ateliers of the history painters [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Paul Delaroche]] and [[Leon Cogniet]] (1854) in Paris. Despite repeated attempts, he failed to win the prix de Rome, finally receiving only a second prize. However, a scholarship from his native Bayonne allowed him to spend three years in Rome (1858–60) independently. During his stay in Rome, he became friends with [[Edgar Degas]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jean-Jacques Henner]] and the sculptor [[Henri Chapu]].

==Career==
Bonnat won a medal of honor in Paris in 1869, going on to become one of the leading artists of his day. Bonnat went on to win the Grand Officer of the [[Légion d'honneur]] and became a professor at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]] in 1882.  Bonnat was quite popular with American students in Paris. In addition to his native French, he spoke Spanish and Italian and knew English well, to the relief of many monolingual Americans. In May 1905 he succeeded [[Paul Dubois (sculptor)|Paul Dubois]] as director of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Julius Kaplan characterised Bonnat as "a liberal teacher who stressed simplicity in art above high academic finish, as well as overall effect rather than detail."&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Kaplan]], "Leon Bonnat", ''The Dictionary of Art'', Volume IV, New York: Grove, 1996, {{ISBN|9781884446009}}, p.&amp;nbsp;329.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnat's emphasis on overall effect on the one hand, and rigorous drawing on the other, put him in a middle position with respect to the [[Impressionists]] and academic painters like his friend [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. In 1917, Bonnat was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary Corresponding member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalacademy.org/academy/national-academicians/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314023614/http://www.nationalacademy.org/academy/national-academicians/ |archivedate=2016-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
[[File:Bonnat01.jpg|thumb|230px|''The Resurrection of Lazarus'' by Bonnat in 1857]]
Bonnat's vivid portraits of contemporary celebrities are his most characteristic works, but his most important works are arguably his powerful religious paintings, such as his ''Christ on the Cross'' (now in the collection of the [[Musée du Petit Palais]] in Paris, but not currently on display), ''Job'' (in the [[Musée Bonnat]]), ''St Vincent Taking the Place of Two Galley Slaves'' (at the church of Saint-Nicholas des Champs in Paris), and the large ''Martyrdom of St Denis'' for the Pantheon in Paris. However, he received few commissions for religious and historical paintings, and most of his output consists of portraits. He also produced [[genre painting]]s of Italian peasants, and a small number of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] scenes.

The writers [[Émile Zola]] and [[Théophile Gautier]] were among Bonnat's supporters. Gautier hailed him as "the antithesis of [[Bouguereau]]," because of the stark naturalism and lack of surface finish that characterize Bonnat's work. Bonnat is an [[Academic painting|academic painter]]. He was a member of the Institute, one of the only 14 painters who had administrative power over the Academy des Beaux Arts and thereby the Ecole des Beaux Arts.  He had friends and connections among the independent artists of his time as well, such as [[Edgar Degas]], whom he met during his stay in Rome and who painted two portraits of Bonnat, and [[Édouard Manet]], who shared his predilection for Spanish painting. He taught together with [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]] in the private atelier he ran before becoming professor at the École. He supported [[Auguste Rodin]]'s candidacy for the Institut, and defended [[Gustave Courbet]]'s submissions to the salon.

==Later life==
In a gesture of gratitude for the help he had been provided in his youth, Bonnat built a museum in his native city of Bayonne, the [[Musée Bonnat]]. Most of the works in the museum are from Bonnat's personal collection of works of art, amassed over a lifetime of travelling around Europe. It includes an exceptionally fine collection of Old Master drawings from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]] to [[Ingres]] and [[Géricault]].

Bonnat died on 8 September 1922 at [[Monchy-Saint-Éloi]]; he never married, and lived for much of his life with his mother and sister in the [[Place Vintimille]] (renamed Place Adolphe-Max since 1940).&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00616F93A5D1A7A93C0AB1782D85F468285F9 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some of Bonnat's more notable students include: [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Stanhope Forbes]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke]], [[Gustaf Cederström]], [[Laurits Tuxen]], [[P. S. Krøyer]], [[Marc Aurèle de Foy Suzor-Coté|Suzor-Coté]], [[Alfred Philippe Roll]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Jean Béraud]], [[Franklin Brownell]], [[Marius Vasselon]], [[Hubert-Denis Etcheverry]], [[Fred Barnard]], [[Louis Béroud]], [[Paul de la Boulaye]], [[Aloysius O'Kelly]], [[Erik Werenskiold]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Alphonse Osbert]], [[Henry Siddons Mowbray]], [[Charles Sprague Pearce]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Hyakutake Kaneyuki]], [[Nils Forsberg]] and [[Walter Tyndale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwar.com/masters/b/bonnat-leon.html World Wide Arts Resources.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720212142/http://wwar.com/masters/b/bonnat-leon.html |date=2012-07-20 }} Retrieved November 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madras''' is a lightweight [[cotton]] [[fabric]] with typically patterned texture and plaid design, used primarily for summer clothing such as pants, shorts, dresses, and jackets. The fabric takes its name from the former name of the city of [[Chennai]] in  [[India]].

Madras today is available as [[Tartan|plaid]] patterns in regular cotton, [[seersucker]] and as patchwork madras, meaning cutting several madras plaid fabrics into squares or rectangles and sewing them back together to form a mixed pattern of various plaids.

==Definition==
Authentic Madras comes from  Chennai (Madras); both sides of the cloth must bear the same pattern; it must be handwoven (evidenced by the small flaws in the fabric).&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;
Cotton madras is woven from a fragile, short-staple cotton fiber that can’t be [[combing|combed]], only [[carding|carded]],&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;  resulting in bumps known as  [[Slub (knitting)|slubs]] which are thick spots in the [[yarn]] that give madras its unique texture. The cotton is hand-dyed after being spun into yarn, woven and finished in some 200 small villages in the Madras area.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Madras-tissue01a.JPG|thumb|right|300px|A [[handkerchief]] with a typical Madras pattern]]
Madras fabric is generally regarded as belonging to the [[peasant]] class in its native India.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; 
Dutch traders arrived in India in the early 1600s to trade in the local [[calico]] cloth, followed by the British. The [[English East India Company]] sought quality textiles, finding the small fishing village of Madraspatnam (Madras), and the company established a trading post there in the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;  The first madras material&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvsfg | title=Cotton: a Yarn with a Twist | work=The Forum | date=19 December 2017 | publisher=BBC | accessdate=29 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[muslin]] overprinted or embroidered in elaborate patterns with vegetable [[dye]]s.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; To secure a reliable [[Contract labour|labor]] supply, the English East India Company  promised a 30-year exemption from [[Duty (economics)|duties]] for Indian weavers in the area, and thus within a year nearly 400 families of weavers had settled in Madras.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Raphael Schneider, gentlemansgazette.com [http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/madras-guide-shirts-pants-history-where-to-buy/ Madras Guide – How the Shirt, Pants &amp; Jackets Became Popular] 12 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Undyed madras cloth became  popular in Europe because it was lightweight and breathable.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; Cotton plaid madras reached America in 1718 as a donation to the Collegiate School of Connecticut (now known as [[Yale University]]).&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; [[Sears]] offered the first madras shirt for sale to the American consumer in its 1897 catalog.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;
 
The name  "madras" was attributed to [[shirt]] maker David J. Anderson in 1844,&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;   although the material had been referred to as such much earlier.   In 1958 William Jacobson, a leading textile importer, traveled to [[Bombay]] to trade with Captain C.P. Krishnan, exporter of madras from Chennai (formerly [[Madras]]). The two men struck a dollar-a-yard deal for madras material possessing a "strong smell of vegetable dyes and [[sesame oil]]s," woven of bright colors and originally bound for [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; Krishnan warned Jacobson that the fabric should be washed gently in cold water to avoid bleeding, advice that never reached the [[Brooks Brothers]] buyers to whom Jacobson sold 10,000 yards for the manufacture of madras clothing.&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt; Brooks Brothers then  sold cotton madras garments to consumers without proper washing instructions, resulting  in  the bright madras dyes bleeding in the wash and the garments emerged discolored and faded. To counter dissatisfied customers, [[Madison Avenue]] advertising giant [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] coined the phrase "guaranteed to bleed" and used this as a selling point rather than a defect.   A 1966 catalog advertisement stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Authentic Indian Madras is completely handwoven from yarns dyed with native vegetable colorings. Home-spun by native weavers, no two plaids are exactly the same. When washed with mild soap in warm water, they are guaranteed to bleed and blend together into distinctively muted and subdued colorings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United States, the plaid cotton madras shirt became popular in the 1960s among the  post-[[World War II]] generation of [[preppy]] [[baby boomers]].&lt;ref name="Checkered Past"&gt;[[Orvis]] [http://www.orvis.com/news/products-we-love/checkered-past-a-brief-history-of-the-madras-plaid-shirt/ Checkered Past: A Brief History of the Madras Plaid Shirt]&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1930s, cotton madras clothing was  emerging as a [[status symbol]] in the US because only American tourists who could afford expensive [[Caribbean]] vacations during the [[Great Depression]] had access and thus  the madras shirt was a signal of [[affluence]].&lt;ref name="Checkered Past" /&gt;

The avenue begins on the [[National Congress of Brazil]] building and is considered part of the [[DF-002]] road. Its first section is known as "Ministries Esplanade" ("Esplanada dos Ministérios"), as it is surrounded by ministries buildings.  Many important [[government]] buildings, [[monument]]s and [[memorial]]s are located on the Monumental Axis.

A common [[urban legend]] persists that the Monumental Axis is the widest road in the world, where "[100 to 160] cars can drive side by side".  This is untrue, as the road consists of two avenues with six lanes on either side; a total of twelve lanes. However, the street has been featured in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as having the widest [[central reservation]] of a [[dual carriageway]] in the world.

On April 21, 2008, a year before they formally broke up, the Mexican pop group [[RBD]] performed a free concert to a crowd of 500,000 on the Monumental Axis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Show RBD no Brasil|url=http://www.tudoemfoco.com.br/show-rbd-no-brasil.html|website=tudoemfoco.com.br|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Empezar Desde Cero Tour 2008]]. The show was to celebrate the 48th Anniversary of the founding of [[Brasilia]]. It was recorded and released as a DVD titled [[Live in Brasilia]]. The crowd in attendance was the largest for which the group had performed.

'''PVC clothing''', commonly known as "vinyl clothing", is shiny clothing made of the plastic [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=53243 |title=poly(vinyl chloride) (CHEBI:53243) |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PVC plastic is also called vinyl. For this reason, this type of clothing is also called vinyl clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthybuilding.net/pvc/SortingOutVinyls.html |title=Sorting Out The Vinyls – EVA, PEVA, PVA, PVB, &amp; PVC |publisher=Healthybuilding.net |date=April 28, 2005 |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PVC is sometimes confused with the similarly shiny [[patent leather]].

The terms "PVC", "vinyl" and "PU" tend to be used interchangeably by retailers for clothing made from shiny plastic-coated fabrics. These fabrics
usually consist of a backing woven from [[polyester]] fibers with a surface coating of shiny plastic. The plastic layer itself is typically a blend of PVC and [[polyurethane]] (PU), with 100% PVC producing a stiff fabric with a glossy shine and 100% PU producing a stretchy fabric with a silky shine.
A manufacturer's label may say, for example, 67% polyester, 33% polyurethane for a fabric that contains no PVC; or 80% polyvinyl chloride, 20% polyurethane with mention of the polyester backing omitted.

The PVC can also be produced in bright colours (black, red, white, blue, orange, pink, silver, striped, etc.), adding further visual stimulus to the physical sensations produced by the material. The more frequently found colors are black and red. The PVC clothes are very associated with [[Retro-futurism|retro-futuristic look]], [[Goth subculture|Goth]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[alternative fashion]]s and [[clothing fetish]]. A common stereotype is the image of a [[dominatrix]] wearing a skin-tight PVC [[catsuit]], usually jet-black. In some cities it is more common to see people wearing PVC clothes, especially in large cities such as Berlin, London, New York City, Montreal, San Francisco, etc.

==History==

The plastics were used in clothing since its invention, particularly in raincoats. But PVC clothing became more noted in the 1960s and early 1970s fashion trend.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day, by Mila Contini, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion designers of that era saw the PVC plastic as the ideal material to design futuristic clothes. During that era, boots, raincoats, dresses and other PVC garments were made in many colors and even transparent and worn in public areas to some degrees. At that time it was also common to see PVC clothes on films and TV series such as [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]], for example. And since then these shiny [[Plastic clothing|plastic clothes]] became a [[PVC fetishism|fetish]] object.

In mid 1990s, clothes made of PVC have been prevalent in young people's fashions, particularly in jackets, skirts and trousers, also appearing in the media.&lt;ref name="modices"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modices.com.br/moda/a-proxima-textura-vinil/ |title=A próxima textura: vinil |publisher=Modices |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117100002/http://modices.com.br/moda/a-proxima-textura-vinil/ |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://renataabala.wordpress.com/2012/06/01/trend-alert-pecas-de-vinil/ |title=Trend Alert…Peças de Vinil… &amp;#124; Renata Bala – Consultora de Moda |publisher=Renataabala.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1990s it was common to see presenters, models, actresses, actors, singers and other celebrities wearing PVC clothes on TV and magazines. As fashions come round and round again, it would seem that PVC are appearing again in mainstream street fashions as well as continuing to be central to the fetish scene.&lt;ref name="modices" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutodopvc.org/pvcatualidades/noticia.php?edicao=36&amp;mat=63&amp;lang=pt |title=PVC Atualidades OnLine |publisher=Institutodopvc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820051647/http://www.institutodopvc.org/pvcatualidades/noticia.php?edicao=36&amp;mat=63&amp;lang=pt |archivedate=August 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the PVC has been the target of fashion not only for the female public but also to the male public.

==Caring for PVC clothing==

PVC clothing requires some care to make it last longer and maintain its appearance.
It is known that PVC clothes are made with a fabric covered with a plastic layer. For this reason, the PVC clothes should not be over-stretched, to avoid damage to the plastic layer.
When excessively stretching the clothing, the plastic layer can lose its smooth texture and stay striated, losing also part of the original shine, and may even tear.

If the PVC clothing is not soiled, many people will just freshen the polyester inside up with a fabric refresher product and wipe the plastic outside with a damp sponge. If there is need, PVC clothes should be washed by hand with warm water and a small amount of liquid [[detergent]]. [[Laundry detergent|Washing powder]] should not be used because the flakes can remain on clothing after washing, and also can stick to the plastic layer.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedvegas.net/vinylcare.html |title=Vinyl, PVC Taking Care of your Clothing |publisher=Wicked-Vegas |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To remove the detergent one should use cold water and after turning the garment inside out it should be left to dry under the shade. After drying the inside (polyester fabric), then it must be turned in the right direction to dry outside (plastic layer).&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

PVC clothing should never be [[Clothes iron|ironed]]. This type of clothing is made of heat sensitive plastics and which may melt under the iron, and high temperatures should be avoided from any source, such as flames, [[clothes dryer|dryers]], and cigarettes. The fumes from burning or smoking PVC plastic are dangerous.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

Different coloured PVC garments, especially white, should be stored separately from each other, otherwise staining may occur. PVC clothing is best stored hanging in a garment bag away from other clothing.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

The fabric used for PVC clothes is typically plastic-coated polyester. This PVC fabric is more resistant to wear and tear than rubber, and PVC clothing does not require the use of any shining products. However one can polish PVC clothing if desired with liquid [[silicone]] spray which is available from car accessory shops.&lt;ref name="wickedvegas" /&gt;

'''Pasargadae''' (from {{lang-grc|Πασαργάδαι}}, from [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] ''Pāθra-gadā'', "protective club" or "strong club";&lt;ref&gt;"BATRAKATAŠ," ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', online edition, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/batrakatas-place-name-which-appears-on-the-elamite-fortification-tablets-found-at-persepolis-apparently-the-same-as-pasarga&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Stronach and Hilary Gopnik, "PASARGADAE," Encyclopædia Iranica, online edition, 2009, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pasargadae&lt;/ref&gt; [[Persian language|Modern Persian]]: {{lang|fa|پاسارگاد}} ''Pāsārgād'') was the capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] under [[Cyrus the Great]] who had issued its construction (559–530 BC); it was also the location of [[Tomb of Cyrus|his tomb]]. It was a city in ancient [[Fars province|Persia]], located near the city of [[Shiraz]] (in [[Pasargad County]]), and is today an [[archaeological site]] and one of [[Iran]]'s [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=107603 | title = Ancient Pasargadae threatened by construction of dam | publisher = Mehr News Agency | date = 28 August 2004 | accessdate = Sep 15, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311201606/http://www.mehrnews.com/en/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsID=107603 | archivedate = 11 March 2007 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Cyrus the Great]] began building the capital in 546 BC &lt;!---rest of article uses BC/AD---&gt;or later; it was unfinished when he died in battle, in 530 or 529 BC.  The remains of the tomb of Cyrus' son and successor [[Cambyses II]] have been found in Pasargadae, near the fortress of Toll-e Takht, and identified in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6865 | title = Discovered Stone Slab Proved to be Gate of Cambyses' Tomb | publisher = CHN | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091129074711/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6865 | archivedate = 2009-11-29 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasargadae remained the capital of the Achaemenid empire until [[Cambyses II]] moved it to [[Susa]]; later, [[Darius the Great|Darius]] founded another in [[Persepolis]]. The archaeological site covers 1.6 square kilometres and includes a structure commonly believed to be the [[mausoleum]] of Cyrus, the fortress of Toll-e Takht sitting on top of a nearby hill, and the remains of two royal palaces and gardens. Pasargadae Persian Gardens provide the earliest known example of the Persian ''[[Charbagh|chahar bagh]]'', or fourfold garden design (see [[Persian Gardens]]).

The Gate R, located at the eastern edge of the palace area, is the oldest known freestanding [[propylaeum]]. It may have been the architectural predecessor of the [[Gate of All Nations]] at [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/pasargadae|title=PASARGADAE – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tomb of Cyrus the Great===
{{main|Tomb of Cyrus}}
[[Image:I am Cyrus, Achaemenid King - Pasargadae.JPG|thumb|"I am [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] the king, an [[Achaemenid]]." in [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] languages. It is carved in a column in Pasargadae]]

The most important monument in Pasargadae is the tomb of Cyrus the Great. It has six broad steps leading to the sepulchre, the chamber of which measures 3.17&amp;nbsp;m long by 2.11&amp;nbsp;m wide by 2.11&amp;nbsp;m high and has a low and narrow entrance.  Though there is no firm evidence identifying the tomb as that of Cyrus, Greek historians tell that [[Alexander]] believed it was.  When Alexander looted and destroyed Persepolis, he paid a visit to the tomb of Cyrus. [[Arrian]], writing in the second century AD, recorded that Alexander commanded Aristobulus, one of his warriors, to enter the monument.  Inside he found a golden bed, a table set with drinking vessels, a gold coffin, some ornaments studded with precious stones and an inscription on the tomb. No trace of any such inscription survives, and there is considerable disagreement to the exact wording of the text. [[Strabo]] reports that it read:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Passer-by, I am Cyrus, who gave the Persians an empire, and was king of Asia.
Grudge me not therefore this monument.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Another variation, as documented in ''Persia: The Immortal Kingdom'', is:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
O man, whoever thou art, from wheresoever thou cometh, for I know you shall come, I am Cyrus, who founded the empire of the Persians.
Grudge me not, therefore, this little earth that covers my body.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The design of Cyrus' tomb is credited to Mesopotamian or Elamite [[ziggurat]]s, but the [[cella]] is usually attributed to [[Urartu]] tombs of an earlier period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18264 | first = C Michael | last = Hogan | title = Tomb of Cyrus | work = The Megalithic Portal | publisher = Andy Burnham |location = Surrey, UK| date = Jan 19, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the tomb at Pasargadae has almost exactly the same dimensions as the tomb of [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]], father of the Lydian King [[Croesus]]; however, some have refused the claim (according to [[Herodotus]], Croesus was spared by Cyrus during the conquest of Lydia, and became a member of Cyrus' court).  The main decoration on the tomb is a [[Rosette (design)|rosette]] design over the door within the gable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ronald W | last = Ferrier | title = The Arts of Persia | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-300-03987-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the art and architecture found at Pasargadae exemplified the Persian synthesis of various traditions, drawing on precedents from [[Elam]], [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]], and [[ancient Egypt]], with the addition of some Anatolian influences.

==Archaeology==
[[Image:Pasargadae Swallow-Tail Staples.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dovetail]] [[Staple (fastener)|Staple]]s from Pasargadae]]

The first capital of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], Pasargadae lies in ruins 40'40&amp;nbsp;kilometers from [[Persepolis]], in present-day [[Fars province]] of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.livius.org/pan-paz/pasargadae/pasargadae.html | first = Jona | last = Lendering | title = Pasargadae | publisher = Livius}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasargadae was first archaeologically explored by the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] in 1905, and in one excavation season in 1928, together with his assistant {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Krefter|de}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = E | last = Herzfeld | language = German | title = Bericht über die Ausgrabungen von Pasargadae 1928 | publisher = Archäologische Mitteilungen aus Iran | volume = 1 | pages = 4–16 | year = 1929}},&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1946, the original documents, notebooks, photographs, fragments of wall paintings and pottery from the early excavations are preserved in the [[Freer Gallery of Art]], Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, DC.  After Herzfeld, [[Sir Aurel Stein]] completed a site plan for Pasargadae in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = A | last = Stein | title = An Archaeological Tour in Ancient Persis, Iraq | volume = 3 | pages = 217–20 | year = 1936}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1935, Erich F. Schmidt produced a series of aerial photographs of the entire complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | format = PDF | url = https://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/flights_over_iran.pdf | first = Erich F | last = Schmidt | title = Flights Over Ancient Cities of Iran | publisher = [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], University of Chicago Press | year = 1940 | isbn = 0-918986-96-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1949 to 1955, an Iranian team led by Ali Sami worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ali-Sami | title = Pasargadae. The Oldest Imperial. Capital of Iran | others = Rev. RN Sharp transl | volume = 4 | place = Shiraz | origyear = March 1956 | publisher = Learned Society of Pars; Musavi Print. Office | edition = 2nd | year = 1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A British Institute of Persian Studies team led by [[David Stronach]] resumed excavation from 1961 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Stronach | title = Excavations at Pasargadae, Iran | chapter = First Preliminary Report | volume = 1 | pages = 19–42 | year = 1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Stronach | author-mask = 8 | title = Excavations at Pasargadae, Iran | chapter = Second Preliminary Report | volume = 2 | pages = 21–39 | year = 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Stronach | author-mask = 8 | title = Excavations at Pasargadae, Iran | chapter = Third Preliminary Report | volume = 3 | pages = 9–40 | year = 1965}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the 1960s that a pot-hoard known as the [[Pasargadae Treasure]] was excavated near the foundations of 'Pavilion B' at the site. Dating to the 5th-4th centuries BC, the treasure consists of ornate [[Achaemenid art|Achaemenid]] jewellery made from gold and precious gems and is now housed in the [[National Museum of Iran]]  and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Pasargadae+Pavilion+B+Hoard|title=Collection search: You searched for Pasargadae Pavilion B Hoard|author=|date=|website=British Museum|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the treasure was buried as a subsequent action once [[Alexander the Great]] approached with his army, then remained buried, hinting at violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/articles/place/pasargadae/pasargadae-photos/pasargadae-paradise|title=Pasargadae, Paradise|work=Livius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gap, work was resumed by the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization and the [[Maison de l'Orient et de la Méditerranée]] of the [[University of Lyon]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Rémy | last = Boucharlat | title = Pasargadae, Iran | volume = 40 | pages = 279–82 | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scj.sbu.ac.ir/index.php/IJIHS/article/download/24077/7306]Sébastien Gondet et al, Field Report on the 2015 Current Archaeological Works of the Joint Iran-French Project on Pasargadae and its Territory, International Journal of Iranian Heritage Studies, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 60-87, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  The complex is one of the key cultural heritage sites for tourism in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Richard|last2=O'Gorman|first2=Kevin D.|last3=Prentice|first3=Richard|date=2012-07-01|title=Destination Appraisal for European Cultural Tourism to Iran|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.862/abstract|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=323–338|doi=10.1002/jtr.862|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sivand Dam controversy==
There has been growing concern regarding the proposed [[Sivand Dam]], named after the nearby town of [[Sivand]].  Despite planning that has stretched over 10 years, Iran's own [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran|Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization]] was not aware of the broader areas of flooding during much of this time.

Its placement between both the ruins of Pasargadae and Persepolis has many archaeologists and Iranians worried that the dam will flood these UNESCO World Heritage sites, although scientists involved with the construction say this is not obvious because the sites sit above the planned waterline.  Of the two sites, Pasargadae is the one considered to be more threatened. Experts agree that the planning of future dam projects in Iran will merit an earlier examination of the risks to cultural resource properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chnpress.com/news/?Section=2&amp;id=6206 | title = Sivand Dam Waits for Excavations to be Finished | publisher = Cultural Heritage News Agency | date = 26 February 2006 | accessdate = Sep 15, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311124253/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?Section=2&amp;id=6206 | archivedate = 11 March 2007 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of broadly shared concern to archaeologists is the effect of the increase in humidity caused by the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6409 | title = Date of Sivand Dam Inundation Not Yet Agreed Upon | publisher = [[Cultural Heritage News Agency]] | date = 29 May 2006 | accessdate = Sep 15, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312115535/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6409 | archivedate = 12 March 2007 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  All agree that the humidity created by it will speed up the destruction of Pasargadae, yet experts from the Ministry of Energy believe it could be partially compensated for by controlling the water level of the reservoir.

Construction of the dam began April 19, 2007, with the height of the waterline limited so as to mitigate damage to the ruins.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldculturalheritagevoices.org/lamentable-loss/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In 1930, the [[Brazil]]ian poet [[Manuel Bandeira]] published a poem called "Vou-me embora pra Pasárgada" ("I'm off to Pasargadae" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), in a book entitled ''Libertinagem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bandeira |first=Manuel|editor-first=André (organizer) |editor-last=Seffrin |title=Manuel Bandeira: poesia completa e prosa, volume único |language= Portuguese|trans-title=Manuel Bandeira: complete poetry and prose, unique volume |publisher= Editora Nova Aguilar [New Aguilar Press]|location=Rio de Janeiro [(City) "River of January"], RJ [(State) "River of January"], Brasil [Brazil] |year=2009|chapter=Libertinagem|trans-chapter=Salacity | pages= XXIII, 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It tells the story of a man who wants to go to Pasargadae, described in the poem as a [[utopia]]n city. 
The following is an extract, in the original then in a translation:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}

===''Vou‐me embora pra Pasárgada''===
&lt;poem&gt;
''Vou-me embora pra Pasárgada''
''Lá sou amigo do rei''
''Lá tenho a mulher que eu quero''
''Na cama que escolherei''

[…]

''E quando eu estiver mais triste''
''Mas triste de não ter jeito''
''Quando de noite me der''
''Vontade de me matar''
''— Lá sou amigo do rei —''
''Terei a mulher que eu quero''
''Na cama que escolherei''
''Vou-me embora pra Pasárgada.''&lt;/poem&gt;
{{col-2}}

===I'm off to Pasargadae===
&lt;poem&gt;I'm off to Pasargadae
There I am friends with the king
There I shall have the woman I want
In the bed of my choice

[…]

And when I'm sadder
So sad there's nothing left
When at night I feel
A desire to kill myself
— There I am friends with the king —
I will have the woman I want
On the bed of my choice
I'm off to Pasargadae.&lt;/poem&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6807">[[Image:Clifton Pilkingtons Factory Fletchers Canal.jpg|thumb|right|In this early 20th century image, Pilkington's factory and kilns can be seen on the right of the image, with Fletcher's Canal in the foreground.]]
'''Pilkington's Lancastrian Pottery &amp; Tiles''' was a manufacturer of tiles, vases and bowls, based in [[Clifton, Greater Manchester]], [[England]]. The company was established in 1892 at [[Clifton Junction]], alongside [[Fletcher's Canal]].  The company employed talented designers, the most famous of whom was [[Charles Voysey (architect)|Charles Voysey]].
Production of art pottery was stopped at the end of the 1930s, although tile production continued.
Today the site is occupied by [[Pilkington's Group Plc]].

==History==
In 1889 the [[Clifton and Kersley Coal Company]] sank a pair of pit shafts with the intention of working the coal seams lying adjacent to the geological feature known as the [[Pendleton Fault]]. However, the work became increasingly difficult due to the excessive quantity of water that was encountered. When it became clear that the work would not produce coal, the four Pilkington brothers decided to use the [[marl]] that had been encountered to make glazed bricks,&lt;ref name=Hyde93 /&gt; however, the marl was found to be unsuitable for this purpose.

By chance, the secretary of the coal company knew William Burton, a chemist working for [[Josiah Wedgwood and Sons]]. Burton tested the marl and suggested that a more commercial venture would be to make tiles. Decorative tiles were at that time becoming quite fashionable and they were in high demand. The site of the proposed factory had many advantages&amp;mdash;it was close to [[Clifton Junction railway station]], it was adjacent to [[Fletcher's Canal]] and there was abundant coal nearby in the local [[Wet Earth Colliery]], a short distance away along the same canal.
 
By 1903 the factory had developed an opalescent [[ceramic glaze]] called Lancastrian, named after the county of [[Lancashire]] where the factory was sited. It became popular in Pilkington's Lancastrian line of pottery. A later glaze took its name from [[Manchester]], the Cunian glaze.&lt;ref name=Hyde93&gt;{{Harvnb|Hyde|O'Rourke|Portland|2004|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous glazes were used, e.g. sunstone, eggshell, fiery crystalline, aventurine, merged and curdled glazes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lomax|1957|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glazes of different textures were also produced. These "fruit skin" glazes had surfaces like orange peel or apricot.

The pottery's work was exhibited at the [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition of 1908]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Pilkington Lancashire Pottery Pavilion at the Franco-British Exhibition | work=Our Manchester | url=http://manchesterhistory.net/edgarwood/SHOPS/exhibition.html |accessdate=2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Burton (1863–1941)===

William Burton was a chemist with the Wedgwood Company at the Etruria Works in Stoke-on-Trent, with an extensive knowledge of the ceramics industry. It was he who suggested that the red clay and marl found at Clifton was suitable for production of ceramic tiles. Decorative tiling was becoming a popular trend at the time, and represented a long term commercial proposition. Burton oversaw the production of fine pottery in the style of ancient [[Persia]]n and [[China|Chinese]] potters, employing fine artists and commissioning work from some of the top designers of the time. Burton was a friend of H. G. Wells and was inspired by the [[Arts &amp; Crafts Movement]], and in particular, the workings of [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. He chose artists and designers that shared this inspiration, and Lancastrian Pottery works became high quality examples of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement.

===John Chambers (1869–1945)===

Burton invited John Chambers to join him in the running of the Pilkington's Tile &amp; Pottery Company. Chambers was often responsible for designs produced in what became known as the 'Persian style', and was head of the architectural pottery department throughout his time with the company.

===Royal Lancastrian Glazes===

High [[Lustreware|lustre glaze]] finishes were produced from 1906, and are particularly associated with the designer [[Gordon Forsyth]], who joined the company in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/name/forsyth-gordon-mitchell/35558/ ''Examples of Gordon Forsyth's works at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum'']&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Lancastrian' was used for the new ware due to the location in the county of Lancashire. Later on, 'Cunian' glazes were named after the site's close proximity to Manchester. Glazes of different textures were used. Some of the more famous glazes used by the Royal Lancastrian Pottery Company included sunstone, eggshell, crystalline and aventurine. One of the most notable, Lancastrian Lustre, was exhibited at the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908.

In 1913 [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] visited [[Lord Derby]], in whose home several Lancastrian vases were proudly displayed. It was then that permission was granted for the [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|royal warrant]] to be used and the firm became '''Pilkington's Royal Lancastrian Pottery Company'''.

'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a 1635–1636 painting by [[Francesco Furini]], which has been in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] since 1987.

It was inspired by the work of [[Caravaggio]] and was commissioned by the painter's patron marquess Vitelli. The facial features show it was based on the same model as the artist's ''Apollo the Archer'' ([[Columbia University]]) and for various female allegorical figures.

The '''Salle Le Peletier''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Salle de la rue Le Peletier''' or the '''Opéra Le Peletier''')&lt;ref&gt;Le Peletier has also been spelled Lepelletier. See Mead 1991, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; was the home of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1821 until the building was destroyed by fire in 1873. The theatre was designed and constructed by the architect [[François Debret]] on the site of the garden of the Hôtel de Choiseul on the rue Lepeletier.&lt;ref&gt;Mead 1991, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the many changes in government and management during the theatre's existence, it had a number of different official names, the most important of which were: Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique (1821&amp;ndash;1848), Opéra-Théâtre de la Nation (1848&amp;ndash;1850), Théâtre de l'Académie Nationale de Musique (1850&amp;ndash;1852), Théâtre de l'Académie Impériale de Musique (1852&amp;ndash;1854), Théâtre Impérial de l'Opéra (1854&amp;ndash;1870), and Théâtre National de l'Opéra (1870&amp;ndash;1873).&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Alicia. "A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830&amp;ndash;1900" in Fauser 2009, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Inauguration of the Salle Le Peletier with Les Bayadères 1821 – Gallica btv1b84367769 (adjusted).jpg|thumb|upright=1.37|Performance of Charles-Simon Catel's opera ''[[Les bayadères]]'' for  the inauguration of the Paris Opera's Salle Le Peletier on 16 August 1821]]

When [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII's]] nephew, [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry]], was fatally stabbed on the night of 13 February 1820 in front of the former theatre of the Paris Opera, the [[Théâtre National de la rue de la Loi|Salle de la rue de Richelieu]], the king decided that the theatre would be demolished in order to build a commemorative chapel in its place. However, the project to build a chapel was never carried out due to the [[July Revolution|1830 revolution]]. Today the [[Fontaine Louvois]] in the Square Louvois occupies the spot where the chapel would have been built.&lt;ref&gt;Barbier 1995, pp. 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Salle de la rue de Richelieu had been the principal venue of the Paris Opera since 1794. Very soon after the death of his nephew in February 1820, the king commissioned the architect François Debret to design a new theatre for the Opéra on the [[Rue Le Peletier]], which was completed one year later. During the construction the opera and ballet companies occupied the Théâtre Favart and the Salle Louvois.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1983,  '''1''': 38, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salle Le Peletier was inaugurated on 16 August 1821 with a mixed-bill that opened with the anthem "Vive Henry VIII", and included the composer [[Charles Simon Catel|Catel's]] opera ''[[Les bayadères]]'' and the [[Ballet Master]] [[Maximilien Gardel|Gardel's]] ballet ''Le Retour de Zéphire''.&lt;ref&gt;Pitou 1990, pp. 758–760.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the theatre was meant to be temporary and was built of wood and plaster, it continued to be used by the Opéra for more than fifty years. Many of the great [[Grand Opera|grand operas]] of the 19th century were presented for the first time on its stage, among them: Rossini's ''[[Guillaume Tell]]'' (1829), Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]'' (1831), Halévy's ''[[La Juive]]'' (1835), and Verdi's ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (1867).&lt;ref&gt;Simeone 2000, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre, which was 14,000 square metres in area with a 104&amp;nbsp;ft. stage, was quite advanced for its time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} On 6 February 1822 gas was used for the first time in order to light the stage effects in [[Nicolas Isouard]]'s opera ''Aladin ou La Lampe merveilleuse''.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone 2000, pp. 191&amp;ndash;192.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage and orchestra pit were able to be removed in order to transform the auditorium into a massive hall which could accommodate large balls and other festivities.

===Ballet===
Along with the [[Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre]] in [[London]], the Salle Le Peletier played host to the heyday of the [[romantic ballet]], with such [[Balletmaster]]s as [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-Léon]], [[Filippo Taglioni]], [[Joseph Mazilier]], [[Jean Coralli]], and [[Paul Taglioni]] staging many masterworks for the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. Among these works: ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1832), ''[[Giselle]]'' (1841), ''[[Paquita]]'' (1846), ''[[Le corsaire]]'' (1856), ''[[Le Papillon (ballet)|Le papillon]]'' (1860), ''[[La source (Saint-Léon)|La source]]'' (1866), and ''[[Coppélia]]'' (1870). Among the great [[ballerina]]s to grace the stage of the Opéra during this time were [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Carolina Rosati]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Lucile Grahn]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Chess===
In 1858 the Salle Le Peletier was the setting for one of the most famous games in the history of [[Chess]], the [[Morphy versus the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard|Opera Game]] between the American master [[Paul Morphy]] (White) and two French aristocrats, the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard. The game was played in the Duke's private box during a performance of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini's]] ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Exploits and Triumphs, in Europe, of Paul Morphy, the Chess Champion'', Frederick Edge, D. Appleton and Company, New York (1859) pp. 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire===
On the night of 29 October 1873, the Salle Le Peletier met the same fate as many of its predecessors: it was destroyed by a fire which raged for 27 hours, believed to have been started by the theatre's innovative gas lighting. Fortunately, in 1858 [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]] had hired the civic planner [[Baron Haussmann]] to begin construction on a second theatre for the Parisian Opera and Ballet based on the design of architect [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]. In 1875, the new theatre, today known as the [[Palais Garnier]], was inaugurated.

'''''Scepticism and Animal Faith''''' (1923) is a later work by Spanish-born [[American philosophy|American philosopher]] [[George Santayana]]. He intended it to be "merely the introduction to a new system of philosophy," a work that would later be called ''[[The Realms of Being]]'', which constitutes the bulk of his philosophy, along with ''[[The Life of Reason]]''.

''Scepticism'' is Santayana's major treatise on [[epistemology]]; after its publication, he wrote no more on the topic. His preface begins humbly, with Santayana saying:
{{cquote|Here is one more system of philosophy. If the reader is tempted to smile, I can assure him that I smile with him...I am merely trying to express for the reader the principles to which he appeals when he smiles.}}

Moreover, he does not claim philosophical supremacy: {{cquote|I do not ask anyone to think in my terms if he prefers others. Let him clean better, if he can, the windows of his soul, that the variety and beauty of the prospect may spread more brightly before him.}}

While Santayana acknowledges the importance of [[skepticism]] to philosophy, and begins by doubting almost everything; from here, he seeks to find some kind of epistemological truths. [[Idealism]] is correct, claims Santayana, but is of no consequence. He makes this [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] claim by asserting that men do not live by the principles of idealism, even if it is true. We have functioned for eons without adhering to such principles, and may continue, pragmatically, as such. He posits the necessity of the eponymous "Animal Faith", which is belief in that which our senses tell us; "Philosophy begins ''in medias res''", he assures us at the beginning of his treatise.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]].

The '''Staffordshire helmet''' is an [[Anglo-Saxon]] helmet discovered in 2009 as part of the [[Staffordshire Hoard]]. It is part of the largest discovery of contemporary gold and silver metalwork in Britain, which contained more than 4,000 precious fragments, approximately a third of which came from a single high-status helmet.&lt;ref name="Revealed"&gt;{{cite web |title=Staffordshire Hoard Helmets Revealed for Public Display |url=https://www.staffordshirehoard.org.uk/staffordshire-hoard-helmets-revealed-for-public-display |website=Staffordshirehoard.org.uk |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following those found at [[Benty Grange helmet|Benty Grange]], [[Sutton Hoo helmet|Sutton Hoo]], [[Coppergate Helmet|Coppergate]], [[Pioneer Helmet|Wollaston]], and [[Shorwell helmet|Shorwell]], it is only the sixth known Anglo-Saxon helmet.

The helmet, along with the entire hoard, was purchased jointly by the [[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] and the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery]], and is currently undergoing conservation work. In 2012 a second find of metalwork, including the second cheek guard, was made at the original site.

The helmet is believed to have been made around AD 600-650.&lt;ref name="Revealed"/&gt; Two replicas of the crested helmet have been made for display in the museums in Birmingham and Stoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Addley |first1=Esther |title=Ornate gold helmet from Staffordshire hoard recreated |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/nov/23/ornate-gold-helmet-from-staffordshire-hoard-recreated |accessdate=23 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thangka''', variously spelt as '''thangka''', '''tangka''', '''thanka''', or '''tanka''' ({{IPA-ne|ˈथान्का|Nepali pronunciation:}}; {{bo|t=ཐང་ཀ་}}; [[Nepal Bhasa]]: पौभा), is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] painting on [[cotton]], [[silk]] [[appliqué]], usually depicting a [[Buddhist]] deity, scene, or [[mandala]]. Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures.  A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition.  Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.

Thangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and [[bodhisattva]]s. One subject is The [[Wheel of Life]] (''Bhavachakra''), which is a visual representation of the [[Abhidharma]] teachings (Art of Enlightenment).  The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including [[relief]]s in metal and [[woodblock prints]].  Today printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes. Many tangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated.

Thangka perform several different functions. Images of deities can be used as teaching tools when depicting the life (or lives) of the Buddha, describing historical events concerning important Lamas, or retelling myths associated with other deities. Devotional images act as the centerpiece during a ritual or ceremony and are often used as mediums through which one can offer prayers or make requests. Overall, and perhaps most importantly, religious art is used as a meditation tool to help bring one further down the path to enlightenment. The Buddhist [[Vajrayana]] practitioner uses a thanga image of their [[yidam]], or meditation deity, as a guide, by visualizing "themselves as being that deity, thereby internalizing the Buddha qualities"&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, Ragnubs&lt;/ref&gt;  tangkas hang on or beside altars, and may be hung in the bedrooms or offices of monks and other devotees.

==History==
Tibetan Buddhist painting developed from widespread traditions of early Buddhist paintings which now only survive in a few sites such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India and the [[Mogao Caves]] on the [[Silk Road]], which has very extensive wall-paintings and was the repository for what are now the earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth.  The thanka form developed alongside the tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings]], which are or were mostly in monasteries.

The early history of the form is more easily traced through these murals, which survive in greater numbers than the portable paintings which certainly once existed.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Most thanka were commissioned by individuals, who were believed to acquire merit by doing so.  They might then be given to a monastery or another individual, or retained for use by the commissioner.  Some thangka have inscriptions on their back recording that they were the personal meditation image (''thugs dam'') of a notable monk.&lt;ref&gt;For example Kossak and Singer, #20&lt;/ref&gt;  Most artists were probably monks, although lay artists seem to have existed, as they did for metalwork sculpture.  The commissioner would provide the materials, which were often valuable, and by tradition the compensation to the artist was regarded as a "gift" rather than a fee.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "thangka" means "thing that one unrolls" in [[Classical Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;Béguin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 386&lt;/ref&gt;  Thangka are very rarely signed, but some artists are known, more because they were important monastic leaders than famous as artists. Painting was a valued accomplishment in a monk.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest survivals of Tibetan paintings on cloth are in some pieces from the Mogao Caves at [[Dunhuang]] on the Silk Road, in [[Gansu]] province, China. The "Library Cave" there was a repository of old or worn out manuscripts, paintings, prints, textiles and other items which was sealed off in the 11th century, after several centuries of deposits. Many of the paintings have Tibetan inscriptions or are in a style that can be recognized as Tibetan, as opposed to the dominant Chinese style and some pieces reflecting Indian styles.&lt;ref&gt;Béguin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 385; Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41–42, 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Though they are hard to date, it is thought that these pieces mainly come from a period c. 781–848 when the area was ruled by Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 122; Kossak and Singer, 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving tangkas on cloth certainly from Tibet itself start in the 11th century, after the revival of Buddhism; there are some 20 surviving from this and the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Such early examples typically have compositions that are already complex, but less so than in later examples. As later the typical compositions shows a central figure flanked by smaller other figures, often in framed compartments, or surrounded by flaming halos or seated on small clouds. Behind these figures a landscape background including much sky is often indicated, though little of it may be visible.  The central figure may be a deity, and [[arhat]], or an important monk, and the same groups make up the background figures. Several of the figures may be different "aspects" or reincarnations of each other according to Buddhist theology. In the example at left the flanking [[bodhisattva]]s are in a style, one of several found in such figures in this period, that appears derived from central Indian art.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries Tibetan painting, both on walls and thangka, continued to develop in its distinctive style, balancing between the two major influences of Indo-Nepalese and [[Chinese painting]], despite Buddhism being in general decline in both those regions.  Styles could vary considerably between the different regions of Tibet as well as the wider region where tangkas were painted.  Within Tibet the regions nearer Nepal and China were often more influenced by those styles. [[Bhutanese art|Bhutanese tangkas]] were mainly influenced by Central Tibet. The different [[Tibetan Buddhism#Schools|monastic orders]] also developed somewhat different stylistic characters.

Tibetan painting incorporated many elements from Chinese painting, especially from the 14th century onwards, reaching a peak in the 18th century.  One aspect of this was allowing more space and emphasis to the landscape background.  In general the style of figures in thangka remains derived from the Indo-Nepalese tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 52-65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;McKay, Alex. ''The History of Tibet''. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. {{ISBN|0-7007-1508-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Giuseppe Tucci]], by the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]], "a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity."&lt;ref name=McKay/&gt;  Throughout the period the Chinese Imperial court retained diplomatic and other contacts with Tibet for political reasons, but when the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] came to power court interest in Tibetan Buddhism increased, and many Chinese works in a very refined and elegant style, though eventually becoming rather stiff, were produced by Imperial artists and often sent to Tibet as gifts, influencing local styles.  As well as the court style, there was influence from the regions of China near to Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman,64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangkas were painted in all the areas where Tibetan Buddhism flourished, which apart from those mentioned already included [[Mongolia]], [[Ladakh]], [[Sikkim]], and parts of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] India in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Dharamshala]], and [[Lahaul and Spiti district]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. It is also practiced in parts of [[Russia]] ([[Kalmykia]], [[Buryatia]], and [[Tuva]]) and [[Northeast China]].

Other traditions of Buddhist scroll paintings are not usually covered by the term thangka, although they may have many similarities, and descend from the same origins.  An example is [[Japanese painting]], where a number of very early examples survive from the [[Nara period|Nara]] (710-794) and [[Heian period]]s (794 to 1185).  Most of these are [[List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings)|National Treasures of Japan]]. ''[[Raigō|Raigō-zu]]'' developed as one popular genre, showing the [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas welcoming the souls of the faithful to his [[Western Paradise]].  These were, and still are, carried into the house of a person who was near death.

==Types==
Based on technique and material, tangkas can be grouped by types. Generally, they are divided into two broad categories: those that are painted (Tib.) bris-tan&amp;mdash;and those made of silk, either by appliqué or embroidery.

Tangkas are further divided into these more specific categories:

* Painted in colours (Tib.) tson-tang—the most common type
* [[Appliqué]] (Tib.) go-tang
* Black Background—meaning gold line on a black background (Tib.) nagtang
* Blockprints—paper or cloth outlined renderings, by [[woodcut]]/[[woodblock printing]]
* Embroidery (Tib.) tsem-thang
* Gold Background—an auspicious treatment, used judiciously for peaceful, long-life deities and fully enlightened buddhas
* Red Background—literally gold line, but referring to gold line on a vermillion (Tib.) mar-tang

Whereas typical tangkas are fairly small, with painted area between about 20 to 50&amp;nbsp;centimetres high, there are also giant festival tangkas, usually appliqué, and designed to be unrolled against a wall in a monastery for particular religious occasions.  These are likely to be wider than they are tall, and may be sixty or more feet across and perhaps twenty or more high. In Bhutan at least these are called [[thongdrel]]s.  There are also larger than average thankas that were designed for altars or display in temples.

Somewhat related are [[Tibetan tsakli]], cards which look like miniature tangkas perhaps up to 15&amp;nbsp;centimetres high, and often square, usually containing a single figure.  These were mostly produced in sets and were usually used in earlier stages of training monks, or as initiation cards or offerings, or to use when constructing temporary mandalas.  Another related form is the painted wooden top cover for a manuscript book, giving a long narrow strip, typically some 6&amp;nbsp;cm by 55&amp;nbsp;cm, often painted with a row of seated figures in compartments. The techniques for both these forms are essentially the same as for thangka, and presumably the same artists worked on them. Because tangkas can be quite expensive, people nowadays use posters of tangkas as an alternative to the real tangkas for religious purposes.

Sources on Asian art often describe all-textile tangkas as "tapestry", but tangkas that meet the normal definition of tapestry with the image created only by [[weaving]] a single piece of fabric with different colours of thread are extremely rare, though a few tapestry examples in the Chinese ''[[K'o-ssu|kesi]]'' technique are known, mostly from the medieval period. There is a large example in the [[Hermitage Museum]], although in this and other pieces the different colours are woven separately and then sewn together in a type of [[patchwork]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhie and Thurman, 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;  Most thangka described as tapestry are some combination of [[embroidery]], [[appliqué]] and other techniques.

==Process==

Tangkas are painted on [[cotton duck|cotton]] or silk. The most common is a loosely woven cotton produced in widths from 40 to 58&amp;nbsp;cm (16 - 23&amp;nbsp;inches). While some variations do exist, tangkas wider than 45&amp;nbsp;cm (17 or 18&amp;nbsp;inches) frequently have seams in the support. The paint consists of [[pigment]]s in a water-soluble [[Media (arts)|medium]] of animal [[glue]]. Both mineral and organic pigments are used. In Western terminology, this is a [[distemper (paint)|distemper]] technique; although it is often described as a form of [[gouache]], this is incorrect, and the paint was applied as a warm liquid, mixed shortly before application.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 196-199&lt;/ref&gt;

Most old thangka have inscriptions on the back, usually the [[mantra]] of the deity depicted, but sometimes also information as to later owners, though rarely information about the original commissioner or artist. Sometimes x-rays allow pious inscriptions placed under the paint on the front of the image to be seen. Inscriptions may be made in the shape of a [[stupa]], or sometimes other shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Kossak and Singer, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of a thangka, as with the majority of [[Buddhist art]], is highly geometric. Arms, legs, eyes, nostrils, ears, and various ritual implements are all laid out on a systematic grid of angles and intersecting lines. A skilled thangka artist will generally select from a variety of predesigned items to include in the composition, ranging from alms bowls and animals, to the shape, size, and angle of a figure's eyes, nose, and lips. The process seems very methodical, but often requires deep understanding of the symbolism involved to capture the spirit of it.

Thangka often overflow with symbolism and allusion. Because the art is explicitly religious, all symbols and allusions must be in accordance with strict guidelines laid out in Buddhist scripture. The artist must be properly trained and have sufficient religious understanding, knowledge, and background to create an accurate and appropriate thangka:

"[[Tibetan art]] exemplifies the [[nirmanakaya]], the physical body of Buddha, and also the qualities of the Buddha, perhaps in the form of a deity. Art objects, therefore, must follow rules specified in the Buddhist scriptures regarding proportions, shape, color, stance, hand positions, and attributes in order to personify correctly the Buddha or Deities."&lt;ref&gt;Lipton and Ragnubs, ''Treasures of Tibetan Art''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepal==
The earliest surviving thangka paintings from Nepal date to about the 14th century AD, but this is probably well after Buddhists and Hindus began to make illustrations of the deities and natural scenes. Historically, Tibetan and Chinese influence in Nepalese paintings is quite evident in [[Paubha]]s (Tangkas), and Nepalese styles have been a significant influence on Tibetan art. Paubhas are of two types, the Palas which are illustrative paintings of the deities and the Mandala, which are mystic diagrams paintings of complex test prescribed patterns of circles and square each having specific significance.  It was through Nepal that [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was introduced into Tibet during reign of Angshuvarma in the seventh century AD. There was therefore a great demand for religious icons and Buddhist manuscripts for newly built monasteries throughout Tibet. A number of Buddhist manuscripts, including Prajnaparamita, were copied in [[Kathmandu Valley]] for these monasteries. Astasahas rika Prajnaparamita for example, was copied in Patan in the year 999 AD., during the reign of Narendra Dev and Udaya Deva, for the Sa-Shakya monastery in Tibet. For the Nor monastery in Tibet, two copies were made in Nepal, one of Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita in 1069 AD and the other of Kavyadarsha in 1111 AD. The influence of Nepalese art extended to China in regular order in the thirteenth century. Nepalese artisans were dispatched to the courts of Chinese emperors at their request to perform their workmanship and impart expert knowledge, with the Nepalese innovator and architect Balbahu, known by his popular name [[Araniko]] becoming the chief Imperial artist of [[Kubilai Khan]].

After the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular, however, it continued to be used until the eighteenth century. Paper manuscripts imitated the oblong shape but were wider than the palm leaves.  From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colours gradually began to appear in Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing importance of the [[Tantra|tantric]] cult, various aspects of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] were painted in conventional poses. [[Mahakala]], [[Manjushri]], [[Lokeshwara]] and other deities were equally popular and so were also frequently represented in thangka paintings of later dates. As Tantrism embodies the ideas of esoteric power, magic forces, and a great variety of symbols, strong emphasis is laid on the female element and sexuality in the paintings of that period.

Religious paintings worshipped as icons are known as Paubha in Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of Paubha or thangka paintings may be attributed to the Nepalese artists responsible for creating a number of special metal works and wall- paintings as well as illuminated manuscripts in Tibet. Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese Thangka painting dates from the thirteenth /fourteenth century and shows [[Amitabha]] surrounded by bodhisattva. Another Nepalese thangka with three dates in the inscription (the last one corresponding to 1369 A.D.), is one of the earliest known thangka with inscriptions. The "Mandala of Vishnu " dated 1420 A.D., is another fine example of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese Tangkas are simple in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies the central position while surrounded by smaller figures of lesser divinities.

During the reign of Tibetan Dharma King Trisong Duetsen the Tibetan masters refined their already well-developed arts through research and studies of different country's tradition. Thanka painting's lining and measurement, costumes, implementations and ornaments are mostly based on Indian styles. The drawing of figures is based on Nepalese style and the background sceneries are based on Chinese style. Thus, the thangka paintings became a unique and distinctive art. Although the practice of thanka painting was originally done as a way of gaining merit it has nowadays evolved into a commercial business and the noble intentions it once carried has been diluted. Tibetans do not sell Tangkas on a large scale as the selling of religious artifacts such as tangkas and idols is frowned upon in the Tibetan community and thus non Tibetan groups have been able to monopolize on its (thangka's) popularity among Buddhist and art enthusiasts from the west.

Thangka have developed in the northern Himalayan regions among the Lamas. Besides Lamas, [[Gurung]] and [[Tamang]] communities are also producing Tankas, which provide substantial employment opportunities for many people in the hills. Newari Thankas or paubha have been produced in Kathmandu valley from the 13th century.

'''''The Avenue in the Rain''''' is a 1917 oil painting by the American [[Impressionist]] painter [[Childe Hassam]]. It depicts [[Fifth Avenue]] in New York City in the rain, draped with [[US flag]]s. The painting is one of six works by Hassam in the permanent art collection of the [[White House]] in [[Washington DC]].

Between 1916 and 1919, Hassam completed around 30 paintings of streets decorated with flags. This work dates to February 1917, shortly before the US joined the [[First World War]], at a time when patriotic fervour was rising in the US. The previous month, Germany extended its [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] to neutral ships, including vessels bearing the US flag.  The [[Zimmermann Telegram]] became public knowledge at the end of February 1917, and the US [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] on 6 April 1917.

The painting measures {{convert|42|x|22.25|in|cm}} and is dominant by red and blue and whites tones, representing the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]. Several dark figures in the middle distance hold umbrellas, and while the far distance fades into the blue background. The flags seem to float in mid-air, flying from poles that project out from the buildings on the street, but the buildings are not visible. The flags and human figures are reflected on the wet street and sidewalk. Hassam may have been influenced by two similar works of [[Claude Monet]] depicting [[Bastille Day|national celebrations]] in Paris on 30 June 1878.

It was donated to the White House in 1963 by [[Thomas Mellon Evans]] and hung between the windows in [[John F. Kennedy]]'s blue-themed [[President's Bedroom]] (now a private sitting room, adjacent to the [[Yellow Oval Room]] on the second floor), and then in the [[President's Dining Room]] for many years.  It hung in the [[Oval Office]] during both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]]'s terms.

'''''The Butchers''''' (also known as '''''Death Factory''''' and '''''The Factory''''') is a 2014 [[horror film]] directed by Steven Judd and written by David Dittlinger and Stephen Durham.

== Plot ==

While on a bus with his brother, Brian, and a dozen others, Simon has a nightmare about when he fatally clubbed his abusive father, who had killed their mother. In a nearby [[ghost town]], the landowner meets JB, a lawyer who wants to buy the property, primarily for its museum dedicated to serial killers: [[Albert Fish]], [[John Wayne Gacy]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], [[Ed Gein]], and [[Zodiac Killer|the Zodiac]], "The Death Factory". When the landowner refuses to sell the museum along with the rest of his property, JB stabs him, then prepares an occult ritual with a [[Book of the Dead]], and blood samples taken from the displays in the Death Factory.

Elsewhere, the bus Simon is on breaks down, so he and the other passengers go in search of aid while the driver remains with the vehicle, which he disappears with after the group leaves. The passengers reach the ghost town, and while the others debate what to do, Star and Ren wander off, and uncover JB's belongings. For fun, the duo read from the Book of the Dead, unintentionally resurrecting Fish, Gacy, Dahmer, Gein, the Zodiac, and the Ripper, who is revealed to be  lesbian. 

While JB fights to flee from Fish, Star is killed by Gein, and Ren is slain by the Zodiac. Simon is then attacked by Fish, whose neck he breaks, causing Fish to disintegrate into a dust that enters Simon's body. The other murderers, who begin succumbing to infighting, continue to run amok. Gacy stabs Bill, the Ripper dismembers Nicole, JB guts Candi, and Gein stabs Dahmer, and then is bludgeoned by JB.

Simon stabs Gacy and the Ripper, and absorbs their "power" like he did Fish's, Gein did Dahmer's, and JB did Gein's. Simon, Brian, and the remaining passengers, are then confronted by JB, who impales Simon, though his friends resurrect him with the Book of the Dead, giving Simon the chance to snap JB's neck. Simon is then overpowered by the Zodiac, who the others set on fire, and hit with the landowner's car, which they and Simon drive off in.

The bus driver, who is implied to be [[Satan]], reappears, and revives JB, noting, "You think you can steal from me, and there won't be [[Hell]] to pay? Or should I say, repay? C'mon, son, you've got work to do."

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
Rob Getz of Horror News gave ''The Butchers'' a faintly positive review, writing, "No one will accuse ''Death Factory'' of greatness, but it would lose its charm if it were" and "Relying far more on curiosity factor than upon consistency or execution, it succeeds almost in spite of itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/93795/film-review-death-factory-2014/|title = ''Death Factory'' (2014)|last = Getz|first = Rob|publisher = Horror News|date = 16 January 2015|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Horror Scene's Dave Wain gave the film a 0/10, and condemned it as "an abhorrent sleazy little movie that will only serve to repel and disgust anyone that's unfortunate to come across it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ukhorrorscene.com/the-factory-aka-death-factory-2014-dvd-review/|title = ''The Factory'' aka ''Death Factory'' (2014) DVD Review|last = Wain|first = David|publisher = UK Horror Scene|date = 11 July 2014|website = ukhorrorscene.com|accessdate = 3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Exception''''' is a 2016 [[romantic drama film|romantic]] [[war film|war]] [[drama film|drama]] directed by [[David Leveaux]], in his [[directorial debut]], and written by Simon Burke, based on [[Alan Judd]]'s 2003 novel ''[[The Kaiser's Last Kiss]]''. The film stars [[Jai Courtney]], [[Lily James]], [[Janet McTeer]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/the-exception | title=The Exception | accessdate=25 August 2016 | work=The British Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot is a fictionalized account of the last few days in the life of exiled [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] (Plummer), when a German soldier (Courtney) tries to determine whether or not a British spy has infiltrated the Kaiser's home in the Netherlands during the onset of World War II. He falls for a young Jewish Dutch woman (James) during his investigation.

In 2014, Egoli Tossell Film announced that development on a film adaptation of Judd's novel had begun. [[Principal photography]] in Belgium lasted six weeks in 2015. The film held its world premiere at the [[2016 Toronto International Film Festival]] in the Special Presentations section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-2016-special-presentations-wavelengths-919851 | title=Toronto: Christian Bale-Starrer 'The Promise,' Richard Gere-Starrer 'Norman' Get Gala Screenings | accessdate=22 August 2016 | work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received a [[limited release]] and [[video-on-demand]] release on 2 June 2017 through [[A24 (company)|A24]] and [[DirecTV Cinema]] in the United States. The film was released on 2 October 2017 in the United Kingdom through Signature Entertainment.

==Plot==
During [[World War II]], Captain Stefan Brandt ([[Jai Courtney]]) is sent to head the personal bodyguard of exiled [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] ([[Christopher Plummer]]) at his [[Huis Doorn]] home in [[Utrecht, Netherlands]]. Following the [[Battle of the Netherlands|invasion of the Netherlands]], [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] authorities are concerned that Dutch spies may be watching Wilhelm. 

Upon arriving at the residence, Brandt is drawn into an unexpected and passionate romance with Mieke de Jong ([[Lily James]]), one of the maids. Mieke soon reveals to Brandt that she is secretly Jewish. 

[[Gestapo]] Inspector Dietrich ([[Mark Dexter]]) informs Brandt that the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Service]] has an agent in a nearby village. In addition to keeping an eye on the Kaiser, Brandt is ordered to determine and report the identity of the agent. It turns out to be Mieke, who reports to a pastor at the local church on events at the Kaiser's home. When [[Reichsführer-SS|SS Commander]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] ([[Eddie Marsan]]) decides to visit with a large SS platoon, Brandt is forced to choose between following the Nazi party agenda and protecting Mieke.

As his involvement with Mieke continues, Brandt notices a smell of gun oil from her room. He later sees Mieke leaving the residence grounds and follows her. Mieke again visits the pastor and, unaware that Brandt is watching outside a window, tells the pastor that she is prepared to assassinate Himmler as revenge for the SS' killing her father and husband. 

The SS then intercepts the pastor’s radio transmissions to Britain. They arrest and mercilessly beat the pastor. Shortly afterward, Wilhelm's wife [[Hermine Reuss of Greiz|Hermine]] ([[Janet McTeer]]) discovers the lovers' affair and notifies Wilhelm, expecting him to dismiss Mieke and discipline Brandt. Wilhelm, however, supports the relationship. In private, he reveals to the lovers that he fathered illegitimate children prior to meeting Hermine.

When the time comes to have the house searched before Himmler's arrival, Brandt himself searches Mieke's room to protect her ruse. 

After Himmler's arrival, Brandt learns that the pastor has revealed Mieke's identity as the British agent. He locates her and urges her to flee. She refuses, insisting that she has a duty. 

Meanwhile, Himmler extends to Wilhelm an invitation from [[Adolf Hitler]] to return to Berlin. He then meets with Brandt and Dietrich, informing them of the gesture and its intention as a trap to expose and eradicate supporters of the monarchy restoration. Against orders, Brandt passes the information along to Wilhelm’s adjutant, Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann ([[Ben Daniels]]).

Mieke does her duty and imparts to Wilhelm a message from the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]. Wilhelm is offered asylum in Great Britain and restoration to the German throne after the defeat of the Nazis. He refuses, preferring not to leave Utrecht. 

As the Gestapo closes in on the mansion, searching for Mieke, Brandt devises an escape plan. Wilhelm, Mieke, and Brandt escape in a van with Wilhelm pretending to have had a heart attack. Brandt kills Dietrich and another suspicious officer in the process.

Deep in the woods, Mieke decides to flee and asks Brandt to join her. She fears if he stays, he will be executed for the murders. Brandt, however, insists that he has a duty to Germany and a protective alibi (he brought Wilhelm to hospital, while Mieke killed the officers and escaped). 

As Mieke departs, Brandt repeats a marriage proposal that Mieke had earlier refused in fear. This time, she tells Brandt to find her after the war and disappears into the woods.

Some time later, Brandt is seen at a desk in a Berlin office. He is delivered a package, which contains a book of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s writings that Mieke had shown him. Inside is written a London address. In London, Mieke is seated on a park bench when she is informed that the prime minister is ready to see her. Rising, Mieke puts her hand on her belly, obviously  pregnant. 

In Brandt's office, an air raid siren sounds. While others evacuate, Brandt remains seated, reading Mieke's book. A plane is heard flying overhead as the screen cuts to black.

'''Theater Basel''' is the [[Municipality|municipal]] [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] of the city of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], which is home to the city's [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies. The theatre also presents  [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[musical theatre|musical]]s in addition to operas and [[operetta]]s. 

Because the theatre does not have its own [[orchestra]], the [[Basel Symphony Orchestra]] is usually contracted to perform for opera and ballet productions as needed. For [[baroque opera|baroque-opera]] productions, [[La Cetra (baroque orchestra)|La Cetra]], the [[baroque orchestra]] of the [[Schola Cantorum Basiliensis]], is engaged.

==History==
[[File:Basel Theaterbrand 1904.jpg|thumb|left|Theater Basel's second theatre which was destroyed by fire in 1904 (postcard from 1904).]]
Theater Basel was founded in 1834 under the name '''Basler Stadttheater'''. The first theatre was designed by Swiss [[architect]] [[Melchior Berri]]. 

In 1873 work on a new theatre began which was designed by Johann Jakob Stehlin Jr.. This second theatre opened in 1875 and was used until it was destroyed by fire on October 7th, 1904. 

Plans for a third theatre were soon made, but it was five years before the theatre finally opened in 1909.  The fourth theatre opened in 1975.

In October 2018, the company announced the appointment of Kristiina Poska as its next General Music Director (GMD; ''Generalmusikdirektorin''), effective with the 2019-2020 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Kristiina Poska wird Musikdirektorin am Theater Basel | url=https://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/kristiina-poska-wird-musikdirektorin-am-theater-basel/story/23806746 | work=Basler Zeitung | date=2018-10-11 | accessdate=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Unitary urbanism''' ('''UU''') was the critique of ''[[status quo]]'' "[[urbanism]]", employed by the [[Letterist International]] and then further developed by the [[Situationist International]] between 1953 and 1960.

The [[praxis (process)|praxis]] originates from the [[Lettrist]] technique of [[hypergraphics]] which was applied to architecture by the Lettrist International (LI). The UU critique of [[urbanism]] was further developed in the 1950s by the LI, and consists of a range of practices that include, but are not limited to:
* The situation
* The [[dérive]] (drift)
* [[Psychogeography]]
* [[Détournement]]
* [[Industrial Painting|industrial painting]]
* [[Revolution]]

The critical practice continued to be developed by the Situationists and others. It was largely abandoned for the Debordian theory of the [[Society of the Spectacle|spectacle]] after the [[Second Situationist International]] and [[Situationist Antinational]] were formed. [[London]] based [[evoL PsychogeogrAphix]] is one of the few groups openly practicing unitary urbanism today.

Unitary urbanism was announced as a very specific praxis at the [[Alba, Piedmont|Alba]] platform between the Lettrist International and the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]]. In his Address to the Alba Conference in September 1956, the Lettrist International Delegate [[Gil J Wolman]] said: "A unitary urbanism—the synthesis of art and technology that we call for—must be constructed according to certain new values of life, values which now need to be distinguished and disseminated."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/presitu/wolman.html&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of urban practice was also called for in a tract distributed during a demonstration by Lettrists in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] in December 1956.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/UU.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constant Nieuwenhuys]] and [[Guy Debord]] disagreed about the praxis, issuing the designation "the complex, ongoing activity which consciously recreates [[man]]'s [[urban environment|environment]] according to the most advanced conceptions in every domain," however the widening gulf between Nieuwenhuys' "structural" approach and Debord's focus on "content" eventually lead to Nieuwenhuy's split from the [[Situationist International|SI]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notbored.org/ten-years-on.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Unitary urbanism, one of the major early Situationist concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 27, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808190435/http://www.socialfiction.org/psychogeography/unitary_urbanism.html |archivedate=August 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stands on two tenets:
* The rejection of the standard [[Euclid]]ean, almost wholly functional, approach to urban architectural design, and
* The rejection of the compartmentalized way in which "art" is typically detached from its surroundings.

In the relative [[utopia]] of the UU ideal, the structural and artistic elements of human's [[metropolis|metropolitan]] surroundings are blended into such [[wikt:grey area|grey area]] that one cannot identify where function ends and play begins. The resulting [[society]], while it caters to fundamental needs, does so in an atmosphere of continual exploration, leisure, and stimulating ambience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28103">“'''Want of Matter'''” (in [[Hebrew]]: דלות החומר; Dalut HaHahomer) is an Israeli style of art that existed in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  Characteristics of this style include the use of “meager” creative materials, artistic sloppiness, and criticism of the social reality and the myth of Israel society.  Among the artists identified with “Want of  Matter” are [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Yair Garbuz]], [[Michal Na'aman]], [[Tamar Getter]] and [[Nahum Tevet]].

==History==
[[File:Lavie, Raffi-Untitled, 1977 cropped~B92 1599.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|''Untitled'' (1977) by [[Raffi Lavie]]. Acrylic, colored pencil, and collage on plywood, 122 x 83 cm. The Israel Museum, Jerusalem]]
The “Want of Matter” style grew out of a historical-retrospective view of Israeli art. The name  originated in an exhibition called  “The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art” curated by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which took place in March 1986 at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]]. Breitberg-Semel, then curator of Israeli art at the museum, mounted this exhibition as a summation and continuation of the exhibitions “Artist,Society,Artist” and “Different Spirit” (1981).  It was an attempt to distinguish between local art and the style of international art of this period by means of a sociological and esthetic survey of Israeli artists and their attitude toward European artistic traditions. Breitberg-Semel saw the roots of the style in [[Pop Art]], [[Arte Povera]] and [[Conceptual art]].  Another  highly significant element in Breitberg-Semel’s view was the concept “anesthetic,”  the roots of which could be found in the Jewish Talmudic tradition, which puts the text in the center of culture.

Breitberg-Semel’s attempt to trace  the development of “Want of Matter” gave rise to a clear historical line, beginning with the painting of the “New Horizons” group.  The members of this group developed  an abstract  style that came to be known as “lyrical abstract” within the framework of which the painters created an abstraction of form  influenced by Expressionism.  The artists who followed in the footsteps of these artists, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used the artists of the “Want of Matter” group as their esthetic model with regard to their relationship to the materials they used in their paintings, to their ascetic materialism, and to their combined use of the abstract and veiled iconography.

The first generation of artists in the “Want of Matter” group in the 1960s were partners in a number of avant-garde artistic experiments, the most important of which were the activities of a group called “[[10+]]” This group, which never had a unified political or esthetic direction, united around the influences of international art and the use of new artistic materials such as photographs to create two dimensional art, artistic “activity,” and even the use of the pioneering video art films in Israel.  
 
Visually, "The Want of Matter" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages,  photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials reflected the “Ars Poetica” approach and  gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.

==“But the word is very near you”==
The caption on the exhibit “Want of Matter” included a quotation from the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (30:14) -- “But the word is very near you.”  This quotation captured the point of view of this group of artists, according to Breitberg-Semel, a secular, modernist point of view mixed with Jewish symbolism.  The works were pointedly free of religious symbolism, as Breitberg –Semel notes, defining the works of Raffi Lavie: “There is no Western Wall, no Old City Wall, no Augusta Victoria,” while on the other hand, the works were created “against the background of a religion whose esthetic and non-materialist point of view were its symbols.”  The development of this idea can be seen the article “Agrippas versus Nimrod” (1988), in which Breitberg-Semel expressed the desire to inculcate into their art a secular, pluralistic point of view influenced by Jewish tradition.  
The identification of Judaism with abstract art had already happened in the past, when it was based on the iconoclastic Orthodox tradition, in the spirit of the prohibition against  the making of statues or masks that appears in The Ten Commandments. In 1976 this idea appeared in the Hebrew translation of an article by the American art critic Robert Pincus Witten, published in the first issue of the art journal Musag (in Hebrew: "Concept").&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Ofrat, “[http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/art/yahadut/haisraelit.htm Israeli Art and the Jewish Tradition].” [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The typical expression of this point of view on the Israeli artist can be found in an article on the work of [[Arie Aroch]], who is considered the model for Raffi Lavie and his generation.  The concept of “anestheticism” fueled the writings of the young artists, as an image within the works themselves, writing which relates to the relationship between the Jewish Talmudic tradition and a preoccupation with borders and national symbols as an expression of critical Zionist Judaism. In Breitberg-Semel’s writing, these artists are portrayed as the “disinherited sabra,” cut off from Jewish tradition to the same degree that they were cut off from the European Christian tradition.

In the article by Breitberg-Semel that accompanied the “Want of Matter” exhibition, the artist [[Raffi Lavie]] was presented as the typical representative of the style.  Lavie’s works put forth the idea of “The City of Tel Aviv” as a combination of European-Zionist  modernism and neglect and abandonment.  As the years passed, the image of Lavie himself, dressed sloppily in shorts, with rubber flip-flops on his feet, arrogant, “native,” and “prickly,” became the typical expression of this aesthetic school.&lt;ref&gt;The photography of Michal Heiman, for example, documented Raffi’s wanderings around the city and presented him at his most typical.  Another artist, [[Doron Rabina]], described the earthy image of this artist: “End of a summer day at [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|HaMidrasha]].  Raffi walks into the cafeteria, sweat streaming down his face, his shirt glued to his back with sweat.  I couldn’t help thinking, “This is the Maestro.”  See: Doron Rabina, “Drawing Proper,” Hamidrasha, 2 (1999): 127.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie’s works, which included childish scribbles, collages of magazine illustrations, advertisements of Tel Aviv cultural events,  stickers with words “head” or “geraniums” written on them, and above all the plywood sheet, sawed to a consistent size of 120&amp;nbsp;cm., and painted in whitewash,&lt;ref&gt;This format became a permanent part of the scene primarily toward the end of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt; became the most recognizable symbols of  “Want of Matter.”

In addition to developing a comprehensive visual style, Lavie encouraged discussion of his works on a formalist level. In interviews, Lavie refused to relate to any interpretations of his work other than “the language of art” in its modernist aesthetic incarnation.  In spite of clearly iconographic images in his works, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical significance.  Furthermore, the use of collage and techniques that lacked an artistic “halo” were intended, according to both Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, to erode and undermine the significance of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Sarit Shapira, “This isn’t a Cactus, it’s a Geranium,” (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 2003) 18-20.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Lavie’s students, however, continued to cultivate a preoccupation with form, as well as a continuing relationship with the modernist  tradition, both of which caused problems for Lavie’s didactic separation of “form” and “content.”&lt;ref&gt;Michal Na’aman, “Please Don’t Read What’s Written Here,” Hamidrasha 2 (1999): 104.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yair Garbuz]] formed a relationship with Lavie when he was just a young boy. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz’s private teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Ruti Direktor, “A Little Bit Guru, a Little Bit Fake,” Hadashot [News] (April 4, 1986). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Garbuz went  from being a student to being a senior instructor at the “HaMidrasha” (School of Art). His work from these years created a link between the symbols that connected  the ethos of the Zionist undertaking, as reflected in popular culture, with social and political criticism.

His two-dimensional works from the 1970s  and 1980s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as "The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly" (1979) and "The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society.  For the cover he designed for No. 11 of the journal Siman Kriah [Exclamation Point] (May 1980), Garbuz inserted a photograph from the newspaper Davar  of a self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh captioned “Van Gogh in Tel Aviv.”  Under the reproduction, Garbuz added a sort of poem, complete with nikud [vocalization] and illustrations, discussing the significance of labor. This work was one of a number of his works in which he presented his artistic activity as an artist in Israel - which he perceived as a distant and outlying place — as a kind of anarchism. Along with these two-dimensional works, Garbuz produced art videos, installations, and other forms of artistic activities in this spirit.

[[Henry Schlesnyak]], an American-born artist, juxtaposed collage with American Pop Art, and American symbolism—the most significant of which is his portrait of Abraham Lincoln – with scenes from Israeli art as reflected in various newspaper articles. Through this juxtaposition, Schlesnyak pointed out  the moral aspect  of artistic activity and his view of the place of Israeli art and the Israeli artist within it.  Another layer of his work was composed of the “Tel Aviv” aesthetic, which played the role of critic in his works. For example reproductions of famous works of art were painted over in industrial shellac to give them the feeling of paintings by the European “Old Masters.”  The “Hebrew translation” of this feeling included the devaluing of the paintings by “flashes of stains on the surface of the paintings, dirt, ‘want of matter’, thereby bringing it down to the level of what is appropriate to the experience of being here. “&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel,  “Want of Matter as a Sign of Excellence in Israeli Art,” Hamidrasha 2 (1999):267.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1980 collage, Schlesnyak glued onto plywood a newspaper picture of the writer Irving Stone, author of popular novels about artists, positioned at the front of the Tel Aviv Museum.  Next to him stands Marc Scheps, Director of the museum, with his head enclosed in a circle.  Above this Schlesnyak glued an article by Adam Baruch describing an exhibition of the works of Ya’acov Dorchin, a friend of Schlesnyak, with a caption composed of letterset printing.

The works of [[Michal Na'aman]] from the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Naaman put together various expressions emphasizing the limitations of the language of description and of vision, as well as the possibilities of imagination and the difference in visual expression. The practice of combining conflicting axioms indicated the failure or distortion of the language of description.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “Michal Na’aman: What Has She Done Here?” Studio 40(January 1993): 48. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Against the background of the visual dimension that reflected the aesthetic principles of “Want of Matter,” there appeared various representations and texts written in letterset printing&lt;ref&gt;Kits of ready-made stick-on letters intended for various graphic purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; or in handwriting that reflected the semiotic bankruptcy of the representation of images.  Examples of this can be found in works such as “The Fish is the End of the Bird” (1977) and “The Gospel According to the Bird” (1977) in which Na'aman joined reproduced images of a fish and a bird into a kind of hybrid monster. In “Vanya (Vajezath)" (1975) a conflict is created between the textual contents  of the work with the visual contents, along with an emphasis on sexual motifs.

In spite of her feminist connections, [[Yehudit Levin]]’s works are more personal and less intellectual than the works of most of Raffi Lavie’s students.  At the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, Levin created abstract compositions constructed from sawed and painted plywood, sometimes combined with photographs, then leaned against a wall. The names of  these works, such as “Bicycle” (1977) and  “Princess in a Palace” (1978) hint at a domestic connection.  Even though these works appear in space as three-dimensional, their main interest  lies in their complex relationship with the spaces seen within them. The “drawing” breaks out of the framework  of the platform and flows over into space.

A similar approach, without the psychological baggage, can be seen in the works of the sculptor [[Nahum Tevet]]. In his minimalist works Tevet  shows an ambivalent relationship with three-dimensional space.  In a late interview Tevet defined the motivation behind these works as a reaction to his studying  art with Lavie. “It might be that to a certain extent this is a reaction to the place where I studied painting, in Raffi Lavie’s studio.  He suggested  painting in which the main interest was built around personal tensions and relationships, and I asked about the relationship between the painting as an object  and the environment – the world.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “How Much Happiness Can Grow Out of This Reduction: a Conversation with Nahum Tevet,”  Studio 91 (March 1998): 24.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

His works from that period dealt with the division and organization of work surfaces. In an installation from 1973-1974, Tevet placed white-painted plywood boards on top of chairs. The work showed the influence of the aesthetic  principles of minimalist art and emphasized the temporariness of the expression of an artistic experience.  In another work, “Beds” (1974), Tevet displayed rectangular, white-painted plywood boards, with legs attached to them that turned the two-dimensional “painting” into a work of sculpture.  The interpretation of this work that grew up over the years required that, in addition to the formalistic aspect of the work, the biographical background of Tevet, as a former kibbutz member, needed to be taken into account. Relating to plywood as a “painting” and to its placement as a work of art&lt;ref&gt;This relationship is clearer in Tevet’s later installations, such as his series of works called “Painting Lessons.”&lt;/ref&gt; reflected the ambivalent relationship of Tevet to the surface of the painting.

==Hamidrasha School of Art==
{{Main|HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts}}
In 1966 Lavie joined the staff of Hamidrasha Art Teachers College in [[Ramat Hasharo]]n, known as “[[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|Hamidrasha School of Art]].” Around this educational institution a group of Lavie’s students, such as Michal Na’aman, Yehudit Levin, etc., grew up and began teaching there. As a group these artists formed a clear hegemony over art in the period following “New Horizons.”

The teaching method at Hamidrasha centered around the discussion  of art and modern aesthetics, demoting the more traditional  method of teaching art, which focused on drawing lessons opposite a model, to second place. The rational that gave rise to this pedagogical method sprung from the assumption that  in a world in which art was expressed in endless new ways of execution, there was no way to learn all the new artistic techniques. Therefore the school tried to educate its art students first and foremost as “artists” and assumed that they would develop their technical skills independently, in accordance with their individual needs.

A great many academic areas at Hamidrasha were subordinated to this pedagogic approach.  “I reject all academic degrees and any attempt at the academization of the study of art in any form,” Lavie stated in a dialogue between him and Pinchas Cohen Gan.  “I don’t think it’s possible to give out grades, and I don’t believe it’s possible to judge art.”&lt;ref&gt;Training Young Artists,” Muzot [Muses] 5/6 (February 1989): 20. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  As an answer to the inability to make judgments  about art, which Lavie pointed out, the institution developed  “public” criticism.  Within the framework of this criticism, which was often dubbed “The Ceremony,” teachers were invited to a public discussion of their students’ work.

The “Criticism” demonstrated the centrality of the personality and the status of the teachers on the framework of the studies.  Tsibi Geva, who was a student in the Hamidrasha and later became a teacher there, described Lavie as a central figure in art, through which the world of art was perceived…”We received everything through Raffi Lavie.  The man controlled the flow; and he was, you could say, the authority that legislated and the authority that carried things out. He was the window onto the world; our education was acquired through the prism of his eyes.”&lt;ref&gt;Roee Rosen, “The Birth of Oil and the Life of the Machine,”  Studio 94 (June–July 1998):43.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the its teaching, Hamidrasha provided  favored graduates with entrance to the “Hamidrasha School.” Within this framework, Lavie encouraged exhibitions of the school’s graduates.  In May 1974 Lavie distributed a “pamphlet” in which he presented works by students who were close to him, such as Naaman, Tevet, David Ginton, etc., and aroused a storm of negative criticism.  The Ross Gallery in north Tel Aviv also consistently displayed the artists of the new School.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Efrat, Dorit Lavita, and  Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Tel Aviv : Masada Publishers,  1980), 305-310. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the artists of the School began displaying their works in the [[Julie M Gallery]] and the [[Givon Gallery]] in the center of Tel Aviv as well.

==The Struggle to Be the Center: Tel Aviv and Jerusalem==
The exhibition “Want of Matter” presented the group of “Tel Aviv Artists” as the center of contemporary Israel art. In addition to representing the Socialistic-Pioneering spirit, these artists represented the secular character of Tel Aviv, under the banner of “the aesthetic, non-materialistic aspect of the Jewish tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel,  “Want of Matter as a Sign of Excellence in Israeli Art,” ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):258.  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The group strengthened its sense of its own identity by forming a network of personal and professional connections among themselves.  In the article, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown. Catchup, Love” (1999), Yair Garbuz, Lavie’s student, presented his teacher in terms of his originality.  “It’s not that we suddenly became the center of art… we’ve remained the provinces [...] In a certainly respect, Raffi painted and taught like a pioneer. In order for something to flourish here, it had to be carefully disguised. You couldn’t  just say that maybe modernism was developing.”&lt;ref&gt;Yair Garbuz, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown, Catchup, Love,”  ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):37. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The period before the existence of “Want of Matter” was perceived by this group of artists as a mixture of immature explorations of abstract modernism with overtones of the romantic aesthetic, overtones which Lavie and his followers viewed as a danger  capable of reducing art to something  lacking in the characteristics and criteria of aesthetic judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Yair Garbuz, “About Raffi: Color patch, Crown. Catchup, Love,”  ''Hamidrasha'' 2 (1999):39-43. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition that Want of Matter created for itself attempted to follow what was happening in American and European conceptual Art. However, in contrast to them, this conceptualism was seen primarily within the framework of painting. [[Ariella Azoulay]] stated, in an analysis of the Israeli artistic scene, that this choice of painting as the dominant medium in Israeli art, was not a natural process, but rather was carefully directed by certain elements such as Sarah Breitberg-Semel, the museum and the art establishment, as well as the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ariella Azoulay, “The Place of Art,” ''Studio'' 4 (January 1993):9-11. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, the choice of works by Breitberg-Semel  for the exhibition honored works from the exhibit that were created by the same group of artists she had chosen to exhibit, but they were done using techniques other than painting.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions were the installation of  Nahum Tevet, and the objects of Pinchas Cohen Gan, Tsibi Geva, and Michael Druks, whose work, in spite of its “three-dimensionality,” included a clear affinity to painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of this are the video art films of Lavie and Garbuz, the mixed media works and installations of Michal Naaman, etc. Outside the museum establishment, avant-garde art such as mixed media works, installations and other conceptual projects that couldn’t be displayed at museums continued to be produced. Criticism of this kind was also heard during the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Itamar Levy, “There are No Child Prodigies, ''Yediot Ahronoth'' (March 28, 1986). [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 1980s, Azoulay contends, with the weakening of the status of the central museums, did these trends, that were suppressed until then, rise to the top of Israeli art.

The attempt to present “Want of Matter” as the dominant hegemony in Israeli art, as the “center” of Israeli art, pushed many Israeli artists to the periphery of this center.  Gideon Efrat, an art critic and curator set up a comparison between “Tel Aviv-ness” and the “School of New Jerusalem,” a term based on the metaphysical Christian interpretation of the city of Jerusalem.  The main difference between the definition of this group and that of the “Tel Aviv School,” according to Breitberg-Semel, lay in the difference between their definitions of the status of art in relation to public space.  While the “Tel Aviv” group strove to focus their art within the traditional definitions, the “Jerusalem artists” sought to draw an “eruv” – a ritual shared enclosed area – around art and life.  Artists such as [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (“Gabi and Sharon”) appeared in a series of performances of a political nature in Jerusalem public places; [[Avital Geva]] and [[Moshe Gershuni]] met with [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]], Secretary General of the Histadrut, as an “activity”&lt;ref&gt;”Peulah” (activity) was the previous Hebrew term for “installation.”&lt;/ref&gt; of “art.”&lt;ref&gt;Ariella Azoulay, ''Exercising Art: a Critique of the Economics of Museum Curation'' (Tel Aviv: Kibbutz Hameuhad, 1999), 163-164. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the “Tel Avivans,” led by Lavie, developed a purist concept of art.  In his view, art should focus on the physical boundaries of the plastic arts – on color, line, stain, and their relationship to the format of the work.  In a 1973 interview, Lavie spoke about politics in art: “If an artist wants to say political things through his work, it’s his privilege. But he should know exactly what the work is called: a “placard.”&lt;ref&gt;In: Ariella Azoulay,  ''Exercising Art: a Critique of the Economics of Museum Curation'' (Tel Aviv: Kibbutz Hameuhad, 1999), 136. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the exhibition “Eyes of the Nation,” held at  the Tel Aviv Museum in 1998, Ellen Ginton  viewed the art of the period as a reaction to the political and social problems in Israeli society.  This perspective undermined the traditional dichotomy  that Efrat and Breitberg-Semel presented. Ginton held that this art was a response to the political and social crisis after the Yom Kippur War which continued into the 1980s. Eventually, the artists returned to more traditional artistic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the Nation. Visual Art in a Country without Boundaries'' (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum, 1998)  [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Sabra and the Exile==
Another kind of criticism, political in nature, was directed against “Want of Matter” and the wide acceptance of Breitberg-Semel’s thesis. In 1991 Breitberg-Semel’s article “Want of Matter” was re-published, and she wrote a new introduction for it.  In this new introduction she attempted to clarify the critical dimension of her thesis, declaring that “the generation that grew up after 1967 encountered a new ethos – the rule by occupation, with all its moral and material implications, and with all its enormous social changes, of which the bourgeois existence as the leading way of life, is only one aspect. This generation of artists, which would have difficulty freeing itself of the cultural images the exhibition bequeathed to them with regard to the dispute over local culture, would also have difficulty waving the flag of “want of matter” as the achievement that belongs to it and characterizes it. But perhaps, one day, things would change.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Breitberg-Semel, “Want of Matter,” in: Haim Losky, ed. ''The City, Utopia, and Israeli Society'' (Tel Aviv: 1989), 108. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt; The division in “want of matter” between “ethos” and “aethestics”  is presented in the introduction as a fleeting moment, since the use that was made of it later cut it off from the social and political field in which it originated. 
 
In 1993, an article by [[Sarah Chinski]] entitled “Silence of the Fish: The Local versus the Universal in the Israeli Discourse on Art” was published in the journal Theory and Criticism. The article criticized the narcissistic banner-waving of the self-pitying Tel  Avivan.” Against this image of self-pity, Chinski juxtaposed the political reality that gave birth to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. “The ‘dispossessed sabra’,” writes Chinski, “has been so focused on self-pity for his imaginary losses, he hasn’t noticed that in his name massive expulsions of huge numbers of people have taken place throughout all the glorious history of the Palmach  and the youth movement he has created in his heart.“&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Chinski, “Silence of the Fish: The Local versus the Universal in the Israeli Discourse on Art,” ''Theory and Criticism'' 4 (Autumn 1993):105-122. [in Hebrew]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Young Actors Summer Institute''' is an arts enrichment summer programs in New England. Held annually since 2005 at the [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Trinity Repertory Company]], in Providence, Rhode Island, YASI is taught by the theater's resident acting company and education staff. Students are able to choose from a variety of different classes, including playwriting, painting and drawing, improvisation, Shakespeare, film and more.

== Structure ==
YASI takes place during the month of July and culminates in performances featuring [[scene (drama)|scene]], [[monologue]]s and musical theater selections. The program usually lasts five weeks, excluding weekends and holidays. The first week starts participants with age appropriate improv games and an "audition day"; and the last week is spent in [[rehearsal]] for a final showcase.

Normal days are divided into four elective blocks and one extended period of time used for mandatory [[scene study]], rehearsal or learning about the technical aspects of theater. The elective blocks are varied in subject matter and range from [[yoga]] to [[improvisation]] to playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Young Actors Summer Institute (YASI) 2011 Course Descriptions |publisher=Trinity Repertory Company |url=http://www.trinityrep.com/DownloadDocs/YASI_Course_Descriptions_2011.pdf |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the final showcase performances, there is also a full length production of a Shakepearean play done by the high school students in the 'YASI Shakes' program.

In the summer of 2011, a new mini camp was created called YASI Jr. YASI Jr. is a 5-day program giving kids too young for YASI a chance to experience what it's like to be at YASI.

== Participant Life ==
In addition to normal classes, many extra events occur. Musical or theatrical guests often come to perform. Every year, there has been a [[rock-paper-scissors]] tournament and a game called "[[Assassins (game)|Boom Roasted]]". There is also a Lip Sync Battle every year and the winner(s) get to smash a piece of art filled with cream.

=== Awards ===
There are daily prizes. These prizes are awarded to the attendees who have helped throughout the day in various ways such as cleaning up during lunch and snack, or helping the counselors and teaching artists. Prizes vary from day to day.

At the end of the program, special participants are recognized with induction to the Gryffindor club (an homage to [[Gryffindor]] of [[Harry Potter]]).
