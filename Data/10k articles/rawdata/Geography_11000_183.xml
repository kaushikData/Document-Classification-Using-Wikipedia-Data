The '''A640''' is a road in [[England]] which runs between [[Rochdale]] in [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Huddersfield]] in [[West Yorkshire]].

The [[Rochdale]] terminus is the junction of Drake Street and Manchester Road ([[A58 road|A58]]). From here, the road runs eastward through [[Newbold, Rochdale|Newbold]], [[Belfield, Greater Manchester|Belfield]], [[Firgrove]], [[Milnrow]], [[Newhey]], Ogden, [[Denshaw]], Buckstones, Deanhead, [[Scammonden]], [[Outlane]] and in [[Huddersfield]] ([[Salendine Nook]], [[Oakes, Huddersfield|Oakes]] and [[Marsh, West Yorkshire|Marsh]], before meeting the [[A62 road|A62]] at Huddersfield's town centre ring road.)

The road is often closed during periods of snow due to its remote nature. This cuts off the non-motorway route from [[Huddersfield]] to [[Manchester]].

'''Alan Marshall''' is a [[New Zealand]] author, artist and scholar working within the discipline of [[environmental studies]]. He is noted as a key scholar in [[environmental ethics|environmental philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;Oliphant, J. ''et al.''(2011) AQA Religious Ethics for AS and A2, Routledge,978-0-203-83021-5:  pp222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/abstract/greenethics/n102.xml|title=Green Philosophy: an A to Z Guide|author=Newman, J.|first=|date=|year=2011|website=|publisher=Sage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for inventing the 'Literary Method of Urban Design'&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. (2018) 'The Fantasy Method of Urban Design', ''Diseña 12'', February 2018 issue -- available in Spanish and English via [http://ojs.uc.cl/index.php/Disena/article/view/45 ''Diseña''.]&lt;/ref&gt;. For his research on these topics, the [[University of Wollongong]] awarded Marshall a doctorate and ''National Geographic'' assigned him as an explorer. Marshall has undertaken projects within institutes all around Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, he's held fellowships at [http://www.ifz.at/ias/IAS-STS/Fellows-and-Alumni/Alumni/Alan-Marshall IAS-STS] (Austria), the [[N. I. Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod|State University of Nizhny Novgorod]] (Russia), [[University of Prešov|Prešov Universit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y &amp; [[Pavol Jozef Šafárik University|UPJŠ]] (Slovakia), [[Masaryk University]] (Czech Republic), [[Khalifa University|KUSTAR]] (Abu Dhabi), [[Nirex|Nirex UK]] (Great Britain), [[Curtin University|Curtin University of Technology]] (Australia), and [[Mahidol University]] (Thailand).





==Major projects==
In the 1990s Alan Marshall developed a [[postmodern]] version of the Human–Nature relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (1998) 'A Postmodern Natural History of the World, Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science', Part C, Vol. 34 Part C, No 1, 137-164&lt;/ref&gt; one that throws into doubt the very concepts of 'Humanity' and 'Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A (2002) [https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 'The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science'], Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Marshall's approach is heavily influenced by the science of [[ecology]] but has been criticized as privileging one school of ecology, i.e., '[[community ecology]]', over others such as [[systems ecology]] and the ecology of [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]].&lt;ref&gt;de Laplante, K. (2004) Environmental Alchemy: How to turn Ecological Science into Ecological Philosophy, Environmental Ethics, Vol 26, Winter Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  His book ''The Unity of Nature''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Marshall (2002) ''[https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p268 The Unity of Nature]'', Imperial College Press/World Scientific: London &amp; Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the fiercest critiques of [[Systems theory|Systems Theory]] in general, and [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia Theory]] and [[Chaos theory|Chaos Theory]] in particular.

In 2006, Alan Marshall founded The [[appropedia:Ecomimicry|Ecomimicry]] Project which tries to meld ecology with Green [[innovation]], sustainable art, and the ethics of [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance: A. Marshall (2007) ‘The Theory and Practice of Ecomimicry’, ''Sustaining Gondwana Working Paper Series'', Issue 3, publlished by Curtin University of Technology: Perth, or A. Marshall (2009) ''‘Wild Design: The Ecomimicry Project’'', published by North Atlantic Books: Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of designs that emerged from this project include:

* a Hemp Sail Battle Cruiser for the Royal Australian Navy (in which a navy ship had its engines 'designed-out' and in their stead it is powered by [[Sail|sails]] made from eco-friendly [[hemp]])
* a [[manure]]-powered swimming pool heating system (in which a luxury pool is heated by the composted [[Feces|body waste]] of the swimmers)
* a hairy-roofed [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain]] village where the architecture is adorned with an engineered protective material that mimics the fur of local [[Brown bear|brown bears.]]

These designs were compiled into Marshall's ''[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/107954/wild-design-by-alan-marshall/ Wild Design]'' book and then praised by the Australian art &amp; design media.&lt;ref&gt;Downton, P. (2009) Review of Wild Design, Artlink, Vol. 29, No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wakely, M (2009) [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/bydesign/design-inspired-by-nature/3159490 Design Inspired By Nature], ABC Radio National's ''By Design'' program.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Marshall started the '[http://www.ecotopia2121.com/#!project-cities/c66t Ecotopia 2121]' project; which (as noted by ''CNN''&lt;ref&gt;CNN (2017) [https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/utopian-cities/index.html Utopian cities of the future re-imagine life on Earth], CNN Style/Architecture, January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;'', Vanity Fair''&lt;ref&gt;D'Alessio, O.

(2017) 'What will London and LA will look like in 2121?', ''The Independent'', Jan 19th, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;) explores 'graphic future scenarios' of 100 'super-ecofriendly' cities across the world. In 2015, the master-class part of this project conducted at Mahidol University was awarded the 2015 [[Kenneth Roemer|Kenneth M. Roemer]] Innovative Course Design Award by the [[Society for Utopian Studies]]. ''Ecotopia 2121'', the book of the project written and illustrated by Marshall, has attracted broad critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.euroscientist.com/journeys-towards-ecotopia-2121/|title=Journeys Toward Ecotopia 2121|last=EuroScientist|first=Science in Society|date=27 June 2016|work=EuroScientist|access-date=10 January 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/WEFvideo/videos/10154168961996479/?pnref=story|title=Visions of Our Future Cities|last=World Economic Forum|first=WEF Agenda|date=2017-02-10|website=World Economic Forum|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewe, E.

A reviewer in ''Strange Horizons''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strangehorizons.com/|title=Strange Horizons: A Magazine of Speculative Fiction|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in contrast, indicated that ''Ecotopia'' ''2121'' was 'offensive fluff' without ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''seriousness' and warned people 'not to read it under any circumstance'. 

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Marshall is also widely referred to as a critic of the car industry&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. (2015) 'Ecotopia 2121: Car-free Cities of the 22nd Century', ''Environment and Natural Resources Journal''. Vol 13, No.1,pp.28-38 &lt;/ref&gt;, of the [[nuclear industry]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: A. Marshall (2005) 'The Social and Ethical Aspects of Nuclear Waste', ''[http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=20362&amp;tip=sid Electronic Green Journal]'', Issue 21, (Earth Day Issue); or A. Marshall (2005) ‘Questioning the Motivations for International Repositories for Nuclear Waste, ''[[Global Environmental Politics]]'', Vol. 5, No. 2, May 2005, pp. 1-7; or A. Marshall (2006) ''Dangerous Dawn: The New Nuclear Age,'' BNI/FoE: Melbourne, or A. Marshall (2008) 'Leaving Messages about Our Radioactive Waste for Future Generations', in A. P Latiffer, ed, ''[https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=6699 Nuclear Waste Research]'', Nova Publishers, pp37-46.&lt;/ref&gt; and of space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: A. Marshall (2000) ‘The Search for Extraterrestrial Us: the Biases of SETI’, ''Australasian Science'', Vol. 21, No 3, April issue, pp36-37; and A. Marshall (1995) ‘Development and imperialism in space’, ''Space Policy'', Vol. 11, No. 1, pp41-52; and A. Marshall(1993) 'Ethics and the extraterrestrial environment', ''Journal of Applied Philosophy'', Vol. 10, No 2, pp227-237.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings on the latter subject have been cited as insightful but are usually regarded by scientists and engineers as being too radically '[[Environmental movement|environmental]]'&lt;ref&gt;Almar, I. (2002) 'What could COSPAR do to protect the planetary and space environment?', Advances in Space Research', Volume 30, Issue 6, 1577–1588.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fogg, MJ (2000) 'The ethical dimensions of space settlement', Volume 16, Issue 3, 16 July 2000, Pages 205–211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17723765.100-the-word-cosmic-preservationist.html|title=Cosmic Preservationist|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|date=Jan 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially his calls for the protection of the Martian landscape.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Dan and Idil Boran, "Agent-Centered Restrictions and the Ethics of Space Exploration" in Journal of Social Philosophy vol. 35 No. 1 (Spring 2004) pp.&amp;nbsp;148–163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2016, Marshall began a new project in urban ecology called [http://www.frankencities.com Frankencities]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strochlic|first=N.|date=2018|title=Voici à quoi pourraient ressembler nos villes en 2121|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.fr/sciences/2018/01/voici-quoi-pourraient-ressembler-nos-villes-en-2121|journal=National Geographic|volume=233|issue=2|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micu, A. (2018) [https://www.zmescience.com/science/ecotopia-project-cities/ Ecotopia 2121 shows what perfectly ecofriendly cities may look like], ZMEScience, Jan 29th, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; which details the worst-case scenarios of emerging environmental problems in a series of cities around the world whilst comparing them to the insights offered by the Dr. [[Frankenstein]] story.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. et al, "[http://journal.urbantranscripts.org/article/frankencities-urban-horrorscapes-near-future-alan-marshall-nanthawan-kaenkaew/ Frankencities: Urban Horrorscapes of Our Near Future]" in Urban Transcripts Journal, Vol. 1 No. 3 (Autumn 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; With projects such as these, Marshall has often been labeled as 'anti-science'. In response, he has explained he is a 'science critic' and not 'anti-science' (in the same manner that a 'film critic' is not 'anti-film').

For the Frankencities project and for the Ecotopia 2121 project, Marshall developed a novel urban design [[methodology]] known as [http://www.ecotopia2121.com/single-post/2016/09/13/The-Fantasy-Method-of-Urban-Design 'The Literary Method of Urban Design'], which is not so much about design but more about inventing new social change strategies. 

==Fiction==
Alan Marshall is an award-winning writer of fiction. His works of fiction include an historical novel, ''Lancewood'', about an iconic New Zealand plant, and a [[science fiction]] radio drama called ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' that was broadcast on [[NPR]] and XM Satellite Radio in the USA. In 2001 ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' received the "Silver Award" from the Mark Time Awards by a panel that included Grammy-award winner [[Phil Proctor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Time/Ogle Award winners|year=2001|url=http://www.greatnorthernaudio.com/MarkTime/MarkTime-winners.html|work=Mark Time Awards|publisher=Jerry Stearns, David Ossman|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Peter Jackson's ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' movie trilogy, ''This Pointless Thing Called Life'' was nominated for a [[Sir Julius Vogel Award|Vogel Award]] in the category "Best Long Form dramatic science fiction and fantasy production made in New Zealand in the year 2002".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffanz.org.nz/sjv/sjvNominations-2002.shtml|title=Sir Julius Vogel Award Nominations - 2002|publisher=SFFANZ|accessdate=22 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/SirJuliusVogelNomList.html#3363-2001 |title=Sir Julius Vogel Nominees List |work=The LOCUS Index to SF Awards |publisher=Mark R.

The sequel to "This Pointless Thing Called Life" was another award-winning full-length radio feature broadcast in four parts on XM Satellite and by some NPR stations in 2003. This sequel was titled 'This Miserable Thing Called Life".

Bahía Portete – Kaurrele National Natural Park, with an area of {{convert|14080|ha|acre}}, is located in the extreme north of Colombia, at the northern coast of La Guajira peninsula between [[Cabo de la Vela]] and [[Punta Gallinas]], Colombia's mainland northernmost point. The park is within the boundaries of the municipality [[Uribia, La Guajira|Uribia]]. The climate is hot and arid, due to the [[desert]] of La Guajira. Average temperatures range between {{convert|28|and|30|C|F}}. The coastal area is characterised by humidity caused by the inland winds.&lt;ref name=ColparquesPortete&gt;{{es}} [http://www.colparques.net/PORTETE Bahía Portete] – Colparques&lt;/ref&gt; The marine bay area has an average depth of {{convert|9|m|ft}}, ranging from {{convert|3|to|20|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=ParquesNacionalesEsquina/&gt;

At the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquest]] in the sixteenth century, the bay was known as ''El Portichuelo'', an area where slaves were brought into [[New Kingdom of Granada|Colonial Colombia]]. The sparsely populated area is inhabited by approximately 500 indigenous [[Wayuu people|Wayuu]].&lt;ref name=Gutierrez_p191&gt;Gutiérrez Moreno et al., 2008, p.191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EspectadorPortete&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/medio-ambiente/nueva-reserva-de-bahia-portete-aumenta-areas-protegidas-articulo-534590 Nueva reserva de Bahía Portete aumenta áreas protegidas en el país] – [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2004, approximately forty paramilitaries tortured and assassinated six people, four of which were women.

'''Bohuslav Balbín''' (3 December 1621 Hradec Králové – 29 November 1688 Prague) was a [[Czech people|Czech]] writer, historian, geographer and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], called the "Czech [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]]". He became well known also as an advocate of the Czech language in the time of incoming germanization of the Czech lands.

==Life==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Balbín was born in [[Hradec Králové]] into a middle class Roman Catholic family. He was educated mostly in the Jesuit schools, he soon joined the Society of Jesus. After finishing studies in philosophy at [[University of Olomouc]], he taught in Jesuit colleges in Prague, [[Třeboň]], [[Brno]], [[Jičín]], [[Jindřichův Hradec]] and [[Český Krumlov]].

After writing of several textbooks and didactic theatre plays, he also became acquainted with historical sources of archives and libraries. His entire life was devoted to collecting and editing materials about Czech history, and his researches have often been utilized by the [[Bollandists]]. Balbín died, aged 66, in [[Prague]].

== Work ==

He wrote over thirty works, the most important from which is ''Miscellanea Historica regni Bohemiae'' ("Varieties from the History of the Czech Kingdom" ", 6 vols., Prague, 1679–87), in which he described the [[geography]], [[natural history]], and chief [[History|historical]] events of his native land. The work includes brief ''[[Biography|vita]]e'' of prominent Czechs.
The sections of the work: 
*Miscellanea historica regni Bohemiae - History of the kingdom of Bohemia 
*Liber naturalis - The Nature of Bohemia 
*Liber popularis - The population 
*Liber chorographicus - Topography 
*Liber hagiographicus – Czech Saints
*Liber parochialis – The Parishes 
*Liber episcopalis - The Archdiocese of Prague 
*Liber regalis - Rulers
*Liber epistolaris - Series of letters
*Bohemia Docta - Czech literature and teaching 
*Liber de seu curialis magistratibus et officiis curialibus regem Bohemiae - Paper on Courts and Offices of the Czech Crown

Bohuslav Balbín (Balbinus) is known in Czech Lands mostly for his "Apology for the Slavic and especially Czech language", written in Latin. He was the first to edit the ancient [[Legenda Christiani|chronicle]] of the tenth century&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the edition of 1902, Dr. Pekár&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''Life of St. Ludmilla and Martyrdom of St. Wenceslas'', which is considered the oldest historical work written in the Czech lands by a Czech (written in Latin). Balbinus wrote also ''De archiepiscopis Bohemiae'' ("The Archbishops of Bohemia", Prague, 1682) and ''Bohemia Sancta, sive de sanctis Bohemiae, Moraviae, Silesiae, Lusatiae'' ("Sacred Bohemia, or the Saints of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Lusatia" Prague, 1682). His book ''Vita beatae Joannis Nepomuceni martyris'' (Life of Saint and martyr John of Nepomuk) was published in Prague, 1670,  is in large part responsible for the developed legend of Saint [[John of Nepomuk]].&lt;ref&gt;It was reprinted in the [[Bollandists]]' ''Acta sanctorum''  III, May, pp 668-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Balbin also wrote one reference book about [[Stylistics (field of study)|stylistics]] (1666) and two works devoted to [[rhetoric]] (1677, 1688) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ujc.cas.cz/lingviste/balbin-bohuslav.html Bohuslav Balbín (Department of the Czech language - in Czech)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104192323/http://www.ujc.cas.cz/lingviste/balbin-bohuslav.html |date=January 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caspian Depression''' ({{lang-rus|Прикаспи́йская ни́зменность|p=prʲɪkɐˈspʲijskəjə ˈnʲizmʲɪnnəsʲtʲ}}, '''Caspian Lowland''') or '''Pricaspian/Peri-Caspian Depression/Lowland''' is a [[lowland|low-lying]] [[Flatland (disambiguation)|flatland]] region encompassing the northern part of the [[Caspian Sea]], the largest enclosed [[body of water]]  on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |publisher=Caspian Environment Programme 
 |accessdate=2011-02-24 
}}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the larger northern part of the wider [[Aral-Caspian Depression]] around the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] and Caspian seas.

The level of the Caspian sea is {{convert|28|m}} below sea level, however several places in the depression are even lower, and among them [[Karagiye]] near [[Aktau]] is the lowest at {{convert|-132|m}}.

The [[Depression (geology)|depression]] lies at the southern end of the [[Ryn Desert]], and is in both [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Russia]]. Most of the Russian Republic of [[Kalmykia]] lies in the Caspian Depression.  The [[Volga River]] and the [[Ural River]] flow into the Caspian Sea through this region.  The deltas of the Ural and Volga Rivers are  extensive wetlands. The North Caspian depression is part of the [[Continental climate|continental]] or [[semi-arid]] desert [[biome]]. The area receives {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year, on average, and less than 10% of the region is irrigated. 

The Caspian Depression is below sea-level, consisting of large areas of  [[marshland]]s in the eastern region. It is one of the largest flat lowland areas in [[Central Asia]], covering approximately {{convert|200000|km²|abbr=on}}. The area is very rich in underground oil and gas reserves, and oil and natural gas pipelines cross the depression from north to south and east to west. Many geologists believe the Caspian Sea and the depression were formed by [[tectonic]] forces. Some of them also believe that the North Caspian depression became separated from the open ocean in ancient times to form an enormous salt lake. Part of the ancient [[Silk Road]] ran through this region. The two largest cities in the depression are [[Astrakhan]] in Russia, and [[Atyrau]] in Kazakhstan. Today, the region is used mainly for livestock raising.

The depression is also noted for [[salt dome]]s, particularly Volgograd salt. It increases dramatically as one travels from the [[Ryn Desert]] toward the Caspian Sea. Russian satellite photos have revealed huge deposits of salt domes (about 1,200), in the Caspian Depression in western Kazakhstan. One dome, called the [[Chelkar Deposit]], covers an area of {{convert|3237|km²|abbr=on}} and is nearly {{convert|8|km|0}} deep.

The southern region of the depression, or the north coast of the Caspian Sea, is characterized by large development of damp sites resulting from [[tidal]] phenomena. The depression is also home to a large number of [[insect]] [[species]], with several thousand different species likely living in the region around the Caspian Sea. Studies have shown that [[water pollution]], mostly coming from the Volga River, poses a serious threat to the [[biodiversity]] of the Caspian Depression. Water pollution is contributed mainly by [[Industry|industrial]], [[agricultural]], and household discharges.

Chott Melrhir is separated from the nearby Chott Meorouane, which lies south-west, by a stripe of permanently dry land which can be as narrow as 4 kilometers in some places.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt; The bottom of the lake is mostly composed of [[gypsum]] and mud and is covered in salt in summer. The lake emits a garlic-like odor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uzgVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 ''The Annals and Magazine of Natural History: Including Zoology, Botany, and Geology''], Taylor and Francis (1871) p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; Although the dry soil in and around the lake appears arable, it is nearly barren due to the high concentration of salt. For the same reason, the soil absorbs much condensation overnight that keeps it partly humid during much of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Woodward [https://books.google.com/books?id=wYcPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA28 ''Geological Magazine'', Volume 1], Cambridge University Press., 1864, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
[[File:Houbara035.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Houbara bustard]]]]
The climate in the Chott Melrhir is hot and arid with high evaporation and low precipitation. The average lowest and highest temperatures are 11.4 and 34.2&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively, and the minimum temperature is about 0&amp;nbsp;°C. Annual precipitation is below 160&amp;nbsp;mm. The winds have a speed between 2.7 and 5.3&amp;nbsp;m/s and are mostly directed south-east between June and September and north-west between autumn and early spring. [[Dust storm|Sandstorms]] are more frequent in winter and late summer and last 39 days per year on average.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The shallow waters of the lake contain scarce vegetation composed of 72 species of plants which have adapted to salty water, such as Parish's glasswort (''[[Arthrocnemum subterminale]]''), sea lavender (''[[Limonium]]''), rushes (''[[Juncus]]''), glasswort (''[[Salicornia]]''), ''[[Sarcocornia]]'', bulrush (''[[Scirpus]]'') and seepweeds (''[[Suaeda]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">A '''connector''' is a [[highway]] or [[freeway]] road that connects to another highway or freeway. It can be part of an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] such as the [[MacArthur Maze]] or a longer roadway such as the {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[Interstate 635 (Kansas–Missouri)|Interstate 635]].

A '''connector route''' is a type of [[special route]] or supplemental route in the [[United States]] that serves as a connector, connecting one route to a more prominent route. Connector routes are found among the [[United States Numbered Highways]] and among some [[state route]] systems like [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|Michigan]] and [[List of Nebraska Connecting Link, Spur, and Recreation Highways|Nebraska]].

Connector routes can also be designated as a routing between two numbered highways. Examples include:
* [[M-44 (Michigan highway)|Connector M-44]], which runs along Plainfield Avenue between [[Interstate 96]] and [[M-44 (Michigan highway)|M-44]] north of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]].
* [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension]] (also known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector), which connects the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike#Delaware River extension|Delaware River extension]] of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].

[[Image:DoubleDig.gif|right|Double digging with spade and fork loosens the soil, to increase drainage and aeration.]]

'''Double digging''' is a [[gardening]] technique used to increase [[soil]] drainage and aeration. It involves the loosening of two layers of [[soil]], and the addition of organic matter. 

Double digging is typically done when cultivating soil in a new garden, or when deep top-soil is required. On poor or heavy soils, or for vegetable gardens, double digging might be required every 3–5 years. In other cases, double digging is only really needed on starting a new garden, or on total replanting.

First the top layer is dug off with a spade, forming a shallow trench, and then the under-layer (at the bottom of the trench) is dug with a fork. When breaking up the lower layer, organic matter such as [[compost]] is usually added to the soil. If the soil is in need of other minerals like [[gypsum]] or [[phosphorus]] this can also be added here. 

A second trench is then started, backfilling the first trench. This process is repeated until the whole bed has been treated. There will be soil left over from the first trench, which is used to fill the last trench.

Walking on top of the bed will crush/flatten it, so the gardener must be sure to protect the soil from too much foot traffic

In [[geomorphology]], '''drainage systems''', also known as '''river systems''', are the patterns formed by the [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s in a particular [[drainage basin]]. They are governed by the topography of the land, whether a particular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks, and the gradient of the land. [[Geomorphologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[hydrologist]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s often view streams as being part of drainage basins. A drainage basin is the [[Topography|topographic]] region from which a stream receives [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[throughflow]], and [[groundwater flow]]. The number, size, and shape of the drainage basins found in an area vary and the larger the [[topographic map]], the more information on the drainage basin is available.&lt;ref name="physicalgeography.net"&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/10aa.html Pidwirny, M., (2006). "The Drainage Basin Concept". ''Fundamentals of Physical Geography,'' 2nd Edition.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drainage patterns==
According to the configuration of the [[Channel (geography)|channels]], drainage systems can fall into one of several categories known as drainage patterns. Drainage patterns depend on the [[topography]] and [[geology]] of the land.&lt;ref name="uwsp.edu"/&gt;

=== Accordant drainage patterns ===
A drainage system is described as accordant if its pattern correlates to the structure and relief of the landscape over which it flows.&lt;ref name="uwsp.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Dendritic Drainage pattern.jpg|thumb|left|Dendritic drainage patterns]]

====Dendritic drainage pattern====
Dendritic drainage systems (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|δενδρίτης}}, ''dendrites'', "of or parallel to a tree") are not straight and are the most common form of drainage system. In a dendritic system, there are many contributing streams (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which are then joined together into the [[tributaries]] of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They develop where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain. Dendritic systems form in [[V-shaped valley]]s; as a result, the rock types must be [[impervious]] and [[non-porous]].&lt;ref name=fieldguide&gt;{{cite book| last = Lambert| first = David| title = The Field Guide to Geology| publisher = Checkmark Books| year = 1998| pages =130&amp;ndash;131| isbn = 0-8160-3823-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parallel drainage pattern.jpg|thumb|right|Parallel drainage pattern]]

====Parallel drainage pattern====
A parallel drainage system is a pattern of rivers caused by steep slopes with some [[Terrain|relief]]. Because of the steep slopes, the streams are swift and straight, with very few tributaries, and all flow in the same direction. This system forms on uniformly sloping surfaces, for example, rivers flowing southeast from the [[Aberdare Mountains]] in Kenya.

Parallel drainage patterns form where there is a pronounced slope to the surface. A parallel pattern also develops in regions of parallel, elongate landforms like outcropping resistant rock bands. Tributary streams tend to stretch out in a parallel-like fashion following the slope of the surface. A parallel pattern sometimes indicates the presence of a major fault that cuts across an area of steeply folded bedrock. All forms of transitions can occur between parallel, dendritic, and trellis patterns.

====Trellis drainage pattern====
The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] used to grow vines. As the river flows, along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into it from the steep slopes on the sides of mountains. These tributaries enter the main river at approximately 90 degree angle, causing a trellis-like appearance of the drainage system. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in North America and in the north part of [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="uwsp.edu"&gt;[http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html Ritter, Michael E., ''The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography.'' 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rectangular.png|thumb|right|Rectangular drainage pattern]]

====Rectangular drainage pattern====
Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to [[erosion]], but which have two directions of [[Joint (geology)|joining]] at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.&lt;ref name="uwsp.edu"/&gt; This pattern can be found with the [[Arun River, China–Nepal|Arun River]] in Nepal.

[[File:Radial.png|thumb|left|Radial drainage pattern]]

====Radial drainage pattern====
In a radial drainage system, the streams radiate outwards from a central high point. [[Volcanos]]  usually display excellent radial drainage. They can sometimes also be found on tops of mountains. Other geological features on which radial drainage commonly develops are [[Dome (geology)|domes]] and [[laccolith]]s. On these features the drainage may exhibit a combination of radial  patterns. The radical pattern develops when streams flow in different directions from a central peak or dome like structure. In India the [[Amarkantak]] range shows the best example of radial drainage pattern.

====Centripetal drainage pattern====
The centripetal drainage system is similar to the radial drainage system, with the only exception that [https://s3.amazonaws.com/classconnection/602/flashcards/7102602/gif/centripetal_drainage_pattern_-150F745643C3823DD4A.gif radial drainage flows out versus centripetal drainage flows in].

====Deranged drainage pattern====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lake]] --&gt;
A deranged drainage system is a drainage system in [[drainage basin]]s where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes. It happens in areas where there has been much geological disruption. The classic example is the [[Canadian Shield]]. During the last [[ice age]], the [[topsoil]] was scraped off, leaving mostly bare rock. The melting of the glaciers left land with many irregularities of elevation and a great deal of water to collect in the low points, explaining the large number of lakes which are found in [[Canada]]. The drainage basins are young and are still sorting themselves out. Eventually the system will stabilize.&lt;ref name="physicalgeography.net"/&gt;

[[File:Annular.png|thumb|right|Annular drainage pattern]]

====Annular drainage pattern====

In an annular drainage pattern streams follow a roughly circular or concentric path along a belt of weak rock, resembling in plan a ringlike pattern. It is best displayed by streams draining a maturely dissected [[structural dome]] or [[structural basin|basin]] where erosion has exposed rimming [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] strata of greatly varying degrees of hardness, as in the [[Red Valley (South Dakota)|Red Valley]], which nearly encircles the domal structure of the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]].

==== Angular drainage pattern ====

Angular drainage patterns form where [[bedrock]] joints and faults intersect at more acute angles than rectangular drainage patterns. Angles are both more and less than 90 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Don J (1969). Chapter 7, Origins of Stream Valleys and Drainage Patterns.  ''Principles of Geomorphology''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. pp. 148-153. {{ISBN|0-07-018780-0}} (this author defines dendritic, trellis, rectangular, angular, radial, annular, centripetal and parallel drainage patterns)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discordant drainage patterns===
A drainage pattern is described as discordant if it does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: ''[[Antecedent drainage stream|antecedent]]'' and ''superimposed'',&lt;ref name="uwsp.edu"/&gt; while ''anteposition'' drainage patterns combine the two. In ''antecedent'' drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. ''Superimposed'' drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Spokane, Washington]], Nellis was raised in [[Western Montana|northwestern]] [[Montana]] and graduated from [[Libby High School]] {{nowrap|in 1972.&lt;ref name=lhsgrd&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewesternnews.com/education/article_cc7f174e-a146-11e2-9a39-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=story|newspaper=The Western News |location=[[Libby, Montana|Libby, MT]]|title=LHS grad to lead Texas Tech |first=Alan Lewis |last=Gerstenecker |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He attended  [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and earned a bachelor's degree in earth sciences/[[geography]] in 1976. Nellis went to  graduate school at [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], earning a master's in geography in 1977 and a Ph.D. in geography {{nowrap|in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ttu.edu/administration/president/biography.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrtksap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/K/5/pub5851.html|publisher=Science Blog|title=M.

==Academic career==
After graduate school, Nellis has worked for over 30 years in various progressive administrative roles at [[Kansas State University]], [[West Virginia University]], [[University of Idaho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography/faculty/duanenellis |title=Duane Nellis - Department of Geography, University of Idaho |publisher=[[University of Idaho]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302100050/http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/geography/faculty/duanenellis |archivedate=2 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Texas Tech University]].&lt;ref name=TTUPres&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ttu.edu/administration/president/biography.php |title=Texas Tech University :: Office of the President |publisher=[[Texas Tech University]] |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and most recently at Ohio University. At Kansas State, Nellis was a department head, associate dean, and after returning from West Virginia (where he served as dean of the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences), served as [[provost (education)|provost]] and senior vice president from 2004 until his departure for the university presidency at Idaho in 2009. He later became president of Texas Tech in June 2013, then most recently became president of Ohio University in 2017.

Nellis' research has focused on [[geographic information systems]] and remote sensing, and he is internationally recognized for his work in this area, including receiving numerous university, national and international teaching, research and advising awards, and serving as president {{nowrap|(2002–2003)}} of the [[American Association of Geographers|Association of American Geographers]],&lt;ref name=TTUPres/&gt; president of the [[National Council for Geographic Education]] {{nowrap|(1993–1994),}} and president of [[Gamma Theta Upsilon]], the international honor geographical society {{nowrap|(1999–2000).}}

===University of Idaho===
Nellis arrived at the University of Idaho in [[Moscow, Idaho|Moscow]] in 2009 and led a major $225 million capital campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uidaho.edu/inspire |title=Inspiring Futures: Invest in the University of Idaho |publisher=[[University of Idaho]] |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and oversaw over $80 million in campus facility improvements. He created the President’s Diversity Council, enhanced what became a nationally award-winning engagement effort through creation of the Office for Community Partnerships, improved major inter-disciplinary initiatives, and significantly improved business partnerships between the university and business and commodity groups in Idaho and throughout the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;Report to the Board of Regents, April 2013 (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;

As UI president, Nellis was a member of the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] Presidential Oversight Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Idaho president Duane Nellis on college football playoff |first=Andy |last=Staples |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/andy_staples/03/08/idaho-nellis-playoff/index.html |newspaper=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=8 March 2012 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nationally recognized higher education leader, he has served as a commissioner for the Northwest Commission of Colleges and Universities (one of 8 nationally recognized accreditation bodies).&lt;ref name=NWCCU&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwccu.org/About/Commissioners/NWCCU%20Commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=[[NWCCU]] |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as a Governor-appointed commissioner of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, which coordinates higher education efforts for the 15 western states, and has been involved in various national committees for the [[Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities]] (APLU).&lt;ref name=WICHE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiche.edu/newscap/14399 |title=New Commissioners |publisher=[[WICHE]] |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Texas Tech University===
Nellis was announced as the sole finalist for the presidency of [[Texas Tech University]] on March 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Duane Nellis named sole finalist for Texas Tech presidency |first=Brittany |last=Hoover |url=http://lubbockonline.com/education/2013-03-01/duane-nellis-named-sole-finalist-texas-tech-presidency |newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to news reports, he was recruited for the position, and had not applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nellis moseying to Texas Tech |first=Brandon |last=Macz |url=http://dnews.com/local/article_ae12df30-3d96-579d-9c5c-8140d555a716.html |newspaper=[[Moscow-Pullman Daily News]] |date=2 March 2013 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 22, the Texas Tech Board of Regents unanimously confirmed him as the university's next president, starting June 15.&lt;ref name=Hoover&gt;{{cite news |title=M.

During his presidency in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Nellis promoted moving Texas Tech University forward toward higher levels of national prominence as a major public research university. He has advocated for continued quality enrollment growth (including stronger advocacy for national and international student recognition), accelerated research expenditures and faculty recognitions, creating a more engaged institution while promoting industry and community partnerships, with a commitment toward global connections and creativity while seeking external revenue sources to invest in the university enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.ttu.edu/2013/12/inauguration-celebrates-president-nellis-texas-tech-future/ |title=Inauguration Celebrates President Nellis, Texas Tech Future |publisher=Texas Tech Today |accessdate= 3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Nellis' leadership, Texas Tech was named in 2014 an APLU Innovation and Economic Prosperity University. Texas Tech also achieved Tier One Carnegie Designation for the highest research category at the conclusion of his presidential term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://today.ttu.edu/posts/2016/02/tier-one-carnegie-designation|title = Texas Tech achieves Tier One Carnegie Designation|last = Cook|first = Chris|date = February 2, 2016|work = Texas Tech Today|access-date = February 15, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a candidacy for the presidency at the [[University of Wyoming]] in [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], during which he expressed frustration about Texas Tech's governance structure, Nellis announced his resignation from the Texas Tech presidency on January 8, 2016.&lt;ref name=Resign&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Mathew|title=Texas Tech University President Duane Nellis Stepping Down|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2016/01/08/texas-tech-university-president-duane-nellis-stepp/|publisher=Texas Tribune|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university later announced that he would continue on as a tenured university honors professor and work on university strategic initiatives. From {{nowrap|2014–2017,}} Nellis was a trustee of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.

=== Ohio University ===
In 2017, Nellis was announced as the next president of [[Ohio University]] on February 22,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Former Texas Tech president named to lead Ohio University|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170222/former-texas-tech-president-named-to-lead-ohio-university}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his presidency began on June 12 in [[Athens, Ohio|Athens]]. 
&lt;!--
At Ohio University, Dr. Nellis is committed to advancing the University's academic mission and outreach, while enhancing diversity and inclusion, academic success, global studies, effective integration of the OHIO for Ohio network (including regional partnerships), and a nationally recognized living/learning laboratory for sustainability. --&gt;

'''Engineering controls''' are strategies designed to protect workers from [[Occupational hazard|hazardous conditions]] by placing a barrier between the worker and the hazard or by removing a hazardous substance through air [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/engcontrols/|title=NIOSH Directory of Engineering Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roelofs2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4lTEuFWtdIC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Preventing Hazards at the Source|first=Cora|date=1 January 2007|publisher=[[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]|year=|isbn=978-1-931504-83-6|location=|pages=9ff|author=Roelofs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Engineering controls involve a physical change to the workplace itself, rather than relying on workers' behavior or requiring workers to wear protective clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering controls is the third of five members of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s, which orders control strategies by their feasibility and effectiveness. Engineering controls are preferred over [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) because they are designed to remove the hazard at the source, before it comes in contact with the worker. Well-designed engineering controls can be highly effective in protecting workers and will typically be independent of worker interactions to provide this high level of protection. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than the cost of administrative controls or PPE, but over the longer term, operating costs are frequently lower, and in some instances, can provide a cost savings in other areas of the process.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-30}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hazard elimination|Elimination]] and [[Hazard substitution|substitution]] are usually considered to be separate levels of hazard controls, but in some schemes they are categorized as types of engineering control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|title=Hazard Identification, Elimination and Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Sciences Association of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314062833/https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5588">An '''extreme environment''' contains conditions that are hard to survive for most known [[life form]]s. These conditions may be extremely high or low [[temperature]] or [[pressure]]; high or low content of [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]]; high levels of [[radiation]], [[acidity]], or [[alkalinity]]; absence of water; water containing a high concentration of salt or sugar; presence of [[sulphur]], [[petroleum]], and other [[toxic]] substances.

Examples of extreme environments include the [[geographical pole]]s, very arid [[deserts]], [[volcano]]es, deep [[ocean trench]]es, [[upper atmosphere]], [[Mt Everest]], [[outer space]], and the environments of every [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]] except the [[Earth]]. Any organisms living in these conditions are often very well adapted to their living circumstances, which is usually a result of long-term evolution. Physiologists have long known that organisms living in extreme environments are especially likely to exhibit clear examples of evolutionary adaptation because of the presumably intense past natural selection they have experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Jr., T., and P. A. Carter. 1994. Evolutionary physiology. Annual Review of Physiology 56:579–621.&lt;/ref&gt;

==On Earth==
The distribution of extreme environments on [[Earth]] has varied through [[geological time]]. Humans generally do not inhabit extreme environments. There are organisms referred to as [[extremophile]]s that do live in such conditions and are so well-adapted that they readily grow and multiply.

==Beyond Earth==
Most of the moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] are also extreme environments. [[Astrobiology|Astrobiologists]] have not yet found life in any environments beyond Earth, though experiments have shown that [[tardigrades]] can survive the harsh vacuum and intense radiation of outer space. The conceptual modification of  conditions in locations beyond Earth, to make them more habitable by humans and other terrestrial organisms, is known as [[terraforming]].

==Types==
Among extreme environments are [[alkaline]], [[acidic]], extremely cold, extremely hot, [[hyper-saline]], places without water or [[oxygen]], and places altered by humans, such as mine [[tailings]] or oil impacted habitats.

* Alkaline: broadly conceived as natural [[habitats]] above pH 9 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Acidic: broadly conceived as natural habitats below pH 5 whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time.
* Extremely cold: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently below -17&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes montane sites, polar sites, and deep ocean habitats.
* Extremely hot: broadly conceived habitats periodically or consistently in excess of 40&amp;nbsp;°C either persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes sites with [[geological thermal]] influences such as Yellowstone and comparable locations worldwide or deep-sea vents.
* Hypersaline: (high salt) environments with salt concentrations greater than that of seawater, that is, &gt;3.5%. Includes salt lakes.
* Under pressure: broadly conceived as habitats under extreme hydrostatic pressure — i.e. aquatic habitats deeper than 2000 meters and enclosed habitats under pressure. Includes habitats in oceans and deep lakes.
* Radiation: broadly conceived as habitats exposed to abnormally high [[radiation]] or of radiation outside the normal range of light. Includes habitats exposed to high UV and IR radiation.
* Without water: broadly conceived as habitats without free water whether persistently, or with regular frequency or for protracted periods of time. Includes hot and cold desert environments, and some endolithic habitats.
* Without oxygen: broadly conceived as habitats without free oxygen - whether persistently, or with regular frequency, or for protracted periods of time. Includes habitats in deeper sediments.
* Altered by humans, i.e. anthropogenically impacted habitats. Includes mine tailings, oil impacted habitats, and pollution by [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or [[organic compound]]s.

{{Unreferenced|date=September 2011}}
A '''federal district''' is a type of [[administrative division]] of a [[federation]], usually under the direct control of a federal government and organized sometimes with a single municipal body. Federal districts often include [[Capital districts and territories|capital district]]s, and they exist in various countries worldwide.

==United States==
The [[seat of government|seat]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] is located in a federal district called the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]. Other federally administered areas that are within one of the 50 [[U. S. state|state]]s, but not under its jurisdiction are called [[federal enclave]]s.

Additionally, the [[federal judiciary of the United States|U.S. federal court system]] divides each state, the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]], into one or more [[United States federal judicial district|federal judicial districts]]. A [[United States district court]] and a [[United States bankruptcy court|bankruptcy court]] are located in each. There are also regional [[United States federal judicial circuits|federal judicial circuits]], each consisting of a group of states (except for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|District of Columbia Circuit]], which consists of the federal district, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]], whose jurisdiction is based on specific subject matter instead of geography); Puerto Rico and the [[United States territorial court]]s are also assigned to circuits. Each circuit has a [[United States court of appeals]].

==Latin America==
The term ''Distrito Federal'', meaning ''Federal District'' in both [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], is used to refer to:
* [[Federal District (Brazil)]], where the Brazilian capital [[Brasília]] is located.
* [[Buenos Aires|Federal Capital (Argentina)]], formally ''Autonomous City of Buenos Aires'', since 1994.
* [[Mexico City#Federal District|Federal District (Mexico)]], an alternative official term for [[Mexico City]] until January 2016.
* [[Capital District (Venezuela)]], where the Venezuelan capital of Caracas sits.

==Africa==
The [[Federal Capital Territory]], commonly known as FCT, or loosely as FCT-Abuja, is a federal territory in central Nigeria. [[Abuja]], the capital city of [[Nigeria]], is located in this territory. FCT was formed in 1976 from parts of the states of Nasarawa, Niger and Kogi. It is within in the Middle Belt region of the country. It is administered by the [[Federal Capital Territory Administration]], headed by a minister appointed by the President.

==South and Southeast Asia==
In [[Malaysia]], the term [[Federal Territory (Malaysia)|Federal Territory]] (Malay: ''Wilayah Persekutuan)'' is used for the three territories governed directly by the federal government, namely [[Kuala Lumpur]] (national capital), [[Putrajaya]] (federal government administrative centre) and [[Labuan]] (international [[offshore financial centre]]).

In [[India]], the term [[Union Territory]] is used for the seven territories governed directly by the [[Government of India|federal national government]] with its own [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief minister]] and [[Governors of states of India|Governor]]. They include — [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], [[Daman and Diu]], [[Delhi]], [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Puducherry]]. Of these Delhi and Puducherry possess partial state hoods with their own elected chief ministers.

In [[Pakistan]], the term Federal [[Territory (administrative division)|Territory]] is used for the five zones and 12 [[Union Councils of Pakistan|union councils of Islamabad]] governed directly by the state government as [[Islamabad Capital Territory]].

==Australia==
The [[Australian Capital Territory]] is an [[enclave]] within the state of [[New South Wales]]. Its only city is [[Canberra]], the capital of Australia.

==Russia==
[[Russia]] has [[Federal cities of Russia|three cities of federal significance]], established by the Constitution — [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Sevastopol]]( de facto part of Ukraine occupied by Russia). Each city is treated as a separate federal subject, and has its own legislative body.  Russia has [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], but these form an additional administrative layer between the federation government and the federal subjects, rather than being a distinct type of jurisdiction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9742">'''Garden sharing''' or  '''urban horticulture sharing''' is a [[local food]] and [[urban farming]] arrangement where a landowner allows a gardener access to land, typically a front or back [[yard (land)|yard]], in order to grow food.

This may be an informal, one-to-one relationship, but numerous Web-based projects exist to facilitate matchmaking. In some cases, garden sharing projects are launched as a way to shorten [[community garden]] waiting lists that are common in many cities.&lt;ref name="sharecropping"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/features/home/la-hm-share20-2009jun20,0,1628042.story Modern-day sharecropping] ''Los Angeles Times'', June 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bearsfruit"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/article/663813 Garden-sharing program bears fruit] ''The Star'', July 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Garden sharing arrangements take two main forms. The simplest is an agreement between two parties: one supplies the land, the other supplies the labour, and the proceeds are shared. In larger collaborations, groups, often neighbours, share garden spaces, labour and the harvest.&lt;ref name="structure"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/environment/index.ssf/2009/06/like_an_eager_vine_urban_garde.html Like an eager vine, urban garden sharing spreads its roots] ''The Oregonian'', June 04, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifics addressed by a garden sharing agreement are potentially numerous, and the contract itself may be simple or exhaustive. Issues to be considered include terms of access, acceptable behavior, and who supplies what as far as gardening equipment and supplies. At one end of the scale, a verbal arrangement may be all that is expected.&lt;ref name="agreements1"&gt;[http://www.urbangardenshare.org/?p=about_gardens "Growing Relations"] Urban Garden Share, US&lt;/ref&gt; However, garden sharing organisations often suggest a written agreement and supply sample contracts.&lt;ref name="agreements2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6utl5IWTV6QC&amp;pg=PT271&amp;lpg=PT271&amp;dq=garden+sharing+agreement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_pJoRY-0Lp&amp;sig=wUOkRDsbBcEMo0yXrMGeoEsxags&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eUJvSqzBIZLqMd62tOAI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''The Sharing Solution''] by Emily Doskow, Janelle Orsi pp. 259-262 (Nolo, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharecroppercontract"&gt;[http://www.gazette.com/articles/sacramento-55473-binds-sharecropper.html 'Sharecropper contract' binds landowner, gardener] by Cathy Locke.

==Garden sharing projects==
The Web is frequently used as a platform for initiating garden sharing arrangements. Web sites connecting landowners and growers are generally free and non-commercial. Web sites are instituted by a variety of parties, including private individuals, government agencies, and non-profit groups.

===North America===
A number of local, regional and national programs exist across the U.S. and Canada, including:

*Yardsharing.org of [[Portland, Oregon]], is a free online service devoted to connecting renters with landowners, with the goal of creating food for all. The website, created in 2007 by Joshua Patterson, resulted from a local media campaign to find relief for the Portland Community Gardens Program.&lt;ref name=sharecropping /&gt;
*Hyperlocavore.com is a free, U.S.-based international service that matches garden owners with gardeners, and facilitates the set-up of neighbourhood produce exchanges and other sharing projects.&lt;ref name=sharecropping /&gt;
*[http://www.alfrea.com/ Alfrea.com] was built to help landowners and gardeners connect. Think of it as your Marketplace for Land Sharing, Garden Services, and connecting you to Fresh Local food.

*[https://sharedearth.com SharedEarth.com] is a website that connects people who have land, with people who want to garden or farm.

===Europe===
In the UK, Landshare is a high-profile national garden sharing project in England, spearheaded by [[celebrity chef]] and TV personality [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]], in conjunction with public-service broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Linda|title=Garden sharing: growing your own vegetables on someone else's patch|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/02/garden-sharing-growing-vegetables|website=The Guardian|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growers, landowners and volunteers can, at no charge, register their interest in participating in a share in their area. There are over 40,000 members. Although this is a number that have registered since 2009 when the social enterprise was first publicized widely, since then its activity has decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislincolnshire.co.uk/news/share-garden/article-787024-detail/article.html Garden sharing scheme to fight credit crunch]. thisislincolnshire.co.uk (''Lincolnshire Echo'').

The charity aims to promote locally grown food and the skills of doing so with supporting [http://stories.rbge.org.uk/archives/tag/edinburgh-garden-partners older and disabled people] who can no longer manage their garden.

In France, Prêter son jardin ("Garden lending") is a garden sharing web site started by a journalist in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preter son Jardin|url=http://www.pretersonjardin.com/|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Geomessaging''' is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/ITST.2012.6425228|title=2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications|pages=497–501|year=2012|last1=Fujioka|first1=Masanobu|last2=Takahashi|first2=Masanori|last3=Matsumura|first3=Takeshi|last4=Chunmeng Wang|last5=Hirakoba|first5=Hiroyuki|isbn=978-1-4673-3070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions can be created by using [[Geo-fence|geofences]], based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device  will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).

Rules can be: The minimum time to wait before resending a message, weekday, time range, etc.

The content of the message associated to those rules can be any images, text, html, metadata key-value pair, etc.

Increasingly geomessaging is finding its use in various applications including crisis communication and geo-location sensitive communication management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-events-venue.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Events and Venue Crisis and Incident Management |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomessage Media==
Geomessage Media defines a [[Media (communication)|media]] genre where information or messages can be sent to recipients based on their location. Platforms that enable geo-notifications to a defined [[geo-fence]] would fall into the category of Geomessage Media. A geo-fence is a virtual radius or polygon defined by longitude and latitude coordinates on a map. Geofences are being used for a vast array of applications and services like reminder applications based on area, location sharing and localized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loyola L, Wong F, Pereira D ''et al.''|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems - MobiGIS '13|pages=51–58|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534193|publisher=MobiGIS13| date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|doi=10.1145/2534190.2534193|isbn=9781450325318|chapter=Extending battery lifetime of mobile devices with geofence capabilities on dynamic-speed urban environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomessage Media is a natural progression of information sent on Mass Media and Social Media. Geomessage Media platforms allow communicating or sending a geomessage to a hyper-local area. This allows for much more relevant, geo-contextual information to be sent. In some use cases the platforms allow messaging to an anonymised group, in a defined geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shephertz.com/2016/05/05/geo-fencing-push-notifications-next-step-user-engagement |title=Geo-fencing in Push Notifications: The Next Step in User Engagement |publisher=ShepHertz |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other use cases include sending messages to a geolocation where members of a known group may enter. 

Circumstances where a Geomessage would benefit recipients are many, for example:
* Evacuations – instructions can be given to a localised area or areas to evacuate
* Transport Management - Commuters can be sent advice and information that may delay their commute
* Weather – recipients in the path of a weather event can be notified
* Place of Interest – people entering, exiting or even dwelling in a place could be sent a message.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">[[Image:Chenal-beautemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in [[Velm]], Belgium, during a sunny day]]
A '''grassed waterway''' consists in a {{convert|2|m|ft|sing=on}} to 48-metre-wide (157 ft) native [[grassland]] strip of [[green belt]]. It is generally installed in the [[thalweg]], the deepest continuous line along a [[valley]] or [[watercourse]], of a cultivated dry valley in order to control [[erosion]]. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in [[Bavaria]] showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi-purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinctions==

Confusion between "grassed waterway" and "vegetative filter strips" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, [[buffer strip]] can be a [[synonym]], with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a [[riparian zone]].

== Runoff and erosion mitigation ==
[[Image:Chenal-mauvaistemps.jpg|right|thumb|Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm]]
[[Surface runoff|Runoff]] generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the [[thalweg]] where it can lead to rill or [[gully]] erosion.   

Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a [[muddy flood]]. 

In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008. A grassed waterway and earthen dams to control muddy floods from a cultivated catchment of the Belgian loess belt. Geomorphology  100, 419-428.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:JM''' is the entry for [[Jamaica]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Jamaica, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[parishes of Jamaica|14 parishes]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|JM}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Jamaica. The second part is two digits (01&amp;ndash;14). The codes are assigned in the 
counter-clockwise direction starting from [[Kingston Parish]].

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4198">'''La Canela''', the Valley of Cinnamon, is a legendary location in South America. As with [[El Dorado]], its legend grew out of expectations aroused by the voyage of Columbus. He had demonstrated to the satisfaction of his backers that gold and spices would be found as a result of his Atlantic crossing; since he himself found little of these commodities, the search on the American mainland continued.

In 1541, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] led an expedition east of [[Quito]] with [[Francisco de Orellana]] in search of ''The country of [[cinnamon]]'' ("País de la Canela"). The reason why they took this route was not explained in early narratives (at that time the existence of La Canela was still taken as fact, so no explanation seemed necessary). The reason became clear only on the publication of [[Pedro Cieza de León]]'s history, which remained in manuscript until 1871. According to Cieza de León, {{ill|Gonzalo Díaz de Pineda|es}} had recently returned from an exploration of the high Andes. He had found some trees with an aroma of cinnamon, and had understood his informants to say that there were more and better such trees under cultivation not far off to the east. It was these "cinnamon plantations" that Gonzalo hoped to find.&lt;ref&gt;Cieza de León, ''Guerra de Chupas'' chapter 18. The trees found by Pineda were probably of genus ''[[Ocotea]]'' (Dalby 2001 pp. 45-46).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Quito, Gonzalo was able to recruit 220 Spaniards and 4,000 Native Americans. The second-in-command, Orellana, was sent to [[Guayaquil]] to recruit more troops and horses. Gonzalo Pizarro and his followers left Quito on February 1541, a month before Orellana, who was able to bring 23 men and several horses. In March both met in the valley of ''Zumaco'' and started their march towards the crossing of the [[Andes]]. After following the courses of the [[Coca River|Coca]] and [[Napo River|Napo]] rivers, the expedition began to run out of provisions. By this time about 140 of the 220 Spaniards and 3,000 out of 4,000 natives had died. They built a boat, and in February 1542 decided that Orellana, along with 50 men, should continue sailing down the Napo in search of food for the whole party.

After vainly awaiting their return Gonzalo eventually admitted that the expedition was a failure. He decided to find a more northerly route back to Quito. He arrived there, two years after his departure, with only 80 surviving companions. Orellana, who never found any large supplies of food and had been unable to return upstream to rejoin the main party, continued down the [[Napo River|Rio Napo]] to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and became the first European to follow the great river all the way to its [[river delta|delta]].

The best sources for the expedition are the history of [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega|Garcilaso de la Vega, el Inca]] (Garcilaso grew up in the household of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and therefore heard his story at first hand) and the narrative of Orellana's chaplain [[Gaspar de Carvajal]], who took part in the navigation of the Amazon.

The '''Laurentian Upland''' (or '''Laurentian Highlands''') is a [[Physiographic regions of the world|physiographic region]] which, when referred to as the "Laurentian Region" or the [[Grenville Orogeny|Grenville geological province]], is recognized by [[Natural Resources Canada]] as one of five provinces of the larger [[Canadian Shield]] physiographic division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=The Atlas of Canada |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/physiographicregions/map.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-27 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216073515/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/english/maps/reference/anniversary_maps/physiographicregions/map.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] recognizes the Laurentian Upland as the larger general upland area of the Canadian Shield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/physio.xml Physiographic divisions of the conterminous U.

==Geography==

The Laurentian Region, as recognized by Natural Resources Canada, is part of the [[plateau]] and dissected southern rim of the Canadian Shield in the province of [[Québec]]. It is a western extension of the [[Laurentian Mountains]], and continues across the [[Ottawa Valley]] into Ontario as the [[Opeongo Hills]]. Viewed from the [[river valley|valleys]] of the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]s, the south-facing escarpments of the Shield give the appearance of mountains 500–800 meters high; looking across the plateau, the relief is more moderate and subdued. These scarps mark the dramatic southern edge of this Upland region, of which [[Mont Raoul Blanchard]] is the highest peak.
Although the other limits are less well defined, this Laurentian Region in Quebec may be considered to extend 100–200&amp;nbsp;km northward from the [[Escarpment|scarps]] and to stretch from the [[Gatineau River]] in the west (mean elevation 400 m) some 550&amp;nbsp;km to the [[Saguenay River]] in the northeast. Here it attains its maximum elevation north of [[Quebec City, Quebec|Quebec City]] in the [[Laurentides Wildlife Reserve|Réserve faunique des Laurentides]] (over 1000 m). Individual summits rise above the plateau surface: [[Mont Sir Wilfrid]] (783 m) and Mont Tremblant in the west, [[Mont Sainte-Anne]] (815 m) at Quebec, [[Mont Raoul Blanchard]] (1166 m), [[Mont Bleu]] (1052 m) and [[Mont des Conscrits]] (1006 m) in Réserve faunique des Laurentides. [[Cap Tourmente]] (579 m) and [[Mont des Éboulements]] (770 m) are dramatic examples of the scarp face as it drops precipitously to the St Lawrence River.

The more general Laurentian Upland Province may be considered to extend over a larger area of the Canadian Shield, into Northwestern [[Ontario]] and parts of Northern [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[New York State]], and is recognized by the [[United States Geological Survey]] to include the [[Superior Upland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/laurent.html USGS Geology in the Parks&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a southern extension of the Canadian Shield, the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of New York State might also be considered and extension of the Laurentian Upland.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Raisz, Physiographical Map of North America, in Espenshade, Edward B., Jr., and Joel L. Morrison, editors. Goode's World Atlas, 17th ed. Chicago: Rand McNally &amp; Co. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

The Laurentian Upland is primarily made up of ancient [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]], [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]], and [[sedimentary]] rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ojakangas |first=Richard W. | authorlink = |author2=Matsch, Charles L.  |title=Minnesota's Geology |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |pages=15 |isbn=0-8166-0953-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the river valleys and [[Lake|lacustrine]] basins, it is a rolling to mountainous [[peneplain]] that ranges from 800 to 1400 feet above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lajoie |first=Paul G. | authorlink = |title=Soil Survey of Gatineau and Pontiac Counties, Quebec |publisher=Canada Department of Agriculture |year=1962 |pages=14 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Superior Upland ==
[[File:US interior physiographic regions map.jpg|275px|thumb|right|[[United States physiographic region|Physiographic area]] map of the interior United States. The [[Superior Upland]] is identified by "1" on the map.]]
[[File:Brockway Mtn Cooper Harbor Michigan.JPG|thumb|275 px|right|[[Brockway Mountains]] of the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]], [[Michigan]] ([[Precambrian]] of the Keweenian Series)]]
The [[Superior Upland]] is the [[Physiographic Regions of the United States|province]] of the Laurentian Upland which projects into the United States west and south of [[Lake Superior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/laurent.html|title=USGS Geology and Geophysics|first=Dave|last=Frank|website=geomaps.wr.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This upland, part of the [[Canadian Shield]] along with the [[Adirondacks]], is a greatly deformed structure and is composed primarily of [[igneous rocks|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] crystalline rocks commonly associated with a rugged landscape. At some prehistoric period, this had a strong relief, but today the upland as a whole is gently rolling with the inter-streams surfaces being plateau-like in their evenness. Here they have altitudes of 1,400 to {{convert|2,300|ft|m}} in their higher areas, such as the [[Misquah Hills]] and [[Huron Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey. (various quadrangles) [maps]. 1:50,000. Washington D.C.: USGS, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In this province, we find a part of those ancient mountains regions that were initiated by crustal deformation and then reduced by a long continued erosion to a [[peneplain]] of modern relief. A peneplain with the occasional moderately high [[monadnock]]s left behind during the peneplanation of the rest of the surface. The erosion of the region must have been far advanced in prehistoric times, even practically completed, because the even peneplain surface is overlapped by fossiliferous marine strata from an early geological date, [[Cambrian]]. This shows that the depression of the region beneath an ancient sea took place after a long existence as dry land.&lt;ref&gt;Ojakangas, Richard W.; Matsch, Charles L. (1982). Minnesota's Geology. University of Minnesota Press, 15. {{ISBN|0-8166-0953-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of the submergence and the area over which the [[Palaeozoic]] strata were deposited are unknown. Because of the renewed elevation without deformation, erosion in later periods has stripped off an undetermined amount of the covering strata. The valleys by which the uplands are here and there trenched to moderate depth appear to be, in part at least, the work of streams that have been superposed upon the peneplain through the now removed cover of stratified rocks.

[[Glaciation]] has strongly scoured away the deeply weathered soils that presumably existed here in preglacial time. It left behind firm and rugged ledges in the low hills and swells of the ground and spread an irregular drift cover over the lower parts, whereby the drainage is generally disordered being deposited in lakes and swamps and elsewhere rushing down rocky rapids.

'''Legal education''' is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of [[law]]. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for [[Admission to practice law|admission to legal practice]] in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary [[Law degree|degrees in law]], which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as [[Master of Laws|masters]] and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* [[Continuing legal education]], which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of [[rhetoric]]. Around the third century BC [[Tiberius Coruncanius]] began teaching law as a separate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;George Long article, p. 655 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anqiquities'' by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (''jurisprudentes''), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. "legal education." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007  &lt;http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9106475&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oo-U8MDJVJAJ:www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteen century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Boon and Julian Webb, '[http://letr.org.uk/references/storage/U7RC3RR2/Boon%20%26%20Webb,%20back%20to%20the%20future.pdf Legal Education and Training in England and Wales: Back to the Future?]' (2008) 58(1) ''Journal of Legal Education'' 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of legal education ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===
[[File:Uppsala Gustavianum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gustavianum]]'', The Swedish [[Uppsala University]] built 1622–1625 and now a museum, was one of the pioneers in formal legal education]]
In many countries, including most of those in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the principal law degree is an [[undergraduate degree]], usually known as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country's equivalent of a [[bar exam]]. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the [[Law school in the United States|United States]], the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a [[bachelor's degree]]. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor's degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by [[law school]]s, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SSRN 3021333].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Law Society, [https://www.lawsociety.com.au/about/StudentHub/BecomingAdmitted/PLT/index.htm#1 'Practical Legal Training'], retrieved 8 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a [[barrister]] or as a [[solicitor]] are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
[[Continuing legal education]] (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

==Legal education in different countries==
{{Main article|Law school}}
===Australia===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Australia}}

In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. [[Bond University]] in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2{{fraction|2|3}} years. They also offer a JD in two years. The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111235355/http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[University of Melbourne]] introduced the [[Melbourne Model]], whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible.&lt;ref name="law.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php|publisher=Law.harvard.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for [[graduate entry|graduate-entry]] into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Australian Catholic University]], [[Australian National University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Bond University]], [[Macquarie Law School|Macquarie]], [[Monash University Faculty of Law|Monash]], [[Deakin University School of Law|Deakin]], [[UNSW Faculty of Law|UNSW]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[Adelaide Law School|Adelaide]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], [[Sydney Law School|Sydney]], [[Melbourne University Law School|Melbourne]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], the [[TC Beirne School of Law|University of Queensland]], the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Canberra]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Canada}}

The professional law degree in Canada is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), for [[common law]] jurisdictions, and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law]] for Quebec, a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction. Admittance to an LL.B. or J.D. program requires at least two years of [[undergraduate]] education, although, a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree|(bachelor's) degree]]. The change in academic [[nomenclature]] redesignating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—because it is the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2007/11/13/to-jd-or-not-to-jd/ To JD or Not JD — Law is Cool], November 13, 2007.

[[List of law schools in China]]

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Legal education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the [[Common Professional Examination]] conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) currently offered at the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU), [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and [[City University of Hong Kong]], before starting vocational training: a year's [[pupillage]] for [[barrister]]s or a two-year [[training contract]] for [[solicitor]]s.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===
{{Main article|Legal education in India}}
{{See also|Autonomous law schools in India|Common Law Admission Test|List of law schools in India}}

The [[Bar Council of India]] prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961], which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of [[Bachelor's degree]]. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the "licenza in diritto". There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies ([[Bologna process]]):
* first a license of law program (''Licence de droit''): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (''Master de droit''): two-year period
* Ph.D. in Law (''Doctorat en droit''): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized : public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in Law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student's grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the [[University of Tokyo]] Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically-dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|title=Legal Education and the Reproduction of the Elite in Japan, 1 Asian-Pac. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 2|year=1999|publisher=Hawaii.edu|author=Setsuo Miyazawa|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081700/http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the implementation of the "law school system" in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized "cram schools" trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]]. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, [[legal research]]. During this period, the most "capable trainees" are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school {{nihongo|law schools|法科大学院|hōka daigakuin}} that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from "elite" Japanese universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]] or [[Hitotsubashi University]]. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (''[[benrishi]]''), tax accountants (''[[zeirishi]]''), [[scrivener]]s, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys ("bengoshi"), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
{{Main article|Law school in Korea}}

Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized "private educational institutes" exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the [[Judicial Research and Training Institute]] of the [[Supreme Court of Korea]]. During this period, the most capable trainees are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (''법학전문대학원''). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government's approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (''변리사''), tax attorneys (''세무사''), [[solicitor]]s(''법무사''), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|Legal education in Malaysia}}
As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Malaysian Higher School Certificate]], [[A-Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]], Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]] that include [[Sharia]] or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/programmes-courses/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-law-llb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuha.unisza.edu.my/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072652/http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the Philippines}}
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the LEGAL EDUCATION BOARD, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals.  Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino.  Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education.  The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University.  The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law.  Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
[[Law degree]] – jurist (often compared to an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and [[Ukraine]] after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor's or master's degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor's – master's) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the [[Bologna accords]]. See also [[academic degree]]. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor's degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master's degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master's degree.

=== Serbia ===
{{See also|History of legal education in Serbia|University of Belgrade Faculty of Law}}

To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. Studies last for five years (ten semesters) in accordance to the [[Bologna process|Bologna Convention]]. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. Students are divided into full-time students and part-time students. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international [[moot court]] competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a [[prosecutor]].

Since 1998, LL.B. programmes may be entered directly at the [[undergraduate]] level; at the same time, the LLB. continues to be offered [[postgraduate]] and may then be accelerated dependent on the [[bachelor's degree]]. The programme lasts between two and four years correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726092702/http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm |date=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Legal education#Australia|Australia, above]]).  See [[Bachelor of Laws #South Africa]].

Although not formally required for specialised practice, further training, e.g. [[Master of Science in Taxation|in tax]], is usually via [[postgraduate diploma]]s or focused, coursework-based [[LL.M.]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/south-africa |title=Master of Laws (LL.M.) Programs in South Africa |publisher=Llm Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research degrees are the [[LL.M.]] and [[LL.D.]], or [[PhD]] depending on university. The Master's [[dissertation]] reflects an ability to conduct independent research, whereas the Doctoral [[thesis]] will, in addition, constitute an original contribution to the field of law in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/law/docs/LLM_LLD_A5brochure_2010_v2.pdf |title=School of Law LLM and LLD Degrees |publisher=Unisa.ac.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctorate, generally, is required for positions in legal [[academia]]. See [[Master of Laws #South Africa]]; [[Doctor of Law #South Africa]].

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practice as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or [[magistrate]] in the [[South African Law#Court System in South Africa|lower courts]], but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practice as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Law_DoL_Report.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For admission as an attorney, one serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for two years, and then writes a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. See [[Attorneys in South Africa]]. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]].

Attorneys may additionally qualify as [[Notary public|Notaries]] and [[Conveyancer]]s, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssalead.org.za/upload/CONVEYANCING%20COURSE%20AND%20NOTARIAL%20PRACTICE%20COURSE%202012%20v7.pdf |title=Courses in Conveyancing and Notarial Practice |publisher=Lssalead.org.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys – see [[Patent attorney #South Africa]].

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate "of proven experience and skill" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a "silk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=A Career at the Bar in South Africa – The General Council of the Bar (GCB) |publisher=Sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Advocates in South Africa]].

The Act regulating admission to practice law ("The Qualifications of Legal Practitioners Amendment Act of 1997") is being revised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615033823/http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm |date=June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South American countries ===
{{Main article|Law in South America}}
The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

=== Sri Lanka ===
{{main|Legal education in Sri Lanka}}
In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be 'admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]]. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an [[LL.B.]] (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Jaffna]], [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] and [[University of Peradeniya]]) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don't hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a [[Graduate Diploma in Law]] where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a [[barrister]], [[legal executive]], or [[solicitor]]. [[Bar Professional Training Course]] is regarded as one of the hardest degrees and presently it is the most expensive law-related degree.

===United States===
[[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[William &amp; Mary School of Law]], established in 1779, is the oldest law school in the USA]]
{{Main article|Legal education in the United States|Law school in the United States}}
{{See also|Law School Admission Council}}

The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a [[law school]] program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt; http://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readerrules.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state's bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States,in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), a [[Doctoral]] degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a [[bachelor's degree]]). The law school program is considered to be a [[professional school]] program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves "doctor").

Research degrees that are awarded include the [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional [[Law clerk#United States|judicial clerkship]] (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, he or she is expected to pursue [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the [[bar association|bar]] vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

At the higher administrative level, [[Belarus]] is divided into 6 ''[[voblast]]s'' (usually translated as ''[[region]]s'' or ''[[province]]s'') and one [[municipality]] (''horad'', i.e., "city"); the latter one is a special status of the capital of Belarus.

'''Machakheli''' ({{lang-ka|მაჭახელი}}, ''Mač’axeli''; {{lang-tr|Maçahel}}) is a historical geographical area in [[Adjara]] and long valley along the river [[Machakhlistskali]] between [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. There are 23 settled villages in this valley. For its ecology, flora and fauna, as well as cultural importance, both the Turkish and Georgian segments of the valley are protected by the respective governments.

== History ==
Machakheli, also archaically known as Michikhiani (მიჭიხიანი), had been part of the [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian kingdom]] until its fragmentation in the late 15th century. Then it passed to the semi-independent princes of [[Samtskhe atabegate|Samtskhe]] (also known effectively as Saatabago (საათაბაგო) for the rule of [[atabeg]]s from the [[House of Jaqeli|Jaqeli]] family), who submitted to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] in 1479.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=İnalcık|first=Halil |authorlink=Halil İnalcık|title=Mehmed the Conqueror (1432–1481) and His Time|journal=Speculum|date=July 1960|volume=35|issue=3|page=425|doi=10.2307/2849734}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman administration is not attested until the 1570s. In 1563 the ruler of Machakheli, probably of the [[Shalikashvili]] clan, converted to Islam and joined the Ottoman ranks under the name of Lagvesh Ahmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://e-magaza.ttk.gov.tr/switch.php?file=ProductInfo&amp;cat_id=90&amp;product_id=1741 |title=The Georgia–Turkish Frontiers in the Late Medieval Centuries |last=Alasaniya |first=Giuli |authorlink=Giuli Alasania | date=2002 |publisher= Kenan Matbaası|booktitle= XIII. Türk Tarih Kongresi 2002 (III. Cilt I. Kýsým), Ankara, 4–8 Ekim 1999|page=169 |location=Ankara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ottoman subdivision, Maçahel was a sub-district of the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Nigali valley|Livâne]].&lt;ref&gt;Aktsoglou, Iakovos Z. (2007), "Population in the Province of Trabzon (Vilayet-i Trabzon) According to the Yearbook (Salname) of 1286/1869-70", pp. 15, 34. in: Kolovos, Elias et al (eds., 2010), ''The Ottoman Empire, the Balkans, the Greek lands: toward a social and economic history: studies in honor of John C. Alexander''. Gorgias Press &amp; The Isis Press, {{ISBN|978-1-61719-099-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area gained particular fame for its production of [[musket]]s nicknamed ''Machakhela'' from the late 18th to the mid-19th centuries. Machakheli came sporadically under the control of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] during her numerous wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the implementation of the new [[Treaty_of_Kars|Turkish-Soviet]] and [[Treaty_of_Kars#Georgia_and_Adjara|Turkish-Georgian border in 1921]], Machakheli was divided between two nations.

== Geography ==
The Turkish part of the valley is known as Upper Machakheli and is included in the [[Borçka]] district of [[Artvin Province]]. It has six villages, which have both official Turkish and unofficial Georgian names. These are [[Camili, Borçka|Camili]] (Khertvisi), Düzenli (Zedvake), Efeler (Eprati), Kayalar (Kvabistavi), Maralköy (Mindieti), and Uğurköy (Akria). The centre of all Machakheli, Khertvisi (ხერთვისი), was renamed as "Camili" in 1925 and the vicinity has also become known as Camili. The area is renowned throughout Turkey for its intensive practices of [[beekeeping]] and the high quality of [[honey]] it produces. In 2005, Camili became Turkey's only [[UNESCO]]-recognized [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|biosphere reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biospehere Reserves: Camili|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/europe-north-america/turkey/camili/|work=Ecological Sciences for Sustainable Development|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgian segment, known as Lower Machakheli, is part of the [[Khelvachauri Municipality]] of [[Adjara]] [[autonomous republic]] of Georgia and has twelve villages, including Zeda Chkhutuneti, Kveda Chkhukuneti, Chikuneti, Tskhemlara, Skurdidi, Acharisagmarti, Kedkedi, Sindieti, Chanivri, Gor-Gadzeti, and Saputkreti. The territory is known for its endemic [[trout]]. The area contains the Machakhela Gun Monument, Gvara fortress, Mirveti waterfall, the 12th century Mirveti stone bridge, a World War II-era artillery piece and the Machakheli Ethnographic Museum. In July 2012, Georgia established the [[Machakheli National Park]] and signed a United States-sponsored Trans-boundary Cooperation Action Plan with Turkey to address environmental issues in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgia.usaid.gov/news/press-releases/2012/07/18/1123 U.S. Government Helps Government of Georgia and Government of Turkey Cooperate on New National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232909/http://georgia.usaid.gov/news/press-releases/2012/07/18/1123 |date=2012-10-11 }}.

The '''Old Man of the Mountain''', also known as the '''Great Stone Face''' or '''the Profile''',&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| year=2008| title=Franconia Notch| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]| location=[[Chicago]], Illinois| accessdate=2008-01-31| url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9035155}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a series of five [[granite]] cliff ledges on [[Cannon Mountain (New Hampshire)|Cannon Mountain]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]], United States, that appeared to be the jagged profile of a face when viewed from the north. The [[list of rock formations in the United States|rock formation]] was {{convert|1200|ft|m}} above [[Profile Lake]], and measured {{convert|40|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|25|ft|m}} wide. The site is located in the town of [[Franconia, New Hampshire|Franconia]].

The first recorded mention of the Old Man was in 1805. It collapsed on May 3, 2003.&lt;ref name=collapse&gt;[http://www.nhstateparks.org/explore/state-parks/old-man-mountain.aspx New Hampshire Division of Parks and Recreation: Old Man of the Mountain Historic Site] Accessed: 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Old Man of the Mountian.GIF|thumb| 195px|right| The Old Man of the Mountain in the early 1900s]]
[[File:StampOldManMountain.jpg|thumb|right| U. S. stamp issued in 1955. Plural version of the name is unusual.]]

Franconia Notch is a [[U-shaped valley]] that was shaped by [[glacier]]s. The Old Man formation was probably formed from freezing and thawing of water in cracks of the granite bedrock sometime after the retreat of glaciers 12,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Linowes/&gt; The formation was first noted in the records of a Franconia surveying team around 1805. Francis Whitcomb and Luke Brooks, part of the surveying team, were the first two to record observing the Old Man.&lt;ref name=Linowes&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.oldmanofthemountainlegacyfund.org/about/geology.aspx|title=Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund: Geology of the Old Man of the Mountain| last=Linowes| first=Jonathan| website=www.oldmanofthemountainlegacyfund.org| access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official state history says several groups of surveyors were working in the [[Franconia Notch]] area at the time and claimed credit for the discovery.

The Old Man first became famous largely because of statesman [[Daniel Webster]], a [[New Hampshire native]], who once wrote: "Men hang out their signs indicative of their respective trades; shoemakers hang out a gigantic shoe; jewelers a monster watch, and the dentist hangs out a gold tooth; but up in the Mountains of New Hampshire, God Almighty has hung out a sign to show that there He makes men."

The writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] used the Old Man as inspiration for his [[short story]] "[[The Great Stone Face (Hawthorne)|The Great Stone Face]]", published in 1850, in which he described the formation as "a work of Nature in her mood of majestic playfulness".

The profile has been New Hampshire's [[Emblem of New Hampshire|state emblem]] since 1945.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/emblem.html|title=NH.gov – New Hampshire Almanac – State Emblem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was put on the state's [[license plate]], [[New Hampshire Highway System#State highways|state route signs]], and on the back of New Hampshire's [[State Quarters|Statehood Quarter]], which is popularly promoted as the only US coin with a profile on both sides. Before the collapse, it could be seen from special viewing areas along [[Interstate 93]] in [[Franconia Notch State Park]], approximately {{convert|80|mi|km}} north of the state's capital, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].

== Collapse ==
[[File:Old Man of the Mountain 4-26-03.jpg|195px|right|thumb|Old Man of the Mountain on April 26, 2003, seven days before the collapse.]]
Freezing and thawing opened fissures in the Old Man's "forehead". By the 1920s, the crack was wide enough to be mended with chains, and in 1957 the state legislature passed a $25,000 appropriation for a more elaborate weatherproofing, using 20 tons of fast-drying cement, plastic covering, and steel rods and [[turnbuckle]]s, plus a concrete gutter to divert runoff from above. A team from the state highway and park divisions maintained the patchwork each summer.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ford, ''The Country Northward'' (1976), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the formation collapsed to the ground between midnight and 2 a.m., May 3, 2003.&lt;ref name=collapse /&gt; Dismay over the collapse was so great that people left flowers at the base of the cliffs in tribute.

== After collapse ==
[[File:OMOTM-14july2010.JPG|250px|thumb|195px|right|The site of the Old Man of the Mountain in July 2010, 7 years after the collapse]]
Early after the collapse, many New Hampshire citizens considered replacement with a replica. That idea was rejected by an official task force in 2003 headed by former Governor [[Steve Merrill]].&lt;ref name="Governor Steve Merrill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfda.org/issues/old-man-mountain-memorial |title=Old Man of the Mountain Memorial |first1=Steve |last1=Merrill |publisher=Live Free or Die Alliance| accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the state legislature considered, but did not accept, a proposal to change New Hampshire's [[Flag of New Hampshire|state flag]] to include the profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seacoastnh.com/arts/please022704.html |title=Save the Seal, Keep the Ship |author=J. Dennis Robinson |publisher=SeacoastNH.com |date=Feb 27, 2004 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first anniversary of the collapse in May 2004, the Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund (OMMLF) began operating [[coin-op]]erated [[viewfinder]]s near the base of the cliff. When looking through them up at the cliff of Cannon Mountain one can see a "before" and "after" of how the Old Man of the Mountain used to appear.&lt;ref name=collapse /&gt;

Seven years after the collapse, on June 24, 2010, the OMMLF, now the Friends of the Old Man of the Mountain, broke ground for the first phase of the state-sanctioned "Old Man of the Mountain Memorial" on a walkway along [[Profile Lake]] below Cannon Cliff. It consists of a viewing platform with "Steel Profilers", which, when aligned with the Cannon Cliff above, create what the profile looked like up on the cliff overlooking the Franconia Notch. The project was overseen by Friends of the Old Man of the Mountain/Franconia Notch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?articleId=ca7548ca-95dc-4980-841d-87bef98de684&amp;headline=Old+Man%27s+profile+makes+return |title=Old Man's profile makes return |author=Lorna Colquhoun |publisher=''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a committee that succeeded the Old Man of the Mountain Revitalization Task Force. The Legacy Fund is a private [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] corporation with representatives from various state agencies and several private nonprofits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmanofthemountainlegacyfund.org/ |title=Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund |publisher=Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the board called a halt to further fundraising. They announced their intention to spend what was left on minor improvements and dissolve the board.&lt;ref name="Governor Steve Merrill" /&gt;

Other proposals that were considered but rejected include:
* Architect Francis Treves envisioned a walk-in profile made of 250 panels of structural glass attached to tubular steel framework and concrete tower, connected by a tram, rim trail or tunnel through to the cliff wall at the original site. It won an [[American Institute of Architects]] Un-Built Project Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=UL&amp;p_theme=ul&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=headline(replica)%20AND%20date(4/24/2009%20to%204/24/2009)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=4/24/2009%20to%204/24/2009)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=title&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(replica)Êl_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:DÊl_useweights=no |title=Designer: Replace Old Man with walk-in glass replica |author=Garry Rayno |publisher=New Hampshire Union-Leader |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhomm.com/ |title=Redefinition of the Old Man of the Mountain |publisher=Francis Treves, AIA |date= April 26, 2010 |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, Kenneth Gidge, a state representative from Nashua, proposed building a copper replica of the Old Man on level ground above the ledge at the original site where hiking trails already lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://edgeascension.com/wordpress/?p=62| title=New Hampshire Proposal to Rebuild the Old Man of the Mountain: HB 192| author=Edge Mugga| publisher=Edge-On Blog| date=January 7, 2009| accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1965 — Niels Nielsen, a state highway worker, becomes unofficial guardian of the profile, in an effort to protect the formation from vandalism and the ravages of the weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmanofthemountainlegacyfund.org/about/historical-timeline.aspx|title=Old Man Timeline |publisher=Old Man of the Mountain Legacy Fund|accessdate=April 20, 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;
* 1986 — [[Vandalism|Vandalizing]] the Old Man is classified as a crime under the state [[criminal mischief]] law. Under the law (RSA 634:2 VI) it is a [[misdemeanor]] for any person to vandalize, [[Defacement (vandalism)|deface]] or destroy any part of the Old Man, with a penalty of a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of between $1,000 and $3,000 and [[restitution]] to the state for any damage caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxii/634/634-2.htm |title=Title LXII, Criminal Code, Chapter 634, Destruction of Property, Section 634:2 |publisher=[[New Hampshire General Court]] |accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1991">In [[cartography]], a '''phase line''' is a line to show {{cfact|some positional dependency or relation to the passage of time,|date=July 2017}} most often changing phases of a military operation, {{cfact|or changing borders in histogeographic maps.|date=July 2017}}

==Military usage==
[[Image:TulagiBattle1942.gif|thumb|300px|A photo with overdrawn phase line illustrating a [[World War II]] military operation.]]
The term is also used in [[military terminology]] to refer to an imaginary line on a map used to coordinate phases of operations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.nato.int/docu/stanag/aap006/aap6.htm

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
They are usually distinguished with different code names, varying by the particulars of the mission such as location and nature. By the same token, phase lines are frequently used after a battle or a [[military campaign]] by [[historian]]s to describe what territory was controlled by which side at a given phase of the campaign.

==Historical geography==
{{or-section|date=July 2017}}
[[Image:Soviet-finnish_negotiations_1939_borderline.png|thumb|300px|A map of negotiated border lines at different stages of the Finnish [[Winter War]].]]
Historical geographers use such techniques in a similar way, but written upon a longer time period. Dated phase lines on a map would indicate the growth or shrinkage of a [[great power]] of the era such as the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]], the spread of [[Islam]] or [[Christianity]]. Other familiar phase line mapping most experience in late elementary or middle school classes would be the extent of various ice ages or the [[Ice Age]] consequential shrinkage or extension of continental landmasses down the continental shelves as the results of such climate changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36248">[[Serbia]]n [[postal code]]s consist of five digits. The first two digits roughly correspond to the corresponding [[Districts of Serbia|district]]; district seat cities usually have 000 as the last three digits, while smaller towns and villages have non-round last three digits.

According to http://www.posta.rs/AdresniKod/Adresovanje_eng.asp, since 1 January 2005 a six-digit postcode format has been introduced.

The '''Principal Triangulation of Britain''' was the first high-precision [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] [[surveying|survey]] of the whole of Great Britain (including Ireland), carried out between 1791 and 1853 under the auspices of the [[Board of Ordnance]]. The aim of the survey was to establish precise geographical coordinates of almost 300 significant landmarks which could be used as the fixed points of local topographic surveys from which maps could be drawn. In addition there was a purely scientific aim in providing precise data for geodetic calculations such as the determination of the length of [[meridian arc]]s and the [[figure of the Earth]]. Such a  survey had  been proposed by [[William Roy]] (1726–1790) on his completion of the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)|Anglo-French Survey]] but it was only after his death that the  [[Board of Ordnance]] initiated the trigonometric survey, motivated by military considerations in a time of a threatened French invasion. Most of the work was carried out under the direction of [[s:Dalby, Isaac (DNB00)|Isaac Dalby]],  [[William Mudge]] and [[Thomas Frederick Colby]], but the final synthesis and report (1858) was the work of [[Alexander Ross Clarke]]. The survey stood the test of time for a century, until the [[Retriangulation of Great Britain]] between 1935 and 1962.

==History==
In the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] it was recognised that there was a need for an accurate map of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and the necessary survey was initiated in 1747 by Lieutenant-Colonel David Watson, a Deputy Quartermaster-General of the [[Board of Ordnance]]. Watson employed William Roy as a civilian assistant to carry out the bulk of the work. Subsequently, Roy, having enlisted in the army and having become a very competent surveyor, proposed (1763) a national survey which would be a plan for defence at a time when French invasions were threatened.  The proposal was rejected on grounds of expense.&lt;ref&gt;The early history of the Ordnance Survey is covered in {{harvtxt|Owen|Pilbeam|1992}} pp 3–14(true), 12–24(pdf), and {{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}} pp. 1–20 (true), 15–35(pdf).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy continued to lobby for a survey and his ambitions were realised to a certain extent by an unexpected development. In 1783 the [[French Academy of Sciences]] claimed that the latitude and longitude differences between the  [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] and the [[Paris Observatory]] were incorrect, and it was proposed (to the  [[Royal Society]]) that the differences could be reconciled by high precision triangulation over the intervening terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knowles|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Society agreed and, jointly with the Board of Ordnance, they invited Roy to oversee the project. (Main article; [[Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790)]].)

Roy's first task (1784) was to measure a base line  between [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] Poor House and King's Arbour on [[Hounslow Heath]], a distance of just over 5 miles (8&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;A full account of the measurement of the Hounslow Heath baseline is given in {{harvtxt|Roy|1785}}. The appendix includes detailed maps and figures.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a painstaking process: three rods of about 20&amp;nbsp;ft. were supported on trestles and the ends aligned to an accuracy of a thousandth part of an inch. The first rod was then carried to the end of the third, an operation to be repeated 1370 times. The final measurement gave the length of the base as 27404.01&amp;nbsp;ft. (8352 metres).

[[File:RamsdenRS theodolite of 1787.jpg|thumb|upright|The first Ramsden theodolite as used by Roy. (Destroyed by war damage in 1941.)]] For the subsequent triangulation&lt;ref&gt;The strategy of the triangulation is outlined in {{harvtxt|Roy|1787}}. The appendix includes detailed maps and figures.&lt;/ref&gt; Roy ordered a new [[theodolite]] from leading instrument-maker [[Jesse Ramsden]]. This [[Ramsden theodolite]], delivered in 1787, for the first time divided angular scales accurately to within a [[arcsecond|second of arc]].&lt;ref&gt;A full description of the first Ramsden theodolite is given in {{harvtxt|Roy|1790}}. The appendix includes detailed figures.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theodolite constructed for Roy by Ramsden is called the Royal Society theodolite. See  {{harvnb|Insley|2008}} ''The Great Theodolites''&lt;/ref&gt; The theodolite was the largest ever constructed but, despite its massive size, it was carried from London to the Channel coast and employed on hills, steeples and a moveable tower. At each location the angles to other vertices of the triangulation mesh were measured many times, often at night time using newly devised lights. Finally the angle data was used to calculate the sides of the triangles by using [[spherical trigonometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Roy's final report, which was put through the press by Isaac Dalby, is {{harvtxt|Roy|1790}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3foottheodoliteramsden.jpg|thumb|upright|The second Ramsden theodolite as  purchased by the Board Ordnance. Now in the [[Science Museum, London]]]] The final results were inconclusive, for triangulation was inferior to the precision of astronomical measurements, but the survey paved the way for all future work in terms of high precision measurements of length and angle, together with the techniques of calculating on an ellipsoidal surface. In his final report, published posthumously, Roy once again pressed for the extension of the survey to the rest of Britain. His successors would oblige. As Master of the Board of Ordnance (from 1782), Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, viewed Roy's work with great interest, At the same time he was acutely aware that Britain, lacking a national survey, was falling behind the standards of many other European countries. Moreover, the renewed threat of French invasion made him alarmed at  the lack of accurate maps, particularly of the southern counties. The catalyst for action was the sudden availability of a new improved Ramsden theodolite&lt;ref&gt;The Ramsden theodolite purchase by Richmond is referred to as The Board of Ordnance theodolite. See  {{harvnb|Insley|2008}} ''The Great Theodolites''&lt;/ref&gt; which had been intended for the [[East India Company]]. The purchase of this instrument on 21 June 1791 by the Board is taken as the inauguration of the [[Ordnance Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;An official [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/2016/06/celebrating-225-years-with-a-map/ OS blog] celebrating 225 years of British mapping.&lt;/ref&gt; The very next day Richmond appointed [[s:Dalby, Isaac (DNB00)|Isaac Dalby]] as its first employee, with a brief to extend Roy's survey.&lt;ref&gt;Dalby was a civilian mathematician who had assisted Roy from 1787. See  {{harvtxt|Owen|Pilbeam|1992}} p11(true), 21(pdf), and {{harvtxt|Seymour|1980}} p22(true),36(pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; In the following month Richmond appointed [[William Mudge]] and Edward Williams, the latter as the first superintendent of the survey.

&lt;!--The baseline derived during that work, together with the new theodolite, served as the basis for the planning and execution of the subsequent work on the Principal Triangulation. Around 1791, shortly after his death, Roy's team began the field work, using the specially built Ramsden theodolite. In 1794 a seven-mile-long baseline of verification was measured on [[Salisbury Plain]].

Eventually the triangulation extended to cover the whole of the British Isles, after it was decided in 1824 that a 6-inch-to-the-mile (1:10,560) [[map]] of [[Ireland]] was necessary for accurate land taxing.
--&gt;

==Re-measurement of the Hounslow baseline==
[[File:General Roys Baseline.jpg|right|thumb|General Roy's baseline: map as about 1935]]
For the 1784 measurement of the original base-line across Hounslow Heath, Roy had ordered three deal rods cut from a new mast in the Admiralty dock yards. These were intended to be used for the precision measurement but Roy also ordered  a 100&amp;nbsp;ft steel chain from Ramsden which could be used for a quick preliminary measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Roy|1785}} Section&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/ref&gt; The deal rods proved ineffective because of their changes with humidity and they were replaced with glass rods for the final measurement; however Roy observed that the chain itself was just as accurate as the rods. For this reason the 1791 survey started by remeasuring the base with two new 100&amp;nbsp;ft chains, the second to be kept unused as a reference against which any stretching of the first would be detected.

The process of measurement was exceedingly precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mudge|1794}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since the ground was undulating and falling about 370&amp;nbsp;ft. along the length of the base, the measurement was carried out over 26 stages with varying slopes, the chains for any one stage being constrained to a perfectly straight line by many intermediate supports. These hypotenuse measurements were then projected to the horizontal. Furthermore, the temperature varied from day to day and each measurement was corrected to the length that a chain would take at 62&amp;nbsp;°F. Finally, the length of the base was reduced to its projection at sea level using the height of the south base above the Thames and the fall in the Thames down to its estuary. The final result was approximately 3&amp;nbsp;inches less than that of Roy and the mean value of 27404.2&amp;nbsp;ft. was taken of the baseline. The difference of the two values meant that the accuracy of the measurement could be claimed to be 1&amp;nbsp;inch in 27,404&amp;nbsp;ft, which is 3 parts per million.

==Corrections==
During subsequent triangulation, errors due to atmospheric refraction, deflection of plumb-bobs, temperature, and the spherical nature of the earth (meaning there were [[Spherical geometry|more than 180 degrees in a triangle]]) were all allowed for.

One of the wide variety of soil-absorption/filter systems, a '''rain garden''', also called a '''stormwater garden''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Application 5th Edition|last=William|first=Marsh|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a designed depression storage or a planted hole that allows [[rainwater]] [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from [[Impervious surface|impervious]] [[urban area]]s, like roofs, driveways, walkways, parking lots, and compacted lawn areas, the opportunity to be absorbed. The primary purpose of a rain garden is to improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and to ensure that rainwater becomes available for plants as [[groundwater]] rather than being sent through [[stormwater]] drains straight out to sea. In fact, it can actually reduce rain runoff by allowing stormwater to soak into the ground (as opposed to flowing into [[storm drain]]s and [[surface water]]s which causes [[erosion]], [[water pollution]], [[flooding]], and diminished groundwater)&lt;ref name=uri&gt;

The plants—a selection of [[wetland]] edge vegetation, such as [[wildflower]]s, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], [[fern]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s—take up excess water flowing into the rain garden. Water filters through soil layers before entering the groundwater system. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]], maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in [[Biofilter|biofiltration]].&lt;ref name=wolverton&gt;B.C.

A more wide-ranging definition covers all the possible elements that can be used to capture, channel, divert, and make the most of the natural rain and snow that falls on a property. Thus, the whole garden can become a rain garden, and each component of the whole can become a small-scale rain garden in itself.

==Restoring the water cycle and mitigating urbanization==
{{see|Urbanization}}
In developed areas, natural [[Depression (geology)|depressions]] where [[storm water]] would pool are filled in. The surface of the ground is often [[Regrading|leveled]] or paved. Storm water is directed into [[storm drain]]s which often may cause overflows of [[combined sewer]] systems or poisoning, erosion or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff.&lt;ref name=Kuichling&gt;Kuichling, E. 1889. "The relation between the rainfall and the discharge of sewers in populous districts." ''Trans. Am. Soc. Civ. Eng.'' 20, 1–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Leopold &gt;Leopold, L. B. 1968.

Storm water runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events. These pollutants include [[volatile organic compounds]], [[pesticides]], [[herbicides]], [[hydrocarbons]] and [[trace metals]]&lt;ref name= Novotny&gt;Novotny, V. and Olem, H. 1994. "Water Quality: Prevention, Identification, and Management of Diffuse Pollution." Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of storm water and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration. They also reduce energy consumption. For example, "the cumulative storage capacity of these rain gardens exceeds a conventional stormwater's system's by 10 times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassberg |first=Valerie |author2=Brad Lancaster |title=Fighting water with water: Behavioral change versus climate change |journal=American Water Works Association |date=June 2011 |volume=103 |issue=6 |pages=59 |url=http://www.harvestingrainwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/Strassberg-Lancaster-AWWA-June-2011.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or [[chemical reduction]] of the pollutants to benign compounds.

[[File:SUNY-ESF-rain-garden-2014-b.jpg|thumb|left|Rain garden, [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry]], Syracuse, New York]]
Rain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without [[rainwater tank]]s). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of drainage with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A [[French drain]] may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural [[water cycle]] displaced by [[urban development]] and allow for [[groundwater]] recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may also increase [[Water pollution|pollution]] unless [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] materials are included in the design of the filtration layers.&lt;ref name= Dietz&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11270-005-8266-8 | last1 =  Dietz | first1 = Michael E. | first2 = John C. | last2 = Clausen | year = 2005 | title = A Field Evaluation of Raingarden Flow and Pollutant Treatment | journal = Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution | volume = 167 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 123–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary challenge of rain garden design centers on calculating the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can handle during storm-water events. This challenge is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust [[native plants]] and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce [[redox]] of incoming pollutant streams.

Rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons: improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized [[flood control]], are aesthetically pleasing, and provide interesting planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and [[biodiversity]], tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in attractive and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant partial solutions to important environmental problems that affect us all.

A rain garden provides a way to use and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for [[irrigation]]. They allow a household or building to deal with excessive rainwater runoff without burdening the public storm water systems. Rain gardens differ from retention basins, in that the water will infiltrate the ground within a day or two. This creates the advantage that the rain garden does not allow [[mosquito]]es to breed. Compost, rather than soil, has better effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well, because the water simply flows off.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==History==
The first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that occurred before development of an area. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] had the idea to replace the traditional [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMP) pond with a [[bioretention]] area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea.&lt;ref name=urbrun&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Urban Runoff |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |magazine=Nonpoint Source News-Notes |issue=42 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |date=August 1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707213649/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/archives/upload/42issue.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a {{convert|300|–|400|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} rain garden on each house's property.&lt;ref name="marcom"&gt;''Wisconsin Natural Resources'' (magazine). [http://dnr.wi.gov/wnrmag/html/supps/2003/feb03/run.htm#one “Rain Gardens Made One Maryland Community Famous.”] February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of [[Curb (road)|curbs]], [[sidewalk]]s, and [[Street gutter|gutters]], which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events.&lt;ref name=urbrun/&gt; Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75–80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event.&lt;ref name=marcom/&gt;

This is also referred to as [[Water Sensitive Urban Design]] (WSUD) in Australia, [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems or SUDS]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] (LID) in the United States, and is cited by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/rain-gardens |title=Rain Gardens |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-28 |website=Soak Up the Rain |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ''de facto'' rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and retain rain water within the garden so as to drain adjacent land without running off a property is at conception a rain garden—particularly if vegetation is maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]], now promoted as “[[bioswale]]s”, remain the conventional drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world.

What is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make [[sustainable development]] possible. This is as true for wealthy developed communities retrofitting [[bioretention]] into built stormwater management systems, as for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path.

==Characteristics==
[[File:2006NeighborsNewRG2.JPG|thumb|A home rain garden recently planted]]
A rain garden requires an area where water can collect and [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]], and plants to maintain infiltration rates, diverse microbe communities, and water holding capacity. This way the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[Bird|birds]], and beneficial [[Insect|insects]]. [[Transpiration]] by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. This includes any plant extending roots to the garden area.

Simply adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing gardens may be all that is needed because the soil has been well loosened and plants are well established. However, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and often more water runs off one's roof than people realize. Thus, rain garden plants are then selected to match the situation after the required location and storage capacity of the garden area are determined.

===Soil and drainage===
When an area's soils are not [[Permeability (fluid)|permeable]] enough to allow water to drain and filter properly, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. This bioretention mixture should typically contain 60% [[sand]], 20% [[compost]], and 20% [[topsoil]], and there is a current trend to replace compost with [[biochar]]. The former non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced. The sandy soil (bioretention) mixture cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that does not have high sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance, according to a 1983 study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212091532/http://www.hriresearch.org/Docs/Publications/JEH/JEH_1983/JEH_1983_1_3/JEH%201-3-77-80.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. But, it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable City Network, Dubuque, IA (2011-02-21).[http://www.sustainablecitynetwork.com/topic_channels/water/article_b65fe518-3de0-11e0-82aa-00127992bc8b.html "USGS: Rain Gardens Work Regardless of Soil Conditions."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a [[drywell]] with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely turning the garden into an [[infiltration basin]] defeating its purpose. [[Depression-focused recharge]] of polluted water into wells poses a serious threat and should be avoided. Similarly plans to install a rain garden near a septic system should be reviewed by a qualified engineer. The more polluted the water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. This is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high [[water table]]. In some cases lined [[bioretention]] cells with [[subsurface drainage]] are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly.

Rain gardens are at times confused with [[bioswale]]s. [[Swale (geographical feature)|Swales]] slope to a destination, while rain gardens do not; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a [[water garden]], [[wetland]], or pond, and not a rain garden. Using the proper terminology ensures that the proper methods are used to achieve the desired results.

===Plants===
Although specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates,&lt;ref name="dussa"&gt;Dussaillant et al. [http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?140904] Journal of Hydrologic Engineering&lt;/ref&gt; plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to have minimal maintenance to survive, and be compatible with adjacent land use.

Native and adapted plants are the examples of such plants that are generally used. They are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; habitat value and diversity for local ecological communities; and overall sustainability once established. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment.

Trees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute most when located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of habitat. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time because heat drives out [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation.

Bamboo is another plant that works particularly well since it can clean water 27.6% better than domestic plants like grass or clovers. Rice, although it is hard to grow and maintain, works even better.

[http://www.ewashtenaw.org/raingardens “Rain Garden Virtual Tour”]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washtenaw County Water Resource Commissioner's office also offers yearly in person and online Master Rain Gardener classes to help guide those interested in the rain garden design, building, and upkeep process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/drain_commissioner/dc_webWaterQuality/rain-gardens/volunteer-information-1/volunteer-information|title=Master Rain Gardener Volunteer Program —|website=www.ewashtenaw.org|access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The city of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], has established a Clean River Rewards program, to encourage residents to disconnect downspouts from the city's [[combined sewer]] system and create rain gardens. Workshops, discounts on storm water bills, and web resources are offered.&lt;ref&gt;Clean River Rewards, Portland, Oregon. [http://www.portlandonline.com/BES/index.cfm?c=41976 “Clean River Rewards.”]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Delaware]], several rain gardens have been created through the work of the University of Delaware Water Resources Agency, and environmental organizations, such as the Appoquinimink River Association.&lt;ref&gt;University of Delaware Cooperative Extension.

* In New Jersey, the Rutgers Cooperative Extension Water Resources Program has already installed over 125 demonstration rain gardens in suburban and urban areas.  The Water Resources Program has begun to focus on using rain gardens as [[green infrastructure]] in urban areas, such as Camden and Newark to help prevent localized flooding, combined sewer overflows, and to improve water quality.  The Water Resources Program has also revised and produced a rain garden manual in collaboration with The Native Plant Society of New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.rutgers.edu/Rain_Gardens/RGWebsite/demoraingardens.html|title=Water Resources Program  at Rutgers NJAES|website=water.rutgers.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dr. Allen P. Davis is an environment and civil engineering professor at in University of Maryland, College Park. For the past 20 years, Davis and his team have been studying the effectiveness of rain gardens. For their research, they constructed two rain gardens on campus near the Anacostia River watershed in the Fall of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/rwqcb2/water_issues/programs/stormwater/muni/mrp/Rain%20Garden%20Quality%2004-11.pdf|title=WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT USING RAIN GARDENS: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STUDIES|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the runoff from the University of Maryland campus, a member of the Anacostia Watershed Restoration Partnership, ends up in the Anacostia River feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. This research finds rain gardens to be a very effective method of water capture and filtration, encouraging others in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to implement rain gardens. 
** Davis' research showed that rain gardens aid in the capturing and bio-degradation of pollutants such as suspended solids, bacteria, metals, oil, and grease. 
** Water quality analyzed at the University of Maryland showed a significant increase in water clarity after rain garden filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.anacostia.net/AWSC/documents/raingarden_pylon_2.pdf|title=Rain Garden Pylon|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
** There is a rain garden at the Center for Young Children (CYC) at University of Maryland designed by students from the Department of Plant Science and Landscape Agriculture. The rain garden allows teachers at the CYC to educate future students on sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainability.umd.edu/sustainability-fund/grant-recipients/center-young-children-rain-garden|title=Center for Young Children Rain Garden {{!}} University of Maryland Office of Sustainability|website=sustainability.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Urquhart Goode''' (December 8, 1858 – June 9, 1903) was an [[United States|American]] [[geographer]]. He was born in [[Bedford, Virginia]]. He attended the [[University of Virginia]] before joining the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in 1877. In 1879, he became a [[topographer]] with the newly created [[United States Geological Survey]] where he worked until 1879. From 1882-1882, Goode was attached to the Northern [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad Survey]] as an engineer and topographer. In 1884 he rejoined the USGS. In 1888, while on a leave of absence from the USGS, Goode served as an engineer and astronomer for the Panama Canal Company. In 1889, he rejoined the [[United States Geological Survey|Survey]] as a geographer and was placed in charge of surveys of the Pacific Coast states - [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He served in that role until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Goode's Funeral.: Service This Morning at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church.|work=Washington Post|issue=p. 7|date=June 11, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goode married Sophie J. Parks of Norfolk, Virginia in 1889. They had three children. He was a member of the [[Washington Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Geographic Society]], and the [[Cosmos Club]]. From 1901 to 1903, he was the chairman of the Committee on Technical Meetings at the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Urquhard Goode|journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=January 1, 1903|volume=14|issue=November 1903|page=424-425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Born in Aldershot, Hampshire into a military family, Whatmore moved often - including Germany, Cyprus, and Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/classic/midday/201404/miv-2014-04-10.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; She studied geography at [[University College London]] (BA 1981), has an MPhil (Town Planning) in 1983 (''Financial institutions and the ownership of agricultural land'') and worked at the [[Greater London Council]]. She returned to UCL for a PhD supervised by Richard Munton (''The 'other half' of the family farm: an analysis of the position of 'farm wives' in the familial gender division of labor on the farm'', 1988) and lectured at Leeds University, [[Bristol University]] (1989-2001) and the [[Open University]] (2001-2004).&lt;ref name="oxford homepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/swhatmore.html|title=Professor Sarah Whatmore - Staff - School of Geography and the Environment - University of Oxford|first=Chris|last=White|website=www.geog.ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She lives in [[Upton, Vale of White Horse|Upton, Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;

==Scholarship==
Whatmore began studying rural geography, gender and alternative food networks, moving into [[critical geography|critical geographer]] of environmental issues at the end of the 1990s. She has questioned [[dialectical materialism|Marxist materialist]] approaches in favour of [[actor-network theory]] and feminist science studies. Her approach, laid out in her 2002 book ''Hybrid Geographies'',&lt;ref name="hybrid geog"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whatmore | first = Sarah | title = Hybrid geographies: natures, cultures, spaces | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780761965671 }}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to develop what she terms "more than human" modes of inquiry, and question the relationship between science and democracy. ''Hybrid Geographies'' has been cited over 1,800 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?cites=6034690867247846433&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en|title=Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on the treatment of evidence and role of expertise in environmental governance, against growing reliance on computer modelling techniques. It is characterized by a commitment to experimental and collaborative research practices that bring the different knowledge competences of social and natural scientists into play with those of diverse local publics living with environmental risks and hazards like floods and droughts. Her ideas were developed further in ''Political Matter'' (Whatmore &amp; Braun eds. 2010).

Her critical ideas have been well received by theorists, but less so by policy-oriented environmental thinkers and traditional geographers less inclined to "theorise" human-environment relationships. Nonetheless, she has been a member of the Science Advisory Council to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and chair of its Social Science Expert Group; a member of the Science Advisory Group established to advise the Cabinet Office’s National Flood Resilience Review (2016), and as a member of the board of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology.

===Huanchaco Totorales===
The ancient "[[Moche (culture)|mochica]]s" developed  formidable cultivation [[Scientific technique|technique]]s in the arid coastline of northern [[Peru]]. One is planting "wachaques" (dug wells) to find the water near to the sea. The brackish waters were able to adapt the "[[totora (plant)|totora]]" (Scirpus californicus). The reeds allowed the mochicas to be considered lords of the [[Pacific Ocean]] since ancient times. The huanchaco fishermen were shown as eminent navigators, making long trips overseas in their reed boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= |url = http://caballitodetotora.tripod.com/totorales/pantanos.pdf |title=(spanish) Swamps of Huanchaco|editor =  |accessdate =21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number length==

All telephone numbers are 11 numbers long (initial 0 plus ten numbers). The first two, three or four digits after the zero are the area code.&lt;BR&gt;The possibilities are: '''(0xx) xxxx xxxx''' (for landlines), '''09199323211''' (for mobiles) and '''099xx xxx xxx''' (for MVNO).

When making a call within the same landline area code, initial 0 plus the area code can be omitted.

==Example for calling==
The [[List of international call prefixes|international call prefix]] depends on the country you are calling from; e.g., 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America. For domestic calls (within the country), 0 must be dialed before the area code. The prefix for international calls from Iran is 00 (e.g., for a [[United States]] number 00 1 ... should be dialled).

An example for calling telephones in [[Tehran]] is as follows:

*xxxx xxxx (within Tehran)
*'''021''' xxxx xxxx (within Iran)
*'''+98 21''' xxxx xxxx (outside Iran)

An example for mobile numbers is as follows:

*'''09xx''' xxx xxxx (within same providers, other providers or landlines in Iran)
*'''+98 9xx''' xxx xxxx (outside Iran)

==Landlines==
Originally, there was only one provider of landline telephony, [[Telecommunication Company of Iran]].

===Area Code===
Landlines telephone numbers have these formats : (0'''ac''') xxxx xxxx (within Iran) and +98 '''ac''' xxxx xxxx (outside Iran). '''ac''' (area code) shown in below list :

The '''Triad''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadcentral.org Triad Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to decision-making for [[Hazardous waste|hazardous-waste]] [[waste dump|site]] cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience.

Their goal was to form a framework for real-time [[environmental sensor]]s and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html 2001] that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a [[Community of practice|Community of Practice]] by 2005.

The Triad Community of Practice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/user/cop/&lt;/ref&gt; includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysense.com/index.asp?pageID=133 European CoP Info]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html 2008 Triad Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314225529/http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these [[best practices|best management practices]] together with the guiding principles:

# Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
# Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
# Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
# Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html uncertainty management strategies].  
# Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.

Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/multiagency/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/Triad_Policy_Memo.pdf EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the Triad==
Although the following elements are the legs that gave the impetus for calling the process "Triad," the goal of the Triad approach is to infuse the concepts into hazardous-waste site cleanups, no matter what the lead organization calls the process. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Project Planning Process (TPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715135918/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for systematic planning, for example.)

===Systematic Project Planning===
Project planning identifies the problems and encourages stakeholders to negotiate the steps necessary to mediate the risks the environmental contamination pose to human health and ecology. The specific goals of a project (redevelopment, revitalization, etc.) may differ, but the specific objectives during the SPP process are:

*Frame the problem: identify project objectives, constraints, stakeholders, the regulatory framework, and primary/secondary decisions.
*Develop a site model: construct and maintain a site model that captures information pertinent to the primary/secondary decisions that must be made. The term CSM is updated by identifying data gaps, and developing a dynamic work strategy to fill in the data gaps.
*Evaluate and manage uncertainty: evaluate and manage the uncertainty associated with decision-making in the context of the CSM so that decisions can be made with acceptable levels of confidence.

===Dynamic work strategies===
Dynamic work strategies are strategies that can be adapted to site conditions as new information becomes available while work is underway. This adaptation may be in response to data collection activities designed to address CSM unknowns, or it may be in response to completely unexpected site conditions encountered during the course of work.

Dynamic work strategies as part of a Triad approach can be included in almost every activity associated with hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. This includes overall project strategies, dynamic sampling and analysis programs (DSP,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Robbat, Jr., 1997, A Guideline for Dynamic Workplans and Field Analytics: The Keys to Cost-Effective Site Characterization and Cleanup [http://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/robbat/documents/DynamicWorkplans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP &lt;ref&gt;US-DOE, 2001. Adaptive Sampling and Analysis Programs (ASAPs). Report DOE/EM-0592 [https://frtr.gov/pdf/asap_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) for characterization purposes, remedial action design, implementation, and performance monitoring, long-term monitoring for sites that require it, closure plans, and quality assurance/quality control activities.

===Innovative rapid sampling===
Sometimes referred to as 'real-time' measurement systems, these are analytical or measurement technologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char1_tech.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; capable of producing data quickly enough to direct the progress of field activities (characterization or remediation) while they are underway [http://www.triadcentral.org/mgmt/meas/key/index.cfm], analogous to [[Real time business intelligence|Real-time business intelligence]]. Example analytical methods include portable or handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF [http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/xrf.cfm XRF]), portable gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, and [[immunoassay]] [[test kit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/immunoassay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; New field analytical methods are fast developing. However, some have used standard laboratory approaches with quick turn-around results. The analysis enables in-field decision-making ''and'' ensures logical internal consistency among Triad concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/tio/download/char/epa542f07001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual site models==
At the core of each project is the conceptual site model (CSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/CSM_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term CSM is sometimes used to only describe pieces of the whole model. Geological, hydrogeological, contaminant fate and transport all may have computer models referred to as 'conceptual,' and a risk assessment may contain a CSM, but in a Triad sense, a CSM is the holistic model that can effectively portray site concerns significant to the decisions that must be made.

'''Vakaippathi''', one among the [[Panchappathis]] is a holy site for the People of [[Ayyavazhi]]. 

Vakaippathi is the place situated 4&amp;nbsp;km northeast to [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] in the seashore near [[vattakkotai]]. This is the place where 700 families from [[Swamithoppe]] were sent to [[Thuvayal Thavasu]] by [[Ayya Vaikundar]]; they were later known as [[Thuvayal Pantarams]]. This pathi is not included in Pancha pathis.
